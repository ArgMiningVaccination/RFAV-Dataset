For example you, Eva Leemet at Estonia or you , Michal Hladky Kosice 2013, or you, Jone Zubiaga at Creativity Zentrum in Bilbao who showed great commi tment and interest in this method handbook. We are writing for people like you who create f ertile ground. 3A resilient society can face shocks and persistent structural changes in such a way that it does not lose its ability to deliver societal well-being in a sustainable way, according to the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission . In this sense, the European Economic and Social Committee , which I am a member of, sees a need to tackle shocks as well as disruptive eects stemming from fundamental technological changes and a need to stop transgressing environmental boundaries to ensure resilience. Article 3 of the Treaty on the European Union, however, gives us a vision that goes further, as it refers among other things to pro- moting a competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress. Today, in 2019, we need to focus on sustainable and inclusive growth, reducing social inequalities, upward convergence, competitiveness in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, an investment-friendly environment, quality jobs and pay, combating poverty and social exclusion, sustainable public nances, a stable nancial sector and achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals , as well as the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. More ambitious action in the context of reforming the European Union's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is needed, to achieve a more integrated, more democratic and socially better-developed Union. Although considerable progress towards completing EMU has been made, we have now ended up some- where around the halfway mark along the road. There is an urgent need to reinforce and at the same time balance the highly interconnected pillars, which are the basis for a well-functioning EMU: We need a stable monetary and nancial pillar as a basis for macroeconomic development. Decisive steps to complete the Banking and Capital Markets Unions can contribute to that. They must take into account the social and environmental impact of the rules in place, prioritise consumer protection and aim to avoid theburdening of public budgets in a crisis. Strengtheningthe international role of the euro and the consolidation of the European Central Bank's stabilising role should accompany these steps. A strong economic pillar as a basis for prosperity and social progress is also needed. It can be achieved by balancing supply and demand measures. This currentlyThe European Union (EU), while not yet fully recovered from the nancial and economic crisis, is facing another fundamental challenge: climate change and nal awareness of the planet's boundaries. Moreover, digitalisation is expected to cause a major economic transition. On top of this, the EU still seems underprepared tomanage possible economic shocks. At this stage, important decisions on shaping economic policy are being obstructed by dierences of opinion as to what direction they should take. It hinges on a conflict over risk sharing and risk reduction. Judith VorbachAustrian Member European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)FOREWORD4Finally, a political pillar as a basis for democracy, solidarity and unity should be reinforced. Enhancing the involvement of the European Parliament, social partners and other civil society organisations in key social and economic policy decisions, solidarity and the willingness to compromise - which are basis for EU's prosperity - are the necessary elements for that. entails boosting the demand side by securing purchasing power through well-paid jobs, which requires strength-ening social partners\u00b4 collective bargaining systems and autonomy. Other crucial aspects include provi- sions for sucient public investment and the creationof a scal capacity to buer shocks. The latter should be funded by a common debt instrument. Stemming harmful tax competition and the prevention of tax evasion and avoidance will make another important contribution to a strong economic pillar. I am also convinced that the social pillar must be expanded as a basis for societal progress. Minimum social standards, making greater use of the social scoreboard in the European Semester and implementing the European Labour Authority rapidly are all crucial for this purpose. \"Strengthening the interna/t.iional role of the euro and the consolida/t.iion of the European Central Bank's stabilising role should accompany these steps.\"INTRODUCTION The editor does not necessarily agree with or endorse any of the views or contents of the articles and features within this document.

Nine out of ten people now breathe polluted air that kills seven million people each year. The alarming damage to health from air pollution can be measured by the fact that the hearts of young people living in cities contain billions of toxic air pollution parti - cles - even in a child as young as three. This health burden is falling on our most vulnerable populations - children, as well as lower status socioeconomic groups and excluded communities. Air pollution is the cause of one-third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease. It has even surpassed physical inactivity, alcohol misuse, obesity and as a risk factor for noncommunica- ble diseases (NCDs) to become the second leading cause of death from NCDs. \"Investing in healthier cities in order to reduce air pollution and the incidence of NCDs can also trigger a multiplier effect leading to various co-benefits for both well-being, climate change and the environment.\" As much as 68% of the world's population will be urban by 2050 compared with 55% now, according to UNESCO . And it is urban areas that are clogged with rising levels of air pollution as cities get hotter and more crowded - and trac levels mount. This raises the questions ofwhat type of disruptive change could help cities tackle the serious problem of air pollution and subsequently the growing burden of NCDs and how urbanisation can progress in a more sustainable way. Even though air pollution is typically thought of as a by-product of megacities in Asia, levels in Europe arein fact higher than the global average. In 2016, over 550,000 people died prematurely across the continent because of dirty air. A recent study in the European Heart Journal even suggests numbers could be as high as 800 000 annually. The high level of urbanisation (74%) is the reason for Europe's bad air quality - and estimates say that by 2050 this could reach virtually 84%. To help nd solu- tions we must rst and foremost dierentiate between ambient and indoor air pollution. The former results predominantly from emissions from transport, energy and industrial activities, the latter from burning fuel for cooking, heating and lighting. As individuals we can help by, say, walking or cycling as our main mode of transport or by generating their households' energy needs by using solar power, but most sources of air pollution are well beyond an individual's control. They instead require a concerted multi-stakeholder approach at local, national and regional level across sectors such as transport, energy, industry, waste management and urban planning. European capital cities, such as Copenhagen, Paris,Oslo and Helsinki, have recently adopted various initia - tives to tackle air pollution, especially within transport. In Copenhagen large areas are closed to vehicles, the city has invested heavily in cycling lanes and even opened its rst sole bridge for cyclists in 2014 : it plans to be completely carbon neutral by 2025. Paris banned cars from major historic central districts on weekends and made public transport free during major events. Clean technologies Successful policies and investments for combatting air pollution include clean technologies to reduce industrial smokestack emissions, urban and agricultural wasteMonika Kosinska, Programme Manager, Governance for Health Division at the World Health Organization explains why the air we breathe is Europe's silent killer15management to capture methane gas emissions, increased use of solar, wind and hydropower for energy generation. Cities, in particular, can become more sustainable and health-promoting by prioritising rapid urban transit and cycling networks for its citizens, increasing the energy eciency of building, encouraging waste separation and recycling and setting up urban green spaces. \"Awareness of the global health threat posed by air pollution has gained momentum in recent months. The first-ever global conference on air pollution and health took place last autumn and it will also be among the key topics of this year's European Health Forum Gastein.\" The tricky thing is that local and national solutions alone are not sucient to tackle the problem of air pol-lution as dirty air does not halt at national borders. Transboundary air pollution as it is known can aectpeople's health and well-being thousands of kilome-tres away from its source. Hence, there is a serious need for joint international eorts, notably through environmental agreements such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and policy platforms, such as the European Environment and Health Process (EHP). Similarly, in 2017, 53 countries signed the Ostrava Dec - laration which urged enhanced action to combat the 1.4 million premature deaths ascribed to environmental factors, notably by improving air quality. It encourages European countries to support cities to become healthier and safer by fostering sustainable and health-promoting urban planning and mobility management. Investing in healthier cities in order to reduce air pollution and the incidence of NCDs can also trigger a multiplier eect leading to various co-benets for both well-being, climate change and the environment. Expansion of public transport, cycling networks and 16walkways not only reduces air pollution but also increase individuals' physical activity which is one of the key measures to prevent NCDs. Consciousness-raising Awareness of the global health threat posed by air pollution has gained momentum in recent months. The rst-ever global conference on air pollution and health took place last autumn and it will also be among the key topics of this year's European Health Forum Gastein (EHFG). The annual conference, taking place in early October in Bad Hofgastein , Austria, brings together key Euro- pean politicians, researchers, civil society and industry representatives and journalists to discuss Europe's most pressing health issues and stimulate action for radical change.Obviously, talking the talk is not enough. Urbanisation, both in Europe and globally, will accelerate in the decades to come so all relevant actors from government, industry, civil society and the public as a whole need to come together to tackle the omnipresent, yet invisible threat air pollution represents for all of us.

The result of years of downsizing has been the frag- mentation of infrastructure required for developing novel small molecules. Highly skilled applied scientists with drug discovery know-how and exper- tise can now be found in a number of new spin-out therapy companies, Contract Research Organisations (CROs), not-for-profit organisations and also within dedicated Drug Discovery Groups (DDGs) within academia. This new dynamic ecosys- tem is positioned to actively de-risk early drug discovery through public funding, charities, philanthropy, pri- vate-public partnerships and venture capitalist funding. Such collaborative research environments help to over- come common pitfalls in drug discov- ery where new compounds often fail, known as the \"Valley of Death\"5. Analysis of FDA approved new chemi- cal entities and the role universities have played in their identification and development indicates anything between 24 to 55%1. Nearly a fifth of drugs recently approved by the EMA originated from academic and publicly- funded drug discovery programmes3. With large pharma reassessing priori- ties every two to four years and align- ing behind an ever decreasing set ofdisease areas and indications, large areas of unmet need are now poorly served. Universities are well-positioned to address the gaps. With a diverse set of expertise, access to large sets of data, access to patients, all set in an innovative and creative environment, professionalised DDGs in academia are well placed to advance novel tar- gets, incorporate the latest technolo- gies to de-risk drug discovery projects and progress those projects usingrobust, industry-standard approaches. The \"Valley of Death\" is often described as the gap between a promis- ing early-stage academic discovery andthe later-stage de-risked project that will attract the attention of pharmaceutical companies and investors. Bridging this gap can be a significant challenge in an academic environment 5. In a recent report from the ABPI,4it was noted that 24 publicly funded drug discovery centres exist in the UK, employing over 500 staff, with the capacity to carry out over 350 screening projects per year. In the U.S., there are approximately 60 such academic translational centres that have received significant funding from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science, National Institutes of Health5. Drug discovery at University College London The Drug Discovery Group (part of the UCL Translational Research Office) is an industry-experienced team of drugdiscoverers with the task of seedingnew drug discovery projects within UCL, focusing on UCL-initiated sci- ence. The team collectively has over 40 years of small molecule drug discovery experience across a range of environments from small biotech through to academic groups, research institutes and pharma companies and is positioned within the internationally renowned UCL School of Pharmacy . Over the past five years, the DDG has established infrastructure to support assay optimisation and cellular and biochemical screening, including the capability to miniaturise assays to 384 and 1,536 well formats and access to screening collections including the AZ Open Innovation library through a strategic collaborative agreement with UCL, brokered by the team. In-house chemistry capabilities include an array of automated purification equipment including Biotage Isolera and Waters prep LC/MS. The team also has extensive experience of out-sourcing research requirements as necessary, including specific hit compoundexpansion, biophys screening and in vitro and in vivo DMPK studies. The team are ideally placed to take advantage of UCL's collaborative ethos between clinician-scientists, patients and academic scientists, translating curiosity-driven academic research into drug discovery projects. This is particularly aided by close ties to ourDr Richard Angell and Dr Jane Kinghorn from the Drug Discovery Group (Translational Research Office ), at University College London (UCL), explain the value of drug discovery in academia in bridging the \"Valley of Death\"Academia: An important player in the drug discovery ecosystem 18PROFILEthree National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Cen- tres (BRCs) providing a unique ecosys- tem that supports clinical target identification and validation through building a rich repository of patient data and opportunities for experimen- tal and translational medicine. The DDG is currently working with bioin- formaticians to enable the intelligent use of data for improvements to target validation and drug design, helping tode-risk the projects the team select to work on. Current Portfolio To date, the team has established a portfolio of projects (Wave 1) built upon UCL-based research (Figure). The primary focus has been the cardiovas- cular, anti-infective and oncology projects, many enabled by Open Inno- vation collaborations with AstraZeneca. Most of these projects have progressed to validated hit series and are currently seeking on-funding to enable furtherprogression. A second wave of projects are continuing to mature and the team are establishing drug discovery approaches or confirming data associ- ated with early tool compounds. Funding Models for Academic Drug Discovery Currently, the team has a mixed fund-ing model with underpinning funds provided by UCLH BRC and Wellcome Trust Infrastructure Strategic Support Fund, supplemented by additional funds from competitively won research applications. These have included awards from UCL Technology Fund, British Heart Foundation, CRUK Drug Discovery Committee, MRC Confidence in Concept and Proximity to Discovery funds. However, this funding model and, in particular, applying for funding on a project-by-project basis, does notallow the flexibility required to accel- erate project progression. A lack of sustainable funding to enable rapidprogress in academic drug discovery has been repeatedly recognised in Europe 6, U.S.7, as well as by the Academy of Medical Sciences in the UK8who recently highlighted the need to propagate a culture change in fund- ing for discovery activities to establish more flexible, long-term financial and resource commitments. Moving forward, the DDG at UCL are actively exploring diversification of their funding model to move towards a sustainable funding stream. The team are exploring flexible portfolio finance opportunities from various sources including VC, public money,charities and philanthropy in return for risk sharing in the portfolio and identified projects as they mature.

During the 2014-2019 period, Vytenis Andriukaitis's responsibilities included building up knowledge on how national health systems perform, to mould both national and European Union (EU) policies.Another concerns the increased calls on national health services during a time when there is intense pressure on public nances. (3) The concept of healthy lifestyles Commissioner Andriukaitis took part in a high-level 'Healthcare Innovation for the future' meeting on 9th September 2019. Here, he stressed the importance of paying attention to, \"the protection, prevention and promotion of health, to the economy of health, health and wellness 'valleys' or infrastructure\", as well as the creation of networks of healthy cities and villages and nutritional policies. One area the Commissioner high-lighted is about incorporating the concept of healthy lifestyles in the creation of all businesses, a point heexplained in his own words.\"We have to include the concept of healthy lifestyles in creation of every business. I think it is time the industrydoes not 'business as usual but business as healthier'. This would be such a life changing progress. And the only way to move to healthy ageing goal. \"Public health instruments have to be realised in a coherent way. \"And it means real 'health in all policies' approach. It requires a wide range of dierent measures: taxation, marketing and advertisement regulation, education and infrastructure, just mentioning a few. \"It has to be done at all levels - EU, national, regionaland local - all together, but based on evidence of eec- tiveness of public health instruments. Ant the partici- pation of all actors involved here is crucial.\" Public health When it comes to concrete actions implemented on the EU level in public health, Commissioner Andriukaitis draws our attention to the Alcohol Strategy , HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE Promoting public health in the European Union Member States Here, we take a look at some recent examples of how public health in European Union Member States has been supported by the outgoing European Commissioner for Health & Food Safety, Vytenis AndriukaitisHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 21the provisions of which still need to be implemented and there is more work to be done here. Despite this, the Commissioner underlines some good examples that can be implemented and encourages the Member States to follow these examples. \"We congratulate Scotland's pioneering policy of mini- mum pricing for alcohol, which has been successfully implemented. That is life-saving legislation. Excellent example and precedent for other Member States. \"Another good example - Irish Public Health legislative framework designed to tackle Ireland's harmful rela- tionship with alcohol. It aims to reduce the damage that alcohol causes to individuals, families and society by reducing alcohol consumption, with a particular focus on protecting children and young people from alcohol harm. \"The EU expressed positive support to those measures and encouraged Member States to follow those examples.\" The Commissioner added that the EU can support the policies of the Member States concerning alcohol-related harm by, for example, the reduction of aggressive online marketing to underage and adolescents, supporting unbiased information through labelling and increasing access to food and drink choices. Healthcare innovation Finally, on other public health initiatives, Commissioner Andriukaitis explained that the European Commission has developed an innovative approach in the eld ofpublic health. One of the examples he used in thisrespect, was the State of Health in the EU, a permanent two-year European Commission project that gives policymakers, health practitioners and interest groups insights into health and healthcare and cure systems in EU countries, as well as actual and comparative data. The Commissioner then explained why this approach is helpful. \"It helps to prepare annual Country Specic Recom- mendations to Member States. Together with the next MFF, the proposed regulation on the European Social Fund Plus provides a key governance role for the Steering group for more upstream consultation with the health authorities.\"Commissioner Andriukaitis added that a good example of that is the Swedish 'Physical Activity on Prescription', which will be really useful if transferred to Belgium,Germany, Denmark, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Spain, Portugal and Romania. Having said that, he stressedthe need for the Member States to have the same denition of health in front of their eyes. This is an appropriate note to end this article on as it speaks about 'the health in all policies' approach, which is part of the tremendous legacy that Commissioner Andriukaitis leaves. I am sure you would like to join me in wishing him well for the future and his replacement,Stella Kyriakides for the 2019-2024 period. \"But rst of all, we have to look in the same direction, to have same values and health denition in front of our eyes: 'Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or inrmity.' \"It means - we need to look at it through 'Health in all policies' approach. The Commission tries to implement 'the health in all policies' approach.\" (4) References 4 Open Access Government editorial@openaccessgovernment.org www.openaccessgovernment.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovBringing research to life and seeing it translated into real- world impacts, such as bring- ing important innovations to patients, is a complex process, in which many innovators fail. Evaluations of FP7 and completed health-related Horizon 2020 projects found that an estimated 80% of the results lacked real progress in terms of valorisation and advance- ment towards the market. This is a missed opportunity as health innova- tion is one of the major drivers of future growth in the knowledge-based economy and innovation in healthcare is crucial for providing benefit to citi-zens, as well as meeting established European priorities. Several barriers are impeding the process of valorisation of EU-funded projects. These can relate to general barriers refer to barriers that hamper valorisation of research results in the life sciences industry or specific barri- ers that hamper valorisation specifi- cally for FP7 Health and H2020 SC1 project results. For instance, once a project has ended, there is no mecha- nism in place to ensure that grant ben- eficiaries make any effort to carry out the proposed post-project exploitation or commercialisation plan and it may not be the case that all of the partners involved are otherwise incentivised or interested to keep the project going. In all cases, these barriers relate to the way the Health Innovation Ecosystem is organised. The H2020 funded project UTILE(www.health-breakthrough.eu ), is aimed at facilitating activities that translate promising health-related research results into innovations that will reach the market and have an impact on the healthcare system. Thisinitiative presents the EU-Health Inno- vation Marketplace, which references all types of innovations with potential for future exploitation and/or commer- cialisation, primarily generated by EU Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) and Health and Horizon 2020 SC1 programmes. The UTILE Marketplace matched parties developing new inno- vations (partners within European projects, including academic research organisations, SMEs and large organi- sations) and organisations that act as facilitators for these innovations (including industry representatives, advisors, entrepreneurs, investors and other collaborative parties) and are searching for new research or business opportunities. Valorisation of research does not take place in a vacuum, but rather through a series of steps and processes that depend upon various important part- ners and stakeholders and with access to various resources includingnot only know-how, experience andexpertise (human capital), but also facilities, networks, financial resources and more: in short, valorisation requires an ecosystem in which it can take place. The fundamental rationale for designing the UTILE Marketplace as well as the other services UTILE provide finds its background in, whatwe investigated, is an effective Health Innovation Ecosystem. Health Innovation Ecosystem Within UTILE, we developed a frame- work and outlined conditions for the development of an effective HealthInnovation Ecosystem within Europe via feedback and insights from the UTILE Market and Stakeholder Advi-sory Committee (MSAC) consisting of Europe's respected and experienced industry, investment and other inno- vation stakeholders. The developedframework distinguished four impor- tant elements for an effective Health Innovation Ecosystem and identified the perspective of experts in the field regarding these elements. The four elements that make up the developed framework for an effectiveHealth innovation Ecosystem within Europe are: 1. Excellent Science, 2. Access to capital, 3. Access to human capital and 4. Culture of innovation. Within UTILE, we investigated through interviews and round tables discussion the extent to which the relative supply of these elements, or lack thereof, are perceived as barriers to innovation within Europe. As is visualised in Figure 1, the major barriers are perceived for 3. Access to human capital and 4. Innovation culture & incentive. 1. Excellent science - no barrier perceived: Europe generates a great deal of world-class science. There is, therefore, no relative lack or absenceHere, Cecile ten Kate discusses the process of valorisation of research projects, focusing specifically on the health innovation ecosystemHorizon 2020 research: The health innovation ecosystem of Europe 22PROFILEInnovation culture & incentive Access to human capitalAccess to capital Excellent science Supporting innovation ecosystemInnovation culture & incentive Access to human capitalAccess to capital Excellent science of world-class science in Europe which hinders or presents a barrier to the development of a strong health innovation ecosystem. Europe and the Member States should strive to main- tain or improve the existing strong commitment to fostering world-class science in order to ensure that a current strength is not allowed to deteriorate and become a weakness. 2. Access to capital - no/minor barrier perceived: Although there is room for improvement, access to capital in Europe for health sector innovation is not really the rate-limiting factor it is often made out to be. In particular, ear- lier stage capital is relatively more accessible in Europe than is generally the case in bioregions globally (excep-tion for the leading global hotspots). There is be a minor barrier within Europe in that capital is more accessible in the more mature health clusters and financial centres than in the smaller regions and this is particularly the case with regard to development, late-stage and growth capital, hence there is a minor barrier and access to capital, especially later-stage capital, could be improved across European markets. Specific measures were proposed. 3. Access to human capital - major barrier perceived: Access to humancapital has been identified as a major barrier to the effective valorisation of research results and innovation within the European health innovation ecosystem. Our investigation indicated that \"mediators\" are important players in an effective innovation ecosystem. Mediators are those whose professional role facilitates the translation of research results or inno- vation from academia and research,towards the market. While many such mediators are present in Europe, there are two general problems: First, many mediators are clustered in the more developed and mature biore- gions and second, the necessary networks designed to connect these mediators with innovation stakehold- ers are often lacking or sub-optimal. Any given region of the European health innovation ecosystem may be impacted by one or both of these challenges. A number of specific measures were proposed. 4. Innovation culture & incentive - major barrier perceived: The general lack of a sufficiently strong culture of innovation culture within academic and clinical settings, not only amongst researchers and clinicians but among administration and decision-makers, as well as a lack of commitment to a culture that fosters valorisation orresearch results have been identified as important barriers to Europe's health innovation ecosystem. The main possi- ble contributing factors included: 1) a lack of return on investment in terms of value for career advancement and the prioritisation of publication over research valorisation and 2) a lack of perceived value or incentivises of com- mitment to valorisation in terms of impact on access to research funding. One of the final UTILE deliverables willbe a series of policy recommendations addressing a number of issues but strengthening the European health innovation ecosystem will feature prominently and more attention will be paid to proposed solutions.

Left: the four elements. Right: the four elements as perceived in Europe.HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 24Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: An incurable lung disease Idiopathic pulmonary brosis (IPF), is an incurable lung disease in which scars are formed in the lung tissues. It is a devastating condition characterised by increasing breathlessness, disability and deaththree to four years after diagnosis 1. Only 25% of people survive for ve years. IPF has a worse prognosis than most cancers. Over 30,000 people in the UK live with IPF and over 5,000 people a year die from IPF. It is remorseless and the fourth biggest respiratory killer after lung cancer, COPD and pneumonia2. IPF kills more people in the UK than leukaemia3, but few people have heard of the disease. It generally occurs in people over 50 years of age and aects men more than women. Unlike many respiratory diseases, it is spread evenly through allsections of society. We do not know the precise cause of IPF, but scientists believe it is triggered, in people with a genetic predisposition, by exposure to cigarette smoke, dust and pollution. Acid reflux from the stomach may alsoplay a role. Similar progressive brotic diseases, where the cause is known to include asbestosis and farmer's lung disease. Epidemiological research indicates that the incidence of IPF is increasing rapidly at 2-3% annually 4. The reason for this is not clear. Inequalities in care and treatment IPF generally starts slowly and patients often receive treatment for other conditions, such as chest infections, asthma and heart failure, before they get the IPF diagnosis. GPs misdiagnose up to 35% of patients, which delays referral to hospital respiratory specialists5. Long NHS waiting times for hospital appointments alsodelay diagnosis and treatment. Fewer than 50% ofpatients get the diagnosis within six months of their rst visit to their GP and for 20% of patients, it takes over two years 6. Although IPF has such a poor prognosis, patients donot receive the same level of care as cancer patients. Cancer patients have a clear pathway designed to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment. They must start treatment within 62 days of a GP's referral and are provided access to a specialist nurse. The timeline for IPF patients is less strict - patients only have to be seen by a hospital doctor within 18 weeks. IPF patients who attend one of the 23 specialist centres in England generally have access to a specialist nurse, but this is often not the case at district hospitals. \"Patient support groups can play a vital role in helping patients and their families overcome this feeling of loneliness and find support. They also provide an opportunity for patients to learn more about the disease and feel empowered to manage it better.\" Two anti-scarring drugs are available, which slow down the progress of the disease. These are expensive and have a number of side eects. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has approved anti-scarring drugs for use with patients with a lung function criteria (force vital capacity between 50% to80% of predicted value). This means that the drugs cannot be prescribed to early-stage patients with alung function of over 80%. This restriction is of great concern to patients and their families. The UK is the only country in Europe where this is the case. In other countries, patients may be prescribed these drugs immediately after diagnosis. As well as anti-scarring drugs, people with IPF may beSteve Jones, Chair Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis and Board Member EU-IPFF and Professor Gisli Jenkins from Nottingham University Hospitals, explain idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a silent killer and incurable lung disease in which scars are formed in the lung tissues25oered pulmonary rehabilitation (involving exercise classes and education), cough suppressants and oxygen therapy to help alleviate some of the severe symptoms such as fatigue, cough and breathlessness associated with IPF. As the disease takes hold, patients become more and more breathless. Initially, they are unable to climb stairs and eventually nd walking on the flat dicult. They become dependent on supplementary oxygen.Their world closes in on them and they feel isolated. Patient support groups can play a vital role in helping patients and their families overcome this feeling of loneliness and nd support. They also provide an opportunity for patients to learn more about the disease and feel empowered to manage it better. Support group are generally run by patents and healthcare professionals, such as nurses or physiotherapists. Patient charities, such as Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis, in the UK, have galvanised the community by raising money, funding research, helping to set up over 75 localsupport groups and providing educational resourcesfor patients, carers and healthcare professionals.Similar patient organisations exist in other European countries, the U.S. and Canada. Hope for the future Despite the grave prognosis, there is considerable hope for patients with IPF. There are a large number of new anti-scarring drugs being developed to treat this condition. Furthermore, new genetic insights into the disease have raised the prospect of precision medicine using targeted treatments tailored to patients with specic genetic or molecular abnormalities. Articial intelligence (AI), as well as wearable and other smart technologies, may help identify patients earlier, who may then gain more benet from starting these new or conventional therapies sooner. Although IPF is a deadly disease and is killing more and more people each year, increased collaboration between doctors, scientists and patient advocacy groups is leading to real improvements in outcomes for HEALTH & SOCIAL CAREHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 26patients with this devastating disease. This is happening in the UK, across Europe and globally (see box). The main challenge facing policymakers, in the years ahead, will be to ensure adequate funding for research on IPF and to pay for costly new treatments needed for rising numbers of IPF patients.

Since then, it has grown into animportant platform for sharing best practice, educating its members and raising awarenessamong policymakers in the European Parliament and European Commission. The EU-IPFF promotes the collective partnership of patient groups, health care, professionals, academia and industry. It is in turn supported by larger groupsin which it is active, such as European Lung Foundation, Eurordis (Rare Disease Europe) and the European Reference Network on Rare Respiratory Diseases (ERN-Lung), in turn, support EU-IPFF. It has a Scientic Advisory Board comprising leading clinicians and scientists from across Europe. A benchmarking study of IPF care and treatment across Europe, which highlights areas for improvement in dierent countries, has recentlybeen completed by the EU-IPFF. In 2020, it willorganise the rst European IPF Patient Summit on idiopathic pulmonary brosis (IPF) and interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). This will bring together patient groups, healthcare professionals and industry representatives to discuss research, person-centredcare, policy and advocacy liam.galvin@eu-ip.org www.twitter.com/eu_ipwww.openaccessgovernment.orgGOVERNMENTOPEN ACCESSWhether you agree, disagree, or have another viewpoint with any news and features on our website, we want to hear from you.

IPF has a poor prognosis and a devastating impact on the lives of patients and their families. Recently, two anti-fibrotic drugs became avail- able that slow down the decline in lung function (forced vital capacity, FVC) in IPF. Although this is an important and hopeful step forward for patients, IPF remains a deadly disease with a pro- gressively impaired quality of life due to symptoms as dyspnea, cough and reduced exercise tolerance1. The use of eHealth technologies could hold great benefits in this elderly pop- ulation, especially in countries where patients are treated in a limited number of centres and have to travel considerably to visit the outpatient clinic. We believe that eHealth has the potential to improve care and research in IPF as distances are bridged online and data can be collected by the patient at home. The use of eHealth technologies may further promote self- management and provide patients withmore insights in their disease course. Even though the use of eHealth tools to improve health outcomes is being increasingly explored in other (chronic) diseases, experience with eHealth in IPF is scarce. Currently, over 300,000 health apps are available in the app stores, however, most eHealth applications have never beenthoroughly investigated.eHealth tools to improve health outcomes in IPF Together with patients, we have devel- oped a home monitoring programme (IPF online) for patients with IPF. IPF online consists of an app integrated with real-time measurement of lung function at home (home spirometry), online reporting of symptoms, side- effects and quality of life question-naires, an information library and the possibility of electronic and video con- sultations 3. This system incorporates automated email alerts if lung func- tion significantly declines or patients report bothersome side-effects. The real-time monitoring and feedback enable patients to gain more insightsinto their disease and give clinicians the option to monitor patients at a distance. A pilot study with this system demonstrated high patient satisfaction and indicated that online monitoring of lung function and symptoms is feasible and reliable in this elderly patient population. This study has paved the way for a ran- domised controlled trial evaluating the effect of home monitoring on quality of life, medication use, side- effects and healthcare costs, which iscurrently underway (NCT03420235). Use of home monitoring for data collection in clinical trials Further, eHealth solutions can be used to enhance data collection in clinical trials. One ongoing study evaluates disease behaviour during the peri-diagnostic period in patients with interstitial lung diseases, includingKaren Moor and Marlies Wijsenbeek from the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam explore the role of eHealth tools in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis care and researchThe role of eHealth tools in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis care and research 28PROFILE eHealth is defined as: \"The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for health\"2. IPF, using daily home spirometry and accelerometry. Moreover, this study aims to improve collaboration between community hospitals and expert centres using a digital collabo- ration platform. The results of this study will shed light on the role of eHealth for earlier diagnosis and treatment4. \"We believe that eHealth has the potential to improve care and research in IPF as distances are bridged online and data can be collected by the patient at home. The use of eHealth technologies may further promote self- management and provide patients with more insights in their disease course.\" Home spirometry may also facilitate endpoint collection in clinical trials studying new treatment options for IPF and other forms of pulmonary fibrosis. A decline in FVC is the primary outcome in most IPF clinical trials and is widely accepted as a surrogate end- point for mortality5. In a rare, progres- sive disease as IPF, performing large international clinical trials is rather challenging. Studies with new drugs will have to demonstrate efficacy on top of already registered anti-fibrotic treatment. This will lead to smaller margins of change in FVC decline and thereby require a longer duration of studies or larger groups of patients to be studied (increased sample sizes). Until now, few studies in IPF have focused on the collection of data bythe patient at home. Two studiesdemonstrated that home spirometryin IPF is highly clinically informative and may reduce sample size for future trials 6, 7. These studies clearly revealed the potential of home moni- toring in patients with IPF. However, FVC results were not directly availablefor healthcare providers, which makes it impossible to check the quality of measurements, monitor adherence and timely respond to a decline in lung function. Currently, a number of IPF trials collect home spirometry data as a secondary endpoint, but resultshave yet to be published. Though important as an objective outcome measure, lung function does not necessarily reflect how a patient feels or functions. Patient-reported outcomes can provide more relevant information about the impact of a disease on patients' quality of life and are, therefore, increasingly used as outcome measures in IPF research. One of our recent studies showed that online collection of patient-reported outcomes is feasible for patients with IPF and may be incorporated in eHealth tools 8. Potential future applications of eHealth in IPF Multiple national IPF registries have been initiated during the last years, but trans-border collaboration and pooling of data have encountered multiple hurdles so far. An online home monitoring programme has the potential to overcome these barriers, as data about lung function, symp- toms, medication and quality of life are collected and owned by patients. These data may be used for registry purposes when patients give their consent. A real-world patient-led reg- istry would provide much-needed insights in disease behaviour of IPF and other forms of pulmonary fibrosis, at a low burden for patients and healthcare providers. Although recent developments are encouraging, more steps need to be taken in the coming years. Forinstance, questions about long-term use and cost-effectiveness of eHealth in IPF have still not been answered. Another important issue is whether eHealth solutions could replace outpatient clinic visits in the future and thereby reduce the frequency and burden of hospital visits. To address these topics and integrate eHealth tools in research and clinical practice, better collaboration between patients, healthcare providers, researchers, health policymakers, insurance companies and other stakeholders is needed.

This fact is also demon- strated through the strong government nancial support evidenced in the implementation of genomicresearch into healthcare systems. Numerous nationalgenomic medicine initiatives are presently active, unparalleled propelling transformational healthcare (Stark et al., 2019). However, ethics may present some highlights around genomic medicine. Here, two extreme case studies are unveiled: Finland and China. How countries are evolving their medical systems through genomic medicine approaches? Case Study #1: Finland As many other developed countries, Finland is strongly betting to the opportunities generated by the availabil- ity of huge amounts of data and gene based collections. Big data is expected to actively participate in the enhancement of medical research and the consequentgeneration of economic wealth, in the path toward the total access of the population to health and wellbeing. The imperative relies on the usage of massive genomic data justied by the moral principle of improving health (Snell, 2019). Such imperative of health also establishes the legal regulation of data collection, infrastructure develop- ment and genomic innovation. Finnish data-driven medicine is based on the moral principle of health, with policies related to privacy and autonomy sub- jected to this national goal. On that note, the highlyrestrictive and conscious government regulatory policies of data privacy and security become the major challenge for leveraging the entire potential of big data analytics in the country. However, Finland has found a potential solution through the institutionalisation of automatic systemic data anonymisation policies in order to make healthcare data safe from cyber-attacks and accessible to life scientists (Taiwo, 2019).Cecilia Van Cauwenberghe from Frost & Sullivan's TechVision Group Genomic medicine approaches - two contrasting case studies to note including the overall perspective, as well as the challenges and concerns in the field Genomic medicine approaches - two contrasting case studiesHEALTH & SOCIAL CAREHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 31Case Study #2: China At the opposite corner, violating the ethical consensus of scientists all over the world, a team of Chinese scientists led by He Jiankui. He presented during the second World Summit of Human Gene Editing in early 2019, the gene-editing project that led to the birth of two baby girls with man-made C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) mutations. This research was stronglyrepudiated by the worldwide scientic community as an extremely irresponsible behaviour that exhibits alack of both medical ethics and understanding of gene editing science. The gene editing on a human germlineconstitutes a severe violation of both the Chinese regulations and the consensus reached by the interna- tional science community (Wang and Yang, 2019). How-ever, this incident triggered a wide-ranging discussionabout the criteria and standards for genome editing in the human germline for reproductive purposes, attempting to reach a solid consensus about clear andstrict policies at an international level. \"Genomic research, particularly genome sequencing, has dramatically been translated into clinical practice. This fact is also demonstrated through the strong government financial support evidenced in the implementation of genomic research into healthcare systems.\" It is remarkable to highlight that the present gene edit- ing technologies that attempt to introduce precise genetic modications into the human germlines are still poorly developed. Although a further development and improvement of these technologies may provide solutions for many genetic and rare diseases, presently severely underserved by medical therapies, a regulatory framework is needed before translating gene editing solutions from genomic research to specic medical applications (Ye et al., 2019). Final remarks In contrast to the Finland case, where a national com- mitment governs the most critical decisions regardinghealth and wellbeing actions, there is a serious lack of awareness about the importance of ethics in China.Some researchers emphasise on the urgent need to improve both ethics training and scientic knowledge.In fact, present members of ethics committees are considered by the international scientic and clinical community as probably not well positioned to assess emerging technologies rigorously (Lei et al., 2019).

Very promising examples of targeted therapeutics against specific cancers and novel lipid-lowering medications have emerged but the road from genome to disease insight to therapy has been more challenging than some had hoped. It has become clear that many key medical insights require the integrationof an enormous scale of genetic and medical information from 100,000s to 1,000,000s of humans in order to bediscovered - yet in most parts of the world, the collection, aggregation and integration of such information has been precluded by many logistical and regulatory hurdles. Inherent to the problem is the challenge in striking the right balance between individual data protection and autonomy and the scientific progress that is possible only when data from many individuals is assembled and studied. An individual's medical data is clearly one of the most private elements of personal data and must always begiven the highest level of data protec- tion and to be in the control of the indi- vidual. This is, of course, a primary goalof the GDPR, as well as regulatory frameworks in other parts of the world. At the same time, as medical and genome sciences have advanced (and we have learned the value of their integration), providing access to these data on a large-scale to promote research discovery is seen as an opposing pressure. Indeed, critical insights relevant to both individual diagnoses and therapies in rare dis- eases and cancers, as well as the dis- covery of therapeutically actionable biology in common disease are now possible but often require genomes and health data from extremely large samples to be analysed together. How to ethically balance data protection and promote essential medical discov- eries and innovation is, therefore, oneof the major challenges in research medicine today. Finland tackled this challenge proac- tively and efficiently with an innovative national Biobank Act in 2013. While completely protecting individual data (consistent with the later GDPR require- ments), the Biobank Act facilitates responsible and approved medical research in academia or industry with several critical elements. First, is the introduction of the concept that indi- viduals may provide a 'broad consent' for approved medical research (and, therefore, need not consent to each separate approved research project individually). Second, a straightforwardway in which previously collected sam- ples (such as valuable epidemiological collections with extensive characterisa- tion and longitudinal follow-up) can be transferred to the national biobank framework and used in future studies. Third, individuals consenting to join the biobank can be recontacted (based on their medical and genome data results) in the context of an approved research study, creating the opportunity to build a dynamic research resource that canbe updated with not only national health registry data but individuals are invited to participate in secondary research studies. Equally important are provisions that individuals may remove consent at any time and request any data generated on their samples ordata. Such a forward-looking frame- work has resulted in the initiation of large-scale and innovative research projects, such as FinnGen. The FinnGen project aims to collect genome data and integrate it with national health registry information on 500,000 Finns (almost 10% of the population). FinnGen is supported by a unique public-private partnership involving the Finnish government innovation fund Business Finland and a consortium of nine pharmaceutical companies. Made possible by the pro- gressive Biobank Act, the study has a focus on generating therapeutically relevant insights surrounding the root causes of common diseases, as wellMark Daly, Director of the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE at the University of Helsinki, shares his expertise on medical genetic research on a population scale in FinlandFinland: A framework for genetic research 32PROFILEas their progression and responses to therapy. The project will, therefore, utilise both deeply studied legacy collections, the subjects of which in many cases are quite old and newly recruited patients from hospital clinics throughout Finland (more than 150,000 individuals in less than two years). With all individuals recruited into the Finnish biobanks, the project is thenapproved to perform a broad set ofanalyses including (from the approved study plan) the \"identification of dele- terious predisposing and protective disease variants, the development and genetic exploration of novel longitudinal disease progression and response phenotypes and the use ofgenetic information for prioritisingpotential drug targets\". That such analysis can be done in an ethically responsible way, with no individually identifiable data in the hands of research staff outside the approvedgovernment agencies which handle such data, is a credit to the innovative spirit in Finland and, in particular, the commitment of a population who see the benefit of an advanced medicalsystem comes with a responsibility to permit their data to be used in further critical medical research. While Finland is making progress, we must distribute lessons learned and technology platforms to ensure global progress. Mechanisms for sharing personal data appropriately and anonymously across national bound- aries, not just within, must be devel- oped since human biology and medical challenges are shared by all and efforts, resources and samples inany one country are insufficient to solve the most complex medical prob- lems. Moreover, since medical (and particularly genomic) research has been very disproportionately centred on people of European ancestry, it is ethically imperative that locally appro- priate and secure genetic data sharing techniques be adopted widely in Asia and Africa, as well as Europe and North America. Furthermore, we must accomplish this in a way that respects cultural differences and recognises the impor- tance of capacity and infrastructurebuilding in under-resourced locations. Only then will we ensure maximum value is achieved from existing, as well as newly developed medical research efforts around the world. In this way, we may finally deliver on the promise of the Human Genome Project, ensur- ing that the fruits of medical genetics research can inform on the biology of disease in all people and lead to a new era of improved therapeutics for all.

On the face of it, this announcement looks like very good news. Hancock commented: \"We are on the cusp of a huge health tech revolution that could transform patient experience by making the NHS a truly predictive, preventive and personalised health and care service.\"He also emphasised his determination to: \"bring the benets of technology to patients and sta, so the impact of our NHS Long Term Plan and this immediate, multimillion-pound cash injection are felt by all.\" Whilst some examples of the potential uses of AI have been given both in administrative and clinical contexts(which also include predicting patients most likely not to show for appointment and inspecting existing algorithms already used by the NHS to ensure patient condentiality is protected), there are many otherexamples of applications of AI to support patient care. For example, the monitoring of Type 1 diabetic patients and of those that have heart conditions viabody-worn devices can bring about transformational improvements in the individual's health and also reductions in the cost to the taxpayer. With higher patient expectations and increases in life expectancy, a growing number of citizens require pre- emptive advice to promote better health. Leveraging the insight trapped in the UK population's medical data can make the dierence. But with more data and com- plexity than ever, unlocking this insight is becoming increasingly dicult. Consequently, opportunities forpreventive measures and the most ecient corrective care are not always being taken. The news that the UK Government is investing in artificial intelligence is hugely welcome, but to truly reap the benefits, AI must be part of a wider scheme of data utilisation, digital process automation and citizen engagement. Peter Ford, Public Sector Industry Principal, Pegasystems tells us moreNHS: Why AI investment is just one piece of the puzzleHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE35So how could AI in collaboration with other technologies improve the NHS? AI with end-to-end process automation to improve preventative healthcare As life expectancy rises and pressure on NHS resourcesgrows, investing in ways to educate citizens with pre-emptive advice to staying healthy is growing in impor- tance. To succeed, businesses need an easy, accurate and reliable way to create and incorporate predictiveanalytics and decisions into every process and interac- tion. Coupled with other leading technologies, such as interactive business process management, robotic automation and context-sensitive transparent guidance and decisioning, AI should bring about both improve- ments in patient care at the same time as similar enhancements in operational eciency. AI with analytics to make cost savings and improve eciencies The use of AI and analytics can inform on trends on overtime and temporary sta working patterns, plus identication of likely increases in demand to help set the right numbers of doctors and nurses along with other infrastructure provision. Integration of data fromdierent sources within the NHS and agencies outside of it could also inform where dierent supply options for beds provide the best value for money. AI with external source data to inform policy AI could be used to bring together disparate datasources to indicate the best options for how to improve patient care. For example, with sucient online information to notify on likely shortfalls in public sector rehabilitation beds, private-sector resources could be taken advantage of more to take the strain of the public-sector. The NHS could analyse the particular needs of a patient based on case history, clinical guidance and rules with AI to decide on the best course of action. \"On 8th August 2019, Health Secretary Matt Hancock allocated an additional \u00a3250 million to be invested in an artificial intelligence (AI) laboratory that will lead to a better ability to screen for cancer, identify patients most at risk of diseases such as heart disease or dementia, build systems to detect people at risk of post-operative infections and more.\" Furthermore, data from social welfare can be used to inform policy at both a macro and local level, as health- care and social welfare are so inextricably linked - what happens in one domain often gives rise to demands on the other. The delivery of social welfare by local government versus centralised provision of healthcare has previously caused issues, so orchestration of inter- agency sharing of information is imperative. The government says AI is already being developed in some hospitals, successfully predicting cancer survival rates and cutting the number of missed appointments. It is motivating that this technology is already saving lives, however, it is clear AI alone will not result in the desired outcomes. It needs to be part of the greater plan by also taking into account technologies such as digital process automation, smart use of data and a focus on patients to ensure this investment delivers on its promises. Peter FordPegasystems www.pega.com www.twitter.com/pega HEALTH & SOCIAL CAREWhen it comes to reducing prescription errors, a recent study by the universities of York, Manchester and Sheffield reported that in England's NHS alone some 237 million medication errors occur every year, which, as former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt esti- mated, accounts for between four and five deaths a day. Whilst the NHS is committed to reducing these errorsby 50%, St Helens & Knowsley working with WellSky International (formerly known as JAC) have challenged them-selves to achieve an even higher rate. In April 2017, Whiston, an in-patient hospital, went live with WellSky's web-based EPMA. In under a year, theTrust saw positive results by digitising medicines management. The system links with WellSky Pharmacy stock control module and together create an end-to-end integrated medicines management platform that can interface with their System C Patient Administration System for order communications, admissions/discharge and other functionality. This digital environment enables quick and easy data sharing across wards and other trust sites, providing nurses and doctors with secure access to patient records even while they are on the road. Why WellSky? In addition to already having its pharmacy stock control system, the Trust wanted an elec-tronic prescribing solution with broad functionality, designed by domain specialists and already with a proven user base. At the time of selection, the Trust didn't have an electronic patient record (EPR) so were free to choose the EPMA market leader. One of the main priorities was a modern web-based system that was intuitive to use for mobile clinicians and would be easy to deploy, upgrade and interface with other applications as our digitisation programme evolves. EPMA's web version updates are done directly from the IT centre with users accessing the system via URLs. Not only does this save a great deal oftime, but it also ensures everyone is always using the same version. The digital transformation \"The new system is much more efficient and quicker than other versions that I've used previously,\" said Dr Andrew Hill, Clinical Lead for Stroke Services. When WellSky EPMA was introduced to clinicians, the web interface - which was designed following in-depth study of how users navigate screens - greatly simplified the training process. In fact, the speed with which the Trust overcame cultural and technology barriers were especially impressive considering the complexity of elec- tronic prescribing. There is a vast array of medicines, protocols and dose bandings to be custom config-ured into the drug database, along with exception alerts for the drug allergies and the special sensitivities of individual patients. Given that a single error can be life-threatening,Of all of the digitisation projects currently underway at St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals (STHK) NHS Trust, electronic prescribing and medicines administration (EPMA) represents the biggest step forward for patient safety, ensuring the right drugs get to the right patient at the right timeLeading digital change with WellSky EPMA 36PROFILE this explains why medicines manage- ment has one of the lowest tolerances to error: It simply must be safe. Eliminating transcription mistakes \"On electronic systems, you reduce the amount of hand-written transcription of medications; which significantlyreduces the number of prescribing errors,\" commented Dr Andrew Hill, Clinical Lead for Stroke Services. Like all hospitals, the Trust used to have problems with the wrong medicines being delivered to the wards because of the order's illegible handwriting. And while these were always spotted in time, it posed unnecessary risks. WellSky EPMA eliminates this risk. Other safety features include decision support tools like best practice medicines and dosage defaults. By prescribing electronically, orders no longer go astray and drug administering schedules can be monitored and flagged up if a round is missed. And incases when care is time-critical, a change in prescription or dosage can be reviewed and amended remotely in real-time. The Trust has noted a marked reduction in medicine incidents logged by the Datix incident reporting system. Saving clinician time With WellSky EPMA clinicians no longer wade through old kardexes to look up a patient's medication history. Instead, doctors can see a patient's complete real-time prescription sheet on a single consolidated screen; determine when a particular drug was last administered and find out why it was stopped. Because all medicines data is captured within the database, on readmission to the hospital a patient's treatment history can be called up instantly. The pharmacy/treatment dispense information interface allows EPMA data to be downloaded to create discharge letters for the patient's GP. Digitising the Trust's medicines management environment has also had a positive impact on operationaland financial efficiencies. The wealth of data captured by the WellSky EPMA system is not only clinically rich but enables the generation of a wide range of reports and analysis of both clinical and operational outcomes in away previously not possible. With future EPMA rollouts planned for St Helens Hospital, outpatients and possible outreach into community hospitals, the project is nothing short of transformative.

The signicant challenges facing the UK's treasured NHS playing out against the headwinds of a turbulent political backdrop are making solutions hard to come by. Most NHS trusts in the UK,for example, have been facing critical bed shortages for years, and yet management of those scarce assetscontinues to be a complex, complicated and heavily contested process. At the heart of it, all are the patients, whose care is being profoundly impacted up and downthe country every day. Few could argue with the need for fundamental change. The newly launched NHSX promises just that. With its mission to take forward digital transformation in the NHS, allowing patients and sta to benet from the latest digital systems and technology, it aims to create a revolution in how care is delivered. It is furtherbolstered by the Chancellor's recent spending review which assures renewed focus and funds for the health and social care sector: \u00a36.2 billion in the 2020/21nancial year. We know the answer doesn't necessarily lie in (more) beds, and certainly not with rushing people out of hospital for the issue to then manifest itself in another part of the system. So what can innovators do to help ease the pain points of a system conceived before technology could oer a better way? Is it possible to retrot technology to address asset management in healthcare? Why asset management matters With the NHS so stretched and operating at or over-capacity, optimising the use of physical healthcare resources such as beds is central to successfullymanaging patient flow. Using NHS resources more eectively so they reach their full potential means clinicians are freed up to focus on those in their carerather than consumed by asset management - making patients the top priority as should absolutely be the case. The consequences otherwise are far-reaching. Whilst the crisis around the availability of beds in emergency wards is widely reported and naturally concerning, the issue is, in fact, felt at every touchpoint in the health and social care system, with professionals facing constant barriers to transitioning patients through it. \"Digital solutions which enable better asset management free up valuable clinician time and provide staff with accurate information at their fingertips.\" Paper-based processes and the use of whiteboards to organise and map beds is inecient and inaccurate. Entrenched ways of working dier from ward to ward meaning communication can fall down; time and resource that could be better spent on patients are consumed in bed meetings, trying to chase down capacity with an incomplete picture. These silos of information prohibit not just a joined-up view of the system's bed inventory, but even more concerning of the patient themselves - the impact of which is potentially devastating. A piece of paper lost, information scrubbed from a whiteboard could lead to something important being missed, increasing the chance of clinical risk. Duplicative data entry is commonplace as sta attempt to make sense of ward capacity; this can lead to inconsistencies in patient records alongside the obvious data protection concerns. All of this puts more pressure on sta and takes their time away from patients. Free-flowing data make patient care safer The professionals I encounter universally agree that the solution lies at the intersection between theNeil Laycock, Managing Director of Healthcare, Servelec, explores the potential for digital solutions to change the narrative on managing precious assets in the healthcare environmentHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 41physical and the digital - with improved access to real-time bed information and associated clinical and operational tasks which supports the management of actual patient flow within the hospital through to discharge. What is required is a fundamental shift in the approach towards how beds are managed, usingkey predictors to inform flow. Intuitive end-to-end solutions which document the patient's rst presentation through to discharge and can be integrated into existing Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems and patient administration systems and give hospital sta the up-to-the-minutedata they need to make informed decisions. Invaluable electronic dashboards can accurately display capacity information at site, ward and bed level at a glance means operational and clinical tasks can be expedited and patients moved along their care pathways. The scale of the challenge is perhaps daunting but far from insurmountable; on the contrary, the health and social care system has already come a long way and proven it is adept at adopting new technologies - using instant messaging to communicate on the go and the success of EPR systems. Digital solutions which enable better asset management free up valuable clinician time and provide sta with accurate information at their ngertips. Technology can underpin a 'right bed at the right time' approach -helping sta make better-informed decisions which reduce the length of stay, improve the quality of care and overall patient experience. Trusts have a great opportunity to adopt interoperable best of breed systems. The next step is to embrace interoperability across the full health and social care picture - working towards a future where the patient journey is seamless and truly centred on them. Neil LaycockManaging Director, Healthcare ServelecNeil.laycock@servelec.co.ukwww.servelec.co.uk www.twitter.com/Servelec_ Neil Laycock, Managing Director of Healthcare, ServelecThe Northern Health and Social Care Trust (NHSCT) is one of five health and social care trusts in Northern Ireland. They provide a com- prehensive range of health and social care services to a population of almost 471,000 people across a geographicalarea of 1,733 square miles, making it the largest geographical trust in Northern Ireland. The Trust has a budget of \u00a3687 million and employs 11,800 staff across a fullrange of medical, health and social care disciplines. The Trust delivers services from over 150 facilities including two major general hospital sites, a mental health hospital, local community hospitals, health centres, social services and a significant network of community services, as well as provision of care in the home. The Trust provides emergency hospital services on two sites, Antrim Area Hospital and Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. The need The Trust required the ability to know the location of every medical bed andassociated mobile medical devices in their hospitals. The clinical and medi- cal engineering teams faced a daily battle to locate beds and mattresses, as they are frequently underutilisedand poorly maintained. This created arisk burden and a significant yet avoidable cost. This led to compro- mises in relation to time, cost effi- ciency, safety, patient care and risk management. They estimated that nursing staff were spending on average 21 minutes on every shift looking for equipment. The staff did not have access to all the required information to ensure that every patient was able to be provided with the right bed for their individual situation e.g. bariatric to reduce bed sores or other complications. The estates team estimated that theywere purchasing 25% more equipment than actually required for operationalneeds. In brief, they wanted a real-time asset location service that would start withbeds but could be scaled up to manage all mobile assets, the service would require an integrated task man- agement application for monitoring the location, cleaning, calibration and maintenance of these assets. The solution To provide this capability, Healthcare Analytics and our partner Multitone Electronics engaged in a research pro- ject with the Medicines Optimisation Innovation Centre (MOIC), an innova- tion unit within the Northern Ireland Health Service to build the i-trackbeds service. The solution comprises of a small chip and antenna, RFID tags are attached to beds and mattresses. Each tag hasa unique device identification number and uses radio waves to identify and track beds and mattresses. Brendan Crossey, Chief Executive Officer of Healthcare Analytics Limited, directs our thoughts to innovative bed tracking at the Northern Health and Social Care Trust, one of five health and social care trusts in Northern IrelandInnovative bed tracking at a Northern Health and Social Care Trust 42PROFILE A barcode is included on all tags to allow staff to integrate the history of a device by scanning its barcode using the mobile app. The mobile app also allows staff to manage requests for bed moves, cleaning and mainte- nance. All requests, notices and alerts are processed via the Multitone mis- sion critical iMessage Service which guarantees that all messages are sent and received in a timely manner. The whole service is managed via a Management Dashboard which includes the database and software for processing the data. The result Over the last three months, the movement of medical beds has been successfully tracked in Antrim Area Hospital and staff are now able to know exactly the location of each bed in the hospital. The i-trackbeds solution helps staff in Antrim to ensure security and regula- tion compliance, as well as enabling employees to work more efficiently on a daily basis by solving the issuesaround the location and management of beds and mattresses. In addition, they have found that improved device management, avail- ability and utilisation reduces the need to loan beds and mattresses to accommodate short-term demand. In future the process of bed and mattress rentals will be automated with nursing staff able to raise requests for rentals, which are sent for approval, with a reminder raised at the end of the period and rental companies automatically informed of the return with its location. What's more, significant rentalcharges can be avoided by ensuring clinical staff only use specialist beds and mattresses when necessary. \"Our PATIENTS get access to the RIGHT equipment at the RIGHT time for the RIGHT patient - resulting in safer patient care while delivering a better patient experience\" Dr Naomi Baldwin PhD, Senior Nurse Patient Safety and Performance, Northern Health and Social Care Trust. What next? The Trust is now looking at expanding the use of this service to all mobiledevices across the trust. The Trust will also be exploring the use of the service to enhance the safety of vulnerable patients. As an integrated care provider, the trust is looking at using the service to provide connected medical devices to monitor the care of patients in the community. \"Our PATIENTS get access to the RIGHT equipment at the RIGHT time for the RIGHT patient - resulting in safer patient care while delivering a better patient experience.\" The platform can now support the management of assets which could be beds, mobile devices, staff or patients internally in the hospital or out in the community, as the system has the ability to utilise both active or passive tags using any or a mixture of the major connectivity protocols i.e. Ethernet,4G/5G, Bluetooth BLE, Wi-Fi, RFID, LoRA or Sigfox IoT Networks. medicine: Cost-effectiveness of breakthrough treatments The emergence of precision medicine is upon us. Dened as an approach to patients with specic and identiable characteristics, which enable a targeted diagnostic or treatment methodology. It has become a priority focus for both researchers and the government. Within this broader category of precision medicine, there are two dened subcategories, which are precision targeting and breakthrough precision medicine. The distinction between these two categories is critical to their cost-eectiveness and the likely usage of such tests or therapies. (1) Precision targeting Precision targeting or stratied medicine describes a process of narrowing the use of conventional medicines and diagnostics based on using information such as pharmacogenomics, medical records and demography. This process is predicated on three elements. Whichare: 1. Eective genetic tests to diagnose illnesses reliably and early; 2. Companion diagnostics or biomarkers which deliver sensitive and specic results and; 3. Informatics or the analysis of large data sets collected from patients and/or a wider population. The expectation is that the precision targetingapproach will provide clinicians with the diagnostictools and therapies to prescribe the \"right treatment to the right patient while simultaneously reducing waste and yielding cost savings.\" (2)These cost-savings have not yet been realised across all disease areas. The reasons for this are multiple but relate chiefly to the fact that development costs are still being incurred. However, the system sounds biologi- cally plausible when one considers the potential of fewer inappropriate investigations, reduced iatrogenic problems or unplanned admissions and improved potential outcomes for patients. \"Precision targeting or stratified medicine describes a process of narrowing the use of conventional medicines and diagnostics based on using information such as pharmacogenomics, medical records and demography.\" Breakthrough precision medicine The second type of precision medicine, 'breakthrough precision medicine', derives from the development offully personalised curative drugs; in particular, genetic and regenerative cell therapies, which it is anticipated will be tailored specically to each patient's genomicsand disease features. The key considerations in this category of innovation are the likely enormous costs of drug development against the therapeutic value for a patient who goes on to have a full and productive life. Adding to the economic considerations, we should be aware of the influence of the burden of illness and the social impact involved in the potential of using apooled national nancial resource for expensive treatments for individuals with rare diseases. This has been highlighted recently in the case of a dispute relating to the cost of a drug for cystic brosis.(3) This new therapy which is said to improve the lives ofDr Gerry Morrow shares his thoughts on the precision medicine, defined as the cost-effectiveness of breakthrough treatments and explains why this area is a priority for both researchers and governmentHEALTH & SOCIAL CARE 45aected patients has fallen foul of NHS England pricing arrangements. Even though this is a conventional medication which has not yet reached the precision medicine category. Additionally, in the UK we are nationally constrained by the NICE 'value-based assessment' of health technologies, which places a standard nancial threshold on the incremental cost-eectiveness ration (ICER) per quality - adjusted life year (QALY) of up to \u00a330,000. Having said this, NICE has revised their nancial methodology for end of life technologies, where the ICER per QALY has been revised upwards to \u00a350,000 and for very rare diseases, where the ICER per QALYhas been increased to a \u00a3300,000 maximum. (4) There have been criticisms of the NICE methodology,with researchers commenting that despite their transparent procedures it mitigates against expensive innovation and can result in 'dierent values being placed on health gains for identical patients' (5). Ultimately this may lead to a lack of access for patients who relyon the NHS. This could result in a situation where the much-touted democratisation of precision health, based on harvested population data, may end up benetting only those with sucient means to fund individual clinical trials, research and personal drug manufacture. It is uncertain 'how' or indeed 'if' NICE will revise their value-based assessment approach to deal withthese nascent technological advances that comprise precision medicine. Conclusion 'Precision targeting' seems unarguable and feels like a direct continuation of the evidence-based medicine approach for all clinical practice. Over the next ve to ten years it is likely that we will investigate and treat patients according to their dened genotype and phenotype. 'Breakthrough precision medicine' sounds tantalising patient and to the clinician. A 'golden bullet' approach to a disease entity unique to each patient seems to move us closer to a science ction future ofhealthcare. But, just as this appears fantastical, the costs may also be fantastically out of reach for most patients. As usual, science is moving faster than ethics. Our challenge, therefore, is to nd a way to harness this new technology whilst retaining the benets for even the most vulnerable in society. References 1.

Of particular importance is data sharing across national borders. The evolution of deep space science resulted from global data sharing that helps researchers discover blackholes using hundreds of radio-telescopes set up all over the world. In medi-cine, on a positive note, infectious disease research initiatives including Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness ( GLOPID-R ) and Infec- tious Disease Data Observatory (IDDO ) are advocating for global data sharing to improve diagnosis and treat- ment of patients and to ensure coordinated and eec- tive responses to emerging infections and cross-border threats to health.1The International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC ) found that nearly 80% of rare disease researchers who responded to itssurvey had experience of sharing data internationally.Why are successful examples so rare in medicine? Reasons include intra- and extra-territorial factors; coordination failure among dierent ministries responsible for health care and medicine under heavy bureaucracy, siloed systems of electronic healthrecords within individual nations, conflicts and compe- tition for medical research resources among individualresearchers and industrial sectors all over the world, etc. In these circumstances, how can we utilise global data sharing to fast-track medical R&D and achieve healthy longevity all over the world? Super-ageing is one of the biggest issues for global health which, sooner or later, most of countries will experience. As predicted previously 2, the competition for resources dictated by free-market principles will bethe undoing of the medical commons. Sooner or later, most of countries will need to adopt global mecha-nisms to foster innovative ideas raised by young investigators and to catalyse them within the private sectors and to share challenging experiences between preceding super-ageing nations and younger nations. We cannot otherwise guarantee sustainability. An area of global importance is the ageing of the popu- lation. It is predicted that by 2050, 1.6 billion or 18% of the world's population will be over 60 years old. This is associated with a global decrease in fertility rates. In Japan, around the time of the Meiji Restoration (1868), only 20% of Japan's population was over 50 years old and that percentage remained more or less unchanged until the 1970s. The Japanese population started to age rapidly around then, however, introducing universal health coverage, the eradication of major infectious dis- eases and rapid economic growth had the combined eect of increasing life expectancy and reducing fertility rates inexorably. Japan has, thus, now become a super- aged society and the trend is continuing: By the 2040s, an unprecedented ultra-super-ageing demographic drift will reach its peak with only 35% of the population being under 50 according to the prediction by Dr Toshihiko Hasegawa. In 2019, now that this great population shift has already advanced two-thirds of the way through this great transition phase, Japan has only two decades in which to nd eective solutions to ensure healthy longevity by the time it reaches the ageing peak. It should be noted that developing the drugs and medical devices needed for any such solutions takes time. If we consider the likelihood that many other countries willalso begin to age rapidly in the next few decades, global sharing of data and values on comprehensive medical/environmental/social studies for healthy longevity are indispensable to achieving sustainabilityData linkage and sharing for healthy longevity together present a global challenge, in the view of Prof Makoto Suematsu and Prof Victor J Dzau, Co-chairs of Global Future Council for Human Enhancement and Longevity at the World Economic ForumASIA FOCUS 47of human health. A good practice to follow in the global sharing of data would be the Alzheimer's Disease Neu- roimaging Initiative (ADNI) project3, which has strict rules designed to encourage sharing of collected data among its members including both public and private researchinstitutions. The super-ageing of populations might serve as a huge opportunity to promote a so-called silver market for human wellness. At the meeting of the Global Future Council (GFC) on Human Enhancement and Longevity held in Dubai during November 2018, the Councilorganised the four workstreams for healthy longevity researches: \"Understanding needs of the elderly to fully leverage the opportunities of the silver market\",\"Ethics, equity and governance of an ageing world population\", \"Appreciating the human capital of older adults and developing human capital for the care of older adults\" and \"Global data sharing\". Countries oering public funding to R&D projects on healthy longevity should make it a condition that the resulting data be shared internationally after an appropriate waiting period. Such discussion was further galvanised at the Davos-Kloster meeting in January 2019, as exem- plied by Prime Minister Abe's speech proposing \"Data Free-Flow with Trust\" for medical and industrial R&D purposes, while the privacy of the individuals' health data should be suciently secured. Data linkage and sharing among dierent health care stakeholders may provide numerous benets for healthy longevity. The decline in the physical functionsof the elderly patients is not steady but staggered and is typically precipitated by hospitalisation for acute diseases. Accumulating clinical data on ageing patientswith acute illness can facilitate more detailed monitoring of this trend and help to optimise medical care services. Nursing care for the elderly is another area that could benet from data sharing. One promising approach in this regard is human enhancement using biomedical technologies to augment the physical/mental capabilities and health of those that are weakened with age. Some human enhancement technologies have widely been adopted, including interocular cataract lens (IOL) implants, bipolar hiparthroplasty (BHA) for osteoarthritis and pacemaker implantation for heart failure patients. The developmentof more ambitious enhancement technologies will require the comprehensive use of new materials, robotics, articial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology and among others, together with the continued collection and analysis of clinical data for fast-trackingnext-generation silver R&D. Unlike established medical procedures to treat diseases and restore mental and physical functions which are approved following clinical trials with middle-aged participants, further application of human enhancement technologies for the overall improvement of health and well-being for the elderly will require careful considera- tion of many issues. Human enhancement technologies that are physically and/or psychologically invasive must be demonstrably safe to use for the elderly, just like any medical procedures. Invasive human enhancement technologies are ultimately a means to complement the users' physical and/or mental functions and to improve their health. A survey by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) on the application of human enhancement technologies revealed that of approxi- mately 2,000 adult respondents, over 90% supported Authors (Left to right) Makoto Suematsu (Co-chair), Victor J Dzau (Co-chair), Janneke Annegarn and Linda P FriedASIA FOCUS 48the use of the technologies to regain normal physical and mental functions, including sight recovery and joint replacement. However, the respondents did notapprove of applying the technologies to acquire exceptional or superhuman abilities, such as sharper cognition (memory) or increased muscular strength. 4As this survey demonstrates, there is a public awareness that human enhancement technologies have the poten- tial to allow us to overstep our limitations, which couldchange the very foundation of society and humanity as we conventionally see them. Such adaptation and tolerance levels might dier among dierent countrieswith dierent cultural backgrounds. \"The number of Alzheimer's patients around the world has doubled in the past 26 years.8 Deaths from Alzheimer's disease increased 148% in the same period, making it the fifth leading cause of death. Since the supply of available medical resources is finite and increasingly constrained, we need to employ far more powerful mechanisms for data linkage and sharing in order to conquer Alzheimer's disease.\" Maximising the potential benets of global data link-age and sharing will initially give rise to many dicult multi-factorial challenges: the rst and the most impor- tant challenge is the fact that the European Union (EU)general data protection regulation (GDPR) has now extraterritorial impacts. GDPR holds data controllers accountable for multiple principles as follows; collectionlimitation, data quality, purpose specication and use limitation, security safeguards, openness and nally individual participation. When handling personal human data, we need novel information technology to achieve global data sharing in accordance with GDPR principles. New approaches to consent management or dynamic consent 5,6that allow individual participants to consent or not have been trialled in the UK and EU and by global organisations including Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), while their social implementation will require a bit more time. Second, it is necessary to build public funding frameworks and a consensus policy of \"no share, no budget\" among funding agencies around the world.7Integration of dif- ferent databases/knowledgebases supported by public funding should be facilitated under such a policy. Researchers who benet from public funding should waive their claims to priority access and willingly sharea signicant part of their unpublished research data for the benet of patients and ultimately, the benet of all people. The third challenge is data linkage. Besides successful examples in Estonia, Finland and Denmark, countries with populations greater than 10 million experience diculties in forming links among many domestic knowledgebases. Japan has a huge National Database (NDB) which aims to collect the whole-nation informa- tion on individual patients' medical care and costs. Currently, tight regulation exists limiting the use of the data for academic and commercial purposes. NDB includes a huge amount of information on pharmaceu- ticals, medical devices and other medical treatments carried out by physicians in all hospitals and out-patient clinics in Japan as a function of lifetime until death. In May 2019, under enactment of the new law, the Min- istry of Health Labor and Welfare decided to connect the NDB and the Long-term Care Insurance database (LCIDB). For more than 20 years, LCIDB has accumu- lated full data on those who are more than 65 yearsold and require nursing support from the government. In the future, the link between NDB and LCIDB will lead to a better understanding of how a person's history of medical interventions relates to their eventual medicaloutcomes or quality of life. Such database linkage might give rise to concerns among the data subjects that research discovery may show linkage of multiple diseases and its misuse by insurance companies. However, the data linkage benets strategic planning for healthy longevity by allowing analyses of activities of daily living (ADL) and patients and families' burdensfor nursing care and investigation of the linkage with past medical cares received by the individual elderly patients. Integral and quantitative analyses of the real-world data of medical and nursing care data will not only allow us to optimise the balance between medical and nursing costs but also to reveal unmetneeds for nursing care that will galvanise nursing R&D. The number of Alzheimer's patients around the world has doubled in the past 26 years. 8Deaths from Alzheimer's disease increased 148% in the same period, making it the fth leading cause of death. Since the supply of available medical resources is nite and increasingly constrained, we need to employ far more powerful mechanisms for data linkage and sharing inASIA FOCUS 49order to conquer Alzheimer's disease. Recent multina- tional studies providing a robust staging system of Ab accumulation that may be useful for monitoring patients throughout the course of AD exemplied critical roles of ADNI database consisting of 18F-florbetapir PET imagingas well as availability of gene expression informationfrom Allen Human Brain Atlas database. 9,10,11 Another important aspect of global data sharing that is challenging yet needs to be explored is cooperation with the private sector - especially with private entities that are pursuing human enhancement to achievehealthy longevity. The experiences and values gained in present-day Japan must inform future design for other countries which will follow in its ageing footsteps. Healthy longevity for all people is a grand challenge requiring activation and collaboration among young multidisciplinary researchers all over the world and this is reflected in the launch of the U.S. National Acad - emy of Medicine's Grand Challenge in Healthy Longevity . The establishment of a global data linkage and sharing for healthy longevity has the promise to bring major changes to the silver medical R&D. TheGFC members hope that this message will prove to be the rst step toward making such a scheme a reality for quality of healthy longevity. References and notes 1 GDPR Art. 9.

A variety of growth factors play indispensable roles in the development and regen- eration of tissues. Tissues and organsin our body have an ability to, more or less, regenerate following injury and diseases, in which growth factors sup- port the intrinsic ability to regenerate. Growth factors not only govern cell growth but also powerfully promote cell survival, cell migration, and tissue formation at extremely low concentra- tions, and therefore have great poten- tial as biological drugs for therapeutic use. Several kinds of recombinant growth factors are used for treatment of patients. Hepatocyte growth factor Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was discovered as a growth promoting factor for hepatocytes. HGF affects the cell by binding to its cell mem- brane-spanning receptor, MET. Like a key, HGF binds to MET as a keyhole in highly specific manner, which leads to activation of MET receptor. The MET receptor is expressed in a variety of cells such as hepatocytes, neurons, gastrointestinal cell, skin cells, etc. Dr Kunio Matsumoto, Professor, Nano Life Science Institute and Cancer Research Institute at Kanazawa University, Japan, has spent much of his career investigating HGF. He also started a venture to facilitate clinicaldevelopment of recombinant HGF for therapeutic purpose. Double-blind, randomised and placebo-controlled clinical trials have been progressed fortreatment of patients with spinal cord injury (phase-I/II) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (phase-II). Macrocyclic peptides Kunio has extended research through cross-disciplinary collabora- tion with Dr Hiroaki Suga, Professor, Graduate School of Science at the University of Tokyo. Hiroaki originally established an innovative technology \"RaPID (Random nonstandard Peptide Integrated Discovery)\" system which enables to discover cyclic peptides against pharmaceutical targets. Peptides and proteins are both com- posed of amino acids, while peptides are much smaller than proteins. In RaPID system, peptide library withdiversity over 10 13is screened as binders to a target protein and smallpeptides with circular structure com- posed of 10-15 amino acids are finally obtained. Kunio and Hiroaki co-worked to discover the artificial HGF composed of cyclic peptides capable of activating the MET receptor (see figure 1). The synthetic HGF shows biological activi- ties equivalent to native HGF, indicating the creation of almost perfect synthetic HGF. Recombinant growth factor drugs can be replaced by synthetic growth factors in future, which enables a much lower cost-performance.Using cross-disciplinary technology, Dr Kunio Matsumoto, PhD, Professor at Kanazawa University in Japan is extending research on growth factor toward synthetic biologics for regeneration-based medicine and cancer theranosticsBioScience: Connecting Nature diagnosis and therapeutics Biological pathways often have an important role in more than one pro- cess. Processes that are essential for normal physiology are hijacked by dis- eases such as cancer. The same path- ways that are critically important for recovery from tissue injury or other diseases can assist tumour growth. HGF promotes the regeneration and reconstruction of damaged tissues, however, cancer cells commandeer the HGF-MET pathway to promotetheir own spread. HGF-MET pathway activation leads to an increase in the cell's ability to grow and move in its environment, i.e., spreading. Likewise, HGF-MET pathway activation leads to an increase in the cell's ability to sur- vive even in a stressed condition. Thus, HGF causes cancer cells to become both more invasive/metastatic andmore resistant to anticancer drugs. Kunio commented: \"We have a two- pronged approach for the clinicalapplication of HGF. One is the use of HGF and synthetic HGF as regenera- tion-based therapy for treatment ofdiseases to facilitate regeneration of tissues. The other is use of an inhibitor and/or a probing molecule of HGF for cancer detection and inhibition.\" Using RaPID screening system, the col- laborating group by Kunio and pep-tide-8 (HiP-8) (see figure 2). HiP-8 com- posed of 12 amino acids binds to HGF with outstanding selectivity and affin- ity. Once HiP-8 binds to HGF, HGF cannot bind to the MET receptor. Highly selective ability of HiP-8 to bind HGF was tested to check its potential as a molecular probe for positron- emission tomography (PET) imaging diagnosis in preclinical model. HiP-8was excellently accumulated in cancer tissue wherein HGF levels were higher, indicating non-invasive visualization of HGF-positive cancer. In 2017, a new project for the Nano Life Science Institute (NanoLSI) at Kanazawa University was selected as a project in the World Premier Interna- tional Research Center Initiative (WPI program) by the Japanese government.Kunio is also working in this new project. The goal of WPI-NanoLSI is to bridge expertise in bioscience and scanning probe microscopy such as high-speed atomic force microscopy (AFM), world-leading technologies developed at Kanazawa University. By using high-speed AFM, Kunio's team succeeded to observe a movie for dynamic change in HGF before andafter HiP-8 binding. The molecular shape of HGF was dynamically chang-ing, but it was suppressed by HiP-8. Asmall molecule inhibits dynamic move- ment of a large molecule.

In this article, I will be looking at the impact on society when it comes to the move towards mobile health- care with medical- internet of things (IoT)1, technology trends, as well as an interesting example of an electrocar- diogram (ECG) and my thoughts on what the future could hold in this exciting field of research. The impact of medical devices on society To achieve better medical services with early diagnosis and early therapy, inno- vative solutions for preventative medicine have been continuously investigated and promoted to both medical centres and local clinics. One of the major driving forces in exploring these solutions for mobile healthcare is to allow limited medical resources for those patients who demand in-time treatment and medical care under the coverage of national health insurancein Taiwan. Furthermore, both medical teams and the general public need to be re-edu- cated before these new diagnosis/ther- apy solutions and inherent service models can be accepted. And even some governmental regulations have to be re-adjusted or added to allow these solutions to be deployed for practical usage. Technology trends The advances in wireless devices and miniaturised sensors fuel the possibil-ities of mobile healthcare applications, where medical-internet of things (M-IoT) devices are body-worn or implanted for continuous vital signal recording. To extend the M-IoT moni- toring duration, on-sensor biomedical signal processors (BSPs) can be appliedto timely extract the critical informa- tion for reduced storage and transmis- sion data. Considering the supportgiven to versatile applications with maximised monitoring time, the BSPs should be flexible and accurate with extremely low power operation. In addition, single-type sensor or sensor- fusion solutions should be developed as well to generate valid bio-datasets for follow-up health conditions analy- sis. Data screening is key to enhance prediction accuracy and avoid false alarm in practical usage. Finally, data security to protect privacy leakage and personal identification to secure the quality of service should be taken into account in these M-IoT devices. An example on an electrocardiogram (ECG) An application scenario on an electro- cardiogram (ECG) for heart disease prediction is illustrated in the following figure. To meet the requirements of mobile healthcare applications, a spe- cific M-IoT device is demanded with enhanced energy-efficiency so that it can be operated for more than one week with one chargeable battery. In the meantime, the device should besmall enough to allow user-friendlywearable usage. Thus, a specific chip needs to be designed to cover the fol- lowing functions, namely signal acqui- sition, feature extraction, syndrome classification. In addition, data security and personal identification have to be covered as well. Wireless transmission can be leveraged by those commercial solutions, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth depending on how this M-IoT is deployed and used. A preliminary IRB clinical trial based on this M-IoT on the prediction of both arrhythmia and myocardial infarction with accuracy over 95% have been reported. If sensor-fusion is further exploited to cover ECG, vectorcardiogram (VCG), and phonocardiogram (PCG), it is believed that prediction accuracy can be further improved. There are two issues to be further illustrated to avoid false alarm in prac- tical usage. One is the input signal quality and data validation: this is a very important issue if the input signal has been affected by environmental noises, such as those from power-line, skin contact drift, motion artefact, etc. Different methods have been investi- gated to reduce these noise sources so that signal to noise level can be fur- ther improved. However, these noise- reduction methods may also induce human-made extra noises to signal sources, leading to worse prediction accuracy and even higher false alarmrates. As a result, new approaches to screen out valid datasets from sourceA move towards mobile healthcare with medical-internet of things (IoT) devices is placed under the spotlight here in an insightful piece from Prof D. Chen-Yi Lee from Department of Electronics Engineering, at the National Chiao Tung University in TaiwanTowards mobile healthcare with medical-internet of things (IoT) devices 52PROFILEsignals should be further studied. The other issue is datasets collection from clinical trials. The sample volumes should be large enough to cover dif- ferent test conditions in model train- ing phase so that prediction accuracy can be accepted in practical usage. This is very important when M-IoT devices are to be deployed in different test scenarios. However, one problem often encoun- tered is the limited datasets collected for model training, especially in medi- cal diagnosis based on the data-driven approach. Even test samples and pro- cedures have been well defined and planned but it's still hard to cover all test conditions and, hence, prediction accuracy may vary a lot in practical usage. As a result, new approaches toward autonomous learning at the M-IoT device level should be further explored to enhance prediction accu- racy and make it reliable for mobile healthcare applications. A glimpse into the future Lastly and by no means least, it is believed that with the advances taking place in M-IoT devices, including both sensing capability and autonomous learning, the penetration rate will become much fast than it is today. These new M-IoT devices, together with data-driven operation infrastruc- ture currently under construction, will definitely provide better medical ser- vices to society. As a result, the general public will benefit more from a one- stop service platform to lead a betterlife while enjoying the advantagesoffered by those M-IoT devices, both developed and under development.

OPINION.AsIA focus 56Medical devices policy: Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare Nemoto Takumi (1)served as the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare from 2nd October 2018 until 11 September 2019. (2)Katsunobu Kat is currently in this role (3,4). In this article, we will briefly examine one key policy of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), that concerns pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Pharmaceuticals and medical devices On pharmaceuticals and medical devices, we know that MHLW put together the \"Strategy of SAKIGAKE\" by a project team at the Ministry to lead the world in the practical application of innovative medical products. This team plans strategies from basic research to thepractical applications along with related divisions within the MHLW. SAKIGAKE also covers approval reviews, insurance coverage, improvement of infra- structure and the environment for corporate activities, safety measures, as well as global expansion. SAKIGAKE can be summarised as follows: SAKIGAKE Designation System: Promoting research and development in the country aimed at early practical application for medical devices, innovative pharmaceu- tical products and regenerative medicines. Scheme for Rapid Authorization of Unapproved Drugs: This aspect concerns accelerating the practical application of unapproved/o-label use of drugs for serious and life-threatening diseases to include use in Western countries if it satises certain conditions. Improving the environment for companies to under- take the development of such drugs is, therefore, vital in this vein. (5) It is tting that we now take a look at the \"International Pharmaceutical Regulatory Harmonization Strategy -Regulatory Science Initiative\" of the MHLW. In essence, this strategy claries Japan's policy priorities in the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors, for exam- ple, to more eectively promote international harmon- isation and cooperation initiatives under the direction of the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare, who as from September 2019 is Katsunobu Kat and before that, Nemoto Takumi. \"In August this year, the Medical Equipment Examination Management Division within MHLW approved the target items of the \"remanufacturing\" system for single-use medical devices, for the first time. We know that MHLW collects used single-use medical devices under the responsibility of medical device manufacturers and distributors, for example. In 2017, the Ministry established laws and regulations to create a system for replacement, reassembly, sterilisation, so that medical devices can be used again.\" It is also worth noting here that this strategy aims to show Japan's proactive leadership in the region of Asia and throughout the global community. Policies withinthis include setting up the \"Asian Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Regulatory Training Center\" within the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) (6) to promote pharmaceutical regulations in Japan by regulatory authority ocials in Asia. (7) On the subject of harmonisation, Yasuhiro Fujiwara, MD, PhD, Chief Executive of the PMDA looks to the organisation playing an active role in discussions con- cerning international harmonisation of regulations and he wants to raise standards at Asian and other regula- tory authorities. \"Without being bound by precedents, the PMDA will proactively pursue new initiatives andHere, we look at medical devices policy of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The Ministry now has Katsunobu Kat in place, who very recently replaced Nemoto Takumi as the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare in the countryASIA FOCUS 57contribute to the advancement of the public health and safety of all people in Japan,\" he added. (8) In August this year, the Medical Equipment Examination Management Division within MHLW approved the target items of the \"remanufacturing\" system for single-use medical devices, for the rst time. We know that MHLW collects used single-use medical devices under the responsibility of medical device manufactur- ers and distributors, for example. In 2017, the Ministry established laws and regulations to create a system for replacement, reassembly, sterilisation, so that medical devices can be used again. (9) As Katsunobu Kat is now the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan, we wish him well in his recently acquired position as he pushes forward a wide array of policy issues of which pharmaceuticals and medical devices are just a very small part.

This is not only possible with the familiar voices of family members and friends, but also with the voices of unfamiliar people. Therefore, it is expected that the voice has some characteristics that change depending on one's physical condition. Apart from clinical diseases in the field of otolaryngology, which directly affects the voice, it has long been pointed out that patients with other conditions, including depression, have a characteristic qual- ity to their voice (Newman et al., 1938). Over time, attempts have been made to objectively evaluate speechcharacteristics specific to these diseases. \"Taking a slightly different approach, we focused on the reduction in emotion expression that manifests when a person is stressed or depressed and developed the application 'MIMOSYS (Mind Monitoring System)', which automatically monitors the mental health of the owner of the smartphone from their voice during conversations on the smartphone (Tokuno et al., 2018).\" Initial research involved analysis of the speaking rate, switching pause and pause rate in patients with depression (Weintraub et al., 1967).Then, with the development of com- puters, research began on analysis of the basic frequency of speech (Nilsonne et al., 1988) and analysis offormant frequencies formed by reso- nance when the vocal cord vibrations pass through the vocal tract (Flint et al., 1993). Recent changes in the human-machine interface have increased the opportu-nity for humans to operate devices using voice activation; in other words, there have been increased opportuni- ties to capture speech with devices. Therefore, attention has been focused on research attempting to use speech as biomarkers and the latest researchShinichi Tokuno from the Department of Voice Analysis of Pathophysiology, Graduate School of Medicine, at the University of Tokyo, lifts the lid on voice analysis technology for healthcareHealthcare early detection technology: Voice analysis technology 58PROFILE has made it possible to move beyond simple frequency analysis, with research flourishing in fields that make full use of computers such as machine learning and deep learning (Fang et al., 2018). \"It is possible to tell from a person's voice that he or she is unwell. This is not only possible with the familiar voices of family members and friends, but also with the voices of unfamiliar people. Therefore, it is expected that the voice has some characteristicsthat change depending on one's physical condition.\" Unlike biomarkers obtained from other specimens, voice analysis is cost-effective because it does not require special devices or reagents and it can be measured repeatedly using non-invasive and simple methods. Therefore, it can be used not only for screening but also for household monitoring, which may enable early detection of disease. Taking a slightly different approach, we focused on the reduction in emotion expression that manifests when a person is stressed or depressed and developed the app - lication 'MIMOSYS (Mind Monitoring System)', which automatically moni- tors the mental health of the owner of the smartphone from their voice during conversations on the smart- phone (Tokuno et al., 2018). This system is based on voice Sensibility Technology (ST), which captures emotions from changes in the basic frequency of the voice. MIMOSYS calculates 'Vitality', which is the degree of mental health, from the percentage of emotion within the measured conversation by ST. As Vitality varies significantly depending on the content of the conversation and the other party in the conversation, we devisedthe indicator of 'Mental Activity' based on variations in Vitality over a two- week period and the mean Vitality over that period. We verified this Vitality and Mental Activity with more than 10,000 people in a variety of situations and confirmed its effective- ness. That is, Mental Activity accurately showed the user's mental fluctua-tions; in other words, it showed thetrends in the degree of stress. The algorithm we developed has already been commercialised for industrial medicine in Japan and applications using our algorithm have been pre - installed in a number of smartphones for personal use. Currently, we are adding a function for analysing set phrases read aloud for users who do not make many telephone calls and we are verifying the effectiveness of these applications in multiple lang - uages. In addition to health applica- tions, we are also considering other applications such as mental healthcare for athletes. MIMOSYS is mediated via emotion, so it makes human-like judgements, but it is difficult to capture subtle changes between different diseases. Therefore, we are also attempting methods that compare voice characteristics directly, without using emotions. We have already achieved results for depression, Parkinson's disease and dementia and we are working on expanding the application to other diseases. As stated above, voice biomarkers have a broad range of applications and they have great potential. References Newman SS, et al. (1938).

During the research of developing an extracorporeal circulation simulator, we found that there is a certain operating condition in the operation of a simulator by an extracorporeal circulation engineer. We are currently developing a semi-automated circula-tion control system for a heart-lung machine. Many issues needed to beaddressed in the field of extracorpo- real circulation when I was in graduate school. Here are some examples. Why is extracorporeal circulation necessary? A cardiopulmonary bypass device is used only when the heart is stopped but should it be used only to maintain blood circulation? Are there any other less-invasive methods? Per- fect manual operation can be sound good if it reflects a personalised pro- cedure. However, if the operation of a cardiopulmonary bypass device is car- ried out under circumstances where unified safety awareness is not estab- lished, the procedure can only be worrisome. We had an opportunity to discuss with researchers in the cogni- tive science field and concluded that there is too much information to grasp even though a cardiopulmonary bypass device is a critical system. I believe that the system has a part in which humans can operate and a partin which a machine should operate as a system. When I was developing the extracorpo- real circulation simulator, I observed hundreds of examples of perfusionists manipulation for the perfusion technique. I noticed that there was a basic operation procedure based on a trend graph obtained from the extra- corporeal circulation simulator. It is necessary to operate the simulator according to the surgeon's instruction during open-heart surgery. Also, it is essential to adjust the operating conditions as necessary while managing the progress of thesurgery. Since cardiopulmonary bypass devices replace the heart during the surgery, discontinuation of a blood delivery pump never happens. Based on the above situation, I thought of systemising blood deliveryso that blood delivery can be main- tained. The basic algorithm has been completed already at this point. The primary objective of this study is to systemise blood circulation during open-heart surgery and to maintain safe blood circulation. It has been 60 years since the cardiopulmonary bypass device was established. However, few changes have made in the device and the device is mostly manually operated. Although the device has the potential to be auto- mated, it has not been put into real use. I believe that there must be areasthat can be automated. Cardiopulmonary bypass is a critical system to substitute for the heart. Therefore, errors that can be pre- vented should be able to be replaced by a device system. However, complete automation of the system is consid- ered difficult. Maybe a specialised engineer can manually perform the adjustment of a suction circuit according to the surgical process asnecessary. As I mentioned previously, an operation of the current cardiopul- monary bypass device is cumber- some. There are several procedures which require manual involvement. I think that such procedures should be conducted manually because such procedures require coordination with the surgical processes. On the other hand, it is possible to safely control blood flow automatically using multi- ple monitors in the main blood circuit that is responsible for blood circula- tion. The number of cardiopulmonary bypass device-related accidents has hardly decreased. Improvements in technology have reduced the numberof breakdowns of component parts. However, errors caused by the opera- tors and by miscommunication between staff members are evident. The number of patients with heart failure is increasing in Japan. Novel technologies have been developed and less invasive techniques are available. However, the number of cases where surgery was performed by switching back to a cardiopulmonary bypass device has been increasingAsako Tokumine, PhD, Assistant Professor at Kindai University explains her work in developing a new cardiopulmonary bypass system 60PROFILE Developing a semi-automated circulation system for cardiopulmonary bypassdue to the fear of using a new technique. A cardiopulmonary bypass system is a critical system. Therefore, I believe that extracorporeal circula- tion operation should be performed safely with certain standards no matter who operates it. The basic algorithm has been completed. We will go into a verification process next, although there are several problems. The first issue is the blood reservoir. In research-level experiments, a water tank has been used to resemble the blood reservoir. However, the current blood reservoir needs to be improved in order to be used in an actual clinical setting. A continuous measurement cannot be performed with the current bloodreservoir. I recently found an idea for reservoir level measurement. It may be possible to solve it. A blood deliv- ery pump gradually increases blood flow after turning on a switch of the cardiopulmonary bypass device. Vari- ous signals involved in the operationof the device are utilised for the input so that air will never be mistakenly delivered to a patient. The machine can also respond to both abnormal blood delivery pressure and blood leakage. Operation of the device should be conducted in coordination with the surgical field. It may become possible to control the cardiopul- monary bypass device in the surgical field using a controller installed in the surgical field if this method is applica- ble. A basic algorithm was developedin 2018. Thus, we are still at the begin- ning stage. We will conduct operation verification in the future and events that the algorithm cannot handle will be addressed as necessary. I believe that highly invasive proce-dures, such as a procedure requiring cardiac arrest will certainly decrease within the next ten years. However, procedures which require blood circu- lation to be arrested will not be zero either. I believe that a cardiopulmonary bypass device will be automaticallyoperated far more safely in the next ten years. It will be possible not only to increase the safety of operation but also the safety of patients.

It is very common worldwide, affecting as much as 50% of the global population. Moreover, the disease has been shown to be associated with various systemic diseases, including, cardio- vascular diseases, diabetes, preterm birth, pulmonary disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory lesion induced and maintained by the polymicrobial biofilm formed on teeth, according to the polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis hypothesis. In recent years, microbiome analysisand animal models of periodontal dis- ease have led researchers to propose the hypothesis that Porphyromonas gingivalisis a keystone pathogen in causing dysbiosis of the dental plaque bacterial The periodontal gingivalis P . gingivalis , a proteases like gingipains, and lipopolysaccharides. the poly-merization of fimbrilins on the bacte- rial surface. They play a pivotal role in P . gingivalis colonization, invasion,establishment, persistence within the host, and evasion from immune system destruction. P . gingivalis typi- cally expresses two different types of fimbriae, FimA and Mfa1. FimA and Mfa1 fimbriae are primarily com- posed of polymers of the FimA and Mfa1 proteins encoded by the fimA gene and the mfa1gene, respectively. In addition to structural proteins, mature FimA and Mfa1 fimbriae contain the accessory proteins, FimC-E and Mfa3-5, respectively. However, the structure and biogenesis mechanisms of both fimbriae have not been closely examined.Structure and biogenesis mechanism of Mfa1 fimbriae Since 2007, we have been the structure biogenesis mecha- nism of Mfa1 have deter- mined the mature Mfa1 fimbria is generated via an mfagene cluster Mfa1, Mfa2, Mfa3, of Mfa2-Mfa5, the defi- cient mutant strains of these genes were constructed. In our results, we found that the main shaft portion consists of Mfa1, while Mfa2 is located in the basal portion of the fimbriae and functions as an anchor and an assembly and elongation terminator. Professor Yoshiaki Hasegawa, Aichi Gakuin University, Department of Microbiology, School of Dentistry, discusses the structure and biogenesis mechanism of Mfa1 fimbriae from A depiction of P. gingivalis fimbrae on the cell surface. (B) An illustration showing Mfa1 fimbriae of P. gingivalis. Mfa1 fimbriae Mfa3, Mfa4 and Mfa5. (C) The mfa gene cluster in the P. gingivalis chromosome. Modified from (Hasegawa et al. JDR. 2016)In addition, Mfa3 is localised in the distal tip portion of the Mfa1 fimbriae, and thus may play a role as a ligand to receptors on host cells and other oral bacteria. Mfa3, Mfa4, and Mfa5 all participate in the assembly of an accessory protein complex on the tips of fimbriae. Mfa5, which contains a C- terminal domain and von Willebrand factor type A domain, is translocated to the cell surface by the Type 9 secre- tion system. Our proposed a structure model of Mfa1 fimbria is shown in Figure 1. \"In recent years, microbiome analysis and animal models of periodontal disease have led researchers to propose the hypothesis that Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen in causing dysbiosis of the dental plaque bacterial flora.\" Benefits of our project Since the protein located at the tip of the fimbria often functions as an actual adhesion in fimbriae of many pathogenic bacteria, it is thought that the tip proteins of Mfa1 fimbria of P . gingivalis play an important role in the colonization of periodontal tissue. If we are able to identify the binding partner of the tip accessory proteins of Mfa3-5, we will be able to reveal the colonization mechanism of this bacterium. Furthermore, this information would allow us to devise a new therapeutic strategy for the prevention of colonization. In the future, we hope to lead in the development of locally administered treatments, such as drugs or peptides that can inhibit the function of P . gingivalis fimbria. These treatments could be applied after pro- fessional mechanical tooth cleaning, such as scaling by a dentist. We hope that the results of these research projects will lead to the development of new therapeutic and preventive drugs for periodontal disease targeting Mfa1 fimbriae of P . gingivalis . Recently, Xu et al. (2016) clarified the crystal structure and polymerisation mechanism of a group of proteins which predominantly exist in human microbiomes and are presumed to be a fimbrilin of class Bacterioidia (of which P . gingivalis is also a member). In addition, the fimbrae of this family did not belong to any current type of bacterial fimbriae (type I to IV) and were, therefore, classified as V-type fimbriae. We hope that by exploring these research avenues, future research will be able to lead the devel- opment of a new treatment strategy that controls the bacterial flora inhabiting the intestinal tract.

Through JSN's International Committee, relationships with bodies such as the American Society of Nephrology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis & Transplant Association have been strengthened, while ties with other Asian countries are being consolidatedthrough the Asian Forum of Chronic Kidney Disease Initiative. The Japanese Society of Nephrology (JSN) carries out investigations and research concerning all aspects of medicine, health and treatment related to the kidneys in order to improve public knowledge and advanceacademic achievement. The kidneys play a vital role in keeping the blood clean by excreting waste materials into the urine. They also help to maintain body fluid volume and pH (acidity or alkaline) of the blood. Furthermore, the kidneys secrete a hematopoietic hormone, improve anaemia and are involved in the metabolism of calcium and phosphorous. The main elds of nephrology are concerned with investigating the structure and function of the kidneys; to search for the causes of symptoms such as proteinuria, hematuria or edema and renal function deterioration observed in clinical practice; to actively treat kidney disorders; and to provide renal replacement therapy, such as haemodialysis, peritonealdialysis or transplantation, for patients for havedeveloped end-stage renal disease. The JSN's mission is to support those working in nephrology by holding regular meetings to act as a forum for the diusion of information, producing journals, coordinating clinical research, promoting cooperation with related bodies in Japan and internationally, and proving recognition to those who have made signicant contributions to the eld. The JSN currently has over 10,000 members. Dr Naoki Kashihara of Kawasaki Medical University has been President of the organisation since June 2016. \"We believe that research to overcome diseases develops gradually, not via a simple course, but along a more convoluted pathway. On behalf of the whole organisation, I am determined to make progress step-by-step, without delay, and with the expectationand the objective of educating the next generation,\" Dr Kashihara wrote on the JSN website. The Japanese Society of Nephrology engages in a wide range of activities to, including research, developing human resources, providing lifelong education and disseminating knowledge to the public, to tackle kidney disease and promote health, as we find out here 65To facilitate this progress, the JSN is developing a ve-year plan to dene its future activities focusing on the key areas of: strategy and medical policy; basic research; clinical research; education and development of human resources; internationalisation; and local contribution and industry-university collaboration. A key pillar of the ve-year plan will be a greater focus on increasing diversity and promoting gender equality. In addition, to support collaboration between the dierent workforces in the clinical eld, the JSN will launch the Certied Nephrology Nurse course to strengthen the integration of general nurses, dieticians and pharmacists, and focus on nurturing a wide variety of next-generation career personnel who are not limited to being doctors. \"We believe that research to overcome diseases develops gradually, not via a simple course, but along a more convoluted pathway. On behalf of the whole organisation, I am determined to make progress step-by-step, without delay, and with the expectation and the objective of educating the next generation.\" One of the big concerns for the JSN is the declining international competitiveness of Japan's basic research,as indicated by a reduction in the number of papers from the country published in journals such as theJournal of the American Society of Nephrology andKidney International. To support basic research, the JSN will back education programmes and nurture young researchers, help to establish a virtual resource centre for renal biopsy and facilitate students studying abroad. It will also submit a ve-year proposal to the MHLW and the Japan Agency for Medical Research & Development highlighting the key issues to be resolved. In addition, the JSN will expand its database of renal disorder registration. The Japan Renal Biopsy Registry (J-RBR) is one of the largest renal biopsy registries in the world. The Japan Chronic Kidney Disease Database (J-CKD-DB) is a less labour-intensive database, containing more than 100,000 patients, which is used by the MHLW. Individual information on the J-CKD-DB will be linked to the J-RBR for complementary purposes.To improve the quality of nephology care, the JSN will build platforms with other stakeholders, including the MHLW, AMED and the Ministry of Education, Culture Sports, Science & Technology and consolidate connections through scientic programme workshops. Through JSN's International Committee, relationshipswith bodies such as the American Society of Nephrologyand the European Renal Association-European Dialysis & Transplant Association have been strengthened, while ties with other Asian countries are being consolidated through the Asian Forum of Chronic Kidney Disease Initiative. To support the development of new renal disorder treatment drugs, the JSN is establishing a newregulatory science research organisation together with the relevant ministries. In order to create ecient countermeasures, the JSN is creating joint committees with various other societies. The JSN has successfully expanded in recent years and will continue to pursue growth with the core mission of contributing to society at large. \"We need broad support, not only from the society members but also from citizens,\" Dr Kashihara said. \"For us to overcome renal disorders, it is essential that we work together with people from various elds. We anticipate that you will provide your understanding, cooperation and knowledge to further the JSN's mission.\" Open Access Government editorial@openaccessgovernment.org www.openaccessgovernment.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovASIA FOCUSThe kidneys are an important organ to maintain the home- ostasis of body fluids, regulation of blood pressure, body fluid volume,production of red blood cells and to keep bones strong and healthy. Remarkably, given the importance ofthe kidneys, it is entirely possible to live a full and healthy life with just one kidney. When the kidneys do not work as well as they should, this is referred to aschronic kidney disease (CKD) or chronic renal failure (CRF). CKD is a surprisingly common condition which is often associated with aging. According to theNational Kidney Foundation, 10% of the global population is affected by CKD, with more than 2 million people cur- rently receiving treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant. It is clearly a global health problem that has a high economic cost. While it is widely known that CKD is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is perhapsless well known that kidney failure can have significant negative impacts on the heart, brain, retinas and liver. Changes in inflammatory status in the plasma and kidneys in the rat chronic renal failure model To elucidate the relationships between inflammation and renal functions, the rats had 5/6 kidneys removed when they were 11-weeks old. Every four weeks, the rats were housed in anHere, Dr Masanori Katakura from the Laboratory of Nutritional Physiology, explains the importance of keeping the kidneys healthy, as well as the surprisingly common condition, chronic kidney disease (CKD) The importance of keeping the kidneys healthy 66 PROFILEindividual metabolic cage and their urine was collected for 24 hours. Six- teen weeks after surgery, plasma and kidneys were collected for biochemical and histological analysis. Urinary albu- min excretion was shown to be gradu- ally increasing in the renal failure group, as compared to the control sham group. Reactive oxygen levels and lipid peroxide levels in the kidney, however, did not differ at 16 weeks after surgery. Lipid peroxide levels in the plasma of the renal failure group significantly decreased compared with the control group at four weeks after surgery - but not in the plasma at 16 weeks. The negative correlation was found between creatinine clearance and lipid peroxide levels in plasma at 4 weeks after surgery. Tumour necro- sis factor (TNF)- and transforminggrowth factor (TGF)-1 levels in the kidney at 16 weeks significantly increased in the renal failure group compared with the control group. The positive correlation was found between creatinine clearance and IL-6. The negative correlation was found between creatinine clearance andTNF- or TGF-1. The positive correla- tion was between urinary albumin at 12 weeks and TGF-1. These results have indicated that inflammation an important factor to determine renal functions after that surgery takes place. Effects of chronic renal failure on cognitive function and neurogenesis in rats It is reported that the risk of dementia in dialysis patients is higher than that in healthy individuals. Iwata et al. recently reported a decline in CKD grade was associated with a faster rateof decline regardless of amyloidpathology in women (Alzheimer's Dement (NY). 12(4)765-774, 2018). However, the detailed mechanism underlying this relationship remains poorly understood. Our team exam- ined the cognitive function and behaviour of the rat renal failure models that were prepared by func- tion by removing the whole right kidney, the left kidney ligated one part of the renal artery and blocked the blood flow, using histological and behavioural tests. There was a decrease in creatinine clearance and an increase in urinary albumin excretion in the renal failure group compared to that of the control group. Five months following surgery, brainswere harvested and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde, following which frozen sections were prepared using a cryostat and subjected to fluorescent immunostaining (Ki67, Iba-1). The abundance of Ki67 positive cells, proliferating cells and Iba-1 positive cells which are expressed in monocyte or macrophage, in the hippocampus, was evaluated. The number of Ki67- positive cells in the hippocampus was lower in the renal failure group than in the control group. The number of Iba-1 positive cells in the hippocampus tended to increase in the renal failure group compared to the control group. Behavioural differences between the control group and the renal failure group were observed using the novel object cognitive test for the investiga- tion of learning and memory. The pro- portion of search time for the new object significantly decreased in the renal failure group compared to the control group, indicating a decline in learning and memory function in the renal failure group. These results havesuggested that increased inflammation in the hippocampus caused by chronic renal failure may suppress the number of new-born cells, called neurogenesis, in the hippocampus, resulting in reduced cognitive function. \"According to the National Kidney Foundation, 10% of the global population is affected by CKD, with more than 2 million people currently receiving treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant. It is clearly a global health problem that has a high economic cost.\" Through these experiments, we will clarify the relationship between the kidney and other organs and continue basic research to help reduce compli- cations due to the progression of renal failure. To keep the kidneys healthy leads to extending the healthy life expectancy.

(1) When it comes to ageing, this is an inescapable fact of life. Changes in the mind and body occur, of course, but many symptoms may be due to diseases that canbe remedied or treated. As such, the Elderly HealthService urges the elderly and their carers to be knowl- edgeable about normal ageing, so they can distinguish between disease and normal ageing and, therefore, ensure early and proper treatment for diseases. (2) The Elderly Health Service's website hosts a wealth of information about healthy ageing, with very useful sections on a healthy diet, mental health and relation-ships, for example. Another area they discuss is exercise, which they recommend for the elderly daily to improve both mental and physical health. Of course,this has to be tailored to the ability and target of the individual. For example, we nd out that for beginners who have not been doing any exercise, they mustbegin with an exercise of milder intensity and a shorter duration of around 10 to 15 minutes for every session. This approach reduces the risk of injury caused by progressing too fast and it is also underlined that each workout must start with a warm-up and stretching exercises, and nish with both cool-down and stretching exercises. Many questions about exercise are answered on the website of the Elderly Health Service, such as \"Which type of exercise is the best?\". The response given is that all exercise should be enjoyable, safe and not toostrenuous for the elderly. Certainly, it can be safer and more fun to exercise with friends rather than alone. Three main kinds of exercise are highly recommended: Aerobic exercise of moderate-intensity; Muscle-strengthening exercise and; Stretching exercise (and balance exercises). Also, we nd out that when it comes to what exercises are suitable for the elderly, these include walking, swimming, cycling on static bikes and tai chi. Concerning how much exercise an elderly person should do, at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise isrecommended per week. For instance, one way to dothis is 30 minutes daily for at least ve days per week. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests thatthe elderly should accumulate up to 300 minutes of exercise to gain health benets if the person is physically able to do so. Other exercise recommendations include those for patients with chronic diseases, on the condition that their health conditions are stable as assessed by pro- fessionals in the eld in terms of the relevant safety precautions. For example, diabetic patients can choose dierent kinds of exercise but they should be equipped with carbohydrate snacks like bread or biscuits in the event they are required. Besides, each exercise session should be conned to 20-60 minutes to avoid hypogly- caemia (a low blood sugar) (3)induced by prolonged exercise. Another good example to look at here is exer- cises for patients with osteoarthritis of the knees, indeed it is recommended by the Elderly Health Service in Hong Kong that they should choose exercises that impose relatively light loading to the joints, such asHong Kong's Elderly Health Service has an increasingly important role to play in improving primary healthcare of the elderly, as this article discovers, with a special focus on recommended exercise as one of the many elements to promote healthy ageing in individualsASIA FOCUS 69walking, swimming or tai chi. Having said that, it is advised that exercises involving walking up and down stairs, slopes or deep squatting must be avoided. (4) In conclusion, exercise is just one of many ways to encourage healthy ageing. Others include aspects of self-care (5), such as massage, foot care, coping with fatigue and assistive devices for daily living. You can also read in detail about elements of home safety (6), for example, advice on preventing falls or even how tobe prepared for winter. There is also a section on smoking and drinking (7), that includes information, such as the harm passive smoking does on an individ- ual, as well as how alcohol can harm your health. Exer-cise is a really good example of positive activity that the elderly benet from and it certainly encourages themto enjoy their later years and live a fruitful life.

Approximately 50 million people lived with dementia world-wide, and the prevalence is expected to surge continuously at a rate ofnearly 10 million new cases every year (World Health Organization, 2019). Although a range of care services has been developed to meet their com-plex care needs, the care competence of staff members, who play a key role in the quality of care, is gaining con- siderable attention. Literature has consistently advocated the importance of training and empowerment in preparing the staff in dementia care (Figueiredo, Barbosa, Benbow, Kingston, & LeMesurier, 2011). Hong Kong is facing a rising demand for dementia care due to the ageing population. A local survey revealed that dementia care is a challenging issue for staff in long-term care set- tings (Lee, Hui, Kng, & Auyeung, 2013).The recently released Mental Health Review Report by the Food and Health Bureau of the HKSAR government (2017) highlighted the need for capac- ity building and workforce training to ensure the quality of dementia care. However, relevant training is limited to long-term care and residential care services, and most of the attention isfocused on disease knowledge and skills in handling the challenging behaviours of people with dementia. Although a more structured training programme was recently developed for health and social care staff in com- munity care settings to support thenewly launched Dementia Community Support Scheme, the training is lim- ited to staff members who are directly involved in the service. Systematic reviews on studies on dementia care training concluded that didactic teach- ing and task-oriented activities on occasional sessions demonstrate lim- ited efficacy on staff care competence, especially on attitudinal change (Spector, Revolta, & Orrell, 2016; Surr & Gates, 2017). To address the urgent and extensive staff training needs in dementia care in Hong Kong, the Jockey Club Centrefor Positive Ageing (JCCPA) launched a three-year Best Practice in Dementia Care Programme between 2016 and 2019 in collaboration with the Demen- tia Services Development Centre (DSDC) of the University of Stirling, UK. This programme has been widely adopted in the UK and other Euro- pean countries over the past decade(DSDC, 2019). In the present project, this community-wide programme reached approximately 1,500 staff members from over 70 local non-gov- ernment organisations, includingcommunity and day care centres, res- idential care homes for the elderly and outreach teams in Hong Kong. Ini- tially, 17 experienced care profession- als in elderly care services received training from the DSDC. These train-ers then conducted training for 218 care professionals who committed to be facilitators in their own care set- tings or services to provide in-service training to colleagues. This training aimed to equip the facilitators withknowledge and proper caring attitude towards people with dementia as well as empower them with skills to provide guidance to their colleagues in their workplaces. To ensure holistic care, the programme structure covered six domains: (i)dementia and persons with dementia; (ii) person-centred care and building meaningful relationship; (iii) communi- cation and behaviours; (iv) support for people with dementia, family and carers; (v) health and wellbeing; and (vi) legal aspects and issues related todementia. The domains were intro- duced on a monthly basis for six months. Two sets of training kits,Here, experts explain the intricate situation of Dementia care in Hong Kong, and why it could benefit from a train-the-trainer approach Helen Chan1, Kenny Chui2, Florence Timothy Kwok2 1The Nethersole School of Nursing, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2Jockey Club Centre for Positive Ageing, Hong Kong, 3Dementia Services Development Centre, University of StirlingDementia care workforce: Hong Kong and the train-the-trainer approach 70PROFILEincluding a facilitator guide, an intro- ductory booklet and six booklets for each domain, were respectively devel- oped for the residential and commu- nity care services. The training materials were adapted to the socio- cultural context of the local communi- ties and translated to Chinese to facilitate self-directed learning. The Train-the-Trainer approach, which is the key feature of the aforemen- tioned training, increased the pro- gramme's reach and sustainability. The facilitators acted as a change agent in their own care environments by providing on-site trainings. This approach empowers the facilitators and learners to link their new knowl- edge to real examples, familiar to them in their current work and co- constructs their learning experiences. Various interactive strategies, such as sharing, case discussion, role play, reflection and debriefing, were adopted to promote situated learning. In addition, the programme adopts an inclusive approach, in which all staff members in the care settings - not only those involved in the direct care of people with dementia - were invited to be learners. Stigmatisation and misunderstanding about demen- tia exist in this society, and this pro-gramme aims to raise the awareness towards dementia among non-care- related staff. The inclusion of all staffmembers in the training laid an important foundation in cultivating an atmosphere of caring and mutual understanding in the care settings. To our best knowledge, this pro- gramme is the largest project amongst the Chinese communities to build staff capacity for dementia care across aged care services through a systematic and extensive manner. A mixed-method study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the training programme. The findings provided evidence that the improvement amongst learners throughout this three-year programme was not merely based on their knowledge related to dementia but also on the staff's attitude and sense of compe- tence in dementia care. The reflective essay submitted at the end of the programme reveals that the learners gained an enhanced understanding of the behaviours and emotions of people with dementia. Over time, the care staff developed confidence in communicating with their clients or tailoring activities based on a person- centred care philosophy. The staffalso achieved improvements in their collegial relationship and teamwork through regular peer learning activities embedded in the training. The experi- ences from this project suggested that the Train-the-Trainer approach connotes the need for organisationalsupport for change. Therefore, the approach is an effective strategy for transferring knowledge and skills to different staff levels, fostering a positive care culture and enhancing the sustainability of change in the organisation.

It is made up of 13 Institutes and as such, collaborates with researchers and partners to support the innovations and discoveries that improve health and strengthen the country's healthcare system.1 We know that the CIHR invests approximately $1 billionevery year in support of health research. This funding supports excellence across all four pillars of health research: clinical, biomedical, health systems services plus population health. Certainly, each of the 13 Institutes is headed up by a Scientic Director. 2 The CIHR mandate for research As the CIHR Act from 2000 states, their mandate is very clear. Certainly, the CIHR aims to: \"excel, according to internationally accepted standards of scientic excellence, in the creation of new knowledge and its translation into improved health for Canadians, more eective health services and products and a strengthened Canadian healthcare system.\" This can be achieved in several ways, including the following: Showing leadership within the Canadian research community and encouraging collaboration with theprovinces, organisations and researchers in or outside the country who are interested in health or health research; Creating a robust research environment for health in the country, based on internationally accepted standards of a peer review process and scientic excellence, to develop, attract and retain excellent researchers and provide them with the chance tocontribute to improving the health of people in Canada and beyond; Forging an integrated health research agenda across sectors, disciplines and regions that reflects the emerging health needs of people and the evolving health system of the country. It is important to note here that supporting health policy decision-making isalso important; Encouraging integrative, interdisciplinary health research through Health Research Institutes; Addressing emerging health opportunities, threats and challenges and accelerating the discovery of treatments, cures and healthcare improvements to healthcare, as well as wellness and prevention strategies; Providing support for and pursuing opportunities in terms of Canadian scientists taking part in health research partnerships and international collaboration and; Ensuring accountability and transparency to Canadians when it comes to the investment of the Government of Canada in health research. 3 Human Development, Child and Youth Health (IHDCYH) This article will now focus on just one of those 13 Institutes, Human Development, Child and Youth Health (CIHR-IHDCYH), which is headed up by Dr Shoo Lee fromthe University of Toronto. He is also Paediatrician-in- Chief and Director of the Maternal-Infant Care (MICare) Research Centre at Mount Sinai Hospital and is Senior Clinician Scientist at the Lunenfeld-TannenbaumThe role of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, when it comes to funding health research in Canada, is explored here, including a look at the work of the Human Development, Child and Youth Health division within thatNORTH AMERICA FOCUS 73Research Institute. Certainly, as the founder and Director of the Canadian Neonatal NetworkTM and the International Neonatal Collaboration, he very much believes in fostering collaborative research and as such, heads up the CIHR Team in the eld of maternal-infant care. We read more about his excellent research workon the CIHR website: \"His research focuses on improving quality of care, patient outcomes and health care services delivery. He developed the Family IntegratedCare (FICare) model and piloted the concept at Mount Sinai Hospital. 4 \"The Institute of Human Development, Child and Youth Health (IHDCYH) funds health research to support and develop a well-trained base of investigators with the expertise and skills needed to design and conduct diverse and innovative and research plus knowledge translation targeted at improving health.\" In a message from Dr Shoo Lee for World Prematurity Day and National Child Day in November 2018, he provides a flavour of his thoughts on how the CIHR- funded researchers are making a dierence in the livesof Canadian people: \"The CIHR-IHDCYH is devoted to supporting research that gives children the healthiest possible start to life. We are committed to doing so in collaboration with ourfellow Institutes and partners in Canada and abroad.\" 5 CIHR-IHDCYH funds health research to support and develop a well-trained base of investigators with the expertise and skills needed to design and conduct diverse and innovative and research plus knowledge translation targeted at improving health. Looking ahead, the beginning of 2019 was the time when we entered the last year of Dr Shoo Lee's second term as Scientic Director of the CIHR Institute of theCIHR-IHDCYH. In a written message from Dr Shoo K. Lee in February 2019, we discover that he will complete his term on December 31st, 2019 and his team at SinaiHealth System has already begun the transition process. He emphasises that the CIHR-IHDCYH will continue to work with the CIHR sta and partners to deliver on the priorities outlined in the refreshed strategic plan, Healthy Foundations of Life: CIHR- IHDCYH Refreshed Strategic Plan 2018-2020 6. At the same time, the CIHR-IHDCYH will ensure an orderlyand smooth and transition to the next Scientic Director. Dr Shoo K. Lee then provides his reflections on his time in his current position as Scientic Director of the CIHR-IHDCYH. \"I am honoured to have served as Scientic Director of CIHR-IHDCYH for almost eight years. It has been a pleasure for me and my team to collaborate with our community to support research and capacity building in maternal, reproductive, child and youth health. I am condent that our eorts will make a long-term contribution to improving the health of families in Canada.\"7 Closing thoughts A further example of the kind of research that theCIHR-IHDCYH fund concerns that which strengthens Canada's capacity and knowledge by supporting a new generation of reproductive, maternal, child and youth health researchers. Certainly, this is achieved by providing vital training, mentorship support and early career development to researchers in these elds. We know that the CIHR-IHDCYH embeds capacity development and networks for mentorship and support of trainees into each of the programmes that it funds. 8This and other examples certainly t in well with the CIHR's wider aim to support excellence across all areas of health research and that strengthen the Canadian healthcare system and improve the health of the country's inhabitants.9 References 1 http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html 2 http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/37788.html Government editorial@openaccessgovernment.org www.openaccessgovernment.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovNORTH AMERICA FOCUS 74Funding obesity research in the U.S. today The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of the National Institutes of Health, makes use of technology and state- of-the-art science to nd out the interplay between environmental exposures, human biology, geneticsand common diseases to help improve human health and prevent disease. The NIEHS is dedicated to carrying out the most rigorous research in the environmental health sciences and to communicating this to the public, in the organisation's capacity as a publicly- funded institute. (1) On the website of the NIEHS, we nd out that millions of people in the United States (U.S.) and globally are obese or overweight. Certainly, obesity is said to be a complex health disorder that aects people of all ages.For example, in the U.S., childhood obesity is a serious problem. Simply put, obesity means that one has toomuch body fat and it occurs over time when we consume more calories than we use. One really important point is that being obese puts people at risk for many other health problems, such asarthritis, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, breathing problems and some cancers. Factors that contribute to obesity include one's family history and genetics, metabolism, environment and behaviour or habits, for example. (2) Today, scientists are starting to look into the notion that some chemicals in the environment could play a part in the growing obesity problem. Examples ofchemicals that may be obesogens include cigarette smoke, air pollution, flame retardants, Bisphenol A, some pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls used inpaints, types of cement, fluorescent light ballasts, sealants and adhesives. (3)While obesity is indeed a serious issue, it's not all doom and gloom. Certainly, we know that even modestweight loss can prevent or improve many of the health problems associated with obesity. Increased physical activity and behaviour changes, as well as dietary changes, are all factors that can assist people to lose weight. Staying in this positive mindset, let's look at some examples of NIEHS funded research in the eld. In March this year, we discover that vitamin D may be protective among asthmatic obese children dwelling inurban environments with high indoor air pollution. This study from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine was published in The Journal of Allergy andClinical Immunology: In Practice. \"What surprised us the most was that the ndings ofthe study showed the eects were most pronounced among obese children,\" said Sonali Bose, MD, Lead Author. \"This highlights a third factor at play here - the obesity epidemic - and helps bring that risk to light when considering individual susceptibility to asthma,\"she added. (4) Another example of NIEHS funded research in the eld can be found from March this year when we learn about an international study led by USC scientists, which tells us that toddlers with asthma are more likely to become obese children. This is the largest such study and focused on no less than 20,000 young people throughout Europe. Beyond wheezing and shortness of breath, the study said that asthma can lead to bodies that make young people more vulnera- ble to other health problems when they are older. Lida Chatzi, Senior Author and Professor of PreventiveHere, we find out about the role that the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a publicly-funded institute, when it comes to funding obesity research in the U.S. today75Medicine at USC, believes that asthma and obesity raise a serious concern about a public health crisis. \"We care about this issue because asthma aects approximately 6.5 million children - about one in 10 - in the U.S.,\" Chatzi said. \"It's a chronic childhood disor-der and if it increases the risk of obesity, we can advise parents and physicians on how to treat it and intervene to help young children grow up to enjoy healthy, adult lives.\" (5) As this article draws to a close, let's briefly examine another study by scientists at the NIH and their collab- orators, which discovered that young women with high body fat have a lower chance of developing breast cancer prior to menopause. This could help researchers to understand the role obesity plays in breast cancer risk better. \"Our nding that breast cancer risk is not increased in obese premenopausal women, and in fact decreases, points to the possibility that dierent biologic mecha- nisms are responsible for causing breast cancer in younger women,\" said Dale Sandler, PhD, Co-Senior Author and Head of the Epidemiology Branch at the NIEHS. NIEHS Sta Scientist, Katie O'Brien, PhD, who works in Sandler's group commented that this work is a greatexample of how scientists can pool their resources to tackle important research questions in greater detail. Certainly, the examples in this article show how research into obesity is being supported in the U.S. today. \"We hope this is the rst of many studies to specically focus on risk factors for breast cancer among young women,\" she underlines.

Kenan, Jr., Distinguished Professor of Nutrition at the Univer- sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, established the Division of Nutritional Epidemiology at UNC (since integrated into the dept) and later established and ran the UNC Interdisciplinary Obesity Center funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with several training grants linked to it. He developed the concept of the Nutrition Transition, the dynamic shifts in our environment and how they affect dietary intake, physical activity pat- terns, and trends in obesity and other nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases (NR NCDs). Theirs was the firstresearch on the double burden of malnutrition at the household level. The Nutrition Transition can be thought of as the different stages a population goes through as its access to food evolves from hunter-gatherer to the future stage with a society with a health-oriented enviroment where increased activity and a healthy diet are the norm. This change occurs at different times in different societies, but it follows a similar trajectory in each case and comprises five distinct stages. Beginning with hunter-gather, the stages transition to the fourth, which is dominated by receding fami- lies and NR NCDs. At that point, thepopulation has easy access to foodsthat are rich in fat, salt, and sugar yet low in fibre and polyunsaturated oils and usually at the same time the pop- ulation transitions to a sedentary lifestyle. An epidemic of obesity and the many associated health issues quickly results. The fifth stage - the behavioural change stage -marks the point at which people and govern- ments strive to change the environ- ment and subsequently lifestyles. Hundreds of papers by Popkin and other scholars show the dynamic shifts in diet and physical activity that have led the world's population to the current stage with high and increasing rates of obesity and other NR NCDs. He also published with Colleen Doak the first papers on the double burdenof malnutrition. Popkin's research program is globallyfocused to understand the stages ofthe Nutrition Transition and enables appropriate programs and policies to improve the health of the world's pop- ulations (see www.nutrans.org and also his global food research pro - gram). His investigations have placed obesity and its determinants and consequences centrally on the global stage. His early research and evalua- tion efforts have drawn attention to diet changes and reductions in physi- cal activity and their roles in increased overweight/obesity risks. Currently, he is actively involved in program and policy design and evaluation, including collaborative appraisals of the impact of the sugar- sweetened beverage (SSB) and non- essential food taxes with the National Institute of Public Health in Mexico and similar work on the impacts of an SSB tax and marketing and front Obesity is a growing problem around the world, with many negative consequences for both individuals and societies.

In addition, Popkin founded three major cohort surveys, the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) 28 years) 1, the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) (38 years)2, and the Russia Longitudinal Monitor- ing Survey (RLMS) (25 years)3continue to follow the original individuals and their families. Each survey has provided public free-access data for thousands of publications not only by Popkin and his collaborators in each country but also by tens of thousands of other scholars. The RLMS began when he was a member of the small G-7team4which worked first with the former Soviet Union and later with the Russian Federation to enact a series of laws and provide grants and loans as part of an effort to try to help the transition from Communism. Popkin's many major awards for his global contributions include the 2018 Obesity Society Atkinson-Stern Award for Distinguished Public Service; the2018 American Heart Association Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health Council David Kritchevsky MemorialLecture and Award; the 2016 World Obesity Federation Population Science and Public Health Award; the Chinese government's first award in 2015 for significant foreign contributions to Chinese nutrition; the 2015 Conrad A.

MEDICAL CANNABIS & CBD 78Cannabis products: Greater diversity, increased potency and the need for close monitoring Cannabis products have become increasingly diverse in Europe and close monitoring of their potency and potential health eects is essential. These are among the conclusions of a recent report published by the European Union (EU) drugs agency (EMCDDA) to mark the International day against drug abuse and illicit tracking on 26th June. The report \u2014 Developments in the European cannabis market \u2014 provides an overview of emerging and established cannabisproducts in Europe 1. The report identies a range of factors behind the current diversity of cannabis products, including policy developments, advances in production and extraction techniques and changing consumer preferences. The creation of legal recreational cannabis markets outside the EU is also noted as driving innovation in the development of new cannabis products, some ofwhich are now appearing on the European market. \"The dynamic nature of the current cannabis market and the diversication of cannabis products available bring considerable challenges\", says EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel. \"New and more potent cannabis products may have serious public health consequences for users. Therefore, monitoring and understandingnew trends in cannabis products available to European consumers today is important to inform the policy and regulatory debate.\" Cannabis remains the most widely used illicit drug inEurope. Some 17.5 million young Europeans (15-34years) are estimated to have used cannabis in the lastyear (EU-28). Around 1% of adults (15-64 years) in theEU are estimated to be daily, or almost daily, cannabis users. In 2017, some 155,000 people entered drug treatment in Europe for problems related to this drug, of those around 83,000 were entering treatment for therst time. Cannabis is now the substance most often named by new entrants to specialist drug treatment services as their main reason for contact 2. Cannabis contains many dierent chemicals, the best- known being 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) \u2014 largely responsible for the intoxicating eects of cannabis \u2014 and cannabidiol (CBD). What are the new products in the European cannabis market? Concentrates: These are made by extracting THC from the cannabis plant, often using heat and pressure or volatile solvents or gases. Advances in extraction techniques are yielding high potencies (70%-80% THC). Consuming concentrates can result in high THC exposure and potentially pose a greater risk of psychosis and dependence. Edibles: This is an umbrella term referring to foods (often sweets or liquids) containing THC and/or CBD. Adding cannabis products to foodstus results in slower onset and longer duration of eects than when smoking cannabis (thus dosing becomes important). Synthetic cannabinoids: These man-made chemical substances mimic the eects of cannabis but may beA recent report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction highlights a greater diversity of cannabis products, increased potency and the need for close monitoring of health effectsMEDICAL CANNABIS & CBD 79far more potent. Some of these are sold as 'licit' replacements for cannabis, however, some are now controlled internationally and/or under national legislation. The rst synthetic cannabinoid identied in Europe (JWH-018) was detected in 2008 in products branded as 'Spice'3. Since then, more than 180 synthetic cannabinoids have been reported to the EMCDDA. Cannabis-based medicinal and health-orientated products: These include products manufactured to pharmaceutical standards for medicinal use and others with varied composition and descriptions. The report provides a brief overview of approved cannabis-based medicinal products (an EMCDDA in-depth analysis is also available)4. \"New and more potent cannabis products may have serious public health consequences for users. Therefore, monitoring and understanding new trends in cannabis products available to European consumers today is important to inform the policy and regulatory debate.\" Latest developments with established cannabis products Along with the emerging products on the European cannabis market, there are also challenges arising with the more established forms of the drug. In broad terms, there are two main types of herbal cannabis on European markets: 'sinsemilla' or indoor-grown herbal cannabis produced within the EU and imported herbal cannabis. In addition to herbal cannabis, plant materialis also used to produce cannabis resin. Morocco is the largest producer of resin available on the European drug market. Data provided by the EU Member States show that the THC concentration of cannabis productsfound in Europe over the last decade has increased,raising concerns about potential harms. The estimated mean potency of herbal cannabis doubled from 5% to 10% THC from 2006 to 2016 and cannabis resin potency increased from 8% to 17% THC. Monitoring tools to capture cannabis market diversication The report underlines the need to develop monitoring tools to capture information on these products and their health eects, at national and European level(particularly on cannabis concentrates). From a harm reduction perspective, it will also be advisable to monitor the concentration of CBD in cannabis products. Finally, having the ability to distinguish illicitcannabis products from cannabis-based medicinal products and unregulated CBD oils will be important for law enforcement in many jurisdictions. Cannabis, controversies and challenges The new report is one of several EMCDDA publications and services exploring some of the complex issues in the cannabis policy eld. These include analyses of the medical use of cannabis, cannabis and driving5 and an online alert service on the status and recent developments in cannabis policy6.

Basically, we are all different people with different needs with regards to the dosage of CBD, the method of finding your sweet spot is clearly a personal journey, using the guide below will and can help to establish this if you are using oil-based products. As can clearly be seen, the isolate displays a bell-shaped response curve, whereby an increase in dosage results in an optimal phase followed by a drop-off effect, conversely thefull-spectrum hemp displays a plateau phase and no drop-off. You can read more here . In our opinion, it is always wise to lookfor a whole plant hemp extract (full- spectrum) when researching a CBD product to use, although at savage- cabbageltd.com, we do stock a range of products to satisfy our customers' requirements, ranging from whole plant extract (full-spectrum) THC free (broad spectrum), isolate (only CBD) CBG or CBDA (we will discuss theseproducts later). However, it has been evidenced through scientific research that full- spectrum hemp, which contains allthe plants cannabinoid, terpenes and flavonoids etc, is far superior to a CBD isolate product. The dose-response curves in the fol- lowing schematic display the results discovered by Dr Stefan Kuprowsky BSc, MA Naturopathic - who endorses the importance of full-spectrum wholeplant extract. Can I overdose on CBD? In a word no, because CBD is consid- ered non-toxic and it produces few side effects but when they occur, they are typically minor. A recent report by the National Cancer Institute notesthat overdosing on CBD is virtually impossible and the same is true for THC (Tetrahydrocannabinoid) becauseSavage Cabbage Ltd offer their expert advice on what dosage CBD users should be taking and answers other often asked questions, in this in-depth articleWhat dosage of CBD should you use? 80PROFILE cannabinoid receptors, unlike opioid receptors, are not located in the brain- stem areas controlling respiration and lethal doses from cannabis and cannabinoids do not occur. What is tolerance and what can I do to help deal with it? CBD consumers may develop a toler- ance over time, which can result in a reduced effect from the same dose. A method used by many of our cus-tomers to help deal with this situation is to stop taking their CBD product for 48 hours to give their endocannabi- noid system a chance to reset and then start back on their sweet spot dose again. Conversely, some have reported that after a few months of taking their CBD product, they find that they don't need as much and manage to decrease their dose while maintainingthe same effect, which you could describe as reverse tolerance, so to reiterate, we are all different people. Some of our customers are reporting that they cycle between two or three different quality CBD products (forexample, they spend two to three months on each product, in turn) as a means of controlling tolerance. It's been suggested that as the plant is used for each different product, there will be a different strain and, therefore, the composition will slightly differfrom one product to another. Here, the development of tolerance is not being experienced, although there is no science-based evidence currently available to endorse this, so feedback on this matter and methodology must carry some weight concerning tolerance. These are the questions we asked when looking for a quality whole plant hemp extract to stock in our shop . The questions were asked as a conse- quence of Savage Cabbage CEO Jade Proudman undergoing a number of major operations which took their toll on her and we realised there was a need to enhance her wellbeing and improve her homeostasis. We discovered that Charlotte's WebOil is a full-spectrum hemp extract,more than just a CBD oil, with many beneficial compounds that come from their plants containing more than 80 other phytocompound including cannabidiol Can body weight affect the dose I require? Generally, a person's body weightplays a part in how little or how much CBD affects the body. As a rule of thumb, the heavier the person the higher the dose, conversely lighterpeople may feel the same benefit with a lower dose, but there is a factor that some individuals are more sensitive to CBD than others. How do I get guidance or help with dosage? What if Iam taking medication? Only a qualified medical practitioner who is educated and has full knowl- edge of the CBD products available can give dosage advice (Good luck finding one in the UK). If you are taking medi- cation and/or require guidance with CBD products, The Realm of Caring is the contact for free professional guidance. They are a charity based in the U.S. with a team of professionally trained individuals who will help with your enquiries and give guidance on a product and dosage. Or you could contact the United Patients Alliance. https://www.upalliance.org The United Patients Alliance support approximately 20,000 patients in the UK who are already successfully utilising cannabinoid therapy. Established in July 2014, with the support of Professor David Nutt and Caroline Lucas MP, United Patients Alliance was founded to represent the interests of patients choosing to con- sume medical cannabis to treat their chronic conditions. With some of the most vulnerable members of society facing up to 14 years in prison, they call attention to the injustice of prosecuting individuals for consuming medicine legal elsewhere in the world. Despite the wide body of clinical evi-dence supporting medical cannabis use and a change in Drug Policy in November 2018, moving cannabis to schedule 2, patients are still being denied safe access to a medication with a proven record of safety and 81PROFILE CBD Isolate Higher doses produce diminished returns Dose response relationship \"Response\" changes as function of dosePeak effect at Medium dosesFull Spectrum HempAnti inflammatory response Response Dose Low Dose Medium Dose High Dose82PROFILE efficacy. The team at United Patients Alliance are all patients themselves with life- limiting conditions; cannabi- noids have not only allowed them to elevate their own lives, but they now operate a platform that provides sup- port to many thousands of people with unmet needs, providing tireless advocacy, community support, patientforums, educational tools and harmreduction advice nationwide. United Patients Alliance have been commissioned to assist with the facilitation of Project Twenty21 as part of Drug Science's Medical Cannabis Working Group. The project seeks to deliver a trial model that will see that 20,000 patients are placed onto trials over the next 24 months. Carly's Amnesty Patients in the UK are currently in a very difficult position. Despite recent changes to the scheduling that hasseen private clinics write prescriptions on a daily basis, those who can't affordto buy immunity from prosecution are still being criminalised for consuming medicine that has drastically changed their lives. With the NHS seemingly years away from embracing this new library of medicines, patients are living with a two-tier system; if you can afford it, you are a patient, if you cannot you are criminalised. \"I am a criminal, only because I cannot afford to sustain my \u00a31,500 a month private prescription,\" says Carly Barton, whohas spearheaded a campaign to allow patients the rights to domestic cultivation while policy catches up. This would mean that patients would be able to cultivate their own strains that are most suitable for them and often higher in the non-psychoactive cannabinoid CBD. If granted, patientswould be able to avoid potentially dangerous products often sold bydealers. They would also removethemselves from being financially complicit in the criminal market. \"This is the VERY least we can do for these patients if the NHS is not pre- pared to advance access swiftly. These people have already been through so much, they have usually weaned off highly addictive pharmaceuticals in favour of a more suitable, natural treatment that works better for them. To have your wellness criminalised does not make any sense. We, as a country, need to answer this question: if patients are already benefiting in the meantime, do they deserve to live in fear of a kick through the door in the night?\" In a short few months, Carly's Amnesty has gained endorsements and support from all political parties as well as the Police Federation, the Police Foundation and Crime Com- missioners across the country. It is on the agenda for discussion at the next Drugs Strategy Board meeting at the Home Office. What does full-spectrum mean? Full-spectrum CBD oil includes a wide range of in the cannabis or hemp plant. Full-spec- trum CBD also contains a variety of essential vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, protein, chlorophyll, terpenes and flavonoids. What does broad mean? Broad-spectrum CBD is full-spectrum CBD without any THC. It offers all the entourage benefits associated with full-spectrum CBD, without any chances of THC being ingested into the body. Broad-spectrum CBD is an excellent choice for individuals that can't have any traces of THC is their system. However, it must be noted that in some products there may be a trace of THC. What does isolate mean? CBD isolate contains only CBD All the plant matter contained in the hemp plant, including oils, waxes, chloro-phyll and more are removed, offering a finished product that's CBD and nothing more. What is CBDA (Cannabidiolic acid)? CBD has largely been viewed as the most promising of the cannabinoids for enhancing your health and wellbe- ing and medicinal research and as such, CBDA was overlooked, however, the new trend in raw juicing cannabis leaves has reignited the interest inCBDA. To view MYRIAM'S HOPE THCFREE DAILY 25 CBD 30ML, please visit this link . CBDA is the precursor for CBD, CBDA is found in the raw plant material and is the acidic precursor to active CBD. Both CBDA and CBD first develop in the plants as cannabinoid cannabigerol (CBGA) once an available enzyme is present, it converts CBGA to CBDA. From here, CBD is formed from CBDA via the process of decarboxylation, which involves apply- ing heat to remove the carboxyl group. The decarboxylation can also happen during vaporising, cooking and during the drying process of the plant matter. What are the benefits of CBDA? Research has suggested that CBDA has the potential for pain relief, reducing inflammation, as an appetite suppres- sant, reducing seizures, promoting bone growth and inhibiting cancer cell growth. However, no clinical trials havebeen carried out as yet and more research is needed as CBDA is much more than the inert cannabinoid that the scientist originally thought. You can find out more here . What is CBG (Cannabigerol)? CBG is the non-acidic form CBGA and GBGA is the parent molecule from which several additional cannabinoids are produced. Once the plant is fully matured, the majority of the CBG within the plant is already converted into CBGA which turns into other cannabinoids. CBG is often described as the parent of other cannabinoids.

We had the good fortune initially to become involved with experienced U.S. cultiva- tors and African licence holders for medical marijuana and our journey has become tied to a global transfor- mation which has quietly gathered pace in the re-assessment of the value of marijuana from \"users\", to legisla- tors to revenue collectors. As a listed public company, we are highly regulated and our focus is on legal growth, processing, research and the sale of primarily CBD and THC products. Whilst our project started in Africa, we have also quickly acquired licences for research and two further areas for cultivation and growth in Europe and Africa, with re-investment of a percentage of profits in social and infrastructure projects. Our objective is to develop a high-quality growth, research and distribution network. As with any industry sector, the global market can at first appear chaotic, however, un-picking the myriad legis -lative and regulatory requirements across Africa, Europe, Canada and the U.S., it is clear that established technical expertise, supply-lines,finance and supporting industries are established and continue to develop rapidly. Uruguay, Canada and Luxem- bourg have set a national legislative pace and in the U.S., 33 States havelegalised the medicinal use of which eleven have endorsed recreational use. The collective legislative response in the European Union (EU) has been slower although, \"the European Parliament has positioned itself in favour of legalising the therapeuticuse of cannabis by approving a reso- lution urging the European Commis- sion and all Member States to address the regulatory, financial and cultural barriers related to the plant.\" A Whilst centralised policy remains undeveloped, it has become apparent in our engagements at a national level that Spain, Germany and Portugal are developing solid infrastructures with multiple licences for growth, process- ing research and export granted; the Dutch have superb quality growth capability, established analytics and labs; Denmark is building state of the art processing capacity and the Baltic State's crops are being harvested and processed. Malta, Switzerland, Poland and a number of States in the Adriatic have licenced growth and production at various stages of development. China, where the possession and use remain illegal, is pragmatically becoming a major volume producer of CDB and THC labs are already established by European businesses. However, for the moment, the com- mercial muscle remains in the U.S. and Canada, where consolidation is already becoming evident and appli-cations to list on European exchanges are growing.The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a rescheduling of Cannabis within the international drug control framework to facilitate trade for medicinal and scientific purposes re-aligning the 1961 and 1971 conventions. However, the Com- mission for Narcotic Drugs delayed its vote on the proposal earlier this year. In August meanwhile, The American Bar Association endorsed the ending of Marijuana Prohibition, urging Congress to end the conflict between State and Federal Law. 1 While legislative and regulatory barriers continue to be asymmetric and porous consumer demand continues to outstrip supply and while this has a significant impact on the quality of product reaching consumers, it also risks criminalising consumers and inhibits the generation of tax rev- enues. This has been evident in the UK where evidence for the efficacy of plant-based treatments for alleviating the symptoms of diseases such as epilepsy, Alzheimer, arthritis, asthma, cancer or mental disorders such as psychosis are acknowledged2but existing clinical studies are considered insufficient.3Some parents of child suffers are risking prosecution to secure supplies from sources where treatments are legally available.4 The medical profession's responsewhether to THC or CBD based prod- ucts is unexpected, Harvard MD Peter Grimspoon on CBD says, \"WeIan C Tordoff, CEO of Block Commodities Ltd, provides a snap-shot of changes in the medical marijuana industryMedical marijuana: Developments in the industry 84PROFILEneed more research but CBD may prove to be an option for managing anxiety, insomnia and chronic pain. Without sufficient high-quality evidence in human studies, we can't pinpoint effective doses and because CBD is currently mostly available as an unregulated supplement, it's difficult to know exactly what you are getting.\"5 At the same time in an adjacent Harvard function, a study on a cannabis-derived flavonoid as a treatment for pancreatic cancer with a 70% success rate in mice, has been announced as having a potential'major impact' on cancer treatment inhumans. 6 Again, despite professional caution, a recent Gallup Poll found, \"public sup- port for legalising marijuana has surged, 86% of U.S. supporters of legal marijuana saying its medicinal benefits are a very important reason they support legalisation...also freeing up police resources to focus on other crimes... and generating tax revenue... re key reasons for their support.\"7 The groundswell in consumer demand is compelling with one in seven Amer-icans saying they personally use cannabidiol (CBD) based products...8 According to data compiled by Mordor Intelligence, the global cannabis market will be worth $65 billion by 2023. The Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) calculated the rev- enue that the Spanish Public Treasury would receive \u20ac3.3 billion ($3.71 bil- lion) per year in taxes and social secu- rity contributions. A With the benefit of legalisation diminishing the black- market share to 15% of total demand. Based on the Spanish population, a crude extrapolation to the EU popula- tion would create \u20ac37 billion revenues, enough to cover a couple of Brexits and if the whole European populationis taken into account, the figure is \u20ac53 billion. Demand is already evident and grow- ing: we see our role as cultivators and innovators creating a quality supply for medical and therapeutic use. Block Commodities Limited has pivoted its agriculture business to medicinalcannabis and in the process hasacquired an exceptional Board; a world-class scientific and academic community; seed-stock, experienced cultivators and an enviable network of partners, customers and investors. We are collectively focused on the challenges and successes to come.

Though GreenLight specializes in phytocannabinoid supplement pro- duction and clinical development, it performs research on the potential health benefits of a wide range of plant based compounds. The company is based in Dublin, but has recently created a UK based subsidiary and has plans to expand into Europe. This article overviews the clear distinc- tions between cannabis plant derived supplements and medical products informed by GreenLight's expert perspective in the field. Core topicsinclude a summary of the current supplement and medical cannabis regulatory frameworks, a primer on the science behind the endocannabi- noid system, and pharmacological considerations of both supplements and medicines. From the outset, it is important to clearly define each prod- uct and their regulatory conventions. Cannabinoid Supplements Cannabis-based products, or herein called cannabinoid supplements (i.e. products not authorised as medicines)GreenLight Medicines is a supplier of quality supplements and is an active MedCan research companyCannabinoids and health - from supplements to medicines 86PROFILE can be derived from the hemp plant, which contains less than 0.2% tetrahy- drocannabinol (THC) and usually aims to provide cannabidiol (CBD) to the consumer. CBD based products are the predominant cannabinoid supple- ment available in Europe as ingestible oils or gums, topical creams or vaping liquids. All of these products can be made using CBD isolate or derived directly from raw plant materials to retain a 'full spectrum' of cannabis plant compounds which may act synergistically on the body's endo- cannabinoid system (described in a future Open Access Goverment publication). Recent clarifications on cannabis and its components have confirmed that cannabinoid extracts including CBD are considered novel foods across Europe. Cannabinoid supplements are not considered the same as medical cannabis. These supplements have not been rigorously tested for any clinical benefit through safety and efficacy trials and their quality orrisk/benefit profile has not been formally evaluated by regulatory authorities. Many products, including those from GreenLight Supplements, will however meet Good Manufactur- ing Practice standards to maintain a quality standard for consistent com- position of the product. Additionally, GreenLight Supplements are distri - buted only via pharmacies with staffon hand to advise consumers on their suitability (in light of potential interac- tion with co-medications, overviewed later). Greenlight have producedlearning materials for pharmacists needing to update their knowledge of over the counter cannabinoid foodsupplements. This supports pharma- cists in advising consumers are advised about using food supplements in supporting healthy living alongside abalanced diet. Greenlight take great care to ensure that the consumer understands that cannabinoid food supplements are not intended to prevent, treat or cure any medical symptom or health condition. Current human trial data has not provided sufficient evidence that CBD supple- ments are able to alleviate chronic conditions. Medical Cannabis 'Medical cannabis' (Medicinal cannabis, MedCan, or in the UK, cannabis based medical products (CBMP)) refers broadly to a range of products that contain active compounds either synthesized chemically, isolated from plant or raw preparations direct from cannabis plants. Developments in breeding, growing, harvesting and storage of plants have enabled standardised granulated cannabis or oil extract preparations. These raw cannabis preparations can vary widely in the types and relative amounts of cannabinoids depending on the particular product or strain of plant, the significance of which is to provide a 'full spectrum' of potentially synergistic cannabinoids and terpenes which are absent in isolates. These products have shown moderate clinical evidence of efficacy in condi- tions such as severe epilepsy, chronic pain and intractable nausea and vomiting. Evaluation is still ongoing to consider the risk benefit profiles of CBMPs in treating specific medical conditions. In Europe, medicines must be authorised by either the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or by a national medical product regulatorsuch as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)in the UK or the Health Products Reg- ulatory Authority (HPRA) in Ireland. The European marketing authorisa- tion process has steered medical cannabis products toward purified cannabinoid isolates which lend themselves toward standardised pharmaceutical manufacture and tra- ditional clinical trials of safety, effec- tiveness and side effects. In the past decade, several countries in Europe have passed legislation to allow the prescription of medical cannabis, where there is evidence of benefit in particular indications and where there is no alternative treatment. In 2018 Ireland and UK also permitted medical use but access programmes and prescribing recommendations are only now being established, restricting uptake. Clinical Evidence for Medical Cannabis use The current best evidence of the medical benefits and safety of cannabis preparations comes from systematic reviews of clinical studies and gold- standard randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The strongest evidence to date of efficacy, albeit 'moderate' in nature, emerges from multiple sclerosis, cancer nausea and epilepsy clinical trials. These conditions are invariably cited in government reports from Ireland, UK, Europe and US as the most appropriate indications to target with medical cannabis. 'Moderate' evidence, as referred to in the definitive US National Academies of Sciences, engineering and Medicine (NASEM) 2017 report , describes 'several sup- portive findings from good to fair quality studies with few or no credible opposing findings'. This conservative description clearly indicates limitations and important gaps which need to be addressed by 87PROFILE88PROFILE larger, longer follow-up clinical trials which test alternate cannabinoid combinations, dosage and interactions with other medications. Additionally we can learn from previous clinical studies to take account of pharmaco- genetics (variation in how genetic different patients with the same con- dition will metabolise and respond to a particular drug) and comorbidities(co-existing conditions) to provide medical professionals with reliable evidence of efficacy for real world patient populations. Indeed, studies which test the efficacy of lesser studied cannabis plant isolates and standard- ised whole plant extracts could provide evidence of the often cited 'entourage effect' of multiple complementary cannabinoid and terpene compounds.Expanding Medical Cannabis Research GreenLight Pharmaceuticals Ltd. currently has 9 therapeutic research and development projects based across 3 core disease areas: 1. Cancers including prostate, ovarian and breast, 2. Neurological conditions including Alzheimer's, epilepsy, addiction and pain. 3. Inflammatory or immune related conditions including arthritis and arthritis-related depression, eye disease and diabetes (rationale showcased in greater detail below). They also have a plant-breeding project to optimizeproprietary strains and a dedicated lab to purify and screen compound mixtures, prior to pre-clinical testing in each research programme. GreenLight is conducting research on whether specific cannabinoids reduce inflammation and can reduce pain in arthritis. Cytokines are molecules produced by cells during tissue injury, swelling and repair, which can signal to other cells to become involved. Cytokines can moderate levels of inflammation and are generally found at higher levels in conditions such as arthritis, contributing to joint damage and ultimately disability. Current stud-ies suggest that specific cannabinoids suppress inflamed states of the immune system, by increasing immunosup-Figure 1: An overview of known drug interactions with CBD and THC Cannabinoid inhibits CYP2C fam ily or a mplify t e CYP 3A4 path way, thus speeding metabolism/b reakdown of THC or CBD NB CBD can interact epilepsy m edicines such as Clobazam, cau sing Clobaza m serum levels to increase; concomitant treatment requires carefu l monitoring. T-cell cytokines. In doing so, cannabinoids may also reduce sensitisation of nerve endings to pain. Clinical trials conducted to date on cannabinoid treatments (usually with CBD: THC in combination) are incon- clusive on whether they are effective in arthritis. It is likely there are a number of reasons for this, including the specific treatment composition, doses used, modes of delivery and poor trial design. GreenLight plans on expanding its program of research into the anti- cancer potential of phytocannabinoids and other plant-based compounds. The company also plans phase II clin- ical trials of investigational medical products in both arthritic pain and epilepsy. Pharmacological interactions of Cannabinoid Supplements and Medical Cannabis As with many other supplements or foods such as St. John's Wort or grape- fruit, some consideration should be given to potential for interactions with prescribed or non-prescribed medicines. Prior to prescribingcannabis for medical use, clinical guid- ance by the Irish Department of Health recommends conducting a full review of concomitant medicines and supplements. Particular care should be taken with sedatives, anti-spasticity agents and epilepsy medicines. Con- comitant CBD for example can elevate blood levels of clobazam and its active metabolite in children with refractory epilepsy, necessitating close monitor-ing of clobazam levels. A summary of available drug interaction information is shown in Figure 1. THC and CBD also inhibit CYP2C family (cytochrome P450 liver enzymes involved in break-down of drugs in the body) and CYP3A4 affecting the metabolism of a wide variety of co-medications. Conversely, several medications such as clarithromycin and sodium valproate inhibit THC and therebyincreasing levels. MedCan prescribing recommendations In line with prescribing for all medicines, the potential for harm must be weighed up against the potential for benefit for individual patients. Greenlight are supporting the education for pharmacists in pre- scribed medical cannabis, however the current guidance from regulators has been limited. The clearest clinicalguidance on medical cannabis pre- scribing for MS spasticity, chemother- apy induced nausea and epilepsy has been provided by the Irish Department of Health. The document updated in April 2019 includes details on taking patient history, administration routes (vaporizer, oil products, oral/mucosal sprays), dosage advice, safety and withdrawal, contraindications and possible side effects. In the UK NICE will formally publish clinical guidelines for prescribing of CBMP's in November 2019. The NICE draft for consultation made available in August 2019 gives clear recommendations for which indications CBMPs should be consid- ered and also flags research priorities. The guideline covers prescribing advice (and rationale and detailed evidence reviews behind each recom- mendation) for CBMPs in intractable nausea and vomiting, chronic pain, spasticity and treatment resistant epilepsy. A pertinent example is chronic pain, where use of THC in any form is not recommended and CBD may only be offered in a clinical trial.This conservative view is justified bythe NICE committee, as current evidence indicates benefits of CBMPs in pain are only modest in nature, along with limited evidence of opioid sparing. Though the report acknowl- edges that the number of people suffering chronic pain who may benefit is large, the application of an (as yet undisclosed) economic model (to compare cost benefit with existing treatments) deemed potential benefits small relative to 'high, ongoing costs' and CBMPs 'were not an effective use of NHS resource'. These reports raise important chal- lenges that stakeholders need to address, foremost the need for valid scientific and clinical evidence to replace individual anecdote. This is particularly important where interac- tions with concomitant medications may be at play. GreenLight Medicines are passionate about tacking these knowledge gaps by rigorous research, with the ultimate goal of offering safe and cost effective products that have clear benefits for prescribers and end users.

The world is reassessing cannabis. Today, over twenty countries across the globe have legalised the medical use of cannabis, with more recognis- ing the potential benets for the thousands of patients campaigning for access. Governments are playing a game of tug of war with one end cautious of the unknown, the other eager to unlock access. Here we will discuss current access to medicinal cannabis in the UK and the extent to which it has been legalised. \"The consensus amongst experts is that more clinical trials in real patients are needed to understand the therapeutic benefits and potential risks of these medicines.\" The change of law on November 1st, 2018 was a land-mark day in England, Wales and Scotland with special-ist clinicians listed on the General Medical Council's specialist register able to prescribe cannabis-based medicines for the rst time, without the need to seek approval from an expert panel. However, at present, many patients and their families who saw that day as a glimmer of hope in their treatment journey, are stillunable to access medicinal cannabis or face barriers even when eligible. The issue of access has been largely attributed to the lack of knowledge and clinical evidence around medic- inal cannabis, triggering reluctance amongst clinicians to prescribe these medicines. At present, there remains a limited number of randomised control trials for unlicensed cannabis-based medicinal products. This is partly due to the regulatory challenges of conductingresearch on Schedule I drugs, which cannabis was listed under prior to its rescheduling to Schedule II during November 2018. Medicinal cannabis is complex and physicians don't yet have all the information they need to condently prescribe it to their patients as theydo with other medicines. The consensus amongstexperts is that more clinical trials in real patients are needed to understand the therapeutic benets and potential risks of these medicines. Additionally, guidelines published by NHS England and other professional associations are requesting further research into cannabis-based medicinal products untilthese associations will recommend them for use. This makes it dicult for clinicians to go against recommen- dations from their governing body. Many trusts are refusing to pay for treatment even if the patient holds a prescription from a specialist. NHS data suggests that 12 patients have received cannabis-based medicines since the change in the law last year. 1 Despite this, the legal barriers to formally researching cannabis in a regulated setting are now changing and a future where eligible patients can have access to appropriately prescribed cannabis-based medicinal products is on the horizon. 1 Cannabis: Prescriptions. Mellen, Managing Director of Spectrum Therapeutics UK looks at access to medical cannabis and to what extent is medical cannabis now legalised Cosmo Feilding raw materials and a high protein and health-promoting food source for centuries, more likely millennia. The hemp plant has been used for construction, paper, textiles, ropes and other applications contributing significantly to the advance in western civilisation. Hemp was grown in Europe and most countries worldwide until the 1930s,after which cultivation got almosteradicated. Since the end of the 20th century, hemp is making a comeback and is emerging as one of the most rapidly growing agricultural and industrial markets that have emerged for decades. To clarify, we are talking about \"hemp\" (Cannabis sativa L. ), which is authorised under the EU's Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant species (Reg. 1308/2013) and contains less than 0,2% of THC, which means it is not psychoactive. The world is facing enormous challenges - how can we transition from high carbon to a low carbon economy? To achieve this, hemp has a valuable contribution to play andoffers economically viable solutions tohelp address some of the major challenges our societies currently face,including pollution, carbon emissions,plastics waste, world hunger, people's health, lack of jobs and rural underdevelopment. What are the key benefits of hemp? The production of Hemp is carbon negative, which means it absorbs more carbon from the atmosphere during its growth than is emitted by the equipment used to harvest,process and transport it. It is 10,000+ environmentally responsible industrial and consumer applications including bioplastics, composites, construction materials, high protein foods and beverages, health-promoting food supplements, textiles, paper products, biofuel, graphene substitutes. It gives major environmental benefits.Significant carbon sequestration, enhanced biodiversity and a late season food source for bees, land reclamation and phytoremediation. Also, hemp can be a profitable cash crop for farmers when permitted to utilise the whole plant. What are the barriers to growth? Almost 60 years ago, the hemp plant, which was widely used as food for centuries, was erroneously designated alongside the cannabis (marijuana)flower as a narcotic substance in the UN Single Convention. This has caused a lot of confusion as cultivation ofcannabis plants for industrial purposes is clearly exempted from the scope of international control because theindustrial hemp sector has been severely restricted in terms of onerous licensing procedures and unclear and complex European and national regulations dealing with hemp-derived food products. Hemp foods and drinks from flowers leaves and extracts re-emerged in the 1990s. In response to the introduction of the Novel Food catalogue in 1997, the hemp industry collated data about the volume of sales and product types which use hemp flowers and leaves and submitted it as requested. In 1998, the hemp industry received writtenconfirmation from the EU (PAFF Standing Committee) that: \"it was decided that foods containing parts ofthe hemp plant do not fall under the EU Regulation EC258/97 on Novel Foods and Novel Food ingredients.\" The second letter from PAFF confirmed hemp flowers and leaves are food ingredients. Hemp naturally, abundantly contains cannabinoids, is best known as cannabidiol (CBD). In the 21st century, awareness is rapidly increasing that consuming healthy foods andsupplements can be an importantLorenza Romanese, Managing Director of the European Industrial Hemp Association (EIHA) examines the future of hemp and explains in this vein, what is at stake, as well as looking back at its fascinating historyThe future for hemp: What is at stake?92PROFILE factor for our overall health and wellbeing. This prompted the introduction of hemp extracts in food supplements, commonly known as CBD oils. The reason hemp foods is so important to our health is that all humans and vertebrates have an important physiological system, the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS fulfils a vital role and aids homeostasis. Whilst our body produces its own, so-called endocannabinoids, this is not necessarily sufficient and we can maintain and support this important physiological system byconsuming phytocannabinoids, as we used to do for millennia. Hemp flowers, leaves and extracts are a traditional food Historical records show that naturally rich in CBD/cannabinoids hemp oils, flowers, leaves and hemp extracts were widely consumed. It was an integralpart of our European diet. During the last three years, the popularity of CBD containing food supplements prompted the PAFF committee to revisit the permittedconsumption of hemp products and on 20th January 2019, the same committee that previously acknowledged in writing to the hemp industry 20 years earlier, that hemp flowers and leaves is a food now changed their minds and changed theNovel Food catalogue only permitting seeds for food use. Overnight the legitimate hemp foods industry was declared novel, meaning there is nohistory of consumption prior to May 1997. In response, EIHA has prepared pieces of strong, extensive evidence that hemp cannabinoids/CBD have been consumed in Europe for centuries (insert a link to the evidence). One of the oldest cookbooks in the world, DeHonesta et Voluptate (1475) lists a recipe on how to make modern-day CBD oil, medieval monks ate hemp soup, an Italian recipe (1887) shows how to make hemp flower tortellini, a Polish cookbook lists hemp as avegetable, the Maltos-Cannabis Hemp Extract drink won a prize at the World Exhibition in Antwerp in 1894 and more. This evidence clearly shows that it is disingenuous to argue that leaves and flowers in food are novel today. Revitalise soil with nutrients.

The hemp flower and the leaves are the most profitable part of the plant. If the hemp sector is only allowed to use the seeds and stalks, alongside onerous licensing procedures, this is simply not sufficiently financially viable and undermines investment into R&D and the development of large- scale, next generation, environmentally responsible industrial and consumer products. The recent rewording of theNovel Food catalogue, therefore,threatens the entire European hemp industry as the process is expensive and a novel food application takes several years to assess. Due to the fact that the hemp industryreceived written confirmation fromthe EU (PAFF Standing Committee) in 1998 that hemp flowers/leaves are permitted for food use and the hemp industry can provide ample and substantial evidence that naturallyoccurring CBD has been in the human food chain for millennia, we request that our extensive evidence is considered and that the novel food catalogue is reworded, permitting hemp foods containing cannabinoids/ CBD up to levels that are naturally present in the plant (which was the status in 2018). This means that CBD containing food supplements contain no more than we would naturally consume if eating traditional hemp foods. So, what is at stake? The Hemp plant is capable of helping to solve some of the core issues we face: Foods and supplements (seeds/ flowers/leaves) maintain and support our health. The stalk provides zero carbon raw materials ideal for the next generation of environmentally responsible applications, helping mitigate the environmental emergency. The hemp industry has a real opportunity to play a leading role in the development and expansion of a low carbon, environmentally responsible industry, bringing a new 'cash-crop' to European agriculture and creating jobs across the entire supply chain. For hemp to be a viable cash crop for our farmers and processors, they need to be empowered to utilise the whole plant. EIHA and its members offer our extensive knowledge and expertise to help establish a framework permitting the use of the whole plant that satisfies both regulatory agencies and industry.Lorenza Romanese Managing Director European Industrial Hemp Association (EIHA)lorenza.romanese@eiha.org www.eiha.orgwww.twitter.com/EIHA16 \"CBD has been found to be generally well tolerated with a good safety profile.\" Excerpts from a letter of WHO Director General to Secretary-General of the United Nations, July 23, 2018 \"The Science Museum's three-storey building is constructed using a hemp- lime envelope and was so effective that they switched off all heating, cooling and humidity control for over a year, maintaining steadierconditions than in their traditionally equipped stores, reducing emissions while saving a huge amount ofenergy.\" Dr Mike Lawrence is Director of the University of Bath's new research facility, the Building Research Park \"It has been calculated that the serial implementation of the lightweight biomaterials on the high-volume vehicles will deliver a reduction of 40,000 tons of CO 2emissions and the ability to drive an additional 325 million kilometres with the samequantity of fuel.\" Source: Autocar Pro Newsdesk 3/2018. Hemp fieldThree years since research and intensive awareness efforts began dedicated to challenging prohibitive public barriers, our company has secured government authorisations and regulatory segregated individual licenses for the farming, processing, transportation, importing, exporting of hemp and its derivate by-product assortments, including CBD oil with its tremendously versatile industrialapplication potential. Mongolia, a country best known in the ancient times as the cross route of the Silk Road, connecting trade between Europe and Asia and today, it is morevisible in the eyes of international investors' eyes due to its vast mineralresources and untouched natural landscapes covering nomadic livestock grazing areas. Our company's planned activities are focused on building a production facility plant logistically close to large agricul- tural farmland resources, including around 15,000 hectares of wild hemp fauna of prime genetically unmodified strains of both hemp and cannabis seeds. The fertile soil unexploited over the last 50 years has recently become an industrial-scale crop cultivation field. However, the continental dry climate, prevailing meteorological conditions and relatively short cultivation season- ality factors have influenced the protection of the land from soil degra- dation and chemical contamination and helped to preserve the pristine qualities of hemp and have allowed the natural expansion of its growth area. As the first company licensed in Mongolia to farm and process hemp - our team of investors, advisors and staff worked hard to build a consensus team of different public agencies representatives and convinced these cross-sectoral officers about the unique opportunities of Mongolia as a country with multilateral and cross-board trade facilitation agreements on a regionallevel - with our biggest trading partners and good neighbours beingHemp Mongolia LLC reveals its implementation plan to build the largest hemp processing farm in the Central Asian steppes 94PROFILE Reviving the hemp market in the Central Asian steppesthe Russian Federation and People's Republic of China, as well as Singapore, South Korea, Japan and the European Union (EU). Also, our country is a Member State of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and an especially important agreement has been signed by the Mongolian Government with the Government of Japan that waives reciprocally export and sales taxes on traded goods. To build a strong community for the professional exchange of news and media coverage provided by theopportunities opened up by the digital communications, Hemp Mongolia LLC aims to develop a strong and unified working group of NGO's consisting of hemp industry professionals repre- senting countries in the Asian region, including India, Bhutan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Korea, Japan, Singapore so that that the hemp industry's latest product, technological market trends and trade flow developments can be followed by such working group members. A.Anar's sums up the role of Asia in the hemp and cannabis sector in his own words: \"Asia is moving in thehemp and cannabis sectors - thedevelopment is swifter following the oversight deregulations of industrially developed countries. This trend we follow may bring in the next round of significant ease in policy, inducing a potential hemp boom in the mid-term future. I believe the near future will determine Asia's marketplace as the price moving market force for hemp products due to its dominant con- sumption and volume demand. Meanwhile, Hemp Mongolia LLC successfully accomplished its first open-air greenhouse hemp plantation trial and formed the first steps to addvalue in its technological and chemical property research and laboratory testing results assurances. A.Anar then comments on this research in his own words: \"This research and trial phase following the formalisation of the licensing regulatory require- ments are an essential part of our work to study the previously undocumented and tested local seeds' genetic prop- erties of local hemp. The improvement of selection and breeding is a big piece of work to carry out after the revealed findings and a result of the sampling and testing of the large variety of wild indigenous genetically preserved species originating in the vast regions of Mongolia, potential has been identified.\" Phase 1: The U.S. sales volume statistics are approximately $130 million. For CBD sales and the discussions around the legal framework regulations in the Asian region, I suggest that the CBD production is still relatively low com- pared to the existing and historically traceable demand volume of cultivated hemp harvest for medicinal usage. CBD oils are again becoming the centre point of international discus- sions as an alternative and effective, 95PROFILE 96PROFILE naturally-low side effect carrying organic treatment for certain diseases and illnesses. Compared to the tradi- tionally strictly standardised other agricultural farming cultures, hemp is not a cost-intensive crop culture with modest loss and unpretentious to climatic conditions. The Mongolian climate has short cultivation periods and continental conditions and harsher climate leadsto improvements in the chemicalproperties of hemp as a medicinal plant. Cannabinoid science is now in the starting phase to explore the medicinal properties of CBDA, CBN, CBG and CBC. In summary, with this research and study trials of the Mongolian originated hemp cultures, I am sure that we will contribute to the development of the data bank of such scientific works and we will definitely be of an asset to the market of such R&D companies in the Asian region, as well as in the more industrially advanced countries. Phase 2: \"Hemp Mongolia LLC's second stage is to build an extraction plant for CBD and other medicinal cannabinoids from hemp. The selection and on-site study of the latest extraction systems and building GMP compliant facilities in Mongolia is the main goal for devel- oping and diversifying the export market based on the low-cost advan-tages of arable and cultivation land. Also, the plant facility land initial investment costs are attributed to the first industrial hemp processing plant licensed developer company. Already, during the beginning of our trial phase market, participants from Korea, Japan, Russian Federation, Germany and China have been approached with workable contacts and information exchange.\" A.Anar notes: \"Our company is confi- dent in a production strategy based on the two sources of raw material available for the start of processing.\" Firstly, wild hemp harvests, to be supplied for our production will bring in a relatively low material entry cost. The processing of wild hemp harvest will attract customers with a high awareness of a naturally and organically originated end product. The marketing and pricing of such pure organic hemp labelled products are commonly placed as high-end users preferred brands. Secondly, assisted and advised by our company's partners in Spain, we will be providing selected and improved Mongolian strains based on newly cultured raw hemp materials on an industrial scale from in-house and out-door greenhouse plantations built on fertile virgin soil, without any industrial chemical contamination. Such outdoor open-air and indoor and outdoor greenhouse cultivation areas will be operated on with up to 15,000 hectares of good clean soil land leased from the government for at least 20 years and should be renewable for further periods. \"HempMongolia LLC is closely working with and our activities are under the regulatory oversight of the Mongolian Government's respective agencies. Our company has invested major efforts since 2015 in early education, informing and awareness-building activities with public agencies. With an 'official' awareness of our company's activities, the benefits of hemp pro- duction and its exporting potentialsare a large preparatory work to improve the regulatory relationships necessary to be licensed as the first company,\" A.Anar said. A.Anar then develops this point further and recalls: \"During the first discussions, officials were ignorant about hemp farming, due to a lack of information and industry and market- specific latest developments covered in the international media, but mainly due to the barriers of an old stigma- tised approach to the hemp plant. So, we continuously provided scientific evidence and study to the agencies' responsible representatives, which could not ultimately afford to be ignored or overlooked simply due to the significant international trends in the regulatory environment. Presently, our company has been able to gain the support of the Ministry of Health,the Innovation Center, an agencyunder the auspice of the Mongolian Government Cabinet Administration and other governmental institutions.\" Phase 3: AGROPARK Located after a two hours paved road drive east to Ulaanbaatar, Baganuur is a suburban city close to the capital of Mongolia. The Baganuur city is a special tax-free zone for industrial production factories, approved fornew housing project developmentssupported and potentially to be financed by development agenciesfrom the Mongolian government. HempMongolia LLC is studying the utilities and logistics, infrastructure connectivity and communication suitability requirements for building its production plant facilities in this city area. Hemp Fibre, Hemp Food, Hemp Eco-Building Panels are some poten- tially profitable investment expansionareas for the environmentally friendly and green usage of Hemp industry investments. With the assistance of our advisor from Italy, Mrs Rachele Invernizzi is interested in the fibre and construction material domestic market, so our company will find investors forMongolian company's projects willingto co-operate in the long-term with HempMongolia LLC to fill the gap in these areas of production, in particu- lar, to offload the foreign exchange exposure of such importer companies and diversify their business to substi-tution materials manufacturing. Our company sees good opportunities ahead to create market demand internally in Mongolia, as well as a comfortable foreign market environ- ment for hemp growers and processing manufacturers and their sales agents. We are looking and willing to work to adopt the best international practicesof hemp regulations and to assist and cooperate with Mongolian regulatory agencies. Phase 4: HempMongolia LLC sees a good future ahead when it comes to participating in Asian professional NGO's to become one of the best working teams to represent the countries vision for wellbeing and prosperity. With the digital age present in the daily life of each of us, our company believes blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) will become the next facilitators for hemp value chain building participants. Hemp Mongolia LLC 97PROFILE The recent change in the Novel Food Catalogue, which is not a binding document, brought many negative consequences on the EU industrial hemp sector. Even if hemp extracts are not formally and legally forbidden by Europe, dispro- portionate and senseless measures have been taken against food products containing CBD in many European countries. What does the change mean? It means that this change in wording has turned the whole previously legitimate hemp extract and hemp (leaves/infructescense/flowers) supply into an industry that is now 'novel' and is required to apply for marketing authorisation prior to placing its products onto the market. This would be a long and very expensive process placing the entire EU hemp industry at risk. In addition, it is wholly unnecessary, illogical and illicit considering that: A. The hemp industry received written confirmation from the EU in 1998 that hemp flowers/leaves are permitted for food use, and B. Hemp has been in the human food chain for millennia and it is disin- genuous to argue that leaves and flowers in food are novel.What can you extract from the plant? Following any of the above four methods mentioned, you can obtain hemp extracts rich (but not unnaturally enriched) in CBD and other health supporting compounds. CBD is one ofthe 144 cannabinoids present in thehemp plant (mainly in the green partsof the plant). Consumers are buyingCBD mainly for its health maintaining and supporting (promoting) properties. Recent action by Member States and The Commission On the 20 January 2019 the previous entries for \"Cannabis sativa L.\" and for\"Cannabidiol\" were both rephrased. When the NF directive (Regulation (EC) 258/97) became implemented in 1997, the Commission requested the hemp industry provide evidence of consumption which was collated by Hanfgesellschaft and submitted to the Commission for their consideration. In responses from February and March 1998, the Commission con- firmed in letters to two FBOs that \"hemp flowers... are considered to befood ingredients\" and that \"foods con- taining parts of the hemp plant do not fall under the scope of the Regulation (EC) 258/97\" and a thriving hemp industry has since developed. Below is an analysis of the variousHere, European Union (EU) Novel Food regulations are thoroughly explored and questioned in the context of CBD in foodEU crackdown: Novel food regulation of CBD 98PROFILE 1st version from 1998 till 2017 Only one entry for Cannabis Sativa L.

What do the changes mean for the hemp industry? According to the catalogue, all food/food supplements products con- taining hemp leaves/infructescence (tea, snacks, muesli etc) or containing hemp extracts now need to obtain a pre-marketing authorisation in order to being placed on the market. These authorisations are costly in terms of time as an authorisation process takes two years plus and significant amounts of money (\u20ac300,000+ per product). Only large operators andcorporations will be able to afford the authorisation process. This way, Small and Medium Enterprises which mainly compose the EU market today, will be naturally left out of the market and alongside, this could potentially destroy the entire rapidly emerging and thriving European hemp industry. If Europe will not allow FBOs to fully exploit the plant as a direct conse- quence the EU hemp sector will col- lapse in favour of other markets, such as US, Canada, Switzerland and China. European Industial Hemp Association (EIHA.org) in cooperation with EU institutions are planning the next steps to be further developed with the aim to restore a regulation able to fulfil both scopes (part 1 point 2 of theNF regulation): protect the consumersand guarantee a smooth functioning of the internal market. What else is at stake? Hemp is emerging as one of the most rapidly growing agricultural and industrial markets in decades. 10,000+ applications including bio- plastics, construction, high protein foods and beverages, food supple- ments, textiles, paper products, com- posites, biofuel, graphene substitutes Major environmental benefits Carbon sequestration, enhanced biodiversity, land reclamation and phytoremediation, environmentally responsible industrial and consumer products Profitable cash crop for farmers when permitted to utilise the whole plant Plus multi-billion euro downstream markets Key environmental benefits Hemp protects the environment Hemp can be grown without the use of herbicides, pesticides or fungicides. Hemp is in the top 5 out of 23 crops for biodiversity friendliness, perform-ing better than all major crops such as wheat, maize or rapeseed. Excellent carbon sequestration One hectare of industrial hemp can absorb 15 tonnes of CO2per hectare. In comparison, agricultural land use emits approx. 3 tonnes CO2per hectare. Hemp's rapid growth also makes it one of the fastest CO2-to- biomass conversion tools available, more efficient than agro-forestry. Restores soil health Hemp is a valuable preceding crop in rotations. After cultivation the soil is left in optimum condition. Making one tonne of steel emits 1.46 tonnes of CO2and 198kg of CO2is emitted to make one tonne of rein-forced concrete. One square metre of timber framed, hemp-lime wall, after allowing for the energy cost of trans- porting and assembling the materials actually stores 35.5kg of CO2. Body panels and chassis components in cars made from hemp are lighter weight than steel or metal which improves fuel consumption. Every bit of plastic, carpeting and upholstery in a car can be made of hemp. For hemp to be a viable cash crop for our farmers and processors, they need to be empowered to utilise the entire plant. The new Novel Food classification threatens the entire nascent enviro - nmentally friendly European hemp industry and we seek your support to raise awareness. Michal Tozser CBDepot Tel: UK: Risky business? Few can have failed by now to spot that cannabis and cannabis derivatives, are increasingly big business, not only in countries like Canada, but also right here in the UK. But the question of how thisbrave new world ts with the UK's institutional attitude towards cannabis is an important one and divides intodomestic and international issues. Taking the domestic rst, those who grow, sell or do research on cannabis in the UK itself need to register with and obtain licences from a specialist Home Oceunit, which is dealing at present with a very large number of applications and enquiries. Businesses that expect an easy ride from the unit, or to be able to deal with it on a commercial basis, can become frustrated with its processes and mind-set, which are - understandably, perhaps - particularly focused on the security aspects of what the law still considers a dangerous drug. The casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that the position is more nuanced than it is, thanks to eye- catching headlines in autumn last year to the eect thatmedical cannabis had been legalised 1. In fact, what has happened was that an exception has been made for 'cannabis-based medicinal products' (CBMPs), though only where prescribed by a specialist clinician (not just a general practitioner) or granted a marketing authori- sation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Reg- ulatory Agency (MHRA)2. Those restrictions have proved to be strict in practice and the headlines now are about why, despite the legal change, the number of patients who can actually access medicinal cannabis here remains extremely small3and patients who are forced to obtain their medicines abroad are still seeing them seized at the border4. Another common misconception is that cannabis, or cannabis products, with a THC level below 0.2% arestraightforwardly legal in the UK. It arises because the threshold is relevant for various purposes in European Union (EU) legislation and other EU jurisdictions and in the UK plays a role in determining when the specialist licensing unit of the Home Oce would be prepared to entertain applications for a cultivation licence (andwhat fees would be applicable for such licences). Butwhere the question is whether a substance contains THC, so as to make it a controlled drug, it plays no roleat all and the better legal view is that if there is any measurable THC content, the prohibition applies (subject, of course, to having a Home Oce licence). 5 That same question has also given rise to widespread confusion about CBD oils and other CBD products in the UK, which are increasingly ubiquitous on the high street. An MHRA statement in 20166, to the eect that it would treat CBD products that had medical purposes (a category that, in practice, largely depends on how they are marketed) as medicines, was widely misunder- stood: while those few CBD products that are describedin that way will need MHRA authorisation, the statement has no eect on the broader 'wellness' market, including food supplements, or on (say) cosmetics, or vaping products. Many who are not well versed in this area Is the cannabis industry in the UK a risky business? John Binns, Partner at BCL Solicitors LLP finds out more John Binns, Partner at BCL Solicitors LLP101may in fact be taking the risk of products being seized, premises raided, or personnel arrested. The international issue, meanwhile, is that businesses planning to invest in cannabis overseas and then bring the proceeds here (or otherwise involve UK-incorporated entities), should also have UK money laundering laws in mind. Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, it is an oence to do virtually anything with the proceeds of 'criminal conduct', which is dened to include conductthat is lawful overseas but that would be unlawful if it occurred here. That does not necessarily mean that a UK investor in a Canadian cannabis company, for instance, is breaking the law by doing so. But there are judgement calls to be made about whether, when and how the investment should be reported to the National Crime Agency, with the aim of obtaining consent. Importantly, they are not made in isolation but alongside similar judgement callsby banks and others in the regulated sector, who have their own responsibilities to consider. In the background of both sets of issues is the divide between medicinal and recreational use, as various jurisdictions consider where to draw their lines and thegrowing 'wellness' market blurs the divide still further. The UK, it seems, has some considerable way to go before even strictly medicinal cannabis is available to all who need it. In time, perhaps, the UK may follow the example of Canada and others and adopt a more relaxed approachto cannabis. But for now at least, businesses that want to operate here must temper their enthusiasm by taking a proper look at their plans through a law enforcement lens and making sure they stay on the right side of the law as it is today.

From the offices at MHRA to the shops of the high street, policymakers, health practitioners, retailers and shoppers want to learn more about how this hemp-derived compound is created, processed and consumed. To help understand this \"mighty molecule,\" Mile High Labs offers the following information on CBD by the Numbers. \"The industry is growing, with potentially significant job creation on the horizon. In the past year, Mile High Labs has gone from opening its doors to having 11 full-time staff in its European headquarters in Belfast and a further nine in its London office and across the rest of the UK.\" 113 CBD is one of an estimated 113 cannabinoids that is found in the cannabis plant. Other cannabinoids include CBG, CBN, CBC and the more widely-known THC.1 All 113 cannabinoids can be found in both marijuana and hemp plants. What typically differentiates the two is the amount of THC content in the plant. Since the passage of the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill, the term \"hemp\" has been used to describe cannabis plants that contain 0.3% or less THC by dry weight.Mile High Labs extracts exclusively from industrial hemp due to its low THC and high CBD content. The result is a line-up of compliant CBD ingredi- ents fit for a rapidly growing number of global markets. 2018 The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018,2more commonly known as the Farm Bill, legalised hemp production in the United States. It was this legislation that essentially jump-started CBD pro- duction in America and precipitated the global interest in the product. That same year, the UK Government changed the law to allow doctors to prescribe cannabis under extremely limited circumstances, opening up the UK CBD market to rapid growth. Authorities in the European Union (EU)Member States now regard food, drink and food supplements with CBD as a \"novel food.\" A key regulation of novel foods is premarket authorisation which means any manufacturer intending to put CBD into food are required to applyto the European Commission. 14% & 41% According to a Gallup poll, 14% of Americans use CBD. According to the report, \"Younger Americans and those in the Western U.S. are most likely to report using these products, whichare widely touted for their therapeutic benefits without any psychoactive effects because they contain a low level of THC.\" 3 In May, Open Access Government reported that \"41% of Londoners would use CBD to manage their mental health.\"4John Wallace, Managing Director of Mile High Labs, International, shares with us why CBD continues to be one of the most exciting new products to hit the marketplace and focuses here on some significant numbers in the fieldCBD by the numbers: Exciting new products on the market 102PROFILE And in early 2019, an analysis by UK- based online deals platform Wowcher revealed that purchases have almost doubled in the past year, with UK residents rushing to buy products containing the ingredient that is nowused in copious health and beauty products. 5 \u00a31,000,000,000 According to a study by the Centre for Medical Cannabis (CMC), the market for CBD in the UK could be nearly \u00a31 billion in six years.6Additionally, the report provides wide-ranging recom- mendations for industry success, including amending existing out-of- date legislation; clarity relating to current policy; investment in medicalresearch; and self-regulation among current business operators. Many industry commentators and members of the CMC welcomed the report argu- ing that clear, consistent regulation is in the long-term interests of consumers and the industry alike, ensuring standards for consistency, quality and transparency. 7 The Association for Cannabinoid Industry, created by the CMC, recently announced \"The Cannabinoid Industry Quality Charter,\" which is a seven-pillar framework to help foster a legally compliant, socially responsible and innovative CBD industry in the UK. Those pillars include a legal frame- work, testing, manufacturing, labelling, controlled drugs, marketing ethics andsustainability & social impact. 7Mile High Labs is a leading member of the ACI and has previously worked closely with the Centre for Medicinal Cannabisin drafting and launching its reports. 9001 ISO 9001:2015 is an internationalstandard for quality management systems for companies that operate in a regulatory environment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administra- tion currently does not have regula- tions in place for the production and packaging of dietary supplements or food containing CBD. As a result, the quality, consistency and purity of CBD products can vary significantly. Instead of waiting for regulations, Mile High Labs have moved forward with \"self-regulation\" and earned certification for ISO 9001:2015, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and other certificationsto elevate the industry and give customers the confidence that their CBD is of the highest possible quality. 400,000 The square footage of Mile High Labs'new production facility is 400,000. Located near Denver, Colorado (the \"Mile High City\"), this former pharma-ceutical plant allows the company to produce large quantities of tinctures, capsules, tablets, topicals and gum- mies in a controlled and compliant environment. Mile High Labs CBD isolate is the key ingredient for some of the industry's most recognised products. With greater than 98% potency, our CBD isolate is extracted in a highly controlled environ- ment and processed to guarantee industry-leading purity and consistency. While some isolate manufacturers may claim over 99% potency, there is currently no regulation for the analyt- ical testing methods that generate these results. Statistically speaking, there will always be variability inpotency testing. But some companies that claim higher potencies are merely using less accurate testing methods that could bias the results high. 20 20 is the number of UK residents currently employed by Mile High Labs.

This can happen through cannabinoids that the body naturally produces itself (endo- cannabinoids) or through cannabis- cannabinoids such as CBD. types of cannabinoid receptors: CB1 and CB2 receptors. CB1 receptors are mainly in the brain and the central nervous system and CB2 receptors are mainly in the peripheral organs, and especially in the immune cells. Controlling theHuman Endocannabinoid System plays an important role in maintaining overall good health. What is CBD and is it safe? CBD (cannabidiol) is one of the many active compounds in the marijuana plant. There are over 100 different compounds, know as 'cannabinoids'. The most well-known is compound is THC, the \"psychoactive\" component of cannabis that makes people feel 'high'. CBD is another cannabinoid which has very different and benefi- cial health and wellbeing effects, with scientists discovering more every day. The most important thing to know about CBD is that it is non-psychoac- tive and won't get you 'high'. In a WHO report published in 2018, they stated that naturally occurringCBD is safe and well tolerated in humans. They concluded that therewere no negative public health effects.Who are MariPharm? MariPharm is a ground-breaking Phyto-Pharmaceutical Company that produces the highest quality, pharma- ceutical grade CBD oil in the world. MariPharm was founded in the Netherlands in 1995 and for more than two decades has undertaken pioneering research into the cannabis plant. MariPharm was the first company worldwide to receive a government license to grow, research, process and sell Medicinal GradeCannabis (MGC) which they exclusively provided to the public between 1995 and 2003. With over 30,000 patients having benefited from the use of MariPharm's MGC products, they have a wealth of knowledge in the use of cannabis, especially when relating to strains and genetics of the plant for different impacts and ailments. Milestone moments in MariPharm's pioneering history: 1995- MariPharm become the first company to receive a government license to grow, research, process and sell Medicinal Grade Cannabis. 1999- The Royal Pharmaceutical Soci- ety of Great Britain invite MariPharm to the UK to discuss the therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids. 2002- MariPharm break The Single Convention of New-York (1961) by exporting 1 Kilogram of MGC to theUK, licensed by the Dutch Ministry of Health Welfare and Sport. 2013- MariPharm founder was granted a special benefit working license on medicinal cannabis from the Canadian authorities in order to consult for a large Canadian Medicinal Cannabis company. 2008-2017- MariPharm's experienced team consulted on Medicinal Cannabis businesses around the globe. Countries include Israel, Czech Republic, Uruguay, U.S. and Canada. MariPharm has consistently used innovative technologies, developing a revolutionary extraction process forCBD oil that guarantees the highest quality product, formulated from MariPharm's unique patented genetics. MariPharm maintains a state of the art manufacturing and grow facility with a dedicated high-tech laboratory - with third-party quality oversightand testing of each batch of product guaranteed by a renowned laboratory approved by the Dutch government to issue Certificates of Analysis. MariPharm's quality and clinical trials MariPharm products set the standard worldwide in producing and analysing cannabidiol with every batch goingthrough stringent quality control measures to ensure the best quality product every time. 104PROFILE Here, General Manager Bart den Hertog, introduces MariPharm, the world's first medicinal cannabis business, highlighting the company's major milestone moments, its clinical trial process and recommended product dosageMariPharm: The world's first medicinal cannabis companyYears of painstaking research sup- ported by leading scientists, pharma- cists, doctors, and government specialists, backed by an Opium License from the Dutch Ministry of Health Welfare and Sport, have resulted in the world's finest quality CBD and cannabis derived products. MariPharm CBD oil is currently undergoing double-blind placebo and observational trails. Seed to Sale To ensure the highest quality standard of CBD products, MariPharm believes it is essential to engage with every step of the supply chain. From harvesting our seeds, laboratory testing for quality, to distributing our exceptional finished products (see image). MariPharm products MariPharm produces nutritional dietary food supplements and cos- metic products that can be purchased at various pharmacies and through the MariPharm online web shop across Europe. MariPharm also holds Dutch Govern- ment permits and currently has several new ground-breaking CBDproducts under development that will be introduced in the very near future. \"I have been interested in the devel- opments in the CBD sector for some time now and have seen for myself the effectiveness. However, not all CBD products are the same, so after trial and error, I now only use MariPharm in the clinic - I trust the brand implicitly.\" Dr Aamer Khan, Harley Street Skin Clinic Colour, taste and aroma - What to look for in a high quality CBD oil Purity and quality of CBD oil is recog- nised by the colour. CBD oils that appear brown, discoloured and sticky have undergone an incomplete extraction and purification process through which unnecessary and potentially harmful residues mayremain. Along with the colour of CBD oil, the flavour, taste and aroma of the CBD product also indicate how the produc-tion process has taken place. Some CBD products have a bitter taste or anunpleasant aftertaste, which can also indicate pollution.The MariPharm extraction process produces a completely pure and transparent product which has a pleasant taste and a neutral aroma. MariPharm CBD recommended dosage Recommendations: Begin with three drops three times a day. The number of drops can be increased, if desired - always consult your doctor. It is recommended to administer the oil into the mouth sublingually by placing the drops directly under the tongue. If the drops are administered directly under the tongue, the drops should be retained in your mouth for between 10-30 seconds before swallowing. In this way, the body immediately absorbs the active substance which provides rapid and optimal effects rel- ative to the rate of absorption of active substances through the stomach. For the best results and the highest level of absorption, it is recommend to take CBD five minutes after a meal (breakfast/lunch/dinner). Bart den Hertog General Manager MariPharm B.V.

During the past five years, CBD and other cannabi- noid-based goods have gained a very large market share; adopting custom from other lifestyle categories, such as alcohol, tobacco/vaping, cosmetics and health foods. Almost a year ago, in September 2018 According to Canada's BNN Bloomberg , the drinks giant Coca Cola began talks with Canadian producer Aurora Cannabis to begin developing cannabinoid-infused beverages. Show-casing how this industry has only just begun to be shaped by large corpora- tions, who are bringing cannabidiol into the mainstream marketplace and retailers' shelves, \"along with many others in the beverage industry, we are closely watching the growth of non- psychoactive cannabidiol as an ingre- dient in functional wellness beverages around the world,\" Coca-Cola said in a statement . Constellation Brands in August 2018 , showed their own interest, by vowing to invest over $4 billion into Canadian producers Canopy Growth, with $200 million spent on the research and development of a Cannabis-based alcoholic beverage utilising their Corona brand. Once again, showing that at this turning point within thecannabinoid industry, large corpora- tions are focussed on bringing cannabidiol products to the main- stream aisles of supermarkets; and not the alternative health sections or stores - but a diverse range of mainstream products enhanced with cannabidiol. To a lesser extent, Canna Investments - the Owner of Canna CBD and Green Coffee Lab , have positioned them- selves to replicate these movements into the mainstream sector but on a more local scale within the UK market- place. By utilising their own seed to shelf production capabilities, along with retail and marketing experience, Canna Investments has championed a unique approach to bringing new cannabinoid enhanced products to market via its own retail outlets posi- tioned within the high streets of the UK and to an extent, in Europe and Asia. This approach offers an uncom- promised view to education, product knowledge and expertise within the arena. Canna CBD, the cannabinoid produc- tion arm of Canna Investments, was founded by Timothy Acton in 2017. Offering a range of typical CBD prod- ucts, in the form of dropper bottles, sprays, cosmetics and oral syringes packed with full-spectrum extracts, as well as a fully-fledged white label programme offering over 50 clients production of their own branded cannabinoid products. Canna CBD in2019, turned its focus to the produc- tion of mainstream consumer food products. \"It is a fair assessment that cannabinoid enriched products are making a mark on various sectors within fast-moving consumer goods; and Canna Investments intends on pushing its own boundaries consecutively to provide its consumers, clients and associates the highest levelof service, education and knowledge of this ever-shifting industry.\" Opening its first branch of the Green Coffee Lab in May 2019, focussing on offering products incorporating the benefits of a cannabinoid enriched diet. Green Coffee Lab in its short inception has faced media acclaim, featuring in television programmes for BBC and ITV news. With its own hospitality department and hotelofferings, Green Coffee Lab has become one of the core factors in bringing Cannabinoid products to the forefront of consumers daily routines. Working closely with an Essex, UK- based brewery to expand its cannabi- noid enriched alcohol offering. It is apparent from market research, that cannabinoid-based products share a large consumer group with the alcohol market. A joint study by researchers at two U.S. universities and one in South America claims a reduction in the U.S.'s overall alcoholCanna CBD Limited chart the impact of cannabidiol on mainstream fast-moving consumer goods, adopting custom from other lifestyle categories, such as alcohol, tobacco/vaping, cosmetics and health foodsThe impact of cannabidiol on mainstream fast-moving consumer goods 106PROFILEconsumption appears directly related to the rise of medical marijuana laws . Over the ten years studied, counties located in medical marijuana states showed almost a 15% reduction in monthly alcohol sales . Analysts at Cowen & Co., have illustrated the very real threat that cannabinoid enriched products have on the $1.2 trillion global alcohol market - quoting: \"While recreational cannabis has only limited availability, the rise of cannabis consumption more broadly looks to be weighing on alcoholic bev- erage consumption, where it is now in decline for men and higher-income consumers.\" This correlation of data has lead Canna Investments to focus more on the production of alcohol-based prod- ucts, along with its line-up of food supplements due to this public per-ceptional shift on cannabis, cannabi- noid-based products and how they interact with health at a social andlifestyle level. One of the core productline ups for the Green Coffee Lab has been its full spectrum enriched coffee beans; infused at the point of roastingfor maximum effect. With single-point origin in Columbia, utilising the exper- tise of Master Baristas, Green Coffee Lab has produced a beautiful blend of full-spectrum CBD enhanced coffee beans for the retail market, allowing further accessibility to cannabinoid products and a new home for them on supermarket shelves. This thought process has continued into Green Coffee Labs subsidiary Leafy hotel - a hotel focussed on bringing cannabi-noid accessibility, education and com- fort to the forefront of its ethos. With terpene infused bed linen as a sleep aid and an array of CBD products on offer for guests to enjoy, such as shampoo, conditioner, tea, coffees and hot chocolate stocking the rooms. It is here, where Canna Investments has focussed its consumer research - utilising an array of customers from multiple backgrounds with its retail and hospitality sectors to glean data for its New Product Development machine. Utilising this newfound consumer research to develop further products such as variants of Canna CBD's oral sprays, vegan cosmetics and further enriched products. In summary; it is a fair assessmentthat cannabinoid enriched products are making a mark on various sectors within fast-moving consumer goods; and Canna Investments intends on pushing its own boundaries consecu- tively to provide its consumers, clients and associates the highest level of service, education and knowledge of this ever-shifting industry. Overall, Canna Investments, has vari- ous ambitions within the cannabinoid industry; ranging from construction and property development utilising its proprietary hempcrete methods, as well as agricultural development, coin- ciding with its already established nature as a production facility and retail division, with a keen vision and goal to achieve, we firmly believe there is room within the industry for a UK-based business to expand within the competitive marketplace.

Prior to this cannabis andcannabis derivatives were largely classied as schedule 1 controlled substances, with an associated narrative centred on prohibition, addiction and potential adverse health eects. This law change has led to an increasingly informed and nuanced discussion focussed on the scientic facts and clinical evidence around the potential benets of cannabis-based medicines to treat a number of long- term health conditions, including epilepsy. For context, cannabis-based medicines is a blanket term for products containing cannabis or cannabis derivatives that are produced and regulated as medic- inal products for humans. 1As with most medicines, it is two active compounds present in the cannabis plant, specically cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabi- nol (THC) that are of clinical signicance and the current focus of debate. CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, seems to be following in the footsteps of turmeric and aloe vera in its portrayal by some as the next holistic super supple- ment. In comparison THC, a psychoactive cannabinoid associated with the sensation of getting 'high' in the recreational context, continues to be viewed with caution. There are a myriad of CBD products available as over the counter 'supplements' sold in health food shops across the country. These products are not of a pharmaceutical standard and by law cannot claim any medical benets. They often contain very low quantities of CBD and have no notable clinical eects.However, there is good quality clinical evidence for the safety and ecacy of CBD-containing medicine Epidy- olex as an add-on treatment two iting intractable epilepsy syndromes, Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes. This evidence is in the form of Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), the 'gold standard' of clinical evidence. The existence of positive RCT evi- dence has paved the way for Epidyolex to move towards UK market authorisation. It has already received market authorisation for these indications in the U.S. The lack of such evidence for other cannabis-based medicines, particularly those containing both THC and CBD, is proving to be a critical stumbling block to access for people with epilepsy. The powerful and compelling stories of Billy Caldwell and Ale Dingley, two young boys with severe and treatment-resistant epilepsies, became front-page news in the UK last year and played a critical role in the change in the law. Both had been treated with cannabis-based medicines containing THC and CBD abroad and showed notable clinical improvements in seizure control and quality of life. Tireless campaigning by their mothers led to both children being prescribed medicine containing both THC and CBD on the NHS. They remain the only two NHS prescriptions of this type that we are aware of. It is a bitter irony for many people aected by severeand treatment- resistant epilepsies that the very cannabis-based medicines that led to the change in the law are as inaccessible now as they were before.Despite THC's incarnation as a chemical bogeyman, many families of children aected by severe epilepsies are convinced that medicines with a 1:20 or 1:1 ratio of THC: CBD are the most eective. This is not without basis. Other G7 countries, most notably Canada andSam Mountney, Senior Policy & Campaigns Officer at Epilepsy Action, shares his expertise on cannabis-based medicines as a treatment for epilepsy in the UKMEDICAL CANNABIS & CBD 109the United States, and European Union Member States such as the Netherlands, allow varying degrees of access to treatments containing both THC and CBD for epilepsy. In the Canadian example, the lack of RCTevidence is weighed against data from observational trials, pre-clinical studies and available evidence on the endocannabinoid system and epilepsy. 2 Initial interim clinical guidance for both paediatric andadult epilepsies recommend against prescribing products containing THC and CBD in almost all circumstances.Recent draft guidance from the National Institute forHealth and Care Excellence (NICE), which will ultimately supersede the interim guidance, indicates this is unlikely to change. A separate NICE technical appraisal process is ongoing in respect of Epidyolex to treat Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome and a decision is expected later in 2019. Epilepsy Action is in complete agreement with clinicians, regulators, and the government about the need for more high-quality research. A recent NHS report 3indi- cates the strongest commitment so far to move this research forward at pace. Commitments of political willand, crucially, funds for vital research are welcome, but they must be followed through. Almost a year after the change in the law, patients remain unable to access cannabis-based medicines for epilepsy in all but a minority of cases and the debatecontinues. In one respect, the need for high-quality clinical evidence is a routine and necessary debatearound access to medicines. In another, this debate is unique in trying to unpick decades of prohibition and instigating a battle between avid campaigners callingon compelling anecdotal evidence and international research to push for immediate access, and a UK regulatory system that will seemingly only accept the elusive gold standard RCT evidence. \"CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, seems to be following in the footsteps of turmeric and aloe vera in its portrayal by some as the next holistic super supplement. In comparison THC, a psychoactive cannabinoid associated with the sensation of getting 'high' in the recreational context, continues to be viewed with caution.\" Epilepsy Action is committed to ensuring people with epilepsy can access the best drugs at the right time. Though by no means a magic bullet, the hopes of manyaected by severe and treatment-resistant epilepsies are rmly hung on cannabis-based medicines. Hope is often in short supply for these people and there is a clear need for a short-term solution to allow compas- sionate access for those who could benet. The timefor waiting is over, the time for action is now.

Two recent surveys estimated that 4-6 million people have tried CBD in the UK alone, and you can now find CBD in major retail stores and advertised on television. After years of being a niche product, CBD has now hit the mainstream andmany entrepreneurs and established brands see the opportunity to capi- talise on the growth. While it may seem relatively simple at first, there is a lot to consider when taking your first steps in entering this new market. \"Ethnopharm is a key resource for the cannabis industry, their experienced consultants can assist you with regulatory guidance, compliant product sourcing, labelling requirements, branding and marketing, and distribution channels.\" Know the laws and regulations Having a deep understanding of the laws and regulations surrounding CBD and other cannabinoids is crucial before you begin sourcing products and building your brand. Failing to do so could lead to hefty fines, criminal convictions or even jail. CBD is legal across the majority of European Union (EU) member statesbut businesses should always research to ensure your products comply with the law in your jurisdiction, and com- panies such as Ethnopharm can assist you in ensuring you are complying with your local regulations. Setting up your business It is crucial to have all the correct legal documents in place at the start of the business to avoid banana skins down the track. Whether you are in business on your own, or in partnership with other people, good Shareholders Arti- cles of Association are crucial to set- ting the right structure for the running of the business. Who is doing what, how are decisions made and when, and what happens when the business needs funding or a change of direc- tion? If you manage to successfully grow your business and look to bring in other partners or investors, or tosell the business, having a good administration structure is extremely important. Get a bank account Every business needs a bank account and CBD businesses are no different, but unfortunately at the moment the banking industry is still wary and making it difficult for CBD companies to open bank accounts. Although CBD is legal across most of the world the banking institutions still see these products as being high risk with potential links to money launder-ing, which is far from the truth for CBD retailers, but it takes time to break these barriers down. There are some banks that are supportive, and companies are also known to register their business under a non-CBD associated name and trade under the CBD brand. Branding Building a brand's image can deter- mine its product lines and offerings. Carry out market research to deter- mine your target audience and createa brand identity and image that your customers engage with. Markets you may want to focus on are health and wellness, sports and fitness and beauty and cosmetics. In a competi- tive market customers buy into brand ethics so be sure to tell a story and stick to your values. Find compliant suppliers Hundreds of companies out there will supply you with bulk ingredients 110PROFILE Liam McGreevy and Elliott Findon from Ethnopharm Ltd highlight the key factors businesses must consider in order to set up a successful CBD brand, including; regulatory guidance, compliant product sourcing and labelling requirementsSo, you want to start a CBD brand?or finished products, white label, private label or bulk CBD opportuni- ties. Each has their advantages and disadvantages. Branded CBD products: Most CBD brands are looking for resellers of their products to build their brand presence and drive more sales. This can be a great way of enter- ing the CBD industry with minimum investment. Pros: Low minimum order quantities. Cons: Limited control and smaller profit margins. White label White label CBD products are formu- lated and manufactured by an original supplier and then rebranded and packaged by other companies. This isa very popular option for start-up businesses and it is estimated that 90% of CBD brands in Europe are produced under white label. Before choosing white label it is important to consider how transparent your sup-plier is. Many can provide 3rd party lab reports and certificates of analysis but can they provide information on the whole process from cultivation to manufacture? Pros: Unlike reselling existing brands white label allows you to build your own brand. Meaning you have complete control of branding your business. White label suppliers usually have low minimum order quantities meaning you can build a CBD range quickly with minimum expense. Cons: Although white label gives you the opportunity to build a brand, the ingredients and formulation withinyour products can be sold by the whitelabel manufacturer to other brands. This means although your brand isunique your product almost certainly won't be this can make it hard to stand out in a saturated market. Private label Similar to white label, private label is where a manufacturer formulates a custom product on your behalf. This means you get a unique custom-built product branded to your requirements. Pros: Unlike White label, private label gives you more control over your finished product. Cons: Private label is more expensive, often with higher minimum order quantities. Labelling requirements After choosing a reputable supplier and products it is now time to turn your focus to labelling requirements for your CBD products. The legalrequirements can be complex, whether your product is food, cosmetic or vape, the safety of the ingredients is paramount within the EU, and if your product is not labelled correctly thiscan result in significant fines and reparation work, particularly with major high street retail chains. Marketing Marketing your CBD brand can be tricky, usual forms of paid digital adver- tising such as Facebook and Google are off-limits for CBD companies as both Facebook and Google restrict cannabis product advertising on their platforms. This means CBD marketers need to get creative to push theirbrands. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are great places to reach your target audience through organic likes,post regular updates and product testimonials to your social media pages to boost engagement. Making use ofinfluencers is a very effective way to spread the message of your brand. Sales & distribution Once you covered off the company, product, labelling and branding, you need to start generating revenue! Sales channels are the same for CBD products as any other, D2C ecommerce or B2B into retailers. If you have carried out some initial market research, you should have an indication of where the majority of the value is. For a small company without big retail connections D2C is a good way to get early revenue and brand traction while you work your way into the retail channels. Payment merchants can be an issue, for which Ethnopharm has a ready-made solution. Major retailers bring huge consumerfootfall but require significant market- ing budget to increase the awareness of those consumers and convert themto buyers while in store, therefore smaller specialist health food retailers are a good early avenue to generate consistent bulk orders. Ethnopharm is a key resource for thecannabis industry, their experienced consultants can assist you with regu- latory guidance, compliant productsourcing, labelling dis - cussed the treatment of cancer , this second piece will focus on the use of cannabinoids to treat pain. Cannabinoids are active molecules found within the cannabis plant and include CBD and THC, two of the most notable cannabinoids currently being studied. In the U.S. alone, the number of individ- uals suffering from chronic pain is close to 100m,1with two thirds of patients feeling that current medication does not meet their needs.2More people suffer from chronic pain than cancer, heart disease and diabetes combined.3 Patients use cannabis to treat multiple forms of pain, with cannabis shown to address neuropathic (burning or lanci- nating), mechanical (dullness or aching) and inflammatory (acute or sharp) pain components or sensations. Cannabinoid receptors are expressed in the peripheral and central nervous systems, as well as on immune cells. Pre-clinical data, in vivoanimal model studies and a small number of clinical trials in acute, neuropathic, chronicand cancer pain models suggest that CB1 and CB2 receptors play an impor- tant role in pain processing and that modulation of the endocannabinoid system can alleviate pain. 4 However, clinical trials have also shown that a thorough understanding of the interplay of various cannabinoids (e.g.THC vs. CBD) 5and their specificity fordifferent pain conditions, is essential to develop targeted pain medications that can help sufferers. A growing body of research suggests that cannabis' psychoactive ingredi- ents may enhance the pain-killing effects of opiate drugs, allowing patients using cannabis to take lower doses of opiate medications. Research in JAMA Internal Medicine found thatdeaths associated with the use of opiate drugs fell in 13 states after medical cannabis laws were intro- duced. 6Those states that permitted patients to consume medical cannabis saw a 24.8% drop in opiate-related overdoses over six years. However, these findings have since been thrown into doubt following the publication of a recent paper which suggests that claims that the enactment of medical cannabis laws reduces opioid related deaths should be met with cynicism.7The paper goes on to state that the association between these two factors does not hold when a more extensive data set from 2017 is analysed. As cannabis continues to develop a foothold in the pain management market, product improvement cycles are likely to accelerate when research into individual cannabinoids becomes sufficiently advanced to allow thedevelopment of more personalised medicine. Current therapeutic options for patients living with pain are limitedand consist predominantly of opioids and anti-inflammatory drugs. Over the years, it has become clear that the continued use of opioids has reached a crisis point in western economies, with many patients now dependent on these drugs. This fact, together withthe large number of patients who do not react to the pain medication cur- rently available on the market, high- lights the need to develop additional methods of safer pain medication. In drafted guidelines surrounding cannabis-based medicinal products published by NICE, the importance of collecting robust evidence regarding the long-term safety and effectiveness of medical cannabis was highlighted in order to remove barriers surrounding its prescription. 18Rigorous, high-qual- ity investigations into the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of pain are urgently required, as advised by The British Pain Society19, in order for government policies surrounding the use of medical cannabis in pain treatment to be reformed and this therefore remains as one of Oxford Cannabinoid Technologies' main areas of focus.

Rheumatology92006Compared Sativex, a cannabis-extract mouth spray, with placebo in a randomised double-blind parallel group study in 58 patients receiving over 5 weeks of treatment for pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis. The results showed that the nabiximols oromucosal spray (Sativex) was statistically superior in reducing morning pain on movement and at rest. Neurology102007The results of a randomised placebo-controlled trial showed that smoked cannabis was well tolerated, and effectively relieved chronic neuropathic pain induced by HIV-associated sensory neuropathy. The findings were comparable to oral drugs used for chronic neuropathic pain. Headache Pain112012Compared the efficacy of nabilone and ibuprofen in reducing pain and headache frequency in 30 adults with long-standing, intractable Medication Overuse Headache (\"MOH\"). After eight weeks of treatment with each, nabilone was found to be statistically significantly more effective than ibuprofen in reducing pain intensity on a visual analogue scale and the number of concurrent daily analgesic therapies. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology122013A clinical study of 21 patients with Crohn's disease who did not respond totherapy with steroids, immunomodulators, or anti-tumour necrosis factor- alpha agents. The study showed that smoked cannabis was statistically superior to placebo for pain relief, but not in the induction of remission. European Journal of Pain132014A study of 303 patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) rated their pain on a PNP 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS). The results showed a statistically significant difference favouring a THC/CBD spray over a placebo alongside their current analgesic therapy. Measures of sleep quality also demonstrated statistically significant treatment differences in favour of the THC/CBD spray. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology142018Assessed the possible pain and functional amelioration associated with medical cannabis therapy for low back pain (\"LBP\") in fibromyalgia (\"FM\") patients. The study demonstrated an advantage of medical cannabis therapy in FM patients with LBP, as compared with standard analgesic therapy, with significantly greater improvement in all patient-reported outcomes. Journal of Pain152018Demonstrated that the activation of CB2 receptor by a selective CB2 agonist (synthetic cannabinoid) can attenuate the central sensitisation and pain behaviour induced by paclitaxel, a chemotherapy drug, in a rat model. The authors concluded that MDA7, a selective agonist for CB2 receptors, represents an innovative therapeutic approach for treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. Lancet Neurology162018Showed that nabiximols, a synthetic cannabinoid, had a positive effect on spasticity symptoms in patients with motor neurone disease. There was also significant improvement in patients' global impression of change anda significant reduction in pain in the nabiximols group, compared with the control group. Pain172019Found that in a rat model for neuropathic pain, repeated treatment with low-dose CBD induces analgesia predominantly through TRPV1 activation, reduces anxiety through 5-HT1A receptor activation and rescues impaired 5-HT neurotransmission in neuropathic pain conditions.MEDICAL CANNABIS & a difference between Sativa and Indica cannabis? Technically, there is no dierence between Sativa and Indica cannabis. Of course, among cannabis connoisseurs, it's hotly debated. Sativas are supposed to be the coee-like energy boost to yourbody and mind, while there's a reason why Indicas are sometimes known as \"in-da-couch.\" As in, don't expectto be going anywhere when you consume it. If you're going to a concert or festival, take a Sativa joint. If you're o to bed and looking for a non-alcoholic \"nightcap\", smoke some Indica. Before you light up, it's important to be aware of yourprovince or territory's non-smoking rules because they apply to cannabis, too. In BC, for example, smoking is banned in all public spaces and workplaces, including within six metres of doors, windows and air intakes. Also, don't share a joint with anyone under the age of 19 and don't carry more than 30 grams on you at one time. But as I said before, technically, there is no dierence between Sativa and Indica. What consumers are feeling may be the placebo eect. Just as there's no dierence in the alcohol of vodka versus beer. But, perhaps with cannabis, science hasn't discovered exactly what is happening in the brain when one consumes. There are over 420 compounds in the plant, after all. Tetrahydrocannabinol (also known as THC) is the most famous. It's the active ingredient getting you \"stoned.\" There's no such thing as a \"Sativa\" or \"Indica\" type of THC. Why distinguish between Sativa and Indica? The answer is due to the plant's botany. Sativas are taller and stalkier. Indicas are bushier and loaded withresin. Consumers can also choose hybrids, cannabisstrains that are a mixture of Sativa and Indica. Of course, any experienced cannabis farmer would admit that nearly all cannabis available to consumers is a hybrid of both. \"OG Kush\" may be labelled as an Indica, while \"Girl Scout Cookies\" may be labelled Sativa, but a more accurate classication would be \"Indica-dominant\" or \"Sativa-dominant.\" Ideally, percentages would indicate how far on either side of the Sativa-Indica spectrum the strain rests. Cannabis consumers report more cerebral experiences with Sativa, whereas Indica sends a buzz across your body, giving you the classic cannabis stereotype of couch-lock. For farmers, it's more of a technical matter. But \"Sativa\" and \"Indica\" are not cannabis compounds. THC is a cannabis compound. So is cannabidiol (CBD) There is no psychological eect on the mind with CBD like there is with THC. You can smoke joint after joint of CBD-heavy strains and come away only slightly buzzed, if anything at all. CBD isolates, which extracts the compound completely and isolates it, give you zero buzz. So why consume it? CBD consumers report lower levels of anxiety when consuming it daily like a vitamin. Others report a reduction in their inflammation. And scientic papers back this up, as any quick Google Scholar search willdemonstrate. Due to prohibition, cannabis growers bred plant genetics high in THC and low CBD. The two compounds work like a see-saw, the more CBD in a plant, the less THC. Likewise, for consumers, the higher the CBD in their strain, the less eective the THC high.Cannabis patient, budtender and growers assistant, Caleb McMillan, ponders if there is a difference between Sativa and Indica cannabisMEDICAL CANNABIS & CBD 115With the end of prohibition in Canada, as well as many U.S. states, cannabis farmers are now selecting plant genetics high in CBD and low in THC. But, regardless of whether the plant is CBD or THC dominant, Sativa, Indica or hybrid dominant, cannabis will produce terpenes. What are terpenes? You may be familiar with the terpenes produced by pine trees. Terpenes are an aromatic organic hydro -carbon. This is where the smell and aroma of the tree originates. The resin of a pine tree is the sap and can be used in essential oils. \"Stinging nettle\" is a plant, many would call it a weed, found in many parts of the world. The plant has small little crystals on its leaves. This is what makes it sting. Cannabis also has tiny crystals on it. Except instead of stinging you, it sticks to your ngers. Cannabis is, after all, the \"sticky-icky-icky\" as per American rapper SnoopDogg. The little crystals on the cannabis plant won't sting you, they will stick to you. This is where all the THC is found. If your cannabis is lacking these \"crystals\" or, more accurately, terpenes, then you do not have a good bud. The more \"caked\" a cannabis plant is in these terpenes,the more potent it is, the higher the aroma it carriesand for many connoisseurs, the tastier it is. Shatter and other extractions Extraction methods can turn cannabis plants into aglass-like substance. This process isolates the terpenes and flushes the plant of all its carcinogens. You thenvaporise the extracted cannabis product. Known as shatter, this is cannabis-derived to its terpene essence. The consumer is not only getting a potent hit with one toke but tasting aromas one can't replicate by burning the plant substance. This latter method of consumption is popular among medicinal patients who require high dosages for pain management. But it is also regularly demonised in the media likely due to its high potency and lack of understanding among medical professionals. Certainly,heating your consumption device with a hand-held torch sends a dierent message than using matchesor a Bic lighter. Yet, shatter continues to be popular, especially among Canada's medical cannabis population. Although it remains to be seen how they'll manage under recre- ational legalisation. All previous medical regulations have been absorbed into the new legal framework. For better or worse, medical cannabis in Canada has become an afterthought for cannabis producers and lawmakers. Instead of crafting regulations geared towards medical patients, the government has interpreted their court-mandated duty to \"provide reasonable access\" as completed under recreational legalisation. With plenty of stores and producers to buy from, medical patients are instead given the choice of writing o their cannabis purchases as medical expenses. They also have more leeway when it comes to public consump- tion and operating heavy machinery. But this varies, province to province. Treating cannabis as a gift It's hard to say why one plant works for so many dier- ent people for a variety of reasons. Perhaps we sharean evolutionary history with the plant. Perhaps a higher power put it here for us to consume. Perhaps it's just a coincidence, a sort-of \"it is what it is\" situation. What's the saying? Don't look a gift horse in the mouth? Perhaps this is how we should approach the topic. Caleb McMillian Staff Writer Cannabis sativa family Hemp is quietly becoming one of the key com- ponents in the exploding cannabis industry worldwide. Less hyped than CBD, medical cannabis and recreational marijuana, it is now having the spotlight turned on it due to the sheer volume of possible uses, its environmental benets and the sheerscale of global production. Industrial hemp is part of the cannabis sativa family. It has its own medical benets and is used in a vast range of products, as well as being the base ingredient in many cannabinoid supplements. Like CBD it is non-psychoactive and will not produce a high. From the traditional uses in rope, paper, clothing, con- struction materials and biofuel, it is now increasingly being turned into organic cosmetics, health foods and nutraceuticals. Hemp tinctures, creams, balms, lotions and tablets are now available alongside the traditional packets of seeds and ground hemp seed powders which have been used as remedies for centuries. Hemp-based flour for baking, packaging, compost, even bedding is now being produced. Hemp bres are said to be the strongest natural bres in the plant world and a lot of things which have traditionally been made from cotton or petroleum derivatives can now be made from hemp. Hemp is also useful to farmers as a rotation crop that prevents soil erosion, absorbs carbon dioxide and removes toxins from the land. It is hardy, easy to grow, isn't fussy about climate and has high yields. Compared to cotton or petroleum it has clear environmental benets and uses fewer resources. It is being promoted as a viable green alternative across the globe. Demand for hemp is surging globally. By 2026, it is estimated the global market will be worth $13 billion. The two major producers of hemp are China and Canada, with giant commercial farms and massive factories for processing plants and creating extracts. Today, large-scale hemp production is spreading withthe U.S. catching up fast and regions from Lesotho in Africa to Colombia in South America setting aside land for farming. A boom similar to the palm oil boom isunderway, which has raised the spectre of overproduc- tion and pricing slumps. The rise in demand is typically attributed to these new types of health- focussed products and a global movement to nd healthcare solutions which do not rely on pharmaceuticals. Hemp oils and supplements are growing in popularity. \"Industrial hemp is part of the cannabis sativa family. It has its own medical benefits and is used in a vast range of products, as well as being the base ingredient in many cannabinoid supplements. Like CBD it is non-psychoactive and will not produce a high.\" Hemp seeds are a fantastic source of protein and aminoacids, including arginine which has noted benets for cardiovascular health. For vegans and vegetarians,hemp seeds are a popular way to supplement dietary protein levels. They are a good source of vitamins, including vitamin E, B vitamins, zinc, iron, potassium, phosphorus and folate, amongst others. They are also rich in the fatty acid Omega 3 and rich in bre. If hemp is consumed in suciently high concentrations it can act as an anti-inflammatory. Tests on animals have shown it can have a noticeable eect, but human trials have been inconclusive. In fact, we should be cau- tious about attributing too many direct health benetsHenri Sant-Cassia from CBD Virtue turns the spotlight onto industrial hemp, a part the cannabis 117to hemp seeds or hemp oil. Results are dependent on the amount consumed. For example, industrial hemp does contain some CBD, the cannabinoid which is making headlines everywhere for its numerous medicinal properties, but levels are typically very low. Equally, while arginine is helpful for heart health, it needs to be consumed in sucient amounts, so a few hemp seeds won't do much. There are some claims and early clinical evidence that hemp could help treat atopic dermatitis (AD), acne and arthri- tis, but there are no conclusive scientic studies yet. For now, it remains a healthy dietary supplement with a lot of untapped potential for the future. Industrial hemp is also used in the production of cannabinoids. Typically the plant has relatively smallamounts of CBD and other cannabinoids like THC com- pared to other species of cannabis. However, by process- ing a lot of plant matter it is possible to produceconcentrated extracts. Many experts believe this kind of harsh extraction can damage the cannabinoid molecules and purists prefer cannabinoids produced from specialnon-hemp varieties of cannabis sativa with higher cannabinoid levels which can be extracted gently.There is also a dangerthat because hemp is such an ecient bio absorber - pulling outheavy metals and toxins from soil - that edible products made from hemp will be contaminated with poisonous substances it has absorbed while growing. Buyers need to check for proper safety and test certicates that show productsare pesticide, heavy metal Celtic Wind Crops, we created this tagline working towards a sustainable future as we truly believe that we are creating a sustain- able business to lead the way in the hemp industry for the future. The industrial hemp plant has many uses and Celtic Wind plans to capitalise on all of them, having no waste of any of the plant's parts, therefore, creating health food supplements, natural fibres for industries and wood corefor building and bedding products. We use no chemicals in any of these processes and if we have any waste it is returned to the field from which the crop came to replenish the nutrients and, therefore, completes a fully natural crop cycle. The company's founders have been working with hemp since 2009 and registered the business in 2012 with a view in mind to bring the hemp industry to Ireland and be a globally traded business. Creating jobs and making a difference to the economy and the environment, the 2019 crop of 500 acres will capture during its growth cycle over 1,650 tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere this season. This is equivalent to the carbon produced in over 220 American households every year. We understand the plant and how it performs in different conditions andreintroducing old natural farming techniques to produce a unique range of natural products. We have also created our own supply chain; we call this seed to shelf which means we are in full control of all of our own raw materials and manage everything from putting the seed into the ground all the way through to the finished bottle on the shelf giving our customers total confidence in Celtic Wind. \"Legislative guidelines require that because of its relationship to the cannabis plant, industrial hemp must be below 0.2% THC when tested in the field, however, regulations state that not one milligramme of THC or any other controlled substance may be found in the finished product.\" By introducing these old farming techniques like meadow planting, this allows Celtic Wind to grow a natural crop without the use of agrichemicals, this leaves a boundary around the field so wildlife can come back to protect the crop, encouraging whitebutterflies, ladybugs and bumblebees that all play a role in maintaining a healthy crop by controlling disease and infestations naturally. This is an industry that can no longerbe overlooked with all the benefits it brings when you support the hemp industry by making a difference in theenvironment and the economy in which these businesses are located. It creates jobs, protects the environmentand gives us clean natural raw materials to work with. As you would be creating these resources locally, it would cut down the impact on transportation of goods and mining for resources, reducing our global carbon footprint overall. If we make the decision to switch 40% of the world's agricultural crop to hemp over the next five years, this would have a positive fundamental impact to local economies and envi- ronments, therefore, contributing to the global community. However, industrial hemp is known to be one of the toughest agricultural crops in the world to deal with, stand- ing over 12 feet tall with natural fibres that can be as strong as steel when they wrap around machine parts, cause real problems for modern machinery. To harvest and process this crop cor- rectly, you need a lot of heavy-duty machinery and infrastructure and this is still certainly lacking in the UK andIreland today. This is one area that has really held the whole industry back: support for infrastructure and clearer regulations as most countries tend to make their own legislative changes on industrial hemp. Legislative guidelines require that because of its relation- ship to the cannabis plant, industrial hemp must be below 0.2% THC when tested in the field, however, regulations state that not one milligramme of THC or any other controlled substance may be found in the finished product.Paul McCourt CEO and Founder of Celtic Wind Crops.EU, explains how his firm is leading the way in the hemp industry for a sustainable futureCeltic wind crops: Leading the way in the hemp industry for a sustainable future 118PROFILEWe are heavily regulated in this indus- try by government bodies such as the HPRA, FSAI, HSE and the Department of Agriculture and, of course, Celtic Wind products comply with all European Union (EU) and United States (U.S.) legislation. Celtic Wind had to create their own infrastructure as there are limitations on harvesting hemp seed. We only have eight hours from when we start to harvest before the seed spoils and turns rancid, so this means Celtic Wind only harvest approximately 100 km from the facility to ensure we can protect and stabilise the crop withinthis time limit, so harvest to storage takes place within eight hours. This also allows for full traceability, if you pick up a Celtic Wind product and read the little batch number on the side of the bottle back to the company, they can tell you the day that crop was sown, the date it was harvested and every station in the processing facility that it passed through on its way to the shelf. Celtic Wind carries out all its processing and operations in Ireland and NorthernIreland, where day employ most of their staff, over 18 now and have started employing in the UK and the U.S. At Celtic Wind, even though we work with an ancient crop, we embrace modern technology to help us make the most out of the hemp plant: you can see from our videos the drone photography of the beautiful local area we grow in, what you might not realise is that under that drone a whole bank of sensors take readings from the crop to inform and indicate certain areas of interest. Our monitor- ing system will predict yield, detect disease and provide solutions for this. We are pushing the boundaries in agricultural science and biotechnolo-gies with our crop monitoring systemespecially for hemp and new product development areas. This all combined gives Celtic Wind the ability to produce a wide range of products for different industries. We have just extended our ingestible range with three new capsule products called Synergy and have now launched pet care to the market, coming soon is the body care range, again all fully natural and traceable. Further applications of the raw mate-rials will include eco-friendly building materials such as natural fibre insula- tion and structure-forming wood core products for the sustainable building industry. We at Celtic Wind truly believe this is the way forward for business and industry alike, creating natural resources from a sustainable ancient crop like hemp an annual spring breakcrop that can feed, clothe and shelter if you know how to work with thisamazing plant.

Committed to becoming a leading worldwide manufacturer and distrib- utor of cannabinoid products. They have over 20 years of relationships with hemp farmers around the globe. Benhaim learned in 1991 that hemp seed is a superior source of essential fatty acids, and has been working with it ever since. Since his first product, the '9bar' snack bar (one of the world's best-selling hemp products), he has developed numerous businesses, and supported government policies and global strategies to grow and develop the industrial hemp industry. His obsession is to create the best organic hemp products for the mass market. Paul works with seed breeders and suppliers, growers, harvesters, cleaners, primary processors, manu- facturers, laboratories and quality control personnel (in-house, contracted and third party) to source the highest- quality hemp from around the world for use in Elixinol products. After learning about hemp seeds in 1991, Paul Benhaim immediately began tracking down the best hemp in the world. He has worked in England, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Korea, Thailand, India, China, Canada, U.S., Australia, New Zealand and more!Paul has travelled the world for the last two decades, making close friends and colleagues in his chosen speciality - the highest-quality hemp on the planet! Elixinol has hemp farms in both the U.S. and Europe; hemp extracts fromElixinol U.S. are grown in Colorado, while Elixinol Europe's hemp comes from farmers in Europe. They work from seed to sale with farmers and producers in each location to ensure they formulate the very best productsfor you. Before they ship from their manufac- turing facility, all the products undergo rigorous testing. Then they use advanced HPLC (HPLC-DAD) equipment, in leading labs, to confirm the results. Besides testing for potency, they also test for microbiological con- tamination, heavy metals, pesticidesand the unique terpene profile. To establish the best labs for testing their products, they initially submit multiple samples of the same product, as well as \"dummy\" samples, to assure stability of the lab's analysis methods and their ability to identify abnormalities in our products. This also allows them to be sure that they report any abnormalities immediately. Good communication and attention to detail are critical to the Elixinol process. They employ these quality-controlmeasures in every batch of Elixinol product they manufacture. There isnever a question of what an individual is receiving when they make a purchase. They use only hemp-based product testing laboratories that mirror pharmaceutical-industry processes and controls. Through these processes, they've solved the common problem of inconsistent test results. The testing team comes from the pharmaceutical industry, understands the complexity of operating in a cGMP/GLP environ- ment and has operated in this envi- ronment for decades. Elixinol gives customers and partners greater peace of mind by providing batch and lot numbers for each product. They identify each batch of aproduct that is manufactured (GMP). This is essential in ensuring consistent quality. They provide full transparency to their customers about what they are buying at any given point in time. It also assures that should an issue arise; they can rapidly perform a recall on that specific batch and know exactly who may be in possession of a product derived from that batch.Lastly, it allows them to communicate clearly with their manufacturing partners so that they can identify any issues that may arise on the manufac-turing side of our business. They publish certificates of analysisA worldwide manufacturer and distributor of cannabinoid products, Elixinol are committed to creating the best organic hemp products for the mass marketCannabinoid products: Create the best organic hemp products for the mass market 120PROFILEfor all of their products. They work closely with a team of medical profes- sionals to conduct intensive research and development of formulations. Elixinol is proud to lead the industry when it comes to safety, product inno-vation and value for money. They are experts with decades of experience working with truly natural products.They know how to extract, process and formulate the ingredients they carefully select, without resorting to synthetic chemicals. They maintain a strict policy of no GMO products whatsoever. Their own in-house formulator develops and oversees the innovative methods we employ to make our products safe and enjoyable to use. They also continue to invest in manu- facturing facilities to expand the rangeof products they can make, without ever compromising on values. These same values are applied whenchoosing ingredients for flavouring their edible products or developing non-toxic skin products. The Cinnaminttincture, for example, uses a variety of cinnamon that is extracted using the same solvent-free Super Critical Fluid Extraction techniques used to extract their hemp plants. The result is record levels of cinnamaldehyde, a compound that offers more than just great natural flavour.

Four years later, this vision still drives the BioBloom mission and is implemented by the three CEOs Elisabeth Denk, Christoph Werdenich and Thomas Denk, together with ateam of 15 employees. BioBloom is now one of the most established hemp producers in Austria and Europe. The raw material, especially the hemp flowers, comesexclusively from the hemp plants from their own certified organic fields consisting of approximately 110 hectares. A specially developed cultivation technique guarantees the hemp plants have enough space and light and that they grow healthy and strong. In addition, nutrient-rich soils and the mild Pannonian climate ensure that the hemp plants develop high concentrations of the hundreds of valuable hemp ingredients such as CBD (cannabidiol). The hemp plants are harvested carefully and the hemp flowers are processed exclusively by hand before going through a particu- larly gentle CO 2extraction process in the certified laboratory NateCo2 in Germany, all of which guarantee the highest quality CBD hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of thehemp plant and absolutely no additives. Collaboration with well-known scientists and doctors BioBloom combines three decades ofexperience in organic agriculture and the millennia-old knowledge of the hemp plant, which is one of the oldest cultivated plants in the world, to create innovative natural products of the highest quality. The company and all of its products are BIO AUSTRIA certified, and the production is also supervised by scientific, pharmaceuti- cal and medical experts. One of the external scientific consultants is Gerhard Nahler, M.D., Ph.D., and CEO of CIS GmbH in Vienna, Austria. Gerhard Nahler is well known from publications on various aspects of cannabinoids and cannabis. Among other institutions such as ICANNA, he has also collaborated as an indepen- dent expert with the European Inter- national Hemp Association (EIHA) onthe area of hemp extracts and hemp food aspects. \"From the past, I know the production of high-quality prod- ucts\", says Gerhard Nahler concerning his collaboration with BioBloom. Quality, transparency and the preser- vation of all the valuable ingredients of the hemp plant are the focus of every production step at BioBloom. Trained employees harvest the hemp plants mostly by hand and the hemp flowers are then processed exclusively by hand. This ensures the CBD and the approximately 500 other valuable ingredients of the hemp plant are preserved as best as possible. BioBloom draws upon findings from cannabis research in its production, especially the entourage effect. This states that the ingredients of the hemp plant have the best bioavailability in combination with each other and not as isolated pure substances. That iswhy the main focus in every step of the production process, from theBioBloom has specialised in the production of high-quality organic hemp products with absolutely no additives since 2016. The production focuses on the preservation of all valuable ingredients of the hemp plantOrganic hemp producer extracts are 100% natural and organic hemp full extracts and contain the full spectrum of the hemp plant with absolutely no additives.careful harvesting to the processing by hand all the way to the certified CO2extraction, is the preservation of the cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and all the other valuable ingredients. BioBloom absolutely refuses to use any additives and enrichment with CBD isolates. Certified and quality-tested CBD full extracts The 100% organic and natural CBD hemp extracts from BioBloom are available in of 4%, 6% and 8%. CBDA (cannabidiolic acid) is the acid precursor of CBD and increases its bioavailability. In addition, other valuable properties are also attributed to CBDA. In 2018, it was possible for the first time to produce a 100% natural hemp extract from CO 2extrac- tion with 10% CBD/CBDA. The plants on a test field had developed extremely well. Many physicians and pharmacists in Austria and Europe already rely on the pure natural hemp extracts from BioBloom and use them in the treat- ment of their patients. Including the gynecologist Dr. Iris Pleyer, who pub- lished a book on cannabidiol in 2019. \"I follow a holistic approach in my work as a physician and have beenworking with cannabidiol (CBD) sincethe end of 2013. Natural full extracts with the full spectrum of the hemp plant simply work best. BioBloom,with its certified organic and pure natural hemp full extracts, is clearly one of the suppliers I trust. Quality is very important to me as a doctor!\" says the author and physician Dr. Pleyer about BioBloom hemp full extracts. The BioBloom certified organic hemp extracts are also available in pharma- cies and selected shops in many European countries. In a comparison test of 46 European CBD products by the independent patient association ARGE CANNA (www.arge-canna.at), the BioBloom products were among the test winners and in recognition of their quality the patient association also awarded them the AC seal ofquality. Innovative product development The product range also includes the unique hemp flower tea with hemp flowers from the BioBloom fields picked and processed exclusively by hand. The main component of the organic hemp flower tea is the water-soluble CBDA, which makes the tea especially helpful for people who have trouble sleeping. In addition, the BioBloom brand also includes hemp food products such as organic hemp oil from peeled hemp seeds and hemp seeds, peeled & ready to eat. The certified organic hemp cosmetic series \"Into the Wild\" is the latest addition to the product range fromBioBloom. The organic cosmetic series includes a body lotion, face cream, hand cream and an SOS balm. The product was developed following the company philosophy focusing on improving people's health and well- being as well as the careful handling of nature's valuable resources. The cosmetic products are certified organic, vegan, cruelty and palm oil free, allergen free and GMP certified. BioBloom is also working intensively on new innovative hemp plant prod- ucts as well as the internationalisation of its brand (Japan, Canada, etc.). The product developments include other health-promoting products from hemp, as well as other plants and their ingre- dients that BioBloom intends to use for new products in the near future. All this, while always staying true tothe vision that has been at the heart of BioBloom as a BIO AUSTRIA quality partner since it was founded. \"We are convinced that the many valuable ingredients of hemp plant only develop their full potential in syn- ergy with each other. Our goal is to help people stay healthy and activeand find inner balance with our purenatural products,\" say the three CEOs with conviction.

It influences our relationships, how we work, where we live, and even our basic human rights. Positive mental health today is gaining agreater spotlight. It becomes a more high-prole issue for both policymakers, employers and the generalpublic. Despite this, Europe remains dependent on outdated practices in mental health care. Institutional- isation, excessive medicalisation and coercion 1are still used against people with mental health problems throughout Europe, from West to East. Recent gures show the growing use of involuntary measures in mental health in the UK, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. In England, for example, the rate of involuntary psychiatric hospital admission has increased by more than a third in the past six years. Informed consent to medical treatment is at the centre of good quality healthcare. Non-consensual practiceschallenge this presumption. Involuntary \"treatments\" such as forced medication or forced electroshock can be particularly traumatic when administered against people's will. They also raise ethical issues due to the evidence of potentially irreversible health damage. Coercion is often the reason why people with mental- ill health avoid or delay contact with the healthcare system. Fear of losing their dignity and autonomy results in further negative health outcomes. Life-threat- ening distress and crises situations lead to even more coercion, and the vicious cycle repeats. The notion of risk of self-harm or harm to others has been a justication for involuntary measures in many European countries. However, there is no empirical evi- dence that coercion helps people who are potentially dangerous to themselves or others. There is no asso - ciation between mental health conditions and violenceneither. Instead, personal testimonies collected in Mental Health Europe's Mapping Exclusion report document overwhelmingly negative experiences of involuntary placement and treatment: trauma, fear and pain from the use of physical restraint, involuntary hospitalisation, pressure to sign consent forms for admission or treatment, absence of information and social isolation to name a few. Coercion paves the way for massive and systemic violations of human rights. This includes the right to healthcare based on free and informed consent and the right to active and informed participation in deci- sions - one of the core human rights principles. If we want people with mental ill-health to fully enjoy their human rights and participate in society, their involun-tary, forced and non-consensual treatment must end. So how can Europe abandon unacceptable and outdated coercive practices? And what's needed to achieve the transition towards alternatives that respect human rights? Mental health systems across Europe should be reformed to adopt a human rights-based approach, which is compatible with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) and respectful of medical ethics. The UN CRPD, ratied by all the European Union (EU) Member States and the EU itself, calls for a paradigm shift: mental health servicesshould be centred around people and their recovery. Many countries across Europe have already started the reform ; there are moves at the international level too. Several United Nations bodies have called to reduce, end and prevent coercion in mental health settings. The recent resolution of the Council of Europe (CoE) to end coercion in mental health is another positive sign.Claudia Marinetti, Director of Mental Health Europe tells us why Europe needs to end coercion in mental health125It shows a commitment to human rights in mental healthcare from one of the most prominent interna-tional human rights organisations in the European region. What particularly encourages us is the CoE Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) recommendation to the Member States to start the abolition of coercive practices. As part of the same debate, in June 2019, PACE also recommended the Council's Committee on Bioethics (DH-BIO) to shift eorts away from working on an Addi- tional Protocol to the Convention on Human Rightsand Biomedicine, also known as the Oviedo Conven - tion. The Protocol regulates 'involuntary placement and treatment of persons with mental disorders.' Mental Health Europe and other European organisa - tions representing people with lived experience, along with United Nations experts and internal bodies of theCouncil, have strongly opposed the DH-BIO's work on the Additional Protocol and urged to withdraw the draft. The Additional Protocol is considered to be out of step with the UNCRPD. It solidies rather than reduces institutionalisation and forced treatment of persons with psychosocial disabilities. There is nothing but hope that the ongoing negotiations on the Additional Protocol to the Oviedo Convention will stop after PACE's rallying call. PACE encourages DH-BIO to focus on promoting voluntary measures instead. DraftingGuidelines on ending coercion in mental health, forexample, could help States better implement theirlegal obligations regarding the rights of people with disabilities. Holistic mental health systems are crucial to truly eliminating coercion. It is not about changing individual practices but about implementing a new culture. Mental health services in the community should reflect international standards that protect human rights and dignity of persons with psychosocial disabilities. Their provision must have a positive impact on people's health and recovery. Only the elimination of coercion can ensure this systemic change. A combination of both grass-root work and overarching strategies seems the best way forward to end coercion in practice. 1 Coercion or coercive measures refer to involuntary, forced or non- consensual practices used in mental health services against people with mental health problems.

How does the \"most important third\" of our life affect not only the immune system of our body but also that of our mind and soul? Dr Hans-G\u00fcnter Wee\u00df has a degree in psychology and in Germany he is an absolute expert in sleep research. He is the head of the interdisciplinary sleep centre at Pfalzklinikum, Klingen- m\u00fcnster. \"People with chronic sleep disorders have more than double the risk of developing depressions than people with a healthy sleep. The probabilityof developing anxiety disorders and addictions is also higher.\" Sleep is a highly active process. Sleep- ing people consume only slightly less energy than people who are awake. Recent sleep research clearly shows that sleep is a human being's most important regeneration and repair programme. Nevertheless, more than 80% of the Germans use an alarm to get up in the morning and terminate their most important regeneration programme prematurely before it has fulfilled all its tasks. Human beings are the only beings on our planet who shorten sleep artificially and do not sleep in. Sleep supports regeneration and learning processes Sleep has irreplaceable functions for the human body and a well-balanced psyche: for instance, it strengthens the immune system. Several studies have shown that in cases of enough healthy sleep, natural defence cells are built in a larger quan- tity and it is easier to fight bacteria andviruses. One night without sleep, for example, already leads to a reduction of the function of T-cells (T-lymphocytesor for short T-cells form a group of white blood cells helping the immune defence), which search infected cellsand kill them. In some studies, human beings were given cold viruses and aconnection between the duration of sleep and the onset of a cold was revealed. Shorter sleep was associated with an increased probability of catching a cold. During deep sleep the hypophysis releases growth hormone. It has growth and metabolism-enhancing effects. Growth hormone mainly works by activating growth factors on muscles, liver, bones and on the cells of the fatty tissue. It is responsible for energy storage processes at the cellular level and, thus, a key element of physical and mental regeneration. Sleep is also a decisive factor for the formation of the memory. DuringIn this article, Dr Hans-G\u00fcnter Wee\u00df explains the connection between sleep, mental health and strengthening resilience 126PROFILE Sleep is the best medicine: The repair programme that strengthens resilience sleep the information newly acquired over the day is transferred from the short-term and working memory intothe long-term memory and unneces- sary information is rejected. For this reason, sleep experts advise us to take a regular afternoon nap of 10 up to a maximum of 20 minutes, espe- cially for active learners but basically to ensure a healthy and long life. Studies demonstrate that a short nap between learning phases helps mem- orize factual information more easily. Sleep is important for the mental well-being Sleep does not only help people who are learning, but also regulates emotions. The advice to \"sleep on itfor a night\" is legitimate, as even in case of difficult emotional situations information that is less important for the cause is filtered out of the memory during sleep. The next morn- ing, we can simply think and judgemore clearly. A lack of sleep, however, makes you more reckless and more willing to take risks and leads to more errors in case of complex decision processes. That puts a completely different perspective on certain deci-sions made in politics and business after long night sessions. People with chronic sleep disorders have more than double the risk ofdeveloping depressions than people with a healthy sleep. The probability of developing anxiety disorders and addictions is also higher. The importance of a healthy sleep is already revealed in early childhoodand adolescence. Children and teens who sleep well and sufficiently are more stable regarding their ability to regulate emotions and more balanced when dealing with other people. In turn, young people who sleep badly all the time tend to show rather disso- cial, excited and impulsive behaviour and an impeded social development. Each hour of sleep deprivation height- ens the risk of leading an unhealthy lifestyle with insufficient physical activity and weight gain, as well asincreased consumption of fast food, nicotine and caffeine. Even with one hour of sleep less than preset by our genes the probability of overweight increases by 23%. Sleep protects against age-related diseases During sleep, waste products gener-ated by neurons in the brain over the day, so-called amyloid plaques, are degraded again so that the human brain maintains its functionality. For this reason, enough sleep enablespeople to grow old successfully while enjoying good health and reduces the risk of age-related diseases, such as dementia and Parkinson's disease. Sleep makes us alert and productive. Often, we only realise how important it is when we do not get enough sleep.Depending on the study, up to 43% of the Germans feel \"quite often\",\"mostly\" or \"always tired\" during the day and not well rested (DAK health report 2017). The consequences of sleep deprivation on the psychosociallevel of performance, however, are not always apparent, but they canhave disastrous consequences because sleep deprivation, like alcohol, slows down the reaction time. Lethal traffic accidents on German roads are twice as often a result of lack of sleep than of alcohol consumption. \"Recent sleep research clearly shows that sleep is a human being's most important regeneration and repair programme.\" Consequently, whoever sleeps suffi- ciently and well is not only physically and mentally fit but also has a better mental balance and resilience. Vice versa physical and mental well-being results in a more relaxing sleep. It constitutes a cycle that provides many reasons to attach more importance to sleep and to sleep soundly again. Dr Hans-G\u00fcnter Wee\u00df Psychologist and Head of www.pfalzklinikum.de 127PROFILESTROKE 128Recovery from stroke: The challenges When stroke strikes, part of your brain shuts down. The impact is devastating. It could be anything from wiping out speech and physical abilities to aecting a person's emotions and personality. There's no doubt that recovery from these eects takes time, a ton of courage, determination and support. Doctors, physiotherapists and speech therapists are a vital step in helping stroke survivors rebuild their lives, but we need to know what struggles stroke survivorsface that advances in medical knowledge cannot solve. This is why the Stroke Association commissioned our largest ever survey of UK stroke survivors to formour four-part Lived Experience of Stroke report. Throughout 2018, over 11,000 stroke survivors and carers from across the UK told us about their experi- ence of stroke. They shared their thoughts and feelings about the severity of their stroke, life after their stroke, the things they have found challenging to adapt to, thesupport they have received, and the areas in which they wish they had been better supported. Every day, my colleagues and I at the Stroke Association hear upsetting stories which bring the research ndingsto life. We hear of marriages broken and suicide attempts, of jobs lost, houses sold and stroke survivors, their families and family carers becoming homeless. When I rst joined the Stroke Association, I was told about one man who lamented that living with theeects of stroke wasn't a life worth living for him and that he'd rather have died in hospital. On the most basic level, this is upsetting and speaks of the psychological trauma a stroke can cause. We now have robust data to show what we knew anecdotally, that the stroke population desperately needs emotional and psychological support. For too long now, the social and psychological impactsof stroke have gone unnoticed and have been over- shadowed by the importance of physical rehabilitation. There are currently 1.2 million stroke survivors in the UK. Alarmingly, we found that nearly a million stroke survivors have a mental health problem as a conse- quence of their stroke. Three-quarters of survivors face a battle with depression, anxiety, lack of condence, mood swings and even suicidal thoughts. Devastatingly,a quarter of these people say they haven't had the emo- tional support they should be getting, and so desperately need, to rebuild their lives. Overall, nine out of ten survivors experience at least one cognitive eect including fatigue, problems with concentration, decision-making, reading, writing and poor memory. These challenges are compounded by the worry that another stroke may be on the way. A stroke at any age can be devastating, but the condition is particularly cruel when it hits people of working-age. One in every four strokes happens to aperson aged 18-65. We now know that nearly half (43%) of working-age stroke survivors are faced with nancial hardship after their stroke and over half (51%) gave up work or reduced their working hours following their stroke. Nearly one in six (15%) working-age stroke survivors experienced discrimination, missed out on a promotion or said their employer was not supportive. Of course, the psychological and physical eects of stroke can be heavily intertwined, as often the mental and therefore hidden impacts of a stroke aect a stroke survivor's ability to work as much as the physical impacts. Employers often do not understand the breadth of consequences that a stroke can have on a person; this is symptomatic of the public's overall lack of stroke knowledge. For example, 14 million people who know a stroke survivor don't even realise that stroke happens in the brain.Juliet Bouverie, Chief Executive of the Stroke Association explores the challenges around recovery from strokeSTROKE 129Our stroke recovery teams provide stroke survivors and their families with information and advice on howto rebuild their lives after stroke, including signposting to other services and support with lling in disability benet application forms. The Stroke Association's service teams help stroke survivors get back to workand provide advice to reduce the nancial burden that a stroke can have on a survivor. We have developed My Stroke Guide to help stroke survivors access vital information and oer peer support online and we alsorun the Stroke Helpline as further support for everyone aected by stroke. The evidence highlights how important it is that families, friends and health professionals who support stroke survivors understand what it means to live with these 'hidden eects', ask how people are feeling and provide appropriate social, emotional and psychological support. We have pushed for psychological support to become a higher priority and I'm pleased to see more holistic support included in the National StrokeProgramme. The programme aims to deliver on stroke goals in the Long Term Plan and we are proud to beworking closely with NHS England to develop and deliver it. Please do refer your clients who may beaected by stroke to the Stroke Association's vital infor- mation and support services (see below for details).We're here to help rebuild lives after stroke.

In particular, developed countries are where aging is having a significant effect in result in long-term disabilities. Stroke, which can primarily contribute to hypotonia and chronic hemiparesis, have been found to be one of the major causes for long-term disabilities, leading to limb/hand functional impairments in patients. Due to limitation of muscle motor capabilities, hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex is commonly found in stroke patients. The so-called \"stiff- ness\" or \"tightness\" of muscles in the stroke patients is referred to the muscle spasticity which is caused by hyperexcitability of motoneurons. In medical practices, it is found that with precise and repeated range of motion (ROM) exercises, the aforementioned flexor hyperexcitability can be reduced. In present practices, the ROM exercises are operated by therapist's hands to temporarily reduce the severity of spasticity. In evidence-based medicine, it is demonstrated that with robot- assisted rehabilitation, the high-repet- itive and high-precision movements can greatly improve the quality of rehabilitation for stroke patients. In this article, an exoskeletal robotwhich is designed to perform precise and repeated robot-assisted move- ments by aligning with human finger counterparts is discussed in the con-text of a commercially available prod- uct called \"Mirror Hand\" by Rehabotics Medical Technology Corporation (RMTC). The technology behind this Mirror Hand robot was developed by Professor Chang's group in National Tsing Hua University and Dr Yu-Cheng Pei's group in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan through a project named \"Development of Customized Robot-Assistive Exoskeleton System for Palm-Finger Physical Rehabilita- tion\" which was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan and later transferred to the RMTC. Traditionally, the rehabilitation pro- cess is conducted in hospital or clinics due primary to the device's inevitablebulky mechanism, not to mention the possibility of offering dexterous movement in stroke patient's fingers. To offer enough dexterity and work with the traditional rehabilitation used in everyday situations, the Mirror Hand as illustrated in Figure 1 is designed to be a light-weighted, con- venient to use, and easy-to-operate hand robotic device that can be used both in traditional rehabilitation units in hospital/clinics and in-home care with supervision of medical person- nel. Accounting for human factors and natural movement of fingers, the exoskeletal hand as shown in Figure 1(a) is designed through precision mechatronics and bio-medical inte- gration processes to offer total weightHere, Jen-Yuan (James) Chang discusses pioneering research and innovation by National Tsing Hua University of robot assisted rehabilitation for those who have suffered a strokeMirror Hand: Maximising neuroplasticity through robot-assisted rehabilitation 130PROFILE Figure 1.

The exoskeletal hand worn on a stroke patient's impaired hand can be controlled by the sensor glove as shown in Figure 1(b) which is worn by the patient's healthy hand or the therapist's hand. This sensor glove is also designed with biocompatible but breathable materials offering comfort and light weight of 107 grammes for convenient wearing and operating. The finger movements acquired by the sensor glove are directly fed into the light-weighted control box (125 grammes) as shown in Figure 1(c), with its signals processed by a well-engineered signal processingalgorithm to identify the properhand/finger movements and then to duplicate the movements in exoskele- tal hand. With such portable and pre- cise designs, the Mirror Hand certainly removes the traditional rehabilitation restrictions and enables patients to conduct rehabilitation exercises beyond rehabilitation centres. With these functions, sensing technology is utilised in the Mirror Hand provides conventical Continuous Passive Movement (CPM) model and bimanual therapy. With the Mirror Hand device, patients can guide the impaired or affected hand using their own healthy hand to perform mirror therapy. As shown in Figure 2(a), the affected hand is simply placed behind the mirror without any movement, in the traditional mirror therapy exercise, while the healthy hand moves for the patient to see the reflection in the mirror to stimulate reconstruction of neurons. With the Mirror Hand device, the traditional therapy method is preserved but with enhancement of actual movement in the impaired hand with the robot. In the bimanual rehabilitation mode, the Mirror Hand allows patients to grasp big objects such as cups as illustrated in Figure 2(b) and to grip small objects such as the coloured cylinders or screws as shown in Figure 2(c). This innovative robotic device has obtained Taiwan FDA certification,passed ISO 13485:2016 regulations, and recognised with 2018 National Innovation Award. By applying the robot-assisted rehabilitation technol- ogy, it is hoped that stroke patientfinger muscle strength and joint flexi- bility can be improved. This couldavoid the phenomenon of muscle atrophy and joint sclerosis which occurs from long-term fixation in the same posture, neuromuscular disorders and diseases that lead to permanent loss of hand functions.

All.Can surveyed nearly 4,000 cancer patients from over10 countries to ask them where ineciencies occurred most in cancer care 1- with the aim of building these insights into future denitions and eorts to improve eciency in cancer care. While most reported that their needs were suciently addressed during their care, they also highlighted some specic areas where improvements were needed. Four opportunities to improve cancer care: 1. Ensure swift, accurate and appropriately delivereddiagnosis: When asked to select one area of cancer care where they experienced the most ineciency, 26% ofrespondents chose diagnosis - more than any other area of cancer care. Among respondents whose cancer was diagnosed outside of a screening programme, 32%said their cancer was diagnosed as something else, either once or multiple times. 2. Improve information-sharing, support and shared decision-making: Respondents expressed the need for better information and support - especially after theirphase of 'active treatment' was over. Some 39% felt they had inadequate support to deal with ongoing symptoms and side eects, while 35% felt inadequatelyinformed about how to recognise whether their cancer might be returning or getting worse. \"I think we do not take the aftermath into account enough. Life becomes dierent after [treatment] and many 'little sores' occur, with which one must live.\" (Respondent from Belgium) 3. Make integrated multidisciplinary care a reality for allpatients: Respondents asked for more focus on theemotional and psychological impact of cancer and better integration of allied health and complementary services into their care. Cancer nurse specialists were often cited as playing an essential 'navigator' role. While 69% of respondents said they needed psychological support during or after their cancer care, 34% of those who needed it said such support was unavailable. \"I needed someone to talk to; I was given written information.\" (Respondent from France) 4. Address the nancial implications of cancer: Respon- dents frequently spoke of the nancial impact of having cancer - not just in terms of having to pay for compo- nents of their care themselves, but also the cost of trav- elling to appointments, childcare or household help, lost income and diculties in getting insurance, mortgages or loans as a result of their cancer diagnosis. Over a quarter of respondents (26%) reported that they had suered nancially due to loss of employment related to their cancer. \"I was not really given any info about how long to recover from chemo or returning to work. I had to devise my own return-to-work plan.\" (Respondent from Canada) Why these ndings matter The ndings from this survey are consistent with other reports in the literature.2-5Policymakers, healthcare professionals and all stakeholders need to listen to these perspectives and build them into eorts to improve cancer care. All.Can member Christobel Saunders, Professor of Surgical Oncology at the University of Western Australia, said of the ndings: \"It is so important that, as physi- cians, we listen to what patients are telling us in thisRedefining efficiency based on what matters to cancer patients is placed under the spotlight here by All.Can, including identifying opportunities for changeCANCER 133survey. Each of the areas identied represents an opportunity to improve care for patients and provide truly patient-driven care.\" Acting on these ndings can make a real dierence to patients, their families and healthcare systems. For example: For many cancers, early diagnosis can improve survival.6By contrast, late diagnosis and misdiagnosis can lead to delays in treatment, poorer survival andhigher costs of care. 7, 8 Fullling patients' needs for information is associated with improved treatment adherence9-11and better clinical outcomes.11, 12Information can help patients feel more in control of their disease, reduce anxiety andhelp create realistic expectations for their care. 12, 13 Having cancer nurses may bring overall savings to healthcare systems, with one report in the United Kingdom suggesting that introducing specialist nurses into the cancer care pathway could save about 10% ofcancer expenditure. 14 There is growing evidence that many patients face a 'cascade of nancial burden' due to cancer: for exam-ple, an Australian study found that cancer patients may spend up to 15% of their lifetime income on their dis- ease. 15Social costs - namely lost productivity and care- giver time - represent 60% of the total cost of cancer.16 Creating protective health and social policies that sup- port those patients who can return to work and protect them from nancial insecurity is therefore crucial. About the survey: The All.Can patient survey was conducted in 2018 by Quality Health, with close input from All.Can members. A total of 3,981 people from over 10 countries responded to the survey (specically, in Europe, North America and Australia). The survey was open to current or former patients with any type of cancer.

Professor Jenkins said: \"Many researchers will produce many more papers than this during their careers but I thought it was a nice coincidence that my 100th paper came out as Swansea University prepares to cele- brate its own Centenary in 2020.\" Professor Jenkins's role as Director of Research at the leading UK Medical School sees him divide his time between his managerial responsibilities and leading his own research - and he says his passion for research is still asstrong as ever. \"I do really like talking to the students. I still get a real buzz out of the research, it is the thing that keeps me going.\" Professor Jenkins first came to Swansea as a PhD student back in 1993 to work with Professor Jim Parry, a leading expert in DNA mutations. \"Mutations cause cancer so if you can reduce the amount of mutations that you accumulate during your lifetime you reduce your risk of getting cancer.Take smoking, cigarette smoke causes mutations which is why it leads to cancer, the more you smoke the greater your risk. \"The thrust of my career to date is trying to develop new ways of measuring those DNA mutations.\" This work plays a key role in maintaining the University's reputation, especially as it prepares for the Research Excel- lence Framework (REF) assessment of the quality of research in UK higher education institutions which takesAfter a career spanning more than 20 years, a Swansea University Professor's passion for research is as 'strong as ever', as he marks a very notable achievement - the release of his 100th paper on cancerSwansea University Medical School's Director of Research releases 100th cancer research paper 134PROFILE place in 2021. This assessment is essential to secure the continuation of a world-class, dynamic and responsive research base across the UK. Last time this was carried out in 2014 Swansea University was ranked 23rd in the UK and the Medical school was ranked 2nd in Unit of Assessment 3, for the quality of its research. Some of that success is down to research into mutations carried out by Professor Jenkins and his colleagues, including Professor Shareen Doak who leads the University's In Vitro Toxicology Group. Together they have been at the fore- front of work to develop lab-grown human cells to use when studying whether test compounds cause mutations and their link to cancer. This work aims to study mutation in human models rather than use animals for testing. He said: \"This latest paper, led by Hasan Haboubi, gave me an opportunity to combine work in DNA mutations from our animal-alterna- tive research and use those kinds ofapproaches to study patients withoesophageal cancer and Barrett's oesophagus. Its publication is the culmination of six years of hard work.\" As one of the pioneers of the Univer- sity's Medical School Professor Jenkins is delighted to have played a part in its remarkable growth and now has an office in the ILS building that he helped to design. \"After I completed my doctorate, I considered leaving Swansea, but the Medical School was about to start and I could see this was going to be a big development with great opportunities for future research,\" he said. \"When I was a PhD student in the Genetics department at Swansea there were 20 of us, now the Medical School has 200 PhD students. \"It has seen enormous growth in a relatively short space of time and we're proud we can provide great opportunities for research.\" Swansea University will celebrate its Centenary on July 19, 2020. Throughout theCentenary year, the University will commemorate the academic success and proud achievements of Swansea's current and former staff, our students, and alumni. Also, in 2020, Swansea's Medical School will celebrate 50 years of teaching Genetics and Biochemistry.

Carcinomas in situ constitute roughly 20% of all cancers of the breast [2], and the majority (~83%) occur within the mammary gland known as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) [3]. DCIS is a cancer of the luminal epithelial cells of the mature mammary gland, and is characterized by loss of hetero- geneity of the luminal cells composing the inner layer the mammary gland duct, dysregulated prolif- eration cavity. DCIS is a stage zero pre-invasive cancer (as it remains contained within the duct), and has been associated with increased risk of invasive or recurring breast cancer [2]. The mammary duct is a bilayered structure, composed of epithelial cells surrounding an open duct cavity (Fig. 1A). Within the mammary gland, cells are phenotypically distinct based on the presence or lack of estrogen receptor (estrogen receptor posi-tive: ER+) or fibroblast growth factor(FGF) receptor, and also based on stem, proliferative, or terminally differentiated phenotype (Fig. 1B). Paracrine estrogen signals ER+ cells and results in upregulation of amphiregulin (AREG) production in these cells, cascading and signals to the estrogen receptor negative (ER)/FGF receptor positive (FGFR+) cells. This pathway plays an important role in mature gland maintenance and, when abnormal, may contribute to breast cancer [4]. As many as 70% of all breast cancers are ER+, and loss of function in estrogen receptor has been shown to be associated with transition to DCIS [5]. Aberrations in the FGF receptor have also been discovered in breast cancer, and are often associated with increased FGF signaling and negative patient prognosis [4]. We have developed a multiscale agent-based model of DCIS, and are using it to gain new biological insights on early-stage DCIS ductal invasion into the duct cavity (we characterizethis by the ductal advance rate), as influenced by the cell-scale population dynamics, phenotypic distributions, and important molecular signaling pathways involved. This is accom- plished mathematically through ahybridized discrete cell-scale model, where individual cells are represented as discrete objects (these are called agents; Fig. 1A-C), combined with a continuum molecular scale model, where molecular movement and local concentrations are represented as partial differential equations and solved using standard numerical methods (Fig. 1D) [6]. By combining and explicitly linking these two mod- eling scales through a bidirectional feedback mechanism, our model allows for study of how cell populations are influenced by the underlying molecu- lar concentrations, thereby yielding new insights into the early stages of DCIS development. Our model includes many of the most well-established factors in DCIS, allowing for detailed parameter perturbation analysis studies, including the effects cell hierarchies, cell proliferation rates, rates of molecular uptake or release, and sensitivities to molecular signaling. We also include other key biological consequences of the dysregulated growth patterns in DCIS, including hypoxia and necrosis due to lack of vasculature within the DCIS population and high cell density induced quiescence, which can inhibitcell proliferation. In our ongoing studies, we are exploring the roles of cell phenotype hierarchies,Joseph D. Butner, Vittorio Cristini, Zhihui Wang Mathematics in Program, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030, USADuctal Carcinoma in Situ: Gaining new Biological Insights from Multiscale Mathematical Modeling 136PROFILEcell decision pathways, and molecular signaling pathways in DCIS develop- ment. Agents are bound by a set of rules that determine their actions, including requiring sufficient time to complete all phases of the cell cycle before they may proliferate again, requiring sufficient local oxygen and endocrine/paracrine molecular concentrations to avoid hypoxia andstimulate mitosis, and rules thatdetermine when they are unable tofurther divide and if cells will die due to apoptosis or hypoxia. In the model, these values are set based on litera- ture reported values, and they may be perturbed to study the effects of breaks in the normal microenviron- ment on the early stages of DCIS. Simulation results revealed that DCIS cell population expansion and associ- ated ductal advance rates occur in two distinct phases, characterized by anearly exponential population expansion followed by a long-term steady linear phase of population expansion (verti- cal lines, Fig. 1E). We further found that the rates were tightly regulated by endocrine and paracrine signaling intensity, as well as by the effects of cell density induced quiescence within the DCIS population. Local sensitivity analysis revealed that DCIS progression rates are most sensitive to cell cycle times, and that upstream estrogen 137PROFILE Figure 1: Model schematic, computational domain, and example simulation results.

These cells are stimulated to produce AREG, which leaves through the duct boundary and into the stroma, upregulating production of FGF back into the duct that upregulates proliferation in the ER phenotype. Cells may become quiescent due to high cell density, which can also result in local hypoxia, leading to necrotic cell death.

DCIS cell population expansion occurs over two distinct phases: early exponential growth due to population doublings occurring once per cell cycle, followed by a linear growth phase (transition times between phases indicated by dashed lines, colors correspond to figure legend; found to be 5.6, 7.0, and 6.38 days in the 100, 150, and 200 \u00b5m ducts, respectively).

More- over, it was observed that mixed phenotype DCIS offers a mechanism to overcome molecular signaling bot- tlenecks, resulting in a cell population shift to the uninhibited phenotype. In all cases, molecular signaling path- ways exhibited tight control over cell proliferation events, demonstrating how disruptions in these mechanisms can lead to dysregulated growth and DCIS. We observed that cell death from necrosis in regions of sustained hypoxia acts as a hypoxia relief mech-anism, allowing local oxygen concen- trations to rebound and ensuring the remaining cancer population is sufficiently oxygenated, as well as potentially allowing a subset of hypoxia resistant cells to survive until local oxygen concentration recovery. We expect this may play a key role in the natural selection mechanism for a hypoxia-resistant phenotype in vivo,where hypoxia-resistant cells are able to outlast the necrotic transition of their hypoxia-susceptible neighborslong enough to benefit from theobserved rebound in local oxygen concentration. Interestingly, we consistently observe a predictable, regular distance between the axialextent of calcification and the leading edge of the tumor. This may allow us to make predictions of an effective surgical margin around ducts where calcification is observed, as the major- ity of DCIS cases are diagnosed by observation of calcification via mam- mography [7]. This model may serve as a useful tool to study the cell-scale dynamics involved in DCIS initiation and intraductal invasion, and may provide insights into promising areas of future experimental research.

In contrast to the majority of adult cancers, which develop years to decades following transformation of a single cell, paedi- atric cancers, particularly those thatoccur in the first few years following birth, emerge far more rapidly. Whereas most adult cancers accumu- late a multitude of genetic mutations by the time they become clinically detectable, the majority of paediatric cancers are genetically \"quiescent\", meaning that they harbour few and sometimes even only single mutations. Numerous mutations can contribute to adult cancer growth and different mutations may drive the progression of any given cancer at different stages of its evolution. Determining which mutation(s) is/are driving an adult cancer at the time of diagnosis can, therefore, be challenging. In contrast, mutations responsible for paediatric cancer development are easier to identify, which facilitates exploring the pathogenesis of these tumours and obtaining clues as to potentialtherapeutic targets and options. Although genetic mutations have long been thought to play the key role in the pathogenesis of cancer, it is becoming increasingly clear that in many malignancies, posttranslational and epigenetic modifications may playan equally important role, sometimes even dominating that of the genetic mutations. \"Epigenetics\" was originally coined to describe heritable changes in a cellular phenotype that were not due to alterations in DNA sequence. Itis most commonly used to describe chromatin-based events that regulate DNA-templated processes such asgene expression. Chemical modifications, such as methylation of DNA within gene pro- moters and of acetylation and methy- lation of histones, which are proteins intimately associated with DNA, pro- vide some of the dominant epigenetic mechanisms that control gene expres- sion. Histone modifications determine whether DNA segments assume a compact or relaxed structure. Activat- ing histone marks are associated withrelaxed DNA that is accessible to tran- scription factors, allowing expressionof genes within the correspondingDNA segments. Repressive histone marks induce DNA compaction, ren- dering it inaccessible to the transcrip- tional machinery and resulting in the silencing of genes located in the corresponding DNA segments. As the genes in question may control cell division, growth and survival, epige- netic regulation of their expression may constitute key determinant of cancer emergence, maintenance andresistance to treatment. Increasing evidence suggests that epi- genetic changes play a critical role inthe development of paediatric cancers. Many solid paediatric malignancies, particularly of bone and soft tissues, known as sarcomas, arise as a result of unique reciprocal chromosomal translocations that give rise to fusion genes, which encode fusion proteinsfound only the in the cancer cells. These fusion proteins provide a diag- nostic signature for these particular types of cancer, and, more importantly, are uniquely responsible for their pathogenesis. In the majority of cases, the fusion proteins behave as aberrant tran- scription factors or transcriptional regulators. They alter the gene expression repertoire of the cells, augmenting the expression of genes that promote cell survival and growthand, in some cases, silencing those that induce differentiation and quies- cence. To execute their functions, these aberrant transcription factors may form complexes with chromatin- modifying enzymes and instruct them to reconfigure DNA structure, opening domains that in normal cells remain compact and, therefore, inaccessible to transcription, while condensing domains that are open in normal differentiated cells. Chromatin modification may thus be harnessed to implement critical changes in the gene expression profileof the cells, rendering them more susceptible to uncontrolled division, inhibiting their differentiation andProf Nicolo Riggi and Prof Ivan Stamenkovic from the University of Lausanne share their thoughts on the pathogenesis of paediatric cancersElucidating the pathogenesis ated, pluripotent, state, which recapit- ulates features of normal stem cells. Cancer-associated fusion protein- driven chromatin modification may, therefore, mimic a developmental state and establish a cellular hierarchy within the tumour, which recapitulates that of normal developing tissues, albeit in an aberrant fashion. Whereas the presence of the aberrant fusion proteins can provide the means to dissect the mechanisms underlying the development of the corresponding tumours, understand- ing paediatric cancer development also requires identification of the cellsfrom which these tumours originate. Most normal cells are resistant to transformation. When a mutation that activates an oncogene occurs in a dif- ferentiated cell, the cell undergoes what is referred to as oncogenic stress, which causes the cells to stop proliferating and guides them toward a state of permanent growth arrest known as senescence. Senescence thus constitutes a powerful tumour suppressive mechanism and a safe- guard against transformation. However, some cells, particularly stem cells, are constantly engaged in the cell cycle, which requires suppression of some of the key growth inhibitory genes. These cells thereby already display some of the properties that transformed cells adopt. Various types of stem cells, from embryonic stem cells to more lineage-committed variants, are more susceptible to transformation than differentiated cells and may constitute the origin of a variety of cancer types. Although transformation can occur in a differentiated cell, it requires recon-figuration of the cells state, referred to as reprogramming, that many poten- tial oncogenic events may not be able to induce. A specific oncogenic event may first need to alter the chromatin structure, reprogramming the cell to acquire stem cell features, including the suppression of growth inhibitory genes, to provide permissiveness for transformation. In contrast, an onco- genic event that occurs in a stem cell may not need to induce reprogram- ming as permissiveness for transfor- mation may be associated to the pluripotency with which the cell is endowed. \"Although genetic mutations have long been thought to play the key rolein the pathogenesis of cancer, it is becoming increasingly clear that in many malignancies, posttranslational and epigenetic modifications may play an equally important role, sometimes even dominating that of the genetic mutations.\" We are pursuing the elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie paediatric cancer emergence, maintenance and progression. Our goal so to identify those mechanisms that may be tar- getable from a therapeutic stand- point. We are focusing on paediatric sarcomas whose pathogenesis is driven by unique fusion proteins described above. We have identified populations of committed stem cells, known as mesenchymal stem cells, which give rise to fatty tissue, bone, cartilage and other connective tissues, as the most likely cells of origin of sev- eral sarcomas. We have begun to shed light onto the mechanisms by which the fusion proteins associated with defined paediatric sarcomastransform these particular cells and tounravel the events that drive thedevelopment and progression of the corresponding tumours. Because they are unstructured proteins, the aber- rant transcription factors that under-lie sarcoma pathogenesis cannot be readily neutralised by specific drugs. It is, therefore, essential to identify the downstream events that they initiate or key molecules with which they interact and that support their func- tion, which could be amenable to targeting by newly designed or even repurposed drugs. We have identified some of the key posttranslational and epigenetic mechanisms induced by the fusion proteins that underlie sarcoma development and are now exploring approaches to target these mechanisms and develop new and effective ways to treat the correspond- ing tumours, which currently bear poor prognosis, despite aggressive multimodal therapy.

Did you know that diabetes is one of the leading causes of death in the world? Simply put,there are two types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes (lackof insulin) and Type 2 diabetes (ineective use of insulin). We nd out more about diabetes in the African region in a conversation with Pr. Jean-Marie Dangou,Coordinator, Noncommunicable Diseases Primary Prevention (NPP), Noncommunicable Diseases Cluster at WHO Regional Oce for Africa. In this interview, we nd out what diabetes is and why it has become a new priority and what surveys tell us about the extent of diabetes in the African region.Amongst the numerous insights oered here, we alsolearn about the lack of access to proper treatment and diabetic medications, especially insulin, resulting in avoidable complications and what is being done to address this. While infectious diseases, HIV/AIDS and poverty have traditionally dominated the African region, to what extent has diabetes now become a new priority? Over the past three decades, the occurrence of diabetes mellitus has risen dramatically in all countries of all income levels. The prevalence of diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa, similar to trends being seen worldwide, is rapidly rising. The sub-Saharan African region is expected to see the largest percentage increase in the incidence of dia- betes in any region in the world. In 2015, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that there were 14.2 million people with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa. Prevalence is highly varied between countries, with prevalence ranging from a low of 0.6% in Benin to ahigh of 18.2% in R\u00e9union. There is also great variability in rural versus urban prevalence with urban areasfacing the brunt of the burden. The wide variation in diabetes prevalence can be explained partly due to regional dierences in lifestyle and body mass index. If we do not act now, this gure will increase by 162% by 2045. Africa is the region with the highest percent- age of undiagnosed people - 70% of people with dia-betes do not know they have it. Diabetes caused about 312,000 deaths in 2017 and 3 out of 4 (73%) deaths due to diabetes were people under the age of 60. This rise is due to ageing populations and lifestyle changes - including unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity. Overweight and obesity are the strongest risk factors for Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other noncommunicable diseases. What is diabetes and what are the main symptoms? Diabetes mellitus is a serious, persistent disease in which blood sugar is elevated. Over a period of time raised blood glucose may lead to serious damage to nerves and blood vessels. The disease may go undiag- nosed for years until complications have arisen. Symp- toms include excessive urination and thirst, constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. Some people may suer from signs and symptoms of heartattack or limb gangrene. If not well-controlled, diabetes may cause blindness, kidney failure, lower-limb ampu- tations, heart attacks, strokes and other complications. How would you summarise the three dierent types of diabetes? There are three main forms of diabetes - Type 1 dia-betes; Type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes. Type 1 diabetes, previously known as insulin-dependent, juve- nile-onset or childhood-onset diabetes, is characterisedIn this in-depth interview with Jean-Marie Dangou from the WHO Regional Office for Africa, we find out exactly what the prevalence of diabetes is in the African region, including the lack of access to proper treatment and diabetic medications and what is being done to address this142by decient insulin production by the pancreas. People with Type 1 diabetes require daily administration ofinsulin to utilise the glucose in their blood. Without insulin, they cannot survive. The cause of Type 1 dia- betes is not known and it is currently not preventable. Type 2 diabetes formerly called non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes occurs when the body can no longer eectively use insulin. A vast majority of people with diabetes (over 90%) have this form of the disease.Some risk factors for Type 2 diabetes - such as genetics,ethnicity and age - are not modiable. Others, such as being overweight or obese, unhealthy diet, insucient physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking are modiable through behavioural and environmental changes. Type 2 diabetes was once seen only in adults, but it has begun to occur in children in recent years. Gestational diabetes is a temporary condition that occurs in pregnancy and carries long- term risk of Type 2 diabetes. Approximately one in seven births are aected by gestational diabetes, a severe and neglected threat to maternal and child health. Many women withgestational diabetes experience pregnancy-related com-plications including high blood pressure, large birth weight babies and obstructed labour. What have surveys shown about the extent of diabetes in the African Region? In 2017, the top ve countries for the number ofpeople with diabetes (18-99 years) were Ethiopia, South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Tanzania. Currently, the prevalence of diabetes in the African region is estimated to be 7.1 % compared to 3.1% in 1980. Early diagnosis, detection and themanagement of Type 2 diabetes reduce the develop- ment of complications such as visual impairment and blindness. Management of Type 2 diabetes involves the control of blood glucose through a combination of dietary, physical activity, counselling and appropriate medicines if necessary. The risk of developing Type 2diabetes and its complications could be signicantly reduced by maintaining a healthy body weight, engag- ing in sucient physical activity, eating a well-balanced diet low in sugar and fat but supplemented with fresh fruits and vegetables on a daily basis, as well as avoid-ing tobacco and harmful use of alcohol throughout a person's life. A lot needs to be done in the African region to stem the tide of rising noncommunicable diseases including diabetes. What are the issues around a lack of access to proper treatment and diabetic medications, especially insulin, resulting in avoidable complications? What is being done to address this? Unfortunately, in many African settings, half the people living with Type 2 diabetes are unaware of their disease DIABETESDIABETES 143and therefore not receiving treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment are important for preventing complica- tions of diabetes. Since diabetes can potentially strike any family, awareness of the signs, symptoms and riskfactors is important to help detect it early. Diabetestreatment usually requires daily doses of insulin. This can lead to catastrophic expenditure for people with diabetes and their families when they have to pay outof their own pockets for their treatment. Diabetes can push families into poverty if breadwinners with diabetes become disabled or lose their life prematurely. Dia- betes is also a huge burden on the health care systemand the national economy. I would like to call upon governments to accelerate the prevention and control of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases by adopting policies, legislation and programmes that promote a healthy diet, physical activity and reduce exposure to tobacco and harmful use of alcohol. Tell us where you see diabetes in the region heading by 2030? The number of diabetic patients is expected to increase to 34.2 million patients by 2040. Although the immediate needs of the population already facing dia- betes are dire, there exists an equally important need to introduce policy designed to encourage the creationof nutritious food environments and avoid emergingfood environments that are being flooded with obeso- genic/diabetogenic foods (sugar-sweetened beverages, highly processed foods, etc.). This nutrition transitionis fuelling the dramatic rise in diabetes prevalence in urban areas that are shifting toward a more western, sedentary style of life. Although this nutrition andlifestyle transition does not seem to have reached many rural sub-Saharan African settings yet, the exten- sion of this trend is inevitable as the economic growth of sub-Saharan Africa continues to increase. In addition to a nutritious food environment, education about healthy eating and physical activity needs to be imple- mented at all levels, targeting children and adults as well as urban and rural markets. To identify the unique prevention strategies needed for rural areas, contex- tualised, culturally adapted research needs to be sup- ported to investigate the dietary patterns that may be increasing the risk for diabetes. Estimation of the costsassociated with diabetes is crucial to make progress towards meeting the targets laid out in Sustainable Development Goal 3 set for 2030. The studies includedin this review show that the presence of diabetes leads to elevated costs of treatment which further increase in the presence of complications. The cost of drugs generally contributed the most to the total direct costs of treatment. Thank you. Is there anything you would like to add? This region faces unique challenges in combating dia- betes - lack of funding, lack of availability of studies and guidelines specic to the population, lack of availability of medications, dierences in urban and rural patients and inequity between public and private sector healthcare. Because of these challenges, diabetes has a greater impact on morbidity and mortality related to the disease in sub-Saharan Africa than any other region in the world. In order to address these unacceptably poor trends, contextualised strategies for the prevention, identication, management and nancing of diabetes care within this population must be developed. Combatting diabetes and other NCDs is the business of all - individual; communities; national authorities; development partners; NGOs and INGOs; civil society. Diabetes can be prevented by maintaining normal body weight, engaging in regular physical activity,eating healthy diets that include sucient consump- tion of fruits and vegetables and avoiding alcohol con- sumption and the use of tobacco. We should institute policies and practices across populations and within specic settings (school, home and workplace) that contribute to good health for everyone, regardless of whether they have diabetes.

Despite the availability of numerous treatment options, many patients stillfail to reach their treatment goals. According to the UK National Diabetes Audit data 2016-2017, only 30% of people with Type 1 diabetes and 67% of people with Type 2 diabetes achieved a HbA1c target of not more than 58 mmol/l (7.5%). This is all the more remarkable as diabetes represents a huge challenge for European societies. The good news for innovators tackling treatment inertia in people with Type 2 diabetes, is that this disease leaves a huge space for advancing diabetestreatment towards an iPDM. Personal-isation is considered key for overcom- ing treatment inertia and narrowing the well-known discrepancy between drug efficacy, found in well-controlled clinical trials and drug effectiveness, observed in real-world clinical practice (the E2E gap). iPDM: the conceptual roots In 2012, Antonio Ceriello and colleagues published a concept paper proposing a structured and iterative six-step process cycle for the implementation of a prototypic iPDM regime:1 Education & training for a structured self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)Implementation of structured SMBG Upload and documentation of SMBG data SMBG data analysis SMBG data-based adaption of treatment Assessment of treatment efficacy Repeatedly entering new cycles of iPDM was proposed to realise an iterative approach, enabling a stepwise optimisation of the individual diabetes management. iPDM-like cycles in diabetes manage- ment were taken up in a recent consensus report on the management of hyperglycemia in Type 2 diabetes of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.2 Real-World effectiveness of iPDM: the ProValue study program Inspired by the iPDM iPDM-ProValue studies eectiveness of a 12-month iPDM regime in people with Type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy. They were designed as prospective, cluster- randomised, controlled intervention trials comparing iPDM in either gen-eral medical or diabetes specialised practices to a control group. Overall the iPDM-ProValue studies indicated that patients following the iPDM scheme achieved better glycemic outcomes. The better reduction of HbA1c after 12 months iPDM vs. usual care (- 0.5%, p < 0.0001 vs. - 0.3%, p < 0.0001; Diff. 0.2%, p = 0.0324) was achieved without any impact on the incidence rate ratio of hypoglycemic episodes. At the same time in the iPDM groups a higher percentage of patients received recommendations to adjust their insulin therapy and experienced more behavioural and lifestyle recom-mendations throughout the study. Also, the satisfaction of both patients and healthcare providers as well as the adherence of patients to their pre-determined treatment regimens improved in the iPDM groups. iPDM effectiveness was positively affected bythe usage of digital tools. iPDM-GO: from real-world validation studies towards Europe-wide implementation The recently started iPDM-GO (iPDM Goes Europe) initiative involves a consortium of diverse partners from industry, academia and healthcare administration in Europe. Collectively, the team has extensive expertise and skills in clinical practice, computer science, health psychology, health economics and bioinformatics.

It is answering the challenge of how many people with diabetes still do not achieve their treatment goals - while the costs associated with chronic diseases continue to rise. iPDM-GO offers opportunities to further enhance iPDM and explore the massive and multi-dimensional scalability of iPDM. Acknowledging the diversity of people with Type 2 diabetes is key for the implementation of iPDM regimens people are able and willing to adhere to. Health economic analysis needs to be applied in order to prove the cost-effectiveness of iPDM evolution. Patient assessment should integrate the usage of real-world data collected by sensors combined with telemedical tools. Applying machine learning approaches to large epidemiological data sets will help to establish predic- tion models estimating the individual risk of developing comorbid condi-tions. Integrating advanced artificial pancreas systems as developed by theCLOSE EIT Health innovation project 6 for a comprehensive monitoring of health and disease signatures will pro- duce a huge amount of real-world data informing iPDM algo- iPDM feedback will trigger an adjustment oftherapies, social interventions and behavioural patterns along the lines of patient preferences, new drugs & technologies, treatment guidelines, geography and reimbursement policies, to name a few - leading to an amelioration of treatment inertia and the E2E gap with a tangible impact on the life of diabetes patients and thesustainability of diabetes care. 7 References 1 Ceriello, A. et al., Diabetes Res.

Prof Dr Freimut Schliess Director, Science a corner in the prevention of Type 1 diabetes This year marked a signicant milestone for Type 1 diabetes. After more than three decades of clinical trials, each one providing important learnings for the next, the research community reached the positive outcome they had been waiting for: it was possible to delay the diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes. This nding has sparked a wave of new possibilities, but importantly it provides much-needed conrmationthat tackling the root cause of Type 1 - the immune attack against insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas - has been the right strategy. Witnessing Teplizumab, an anti-CD3 antibody, delay the onset of Type 1 diabetes by an average of two years, is the result of a mammoth eort to piece together the underlying pathology of this condition. Each hard-won milestone has been signicant; from establishing that the development of Type 1 beginsyears before the actual diagnosis, to early experimentsconrming that anti-CD3 antibodies could prevent Type 1 in mice. This eort culminated in a small TrialNet clinical trial in 76 people, 44 of whom were given a two-week IV infusion of Teplizumab. The median time to a diagnosis of Type 1 was two years in those receiving a dummy infusion, but four years in those who were given Teplizumab. That's an average of two extra years free of Type 1 diabetes for some of the participants in this trial. Two years free of insulin therapy, sleepless nights, or the worry of future complications. But before we get tooahead of ourselves, there is more research to be done. For one, a larger clinical trial is needed to conrm Teplizumab's eects. But the positive results of thisphase 2 trial present some challenging questions for the research community. First and perhaps most pressing, is the question of how appropriate would itbe for some of the participants to receive a placebo drug, given the benecial eects of the active drug? Second, who will be recruited to future trials? This small trial focused on people with family memberswho have Type 1 diabetes, but the majority of people who develop Type 1 don't have a family history - can future trials and recruitment eorts account for this? And third, will the results translate into the preventionof Type 1 diabetes? It's important to note that this trialwas carried out in people with a near 100% chance of developing Type 1 diabetes at some point in their life.While one might hope to move onto those who are at an earlier stage in their development of Type 1, or a lower risk, it's thought that Teplizumab works on an immune system which has already been 'activated' against beta cells, making this challenging. Dr Elizabeth Robertson, Director of Research at Diabetes UK explains why 2019 marked turning a corner in the prevention of Type 1 diabetes but adds that there is still more research to be done in this area Dr Elizabeth Robertson, Director of ResearchDIABETES 147In addition, it's near impossible to assess the true eects of a drug on prevention in a trial setting, as participants would all need to be followed until death. But perhaps the two-year delay oered by Teplizumab could be extended and - if subsequent trial results lead to a license for those at high risk - future real-world data could paint a clearer picture of Teplizumab's long-term prevention eects. \"This year marked a significant milestone for Type 1 diabetes. After more than three decades of clinical trials, each one providing important learnings for the next, the research community reached the positive outcome they had been waiting for: it was possible to delay the diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes.\" There are challenges ahead but they do not lessen this signicant milestone. And with insulin therapy nearing its 100-year anniversary, we need more milestones like this. Each step forward in our understanding of how to prevent or delay the onset of Type 1 diabetes brings us closer to nding a cure. A possible future scenario isone where we can combine a treatment to stop the immune attack with another to replace or regenerate lost beta cells. So research must continue. For now, we're thankful. Thankful to the researchers involved in this discovery who didn't give up, to the healthcare professionals who enable clinical science to happen and most importantly, we are thankful to the thousands of people at risk of Type 1 diabetes who have continued to take part in the research. NEJM paper: https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1902226 Dr Elizabeth www.twitter.com/DiabetesUK INFECTIOUS DISEASES 148The priorities for tackling viral hepatitis in Africa Today, viral hepatitis has become a public health challenge of global proportion. While there are ve distinct types of viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E), chronic hepatitis B and C cause 96% of hepatitis-related sickness and untimely deaths. Hepatitis D, however, is less common and occurs only in association with hep-atitis B. The other viruses (namely hepatitis A & E) arespread via contaminated water and food and result in acute infections and outbreak in areas of inadequatewaste disposal and poor sanitation. Having said this, acute infections are often short-lived and are resolved within the space of a few weeks. In this exclusive interview with Prof Olufunmilayo Lesi, Regional Medical Ocer for Viral Hepatitis from the World Health Organization (WHO) Oce for the Africa Region, she speaks to us about the priorities for tack- ling viral hepatitis in Africa. Amongst the many insights given here, we learn how the epidemic of viral hepatitis B and C aects people globally compared to the global HIV epidemic. Also, we nd out about the distinct types of viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) and how the virus ispicked up and which groups of people it aects the most. We also nd out how it is treated. How does the epidemic of viral hepatitis B and C aect people globally compared to the global HIV epidemic? The epidemic of viral hepatitis B and C aects 328 million people globally and is nearly 10 times the magnitude of the global HIV epidemic. The epidemic caused by hepatitis B (257 million) mostly aects the WHO African Region and the Western Pacic Region. The epidemic caused by hepatitis C (71 million) aects all regions, with major dierences between and within countries. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, WesternPacic Region and the European Region have the highest reported prevalence of hepatitis C 1. Everyday, more than 3,600 people die of viral hepatitis-related liver disease, failure and liver cancer. Data from the Global Health Estimate 2015 showed that the number of deaths from hepatitis B and C has increased by 22% from the baseline in 2000 2. In contrast, the death rate from HIV has been rapidly declining due to universal and sustained access to care. \"A recent study conducted by the World Hepatitis Alliance suggests that lack of awareness among the population and policymakers and even healthcare workers is a significant barrier to prevention and testing of viral hepatitis. This low level of hepatitis awareness has significant implications for ongoing transmission, especially high mother to child transmission and household transmission in children and siblings and unsafe injection practices.\" In response to the growing threat of viral hepatitis, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global HepatitisStrategy for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by the year 2030 with two impact targets relating to incidence (decreased incidence of new infec- tions by 90%) and deaths (reduction in mortality by 65%) 2. To accomplish these targets, modelling studies have identied ve key interventions in prevention, testing and treatment that will reach these targets only if taken to scale. Tell us about the distinct types of viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) Although there are mainly ve distinct types of viralhepatitis (A, B, C, D, E), 96% of morbidity and mortalityIn this exclusive interview with Prof Olufunmilayo Lesi, Regional Medical Officer for Viral Hepatitis from the World Health Organization (WHO) Office for the Africa Region, she speaks to us about the priorities for tackling viral hepatitis in AfricaINFECTIOUS DISEASES 149are due to chronic hepatitis B and C infections. Hepatitis D occurs only in people who have hepatitis B, has a variable global and regional distribution. Acute infection is associated with all types of viral hepatitis A-E, is often short-lived, may be associated with jaundice, low mortality rate and complete resolu-tion within a few weeks. Hepatitis A and E are spread via contaminated food and water and cause diseaseoutbreaks in areas of poor sanitation and inadequatewaste disposal with a mortality rate as low as 0.8% in HAV and 3.5% in HEV 3. Ensuring high levels of sanita- tion and access to clean water are the most eective prevention for hepatitis A and E. Progression to chronic infection and chronic liver disease is a dening feature of both hepatitis B and C infection. Most viral hepatitis deaths in 2015 were due to chronic liver disease (720,000 deaths due to cirrhosis) and primary liver cancer (470,000 deaths due to hepa- tocellular carcinoma). In Africa, liver cancer occurs at a younger age, causing catastrophic expenditures and impacting negatively the economic productivity. The disease is rapidly fatal and the opportunity for surgeryand transplantation is limited.How is the virus picked up and which groups of people does it aect the most? The epidemic of chronic viral hepatitis in sub-Saharan Africa aects over 71 million people. There is a highrate of hepatitis B infection with a general population prevalence of 6.1% with over 60 million people estimated to be chronic carriers. Chronic hepatitis Binfects approximately one in every 15 people (1:15), 4.8 million are children under the age of ve years and over2 million with HIV/Hepatitis B co-infections (in 2015) 2. The hepatitis C infection aects 10 million people with higher occurrence in older age and some key popula-tions including PWID- Persons who inject drugs. In Africa, hepatitis B is mostly acquired in the perinatalperiod (including mother to child transmission) and in childhood with 50% to 90% going on to develop a chronic infection with a high risk of liver cirrhosis orcancer over two to three decades. For these reasons, WHO recommends hepatitis B vaccination at birth (within 24 hours) and early childhood as a high impactintervention and an important prevention pillar of the global hepatitis response. In contrast, hepatitis B infec- tion acquired in adulthood leads to the developmentof chronic infection in less than 5% of adults. INFECTIOUS DISEASES 150Unsafe injection practices both in health facilities and in the community account for the majority of hepatitisC infection in Africa, with several investigators suggest- ing large-scale transmission in the 1990s due to unsafe injections and blood transfusion 4,5. Intravenous drug use is an emerging concern for hepatitis C transmission in Africa and is recognised as the most prominent route of transmission in Europe and the U.S. In Africa, one in 100 (1:100) people are infected and mostmay ultimately need treatment. \"Implementing the global hepatitis response in Africa will require investments in hepatitis-specific activities and strengthening health systems, as well as ensuring the availability of adequate, sustained financial resources; affordable good quality diagnostics, medicines and Hep B birth dose vaccines; and trained human resources.\" The available evidence suggests that over 1.5 millioninfected Africans may develop progressive liver diseasein the next few decades in the absence of large-scale testing and treatment programmes for both hepatitis B and C. This is unacceptable for a disease that can beprevented with childhood vaccination and hepatitis B birth dose and eectively managed with aordable and cost-eective suppressive hepatitis B or curativehepatitis C antiviral therapy. Despite these compelling statistics, less than 5% of infected persons in Africa know their hepatitis status 1. This is a sharp contrast to the HIV response where approximately 80% of PLWHA are aware of their status.A recent study conducted by the World HepatitisAlliance suggests that lack of awareness among the population and policymakers and even healthcare workers is a signicant barrier to prevention and testing of viral hepatitis 6. This low level of hepatitis awareness has signicant implications for ongoing transmission, especially high mother to child transmission and household transmission in children and siblings and unsafe injection practices. How is it treated? Testing is the gateway to treatment. In most of the sub-Saharan countries, blood testing for viral hepatitis is not routinely provided except in blood banking services, specialist centres and in the private sector. In 2015, approximately 1.3 million people with hepatitis B infection and nearly 500,000 people with hepatitis C were detected in the blood transfusion services in Africa7. In the absence of counselling and linkage to care, this represents a huge missed opportunity for intervention. All persons with chronic hepatitis B or C require further assessments. In adults, anti-viral therapy is eective and rapidly causes viral suppression in chronic hepatitis B, thus, limiting disease progression. Treatment is recom- mended in all patients with HIV- hepatitis B co-infection and in people with hepatitis B mono infections who have evidence of liver disease or are at a higher risk of disease progression3. Treatment is recommended for all hepatitis C infected persons with evidence of viremia. The devel- opment of curative direct antiviral therapy (DAA) has revolutionised treatment with cure rates exceeding 95%when treated for 12 weeks. Identication of people with hepatitis (case nding) isa signicant step in the global response and provides the opportunity for disease assessment and treatment to halt disease progression and maintain and improve the quality of life. People need to take steps to know their status and receive counselling for other co-riskfactors, such as alcohol and cigarette consumption, aflatoxin ingestion and obesity that may accelerate the development of liver disease. The priorities for tackling viral hepatitis in Africa Although viral hepatitis has become a disease that can be eliminated, progress in scaling up the hepatitisresponse to prevent premature death from complica- tions of liver cirrhosis or the development of liver cancer remains inadequate.INFECTIOUS DISEASES 151Implementing the global hepatitis response in Africa will require investments in hepatitis-specic activities and strengthening health systems, as well as ensuring the availability of adequate, sustained nancial resources; aordable good quality diagnostics, medi-cines and Hep B birth dose vaccines; and trained human resources. Some of the challenges to scale up include poor political and community awareness and stigma, high cost of diagnostics and drugs and lack of surveillance data. Government leadership is critical to the establishment of a sustained public health response and has the potential to be cost-eective, reach millions of the infected populations and save lives. \"Identification of people with hepatitis (case finding) is a significant step in the global response and provides the opportunity for disease assessment and treatment to halt disease progression and maintain and improve the quality of life.\" The role of the community and patient groups cannotbe understated. Globally, civil society organisations promoted by World Hepatitis Alliance have com- menced a widespread testing campaign tagged \"nd-ing the missing millions\". Their collaboration with civil-society groups in Africa has increasingly enhancedawareness and demand for hepatitis services. A strat-egy of decentralisation of care and integration of spe-cic hepatitis activities into existing healthcare services or disease programmes such as HIV/TB appear feasible and can facilitate cross programmatic eciencies and promote universal healthcare. Investment in healthcare nancing, mobilisation of domestic nancing and part-nerships, community commitment are required to launch a successful and sustainable programme. The development of aordable multi-platform labora-tory tests, ecient supply chain and pooled procure- ments, implementation research into ecient service delivery models and other innovations may accelerate the response towards the vision of a \"Region where hepatitis transmission is halted and everyone livingwith viral hepatitis has access to safe, aordable and eective care and treatment.\" References 1 Global Hepatitis Report, 2017. https://www.who.int/hepatitis/publica- tions/global-hepatitis-report2017/en/ (accessed 20 sept 2019). 2 Global Health Sector Strategy for viral hepatitis.

For achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) strategy to control hepatitis by 20301, understanding the HBV transmission is of particular importance. Viral transmission is determined by factorsderived from both virus itself and host. One of such major factors in host is a cell surface protein that mediates the binding to virus, defined as a viral entry receptor. Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a bile acid transporter, has been revealed to function as an HBV entry receptor in 2012 2. This protein, expressed exclusively in the liver, is an apparent factor determining the HBV infectivity to host. However, it has been totally unclari- fied how NTCP mediates HBV entry and determines host susceptibility to HBV infection. In April 2019, Koichi Watashi's group in National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan published a paper in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA thatprovides a new concept that HBV infection is determined by anothermolecule that regulates the function of virus-receptor complex, termed as an entry cofactor 3. Cell culture and animal model data so far demonstrate that NTCP is required for HBV infection. However, there is accumulating evidences suggesting that NTCP expression is not sufficientfor reproducing HBV infection in cells: HBV infection is not necessarily observed in all the NTCP expressing cells, and the infection in susceptible cells depends on culture condition,irrespective of the NTCP expression level. This data raises the possibilitythat another factor(s) regulates HBVinfection. Koichi Watashi's group has been pursuing to identify a series of small molecules and bioactive ligands that suppress or facilitate hepatitis virus infection. Their strategy is to take advantage of these agents to probe the mechanisms underlying virus infection. So far, they have identified a bunch of small molecules that inhibit HBV peptides, which were reported in the context of drug development 4. In addition, the group has also found those rather facilitating HBV infection, one of which is epider- mal growth factor (EGF). By focusing on this probe, they revealed that EGF receptor (EGFR) regulates HBV infection to NTCP-expressing cells. Even if expressing NTCP, HBV infection was no more observed by deficiency of expression or function of EGFR. Mechanistically, while NTCP mediates HBV attachment to the cell surface,EGFR was shown to be involved in HBV translocation to the endosomes (Figure). Their data and previous evi-dences suggest that with NTCP irrespective of HBV infec- tion: EGFR-NTCP complex is likely to travel between the cell surface and the intracellular vesicles by following the cellular membrane trafficking pathway either in the presence or absence of infection. When HBV attaches to NTCP on the cell surface, it migrates with NTCP-EGFR inside thevesicles through the trafficking. Thus, NTCP functions for the attachment with HBV, and EGFR drives the inter- nalization of HBV-NTCP complex. \"Taking advantage of small molecules/bioactive ligands to probe the mechanisms underlying virus infection.\" Notably, if NTCP does not bind to EGFR, NTCP no longer functions as the entry receptor of HBV, which was shown by the blockade of NTCP-EGFR binding by introducing amino acid mutation and treatment with decoy peptide. This data clearly show that productive infection of HBV requires EGFR as an entry cofactor, in addition to NTCP. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) uses its receptor, CD4, for cell attach- ment and requires another involve- ment of coreceptor, CCR5 or CXCR4 for the following membrane fusion. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) attaches to host cells through CD81 and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), which then clusters with tight junction Koichi Watashi, Senior Researcher from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan, explores the trick for cell invasion in reaching regulation of hepatitis B entry Multi-step regulation of hepatitis B virus entry 152PROFILEproteins, claudin-1 and occludin for internalization. The presenting multi- step regulation of HBV entry is analo- gous to such examples for the entry mechanism of these viruses. However, it is unique that HBV follows the cellu- lar intrinsic pathway of the membrane protein trafficking that readily occurs in the absence of infection. Moreover, as EGFR senses extracellular ligands to change its functionality, HBV susceptibility of cells may be affected by these extracellular ligands, not only by NTCP genetic condition. Next questions include whether only EGFR functions as an entry cofactor of HBV, given that cells express related receptor tyrosine kinases such as fibroblast growth factors, vascularendothelial growth factors, and platelet-derived growth factors. How the entry cofactor drives HBV internal- ization, and releases HBV afterwards for the productive viral infection? Good news is that this machinery is expected to serve as a target for anti-HBV development. Actually, a peptide that interrupted EGFR-NTCP binding EGFR tyrosine used anti-cancer drug, inhibited HBV infec- tion. Further analysis of targeting this machinery for developing a new anti- HBV strategy is of great demand in the near future. Albeit still many blackbox, we have had a significant gain ofunderstanding in this decade on the mechanism underlying HBV infection and determining the susceptibility to HBV. Further analysis on HBV infection is expected to develop new strategies to control the worldwide hepatitis. \"EGFR entry cofactor function is expected to serve as a target for anti-HBV development.\" References 1 WHO Global hepatitis report 2017. 2 Yan H et al. eLife 1: e00049, 2012. 3 Iwamoto M et al.

Gefitinib blocks HBV internalisation through inactivation of EGFRHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the main things which can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The contact with blood and body fluids from patients with HBV can transmit the infection to other people. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 257 million people are globally living with HBV infection. The mortality from Tubercu- losis, human immunodeficiency virus and Malaria show a downward trend during 2000 and 2015, whereas the mortality from viral hepatis including hepatitis C is increased during the same period. The number of deaths rose from 1.10 million deaths in 2000 to 1.34 million deaths in 2015 (an increase of 22%), which is on par with tuberculosis. The WHO calls for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 (reducing new infections by 90% and mortality by 65%). HBV vaccination, prevention mother- to-child transmission, blood safety, injection safety, harm reduction, diagnosis and treatment are the key elements for the elimination strategy of HBV infection. Innovation is required to eliminate HBV. New diagnostics and treatments need to be developed. Only 9% of persons living with HBV (22 million) had been tested and knew their status. Therefore, the promoting to uptake of hepatitis testing is extremely important to introduce treatment. In the medical resourcesconstrained countries and regions, however, the access to medical institutions and hospitals is limited. Lack of access to appropriate healthcare service affects severely the prognosis of infected children. To remove the barrier of access to hepatitis testing, we focus on nails and hair to develop new diagnostic method. Usually, blood is used for the diagnosis of HBV infection. Nails and hair, which are so-called \"keratinous tissue,\" have the advantage of pain- less collection, easy transportation, and reliable storage at room temperature. Nails and hairs are formed within a relatively short time and then isolatedfrom the body, which continues its metabolic activities. The components of nails and hair thus reflect metabolic events that occur during the short time of their formation, and nails and hair have been evaluated in clinical practices (e.g., for the measurement of trace elements). A previous study demonstrated that the assessment of glycated nail proteins is useful for the diagnosis of diabetes. Screening for diabetes with the use of nails could be helpful in resource-constrained counties. In addition to trace element and proteins, nails and hair have been used for the investigation of nucleic acid. The amount of DNA in nails and hair is much smaller than that in otherHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the main things which can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomaPaediatric Hepatitis B: Investigating fingernails and hair 154PROFILE Nails and hair are used as they reflect metabolic events that occur during the short time of their formation, and have the advantage of painless collection, easy transportation, and reliable storage at room temperature.tissues such as liver, muscle and blood. However, nails and hair contain sufficient amounts of DNA including mitochondria DNA for analysis. Archaeology and forensic sciencestudies have used nails and hair for DNA analyses over the past two decades. We investigated nails and hear from the patients infected with HBV. Nailsand hairs have signatures of chronic HBV infection. HBV DNA was detected in nails and hear from approximately 80% to 90% of patients with chronic HBV infection. Moreover, hepatitis B surface protein can be extracted from the nails. Histopathology shows that hepatitis B surface protein is present in the nails. In addition to HBV, hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is evaluated in our lab. HBV carriers could be co-infectedor superinfected with hepatitis delta virus. HDV is a defective RNA virus which requires the surface antigen of HBV for viral assembly and replication. We also detected HDV protein and HDV RNA in nails from patients co- infected with HBV and HDV. Nails and hairs have a potential as diagnostic tools in the infectious diseases. For instance, cytomegalovirus (CMV),which is a common virus and infects people of all ages, can be detected inthe nails. Congenital CMV infection can be diagnosed using nails of neonates. Other DNA and RNA viruses might be detected in nails and hairs. The research of nails and hairs hasjust begun in this infectious disease. In the future, nails and hair might be able to become useful specimen comparable to blood in infectious diseases. We hope that our research will contribute to the clearance of hurdle to take diagnostic examination of HBV infection in resources- constrained counties. The final goal of our research is the eradication of HBV infection. This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research) grants, nos. 18K08451 and JP17H04168. Haruki Komatsu Medical Doctor, Associate Professor, Professor, M.D., Ph.D.CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE 156Cardiovascular diseases - how to prevent them At rst glance, the stats are disheartening. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the number one health issue aecting people worldwide, with more people dying each year from them than from any other cause. An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to strokes or heart attacks. Despite the overwhelming gures, the truth is they only hint at the scale of the issue. Death rates don't account for the millions around the world living with a CVD that requires long-term treatment. In the UKalone, there's an estimated 7.4 million people living with heart and circulatory diseases. Given the size of the issue the notion of a 'cure' might seem hopeless tocontemplate, but most CVDs can actually be preventedby addressing behavioural and lifestyle factors. But rst, what actually are CVDs? Cardiovascular diseases are disorders that aect the heart and blood vessels. Common conditions include coronary heart disease, congenital heart disease and deep vein thrombosis. Heart attacks and strokes are generally acute events, brought on by a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels blocking blood flowto the heart or brain. Who's at risk? Though the clear cause of CVD isn't clear, there are many factors that increase your likelihood of getting one. High blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol and obesity are all high risk factors for CVDs. Other factorscan also come into play, such as age, gender and family history. Anyone can get a CVD but they're most common in people over 50. Additionally, they typically aect more men than women, with 3.9 million men in the UK living with a CVD compared to 3.5 million women.What can I do? 'Prevention is better than cure' is a proverb often used in cardiovascular medicine, because it's much easier to implement lifestyle changes early than to readjust to the dicult reality of living with CVD. Taking steps toward a healthier lifestyle is one of the most eective ways to reduce your chances of CVD. Cutting out unnecessarily toxic habits dramatically reduces your risk of CVD. If you smoke or drink excessively you should try to give up or drastically reduce your intake as soon as possible. \"The World Heart and Stroke Forum recommends that every country should have an up-to-date policy on CVD prevention. This should be developed through ongoing dialogue between governmental, social and health groups, with three major strategic angles: population strategy, high risk strategy and secondary prevention.\" When it comes to diet, establishing a healthy balance is recommended to lower your blood pressure andcholesterol levels. Eating more fruit and vegetables and lowering your intake of saturated fats, sugar andsalt can go a long way to guaranteeing you a longer and healthier life. CVDs can aect anyone, regardless of your tness level. However alongside dietary changes, it's impor-tant to establish a regular exercise regime. Adults are recommended to do at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. Obviously, the diculty levelcan be adjusted depending on your tness level and you can consult your GP for recommendations. According to PHE's Health Prole for England, fallingmortality rates from heart disease were the biggestcause of increases in life expectancy between 2001 and 2016. Since then, these rates have slowed signicantly,Cardiovascular diseases are on the rise, but so is confusion as to how to prevent them. Shaun Ingram, MD of Cardiac Science takes a look at the data, shares his views and strikes a cautious note of optimismCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE 157signalling the need for a renewed eort to prioritise CVD prevention on a policy level. What can the government do? The World Heart and Stroke Forum recommends that every country should have an up-to-date policy on CVD prevention. This should be developed through ongoingdialogue between governmental, social and health groups, with three major strategic angles: population strategy, high risk strategy and secondary prevention. Population strategy is about tackling the lifestyle and environmental factors that can cause CVD to develop. High risk strategy is about identifying and treating high risk individuals early, through things like better screening and earlier diagnosis. Finally, secondary prevention is about stopping the progression of the disease in people who have already been diagnosed. So what does this mean in practice? Between 2001 and 2016, the policies that made a big dierence were actions such as banning smoking in public places, improving population-wide blood pressure levels and introducing better treatments through advances in medical science. But what to try next all depends on the country and culture in question. For instance, while lack of nutrition is one of the biggest CVD risk factors in developing countries, in developed countries where many people drive around, it's lack of physical activity. Developed countries aren't all the same either: alcohol is a huge risk factor in European countries, but much less so in othernations like UAE and Saudi Arabia, where alcohol use is much more controlled. Clearly, there is no one size ts all approach. It is up to each individual government to develop policies that address key CVD risk factors in their country, in a way that works economically. So, whose responsibility is it? According to the World Health Organization (WHO) tackling CVD is everybody's responsibility. And the only way to beat it is through a combination of population- wide and individual healthcare strategies. However, at Cardiac Science my team and I believe there are two other factors that make a big dierence: awareness and accessibility. That's why we constantly strive to raise awareness of the risk factors for CVD, the conditions that can lead to cardiac arrest and the steps you can take to protect yourself and others. And although we can't provide global access to healthy food and exercise, we are constantly researching the latest debrillator technology and placing public-access debrillators far and wide. Ultimately, with the hope of saving more lives. To nd out more about life-saving skills and and Catholic University of Rome, Italy For a long time the causes of acute coronary syndromes were poorly understood, and, only after the publication of our paper on New England Journal of Medicine on the importance ofinflammation (The prognostic value of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid a protein in severe J Med. 1994 Aug 18;331(7):417-24.) it was recognized as a crucial pathogenetic mechanism. Along time, more evidences reinforced this hypothesis that is gaining an increasing interest in research and in clinical practise. The several studies published in the last years have conrmed and expanded the previous data and opened to novel nding. In particular, the role of Citokines, rst discovered by our group and subsequently reported by Paul Ridker in Boston with more evidences, paved the way in the Cantos study, to the anti-Citokines therapy. Although ecient this therapy is expensive and may carry a risck of infection. More recently, novel ndings raised the evidence that NL3P3 inflammosoma, that may induce further inflammation, in particular increasing levels IL-18 and IL-6, may increase the cardiovascular risk. As the balance between reduction and increase in this eld is small, in similar conditions the risk of infarction is elevated, and may be responsible of death. For this reason correction of inflammation is an important issue in cardiovascular diseases and its control may signicantly reduce mortality. New evidences on the role o in Acute coronary syndrome However treatment based on cytokines is expensive and may carries further problem. Therefore, other treatments may be requested in order to reduce the residual risk. These treatments may include anti-inflammatory cytokines, but also the possibility of better controlled further risk factors, including microbioma. Novel but extremely important risk factors, linked to mortality and to intestinal (but not only) diseases and deriving from more than 3 trillion bacteria. Several studies have already stressed this pathway and there is an increasing interest in the eld. Indeed, the inflammatory hypothesis could by linked with the Gut Microbioma that, in several condition, and thanks to its enormous amount of bacteria, may overcame the body defences and bring to overt disease. These ndings, if further conrmed, may open new and revolutionary treatments in the prevention and therapy of Acute Coronary syndromes.

The World Health Organization (WHO)2 and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project1calculated for 2015, 4.2 million premature deaths per year worldwide due to air pollution espe- cially by particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5). More than half of the deaths were the result of cardiovascular dis- eases such as coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease due to embolic and hemorrhagic stroke but also due to other non-communicable diseases such as arterial hypertension, diabetes, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Death rates due to air pollution are significantly higher than previously thought In 2018 and 2019, two new studies calculated a much higher mortality and morbidity burden than previously thought, in particular due to the use of a new and much more accurate hazard ratio function of the PM2.5con- centration-response association, the GEMM.3, 4This model has a number of advantages over the Integrated Expo- sure-Response Function (IER) formerly used by the WHO and GBD and is nowconsidered by both WHO and GBD tocalculate premature mortality. Richard Burnett's GEMM is based on the anal- ysis of much larger and geographicallyextended epidemiological data obtained from 41 cohort studies from 16 countries. 3This implies the inclu- sion of an additional 20 000 cases and 2.5 million deaths from study data from heavily polluted and densely populated countries such as China, whereas the WHO-GBD-IER mainlycovered data from less polluted west-ern regions such as Europe, Canada and the U.S. In addition, IER mortality has been reported to be based on five major causes including coronary heart dis- ease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and lower respiratory tract disorders, while in the study by Burnett et al. 3the development and application of GEMM was based onThomas M\u00fcnzel MD, Andreas Daiber PhD, Ulrich P\u00f6schl PhD and Jos Lelieveld PhD discuss the link between air pollution and cardiovascular disease in EuropeThe cardiovascular disease burden from ambient air pollution in Europe 160PROFILE Figure 1.

The estimated additional air pollution death rate was 8.9 million, more than twice that of the GBD and WHO (4.2 million). Recently, Lelieveld et al.4calculated that, based on the GEMM for Europe, this would result in up to 790,000 pre- mature deaths per year mostly due to PM2.5exposure, more than twice based on the previous GBD-IER estimate(269,000) (Figures 1 and 2). Interest- ingly, the highest numbers of prema- ture deaths occurred in Germany (154per 100,000 per year), followed by Poland (150), Italy (136), France (105)and the United Kingdom (98) 4(Table 1). The main part of the mortality was due to cardiovascular diseases. As esti- mated by Jos Lelieveld et al. , PM2.5air pollution reduces the European average life expectancy by 2.2 years. 4 To put this into perspective, the WHO estimates that the excess death ratefrom tobacco smoking is 7.2 million per year; hence, air pollution globally is now rated as the larger risk factor. Effects of air pollution on the cardiovascular system When discussing the pathophysiolog- ical effects of air pollution, we focus on PM2.5because, in particular, the small particulate matter particles can penetrate deeply into the lungs. Following inhalation of PM2.5, the fine aerosol particles are released into the bloodstream via a transition process and then absorbed into the blood vessel.5-7The particulate matter in the vessel wall stimulates the formation of reactive oxygen species, i.e., pro- oxidative substances and pro-inflam- matory biological mediators (i.e., such cytokines as interleukin-6 and tumornecrosis factor) and acute phase pro- teins such as the C-reactive protein and the vasoconstrictor hormoneendothelin. 5-7These processes initiate or accelerate atherosclerotic changes. In general, the smaller the particle is (down to ultrafine particles <0.1\u00b5m, PM0.1), the higher the probability of a rapid translocation of the particles into the vessel wall.7 Furthermore, activation of blood coagulation is observed. Accordingly, high levels of PM2.5are accompanied by hypercoagulation biomarkers, such as high plasma levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer and increased thrombin formation.5-7Human data show an inverse relationship between PM exposure and heart rate variability.5-7 PM2.5can induce arterial hypertension via direct sympathetic activating effects in the brain6,7or by triggering endothelial dysfunction due todecreased vascular nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. 7 The particulate matter limits for Europe are too high In view of the WHO recommendedguideline of 10 g m 3for PM2.5, it can be assumed that more than 91% are exposed to higher concentrations worldwide. The European Union (EU) has been applying a mean air quality limit of 25 g/m3for PM2.5since 2015, which is 2.5 times higher than the WHO guideline of 10 g/m3. The 161PROFILE Figure 2. Estimated excess mortality attributed to air pollution in Europe and the contributing disease categories. At least 48% are due to cardiovascular disease (ischaemic heart disease and stroke). A fraction of other non-communicable diseases should also be counted to cardiovascular diseases related mortality, with an upper limit of 32%. COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Image: \u00a9 2019, Oxford University Press162PROFILE target is 20g/m3by 2020, which is considered too high as well due to the new data. For comparison, the annual average limit in the US is 12 g/m3 (since 2012) and in Canada 10 g/m3 (since 2015), which are to be further reduced in the future. In Australia, the annual PM2.5limit is 8 g/m3, which should be further reduced to 7 g/m3 by 2025. Key points: Due to air pollution (PM2.5and ozone), there are 8.9 million deaths per year worldwide. Almost 800,000 premature deaths per year are calculated in Europe, with coronary heart disease and stroke predominating, especially with around 50% of premature deaths. The number of deaths from particu- late matter worldwide exceeds the number of deaths caused by smoking. The limit for Europe must, therefore, be drastically reduced Air pollution must be recognised as a cardiovascular risk factor and be mentioned in the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology for Prevention, Heart Attack and Stroke and evaluated accordingly.

HEARING RESEARCH 164Why we need to talk more about hearing loss One in six people in the UK1has some form of hearing loss which ranges on a spectrum from profound deafness to mild hearing loss. The strategies which individuals with hearing loss use to communicate eectively vary hugely. British Sign Language (BSL), lipreading, hearing aids, cochlear implants or a combination of strategies can be used to ensure those with hearing loss can understand and be understood. We are encouraging debate around understanding and knowledge of hearing loss and acknowledgement of how it can unnecessarily exclude people from activities which many would consider a fundamental right. Activitiessuch as accessing healthcare at a time and place which is convenient for them or carrying out their civic duty by serving on a Jury in a crown court. Research conducted by the NHS2has shown that almost three-quarters of deaf people (74%) felt that their employmentopportunities were limited because of their deafness and over two thirds (68%) have felt isolated at work. Alack of education and access to training is helping to keep barriers to communication in place. Our research has revealed that: 94% of people surveyed don't know more than two signs in BSL. Mark Hopkinson, Head of the Centre for Deaf Education, City Lit states why we need to talk more about hearing loss HEARING RESEARCH 16560% of people would like to learn to communicate better with deaf people and those with hearing loss, which is positive news we need to build upon. 61% of people feel that those who are deaf, or who have some level of hearing loss, are marginalised insociety because not enough people know how tocommunicate with them eectively. They are right. We can change this. BSL, lipreading and managing hearing loss courses provide students with an incredible range of tools they can use in both their professional and personal lives.Further, deaf awareness training for friends and family members and organisations is important in improvingcommunication with deaf and hard of hearing people. \"Lipreading is proven to be successful for those who seek support if they lose their hearing as adults and we believe that everyone who seeks help for hearing loss should receive advice on lipreading from their GP or Hospital. Unfortunately, there are too few classes across the UK and access is a postcode lottery.\" We strive to influence the UK Government and policymakers about the importance of BSL education and we welcomed the then Secretary of State for Education, Damian Hinds MP's, announcement in November 2018 that the Department for Education and Ofqual were in the process of reviewing proposals for a BSL GCSE. Equally, we have welcomed the London Mayor's commitment to fully fund BSL Level 1 and 2 for deaf adults through the adult education budget. Access to a BSL GCSE and increased funding are incredibly important steps in the right direction. BSL courses encourage more people to learn and perfect this much-needed skill. This includes those who useBSL as their rst language or those who are fluent in English and wish to learn BSL, as well as hundreds ofdeaf migrants who move to London every year and require specialist tuition. City Lit knows that BSL Teacher Training is vital if the demand for learning is to be met. However, BSL is not the only strategy for communication for those with hearing loss. Lipreading is proven to be successful for those who seek support if they lose their hearing as adults and we believe that everyone who seeks help for hearing loss should receive advice on lipreading from their GP or Hospital. Unfortunately, there are too few classes across the UK and access is a postcode lottery. City Lit's #HearMyLips campaign goal is to train more teachers to teach more classes nationwide.

Billions of cells make up the brain. These cells, called neurons,communicate with each other by sending electrical signals known as action potentials. Action potential properties are controlled in part by specialised membrane proteins called ion channels, of which there are numerous types. Ion channel expres- sion is incredibly complex, and varies throughout the brain, so neurons are often classified by their functional phenotype, i.e., the pattern of their action potential firing. In this research profile, we briefly consider action potential firing patterns and the functions they serve in both normal and diseased states. We then focus on specialised firing patterns of auditory neurons and their role in hearing. Diversity of action potential firing patterns Since the brain is responsible for encoding all sensations and planned body movements, a vast diversity of firing patterns exists. Neurons spe- cialised for hearing act differently than neurons for vision, but even within one sensory modality, variety infiring patterns are ubiquitous 1. Ion channels being composed of various multiple subunits is one reason for such diversity. For example, the potassium ion chan- nel has more than 100 subunits2. This is multiplied by the fact that ion chan- nels can be regulated by [See Open Access Government January 2019and April 2019 ]. While this article will focus on firing patterns in theauditory system, firing patterns in the motor system also play a critical rolein biologically relevant functions. Action potential firing patterns in the motor system Motor patterns are ubiquitous, from the rhythmic beating of the heart to the flapping of a bird's wings. Such movements are possible because of the action potential firing patterns of neurons and muscle cells. This pat-terned activity can be thought of as oscillations8. Oscillation patterns are also seen in spontaneous neuronal activity, a good example being Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's is characterised by uncontrollable and spontaneous movement tremors. Recordings of Parkinson's tremors in monkeys found oscillations at 3-19 cycles per second (Hz). Remarkably, this oscillating firing pat- tern is also observed at the individual neuronal level in Parkinsons9, which is critical to its diagonosis and treat- ment. However, patterned activity in Parkinson's may be the exception that proves the rule: Patterned activity is usually beneficial - if not necessary - for normal development and brainactivity. This is especially true in devel- oping sensory systems like vision andGeorge Ordiway, a PhD student in the laboratory of Dr. Jason Tait Sanchez at Northwestern University, discusses how patterned activity in the nervous system permits a wide range of biologically relevant functions, including auditory development 166PROFILE The importance of patterned activity in the nervous system for auditory functions hearing. With vision, patterned activity is needed for eye specific segrega- tion10. Auditory development is also dependent on patterned activity. Action potential firing patterns in the developing auditory system An exemplar of auditory development includes research in animal models like mammals and birds. Mice are born deaf, but their auditory path-ways are wired to function when the onset of hearing begins. This brings up an intriguing question; how does auditory neural circuitry develop with- out sensory stimulation? The answer is spontaneous, patterned activity. For example, supporting cells release ATP to activate hair cells in the cochlea, which leads to bursts of firing activity in auditory spiral ganglion neurons 11, 12. This pattern of spontaneous activity, transmitted to the central auditory structures, changes across develop- ment. Firing patterns are random atfirst, gradually change to rhythmic bursts, and then show periods of higher frequency firing, corresponding to before, during and after the onset of hearing, respectively13. Once the auditory system is functionally mature, firing patterns are crucial to encoding different aspects of sound like frequency, intensity and temporal information found in complex signals like speech. Diverse firing patterns are observed in every region of the auditory pathway. For example, in the cochlear nucleus - a lower auditory brainstem structure in both mammals and birds- as many as six different firing patterns have been well documented and studied with respect to different auditory functions1, 14, 15. Cochlear nucleus neurons receive input from one ear, but their target output neurons are located on both sides of the brain- stem. These outputs are responsiblefor our ability to hear sound fromboth sides of the head on the order of tens of microseconds; a remarkable biological feat responsible for soundlocalisation and discriminating complex sounds in background noise 16. Thus, cochlear nucleus neurons are critical for encoding frequency, ampli- tude and timing aspects of sound. In part, this is due to the firing pattern of action potentials at the onset of astimulus (onset responders, Fig. 1A), throughout the stimulus (sustained responders, Fig. 1B), or rapid brief periods during the stimulus (burst responders, Fig 1C). Neurons with different firing patterns send outputs to many different auditory regions, critical in processing the numerous features of complex sounds. One example come from the chicken nucleus magnocellularis - an analo- gous auditory structure to the mam-malian cochlear nucleus. We recently reported the firing pattern from a 167PROFILE - - - Time (ms)Onse t Responder AVoltage (mV) Voltage (mV) Voltage (mV)Sustain edResponder B Burs t Responder Stimulus (pA) Stimulus (pA) Stimulus (pA) Time (ms) Time (ms)30 0 -30 -6030 0 306030 0 -30 -60C 200 0100200 0100200 0100 150 0 100 50 150 0 100 50 0 1000 500 Figure 1. Action potential firing patterns in the chicken auditory brain168PROFILE newly discovered region responsible for processing different frequency elements of sound. These neurons, referred to as NMc, are in stark contrast with other regions where neurons fire a single, precisely timed, onset action potential to stimulation (Fig. 1A). NMc neurons fire multiple bursts of action potentials to slow and gradual stimulation and are hypothe- sised to respond to ultra-low sound frequencies as low as 2Hz (Fig. 1C) 17, 18. This unique firing pattern suggests a novel biological function related to the processing of sound that differs from the typical pattern of firing responsible for binaural hearing. Although burst firing in mammalian sensory systems is not uncommon 19- 24, it was previously unobserved in the chicken auditory brainstem. This new pattern of firing suggests optimisation for an aspect of sound processing not well understood. Nonetheless, it argues for conserved functions across vertebrates for similar sensory encod- ing of the surrounding environment. 1 Leao, R.M., The ion channels and synapses responsible for the physiological diversity of mammalian lower brainstem auditory neurons.

These commitments can beseen in its industrial strategy in support of healthcare. The green paper published by the Cabinet Oce and the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) in July this year is the beginning of a consultation period to support the general population in having ve additional years of a healthy life. For several years, it has been thought prevention is the foundation of addressing challenges evident in coun- tries like England with ageing populations and where multimorbidity (including mental health issues) and physical inactivity are ongoing. In 2014, the ve-year forward view for the NHS emphasised the essential need for prevention. Last year, the DHSC produced Vision which highlighted a collection of case studies to illustrate and promote the need for prevention. In July this year, we saw the publication of the prevention green paper, Advancing our health: prevention in the 2020s . The green paper recognises musculoskeletal (MSK) and mental health conditions as the leading causes of people living for years with a disability. Musculoskeletal health is maintained through a preventive (public health) approach Dr Laura Boothman, Senior Policy Manager at Versus Arthritis, advocates for improved support for people with arthritis and says, \"Good general health startswith good maternal health. Studies indicate the healthof mothers can have a lasting impact on the health oftheir children. We look at prevention as being essentialat every stage of life.\" Physical activity and maintaining healthy weight support goodmusculoskeletal health Adopting healthy lifestyles will likely facilitate a better quality of life later on. The green paper's reinforcement of the importance of regular physical activity is welcome. The UK Government is working with charities like VersusArthritis to encourage people of all ages to include some form of activity in their everyday lives. \"Treating symptoms in isolation doesn't offer a solution to deeper issues. Knowledge, resource and awareness will inevitably be the foundations for a shift in the model of how patients access support to prevent further damage resulting from musculoskeletal conditions.\" Dr Benjamin Ellis, Senior Clinical Policy Adviser to Versus Arthritis and consultant rheumatologist, says, \"If someone has been diagnosed with a condition that aects their joints, the most important thing they can do is to maintain and increase the amount of physical activity they do.\" People with arthritis should be supported not only to stretch but also undertake activity that builds core strength. Everyone should be active daily; this can mean something other than an exercise routine such as regular walking, cycling, or doing housework or gardening. Versus Arthritis underline the importance of forward planning for improved preventive care for people with arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditionsMUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS 171Regular physical activity supports maintaining a healthy weight. As well as being good for the body, exercise also supports improved feelings of wellbeing. Healthier workplaces can allow people to stay in work for longer According to the Oce for National Statistics (ONS) the average person in the UK is employed for 37.5 hourseach week, but this can be as much as 48 hours weekly dependent on their type of employment. Not all jobsare oce-based and some people have dierent work- ing patterns; for example, freelance or shift workers. As people of working age can spend the majority of their time at work, the workplace is a vital setting to apply best practice advice to encourage people to lookafter their musculoskeletal health. \"People with arthritis should be supported not only to stretch but also undertake activity that builds core strength. Everyone should be active daily; this can mean something other than an exercise routine such as regular walking, cycling, or doing housework or gardening.\" Through his clinical work providing care for people with arthritis, Dr Ellis sees the importance of supportive conversations that allow people to be honest and open about their needs. \"People should feel free to talk - whether that's with their healthcare provider or in theworkplace - so they are able to discuss what they needto maintain their independence at work and home.\" Individual healthcare concerns can present obstacles to remaining in work and for those new to the job market, these concerns can cause apprehension about employability. Musculoskeletal conditions can reduce mobility and can compound other long-term conditions like mental health. Research indicates people with musculoskeletal pain are twice as likely to experience signs and symptoms of mental health challenges such as anxiety. Yet, for some people who are just joining, or perhaps trying to rejoin, the workforce health problems can be a barrier to gaining and retaining employment. This isparticularly the case for those living with long-termmusculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis, bromyalgia or mental health conditions such as depression. It is reassuring Government are exploring oering supportto enable workplaces to become more flexible andaccessible for those people who can benet from this the most. \"The law requires employers to make 'reasonable adjustments' for people living with a disability, which includes many people with arthritis,\" says Dr Ellis. \"Depending on the person and their job, this could include reducing the physical requirements of their role, being flexible about working hours and location, or providing specialist equipment.\" Getting prevention wrong isn't an option for the health service While the prevention green paper has indicated regular health checks being an objective in improved patient care, ideally, these health checks would domore for people with arthritis. Treating symptoms in isolation doesn't oer a solution to deeper issues. Knowledge, resource and awareness will inevitably be the foundations for a shift in the modelof how patients access support to prevent furtherdamage resulting from musculoskeletal conditions. The Government's target is fteen years to achieve thegoals set out in this year's ocial green paper. Poor musculoskeletal health and arthritis can stop individuals from living their lives. To allow people to continue living as independently as possible, working and enjoying their lives, they require access to appropriate services that support, acknowledge and address individual needs. Versus Arthritis Tel: +44 (0)300 790 0400enquiries@arthritisresearchuk.org www.versusarthritis.org www.twitter.com/VersusArthritisTo kick things off, Professor Dr Martin Fl\u00fcck explains how the research at the Laboratory for Muscle Plasticity at Balgrist University Hospital aims to shed light on the mechanisms that govern skeletalmuscle function in health and disease, with the goal of translating the findings into more effective clinical applications. Martin notes that the approach of a head of a department is to make a patient-directed question that you must elucidate in a labora- tory setting and he adds that the mechanisms in this respect need to be described in a coherent manner. This is because the words used to describe active processes when it comes to the muscle can be wronglyused and do not match what we would use to describe the biology of the patient. Martin then continues these themes in his own words, including the importance of accelerating trans-lation for the benefit of the patient. \"We have been investing much in rediscovering older ideas - ones that surgeons originally rejected - based upon an incomplete description of the time course of muscle degeneration following a musculoskeletal injury.Previously, they looked at what happened in rotator cuff disease quite late in the degenerative process, which is quite common when a tendon ruptures, but much of the negative remodelling has already occured at this point. As such, things have to bechecked early on which brings us back to a previous hypothesis that was rejected, Martin tells us. He goes on to expand this point in his own words. \"Basically, our approach is to translate the clinical problem in an experimen- tal scenario that allows to test thera- pies for emerging bottlenecks in the recovery of musculoskeletal function of the patient. In this respect we now revisit early ideas for solutions of the negative remodeling of the injured muscle-tendon tissue composite which were set out 15 years ago, but rejected based on preliminary studies with negative outcome. We do this because we identify that the first window of opportunity for treatment after injury and reconstructive surgery, is short and not addressed experimentally, and consequently a number of active mechanism were overlooked. This can be explained for example by the destruction of the cellular powerhouse, mitochondria, with immobilization that was not consid- ered important; but we now know now that this exerts a dominant neg-ative influence on the maintenance of muscle mass and fatigue resistance. Based on these findings one can reasonably argue that the treatment of disuse-related aspects of muscu- loskeletal disease, such as after tendon rupture, should start early, before the deterioration of clinicalendpoints such as a loss in strength and fatigue resistance of muscle can be diagnosed and established as a chronic disability. We also have a window of opportunity here to translate what we see in other muscle affections, such as during recovery from anterior cruciate liga- ment injury and repair and cardiovas- cular disease (CVD) that also involves the deconditioning of peripheral skeletal muscle (Fl\u00fcck et al, 2018). The critical factor here is how long the muscle is in a semi-stable state after an injury before it enters into a devas- tating spiral of muscle wasting. So, we aim to provide evidence in a coherent manner for how many days and weeks you can keep using the muscle before surgery needs to takes place. We now know, for instance, when muscle loss occurs and when it trans- fers into fat.\" The power of medication and the importance of timing While it is not one of his main priori- ties, Martin then shares his thoughts on educating the patients in this respect, as a dentist would when advising that teeth should be brushed three times daily but if one does not follow such advice then things will go bad. When it comes to translation for the benefit of the patient, Martin believes that while very simple forms of medication are available, such as steroids, there are new drugs on theIn this second interview, Professor Dr Martin Fl\u00fcck reveals how his research aims to shed light on the mechanisms that govern skeletal muscle function in health and disease, with the goal of translating the findings into more effective clinical applicationsThe mechanisms that govern skeletal muscle function 172PROFILEmarket that have passed governmental tests, and as such, their use is safe for humans to ingest. Martin's opinion is that the power of existing medication can be improved by timing when it is taken so that muscle deterioration can be delayed. For example, if medication is adminis- tered under neuromuscular electric stimulation during the first two weeks after injury when surgery typically does not take place because the patient is in a lot of pain and experi- encing tissue swelling. This approach is the way forward, according to Martin, who adds that he works hard with the surgeons because they are not used to working in such a manner, so a rethinking of priorities is there-fore essential when you have the first meeting with a patient. The benefits of excellent research facilities The conversation then turns to explore Martin's thoughts on the superb new research facilities at the BalgristCampus, and the benefit they have had on the valuable work and research at the campus. We find out how different parts of the BalgristCampus are grouped together to enable easier access to research facil- ities and the pipelines are, therefore, tighter. In addition, there are other routines which allow for the accelera- tion of research because new invest-ments have been made for the functional exploitation of musclestructure during movement. Martin says that while his research output has not yet concretely bene- fited from the new facilities, interac- tions with other scientists who carry out anatomical measurements of the muscle has been a plus for him. \"It ismuch easier for the students or researchers to train using these methods to measure muscle volume, get a 3D image and analyse the muscle. The facilities are good because they are open during weekdays and the weekend so people can come in and get things turned around.\" State-of-the-art methods and technologies This compelling interview continues, with Martin keen to detail the veryimportant role that state-of-the-art methods and technologies play in the field of muscle research when it comes to the work taking place at the Balgrist Campus and in their fruitful cooperation with the FunctionalGenomics Center of the University of Zurich/ETH. Knowledge gathering can be accelerated, Martin reveals, in terms of exploiting paradigms in more breadth and in a higher resolution. State-of-the-art methods and tech- nologies enable the measurement of multiple species and the use of powerful tools that enable researchers to work at a very fast pace. Still muchwork needs to be done in the field, Martin underlines. \"We still need good knowledge on the cell, biological, chemical and anatom- ical aspects of disease because it can be misleading to rely solely on results from one novel method. An image tool can always be used to draw con- clusions about the raw numbers but nevertheless, combining that in a very elegant approach that relates to a systems biology that people advocate was raised at a conference around 11years ago (Fl\u00fcck et al. 2008). \"Now, weget biomarkers that allow us to screen patients out of the acceleration of numbers that we can relate to the relevant sizes of muscle, and we canmore easily determine something in blocks, for example, or by a simple genetic test.\" Personalised sports medicine and exercise rehabilitation When it comes to disruptive ideas for personalised sports medicine and exercise rehabilitation, Martin saysthat one of his thoughts around this isthe problem of getting economically viable pipelines established for medics. If it be for reasons of wisdom, or economic causes, the medical profession has typically been shy when it was to implement paradigm shifting approaches this demanded the reconsideration of established clinical routines. Now, it is about how a patient is aware of a problem and goes to a doctor to seek a solution. Sometimes, a doctor has a fair and good knowledge, but a researcher can be very well-informed about an aspect of health that perhaps a doctor doesn't know about. It might be that a doctor needs to do a literature search but although ultimately powerful and justified, this slows down decision taking. The latter in fact is a very active area of Research and Development in the Polytechnical School of Zurich (ETH) to identify faster and more comprehensive ways to approach a disease, Martin notes. \"Here, progressive methods could be used for other treatments even if it is not generally accepted nowadays. For example, if you had a bone fracture as I did, would you only do the training they tell you to do or would you do more, especially if you are experienced in physical training and know the limits of (your) human performance and capacity for the improvement through the stimulation of muscu- 173PROFILE174PROFILE loskeletal plasticity? Would you train hard to ensure a better recovery? Or do you want to get access to treatment that some people are using, such as biohacking that concerns legally allowed biological principles? For example, there are ways in which people can enrich their stem cells and reinject into them during training. \"Gene therapy won't solve everything and when looking at this field of atrophy, it needs to be administered in doses because that is how we grow. We renew, or grow, our active muscles one by one, 1% every day. Using this method repeatedly is way too much for the health system, indeed, we don't visit a doctor daily for two years, so we may anticipate to inject the agent in small doses. People who do biohacking reinject their stem cells when training daily for one month and then either stop or continue. This is not good for control and it is questionable if you carry this out in large numbers. But this is how these processes work. Improvements in strength and endurance rely on adap- tations in muscle and tendons to(daily) repeated stimuli that if reach a specific threshold of mechanical or metabolic overload. The potency of it is enhanced by a high load of medica- tion but the problem is that it uses far too many resources from the per- spective of the health practitioner. Certainly, it is getting too expensive, so how do we deal with that? There will be big solutions to translate and in some cases, to abandon stem cell gene therapy for patients with many risks; but if it works, it will be quite disruptive. Martin then details his thoughts on rehabilitation after muscle injury occurs.\"Another more practical consideration is the contribution of the chiropractor or physiotherapist in rehabilitation. In the U.S., as the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons sees it, the post-operative rehabilitation is condi- tioned by new ideas on the load, the intensity and volume of training. Phys- iotherapy often takes over that part but may overrule the researcher and possibly the orthopaedic surgeons because they have greater experience, and the pharmacist has even more experience of the drug. \"The well-trained physiotherapist is knowledgeable about rehabilitative interventions the patient should do post-operatively during musculoskele- tal rehabilitation to achieve maximal benefit. The physiotherapist will do what is allowed in the window of inter- vention for the patient but maybe itcould be done more aggressively and earlier? We have seen how in some hospitals in Germany, that certain post-operative interventions are start- ing much earlier to allow lymphatic drainage and reperfusion, for instance, after anterior cruciate ligament surgery. We know that this is very beneficial for healing from the experience of other surgeries as it is applied worldwide. So - this is something that we should actively pursue - that the physiother- apist or the people with knowledge of that aspect have more to say. This is the current practice of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and hasn't yet been fully carried over to larger parts of Switzerland. \"What is also a problem is that because there is an economic pipeline, defining within which duration post-operative interventions can be performed in ahospital setting. New knowledge on therapeutic interventions which would extend beyond this window, or which are complicated to carry out in ambu- lant sessions of rehabilitation, may fall out of consideration for an implemen- tation. This is particular concern for the reconditioning of an atrophied muscle, which must be tackled as early as possible by enhancing (or mimicking) the mechanical and metabolic load of an active muscle. There is a classic study from a famous English researcher which clearly shows that immediately after bone fracture, the contractile activity of concerned muscle groups must be increased for instance with sessions of neuromus- cular electric stimulation (NMES) to maintain its protein balance.\" Martin adds that studies have been done around these aforementioned areas but they had not been carried out for a long enough duration to really gain benefit from. NMES may be used for some very high profile sports individuals, such as the number one acrobatic skier who has treatment at the Balgrist University Hospital and uses EMS for an hour or two daily which works. While there are not enough resources to understand howit works, the patient needs to be willing to do NMES for many months or years as shown successfully in rare cases of tetra plegic patients, Martin stresses, which is disruptive. \"I know of athletes using EMS at night and I know it works but there is a big disconnect between the basic knowl- edge and how you apply it. Only committed people use EMS, often externally through Balgrist University Hospital. The patient will stay in thehospital for a month and this approach works but this method it is only disruptive if it is translated to all patients and the benefit for society would be great.\" The priorities for musculoskeletal disorders Martin then sheds light on the priorities ahead for the diagnostics, treatment and rehabilitation of all musculoskeletal disorders. He says that his priorities for the future are very practical ones, in terms of the areas identified in this interview which need to be pursued. A willingness to change the system is needed, Martinnotes and adds that if a treatment is available, it is important to ask at the Balgrist University Hospital withwhom one can collaborate to apply such a genetic test. This involves much rethinking of the legal procedures when it comes to data protection and risk around genetic tests, Martin tells us. In closing, Martin underlines that there is an issue today around health insurance because you cannot fully evaluate people in terms of numbers. Martin asks us to imagine that if we own a car and there is a problem with it then we go to the garage to get it repaired so that it works properly. This helps us to understand Martin's areas of research, and that Balgrist Univer- sity Hospital sends out people who can walk again even though they may have a functional deficit following treatment but thresholds are not set to provide the patient with a map of the individual aspects of its muscu- loskeleton which require further improvement through therapy andtraining to empower a full regain offunctional work capacity. Martin develops this point and adds his concluding remarks to this in-depth interview. \"Translating effective measures for the patient is a priority, so that they recover and that the form of treat- ment given is acceptable, such as gene therapy. Of course, gene therapy is far too expensive but the questionis how can you do that? Do you have a risk priority in some areas? Or doyou have the basic genetic tests thatpredict that such an approach will not help some patients, the health systemor even the hospital? \"The priority must be to substitute for a subtle, often unnoticed, geneticdeficit with an effective treatment which is what we do in the cardiovas- cular field, where with a non-respon- der to rehabilitation we try to haveanother treatment that the patient can respond to. \"Finally, I want to add that I am not connected with my European col- leagues who have two approaches. One is a centralised setting tied to the way the state is organised, such as in the UK, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries that rely on an institutional monarchy who have specifically robust, but sometimes rigid, ways of tackling some diseases. But interestingly, there is a disconnect in terms of what we aim to do in Switzerland where we have a federal system to gather information and administer a solution in a totally different way. \"In the UK, for example, there are the state organs to indicate how topursue new treatments best based on a centralised database. In Switzerland, we gather information from our indi- vidual datasets and I see from my experience of working in different cultures that despite the possibilities for innovation provided by the latter approach, it sometimes lacks effective power for translation on a large scale. We need a solution to direct preven- tive and curative treatments in a more individual and economically viable manner to the entire spectra of the population. But to do so, we should combine a well-informed population- based approach with the innovative powers of an individualized approach, possibly by changing the organization of the health care system.\" 175PROFILE Professor Dr Martin Fluck Laboratory for Muscle NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES 176Tackling the growing burden of brain disorders in Europe Over the last decades, neurological and mental conditions have steadily progressed to become the leading causes of disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) and the second leadingcause of death worldwide. In Europe alone, an esti- mated 179 million Europeans live with brain disorders and 1 in 3 are set to live with one within their lifespan. Every year, treating brain conditions accounts for 35% of Europe's total disease burden with a yearly cost of \u20ac798 billion, of which 60% are related to direct costs (both medical and non-medical) [1,2,3,4], which, in spite of the magnitude of these numbers, are still consideredto be underestimated and outdated. New epidemio- logical and economic studies are currently underway to analyse the extent of this burden on European and global society. The Global Burden of Disease study (WHO, GBD 2016) estimated that neurological disorders were the cause of 276 million DALYs (11.6% of global DALYs for all diseases) and 9 million deaths (16.5% of total global deaths in 2016). Neurological disorders were the leading cause group of global DALYs and second leading cause group of deaths in 2016, while mental disorders accounted for 13% of DALYs[5]. This high burden [5,6]may be surprising as there is a general lack of awareness on the pervasiveness of brain disorders. However, the growing number of citizens being diagnosed with brain conditions makes clear that the burden of these diseases place on society will not change its course. This burden is continuous due to the epidemiological transition from acute to chronic diseases and the increase in life expectancy, but also because of several socio-economic, environmental and behavioural health determinants.National brain plans It is clear that prompt action is needed at all levels. With health being a member state competency, this lack of awareness, prioritisation and disjunction in addressing the burden grows only stronger. Robust strategies at a national level and strong EU-wide coordination eorts are needed to eectively address the burden of diseases, particularly those reaching concerning levels of burden, such as brain disorders - neurological and mental alike. In 2015, the European Brain Council called on the European Union (EU) Member States to work closely with patient represen- tatives, scientic societies and clinicians towards designing and establishing National Brain Plans, which aim to provide a holistic strategy to accelerate brain research and reduce the impact of brain disorders. Norway and Poland have spearheaded the launch of National Brain Plans, which constitute a key tool for supporting brain research and improving the quality of treatment. By countries (either EU or non-EU) recog- nising the brain as a priority, the urgency of addressing the burden is demonstrated and can play a major role in convincing the Member States to push the brain to the top of the EU research and health agenda. Calls for increased funding: Counting down to zero Horizon Europe is key in playing a positive role in addressing the burden of brain disorders, though the mention of health research - or brain research, speci- cally - is scarce and the recognition that funding in this eld has continuously dropped over the last three Framework Programmes is neglected. In fact, this budget conrms a relative decrease of funding over time and across Framework Programmes, as health was previously allocated 12% under the 7th FrameworkFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Destrebecq, Executive Director of the European Brain Council explains the importance of tackling the growing burden of brain disorders in EuropeNEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES 177Programme, 10% under Horizon 2020 and now 8% in the Horizon Europe proposal [7]. Despite the progress in medical science during recent decades and recent breakthroughs which have provided a powerful dual opportunity to relieve the societal burden of neurological and mental disorders and innovate at the frontiers of technology, the inherent complexity of the nervous system has hampered our translational capacity and the vast majority of brain disorders remain without ecient cures. In order to ensure that Horizon Europe becomes a robust instru-ment for supporting brain research, budgets need to match the challenge. The \u20ac7.7 billion provisionally allocated to the \"health\" cluster under Pillar II is not commensurate with the total budget increase and will clearly be insucient to eectively address the societalchallenges associated with health research. Brain, Mind & Pain The reestablishment of the Brain, Mind & Pain MEP Interest Group is a positive sign that the newly elected European Parliament sees the importance of thegroup. The Group's rst course of action was to release its Book of Evidence for the 2019-2024 mandate, whichoutlines clear focus areas and proposes recommenda- tions for policy actions, which, if implemented, would signicantly improve the quality of life for people with neurological and chronic pain disorders, as well as their families and carers. This Book of Evidence and the work of the BMP Interest Group as a whole contributes to the vision of the brain community on the reorgani- sation of care systems and services to respond to thegrowing unmet needs of patients. The value of treatment Discussions on healthcare focus too often on theincrease in per-person healthcare cost rather than on the benets of better health through early detectionand early intervention. It is, therefore, important to emphasise on the need for more value-based and patient-centred care as well as strategies of early diagnosis and intervention, which proves to be cost- ecient and cost-eective in the long run [8].

Nothing unusual, but from the perspective of my brain there are a number of challenges to be solved within these few seconds. In principle, physical cues from the environment reach my sensory organs, my brain extracts meaningful information from these cues and transforms them into commands for my muscles. Naively, one could assume that identical sensory input would trigger identical behaviour. Yet, when facing my door, my brain instructs me to turn around and get on my bike in the morning, but to open it and go through in the evening. This is because the two views of the door are seen in different behavioural and motivational contexts (e.g. time of day, my hunger state and the knowledge of how I got into the situation). But how do I decide what to do? In principle, the brain has to assess the current state of the world based on sensory information from the environ- mentand compare it to an internally generated, desired state of the world. Any mismatch between the two will trigger a behaviour to compensate for the discrepancy between what I perceive as my current world and what I would desire this world to belike. How is this desired state of the world determined by the brain? In other words, how are the goals of my actions encoded? In humans, the answer to this question has captured the attention of philosophers and scientists since ancient times, as it ultimately relates to the concept of whether there is free will and what role conscious experi- ences play in how we decide upon our actions. The problem in trying to understand how our brain generates these representations, determines goals and makes decisions, is thatthere are 85 billion neurons in ourbrain, linked by more connections than there are stars in our galaxy. This results in a neural network of enor- mous complexity with millions of neu- rons involved in any of the mentioned tasks. If we would like to understand the fundamental neural processes that lie at the very heart of how brains control actions based on internal goals, this complexity has to be reduced. This is what I do in my ongoing research. A brain in the brain In my research group, we tackle the problem of goal-directed behaviour in the context of navigation. The abilityDr Stanley Heinze, Associate Professor at Lund University's Department of Biology, underlines his fascinating work on neuroscience, notably using elementary navigation decisions to understand brain functionTurning left, right or going straight - using elementary navigation decisions to understand brain function 178PROFILE Figure 1: Towards the neurobiological basis of behavioural decisions.Click to enlargeto move from one place to another in a planned way is one of the defining features of most animals. Navigational decisions are, therefore, one of the most essential decisions that deter- mine an animal's chance of survival. This applies also to us humans, as most of our momentary decisions revolve around the question whether to turn right, left, or continue to go straight. If you break down any navi- gation behaviour into a moment to moment basis, many can be simplified as long series of elementary navigation decisions. For these decisions, the desired state of the world simply becomes a desired movement direction. This direction has to be compared tothe current body-orientation and any mismatch can be compensated by a simple steering manoeuvre. Whenthese momentary steering decisions are chained together over time, a coherent strategy for navigation will emerge, only depending on which rules are applied to determine the desired headings. Therefore, the abstract concept of comparing the current and desired states of the world is essentially reduced to align-ing two angles: the goal direction and the current heading. Whereas this reduction in complexity is important to develop a tractable strategy to unravel the neural basis of behavioural decisions, determining navigational goals remains a highly complex task that requires many millions of neurons in the humanbrain and that depends on memory, internal state and highly integrated sensory information. To realistically pursue the goal of understanding this process on the level of individual neurons, my research group works on insects, more specifically we focus on a single brain area in the insect brain, the central complex (CX). This region only consists of around 3,000 neuronsbut is involved in all of the described processes. It integrates multiple streams of sensory information, it is involved in visual memory, regulating internal states (e.g. sleep) and con- tains neurons whose activity directly controls walking behaviour. Essentially, the CX carries out all the functions that we have defined as key functions of brains in general - effectively being a \"brain in the brain\". Extracting a core circuit The CX exists in all insects, independent of lifestyle, sensory environment and phylogenetic relationships. When comparing this region across species, its gross anatomy appears to be virtually unchanged since the dawn of insects more than 500 million years ago, suggesting that something about its function is truly essential to survival. A defining feature of the CX is its extremely regular, almost crystallinelayout, consisting of 16-18 repeating vertical columns, which are intersected by horizontal layers. An interplay of two classes of neurons creates this regular array: tangential neurons transferring information from manydifferent brain regions to this central integration hub and repeating sets of columnar neurons. The latter form stereotypical connectivity patterns within the CX and additionally consti- tute its main output. The projection patterns of these neu- rons define the neural computations that can be carried out by the circuit. This structure-function relation is present in all brains and species but is extremely pronounced in the stereo- typical projection matrix that has evolved in the CX. We found a striking example of this when plotting the tuning angles of polarized-light sensi- tive CX neurons against the anatomi- cal location of their input branches. This produces a mapping of these tuning angles across the CX columns. When the animal rotates under the sky, activity should move around this brain region in sync with the animal'srotations. Essentially, we had found an ordered array of head-direction cells, which uses polarized skylight (and hence the Sun) as reference.Importantly, these head-direction circuits are virtually identical across 179PROFILE Figure 2: The head, brain and central complex (shown with speed neurons) of a tropical sweat bee. Electric activity recorded from single neurons shown at bottom left. Click to enlarge180PROFILE all examined insects. This discovery was the first building block needed to understand the neural circuits underlying navigational decisions. But how is the information about body orientation used to drive behavioural decisions? A model grounded in biology An insight was offered by a chance occasion. I was waiting for a bus after a conference in Italy. At the time, I wanted to see what the patterns of connectivity in the CX were, that could be inferred from anatomical data. I had an hour and nothing better to do, so I started to draw, producing a com- plicated and admittedly rather messy tangle of lines, which nevertheless looked oddly familiar. The day before,Barbara Webb, a robotics researcher from the University of Edinburgh, had given a talk about a model for path integration. Path integration is a com- putation that is employed by many animals, from insects to mammalsand is used for finding back to a point of origin, for instance, a nest. As some insects, in particular, bees and ants, are exceptionally efficient when navi- gating with this strategy, I compared the individual elements of her model with my drawing, realising that every single detail could be matched to CX neurons. This was incredible -a model that had been artificially evolved by engineers to carry out path integra- tion was embedded in the anatomical projection patterns of the bee brain! Around the same time, I carried out electrophysiological recordings aimed at exploring how the internal compass of night-active bees differed from the Sun compass of other insects. As I could not find too many compass neurons, I used my virtual reality arena to test responses to optic flow fields that the bee would experience when flying. Indeed, I found neuronsin the bee brain that responded specifically to simulated forward or backward flight. Moreover, they also projected to the CX. Translational optic flow is used by honeybees to estimate their flight speed when using path integration. Whenever they move through their environment, the environment moves across their retina at a speed corre- sponding to their own speed. When this speed signal is integrated over time, the flown distance can be calcu- lated. During foraging, this distance is combined with compass information to keep track of every movement after the bee leaves its nest. At each point during its foraging trip, this informa- tion, therefore, tells the bee the direction and distance of the nest -itshome vector. When we combined these and the remaining relevant CX neurons into a computational model, this model reliably enabled a virtual bee to find back to its nest. When implemented on a physical robot, the path integration circuit mimickingthe bee CX also resulted in reliable homing behaviour. For the first time in any species, this circuit provides an anatomically con- strained circuit for path integration, combining the above-described head- direction code with a similar pattern of activity that encodes the desired heading (i.e. the home vector). Both angles are represented as activity patterns, distributed across the CX columns. Steering neurons sample these two distributions and translate differences into steering commands. This circuit was what we had been looking for, a plausible neural imple- mentation of elementary navigational decisions. Challenges ahead The described model circuit for path integration now provides the basis todevelop a concept for how other navigation strategies could be imple-mented. All we needed to exchange was the source of activation in the memory neurons to generate a new Figure 3: The insect brain database, an accessible tool for depositing, sharing and managing insect neuroscience data.Click to enlargedesired heading, which would be compared to the animal's current heading in the same way as during path integration, providing a basic framework to explain most directed behaviour. While key parts of our model remain hypothetical, numerous predictions arise from the fact that all circuit functions are mapped onto existing CX neurons and, thus, can direct research to the most promising cell types. For the first time, we have an idea of what the conserved core circuit of the CX is and where the differences between species are, allowing us to observe the evolutionary tuning knobs that adapt a system tochanging ecological needs. In my group, we have started to dissect this circuit across six species of bees and ants, all differing in their mode of transportation (walking versus flying), as well as their favourite navigation strategies. Using serial section block-face electron microscopy, we are obtaining detailed connectivity maps of the CX to test circuit predic- tions arising from our models. A key functional prediction is that specific CX neurons encode path integration memory. This memory should depend on ongoing neural activity, similar to our own working memory (as opposed to long-term memory). We are using molecular, anatomical, physiological and behavioural methods to detect the memory cells, confirm the nature of the memory and to develop a simple model for working memory. Excitingly, our work also begins to address the neural switches that change the mode of the path integra- tion circuit from recording (generating the home vector) to following (usingthe vector to steer homewards). In essence, these questions aim at understanding the motivational inputsthat decide which behaviour is appro- priate in which situation. These processes are homing in on our initial question: Why are we doing the things we do? Would it not be amazing if the basic processes underlying behavioural decisions have not dramatically changed over 500 million years and the brain of a bee could bring us closer to understanding our own human nature? Reaching out I have worked on insect brains forover a decade and hopefully, any reader at this point is convinced that we can gain substantial insight into how brains work from investigating these small but fascinating neural systems. Yet, if I had asked a general reader at the beginning of this essay if locust and bee brains could tell usanything about how we make deci- sions, the answer would have probably been a surprised: \"Insects have brains?\". At least this was the response I received when I gave a presentation about my research at my old high school several years ago. To allow insect neuroscience to reach a wider audience, I have teamed up with a professional web-developer and generated a free, online tool to visualise, manage and share original research data. We are now hosting the most inclusive database on insect brain morphology and function, including data from 15 different species, based on work of ten research groups around the world. Not only are we granting access to 3D models, single neurons, images, func- tional information and raw data of individual experiments, but we have also developed intuitive visualisation aids that generate publication-ready illustrations for research, outreach and teaching. To enable non-anatomists to benefit from the database, we haveDr Stanley Heinze Associate Professor Lund University, Department of Biology, Lund Vision Group Tel: +46 462 229 578 staney.heinze@biol.lu.sehttps://braininbrain.org/ www.twitter.com/stanley_heinze 181PROFILE also generated an intuitive graphical search interface. While we are still working out the details of the long- term financial sustainability of our website it is fully functional and acces- sible. Using our database, scientists, journalists and members of the public can explore neuroscience data, pro- viding an unobstructed glimpse of what the product of our research is. Ideally, this transparency will generate a deeper understanding of the output of science, might spark interest in insect neuroscience and will hopefully enhance the appreciation for the invertebrate members of the animal kingdom.

We spoke to experts in dementia research from universities, phar-maceutical companies and other charities and found a consensus that while dementia research is receiving greater support than ever before, there remain gaps in understanding and ways of work that must be addressed. These areas represent important opportuni-ties to accelerate progress and bring about life-changing treatments for people with dementia. The current crisis The scale of dementia is now impossible to ignore. Globally, 50 million people are living with dementia, with that number predicted to triple by 2050. Thissheer number of people with the condition cost theglobal economy $1trillion in 2018. \"...a major gap exists between research funding for serious diseases. In 2016/17, cancer research received \u00a3269 million in UK government funding compared to \u00a383.1 million for dementia in the same year.\" Compounding this health crisis is a lack of eectivetreatments. Currently, while we can temporarily treat some of the symptoms of dementia, we cannot stop, slow or prevent the diseases, like Alzheimer's, that cause the condition. It has been 17 years since the last new drug for dementia was made available and we believe that people living with dementia and their loved ones deserve better. Current gaps in dementia research To bring about change, we worked with experts in the dementia eld to develop a strategic action plan to address gaps in our current understanding. We havecalled for reform in six key areas to ensure we:Investigate the eects of newly identied genetic risk factors on disease processes. Improve understanding of why some brain nerve cells are more resilient than others. Bolster early drug discovery work to identify the most promising new treatments opportunities. Select the right participants for clinical trials. Improve ways to measure how eectively drugs are working in people. Find ways to begin clinical trials in people decades earlier than we do today Our research needs to focus eorts on the most impor- tant biological processes driving disease. This will give us the best chance of bringing about the life-changing treatments people with dementia desperately need. It will require us to think carefully about how we designHere, Hilary Evans, Chief Executive at Alzheimer's Research UK, outlines expert insight into where dementia research should move next Hilary Evans, Chief Executive NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES 183our clinical trials in the smartest ways to test potential new medicines. Updating our approach In 2013, the G8 committed to nding a disease-modi-fying treatment for people with dementia by 2025. Since then, research has moved on. While clinical trials of disease-modifying treatments have not yet borne fruit, we have learnt huge amounts about the complexdiseases driving dementia. But to continue making progress in research we must review what's working well and what could be improved. And we need to take brave steps to move things forward to bring about new medicines. The recommendations outlined in our report are all steps that industry, charity and funders can make, through training, rewards and funding programmes. While they're bold steps, they are manageable and we must start to implement them at the earliest opportunity. Speeding up progress Progress in dementia research does not happen overnight - it requires commitment and a multi-faceted approach. We need to improve prevention strategies, work to detect the diseases that cause dementia ear- lier and expand our understanding of the biological underpinnings of disease at the same time. An overarching resolution is to nd new ways to incen- tivise collaboration between researchers, particularly between those from dierent scientic disciplines who may be able to oer new perspectives on the challenge. We also need to eciently and comprehensively share data at all levels across the scientic community. By standardising approaches to the way we collect and share data, we can more easily compare results and pick out important trends in the data, accelerating progress. It's a huge task, but it's one we must undertake together. Funding makes breakthroughs possible We know that research breakthroughs are made possi- ble by sustained funding. Looking at cancer, in the UK alone, 50 years of committed and increasing investment from 1970 have led to a doubling in the cancer survival rate in this country. We hope to replicate this success for dementia. But right now, a major gap exists between research funding for serious diseases. In 2015/16, cancer research received \u00a3269 million in UK government funding compared to \u00a383.1 million for dementia in the same year. Globally, we're seeing governments commit to increasing budgets for dementia research - the U.S. now spends $2.4 billion on dementia research and Canada has pledged to spend 1% of the cost of care on research. We must see the UK step up to join this global eort and commit to investing just 1% towards research to bringan end to the fear, harm and heartbreak of dementia. We're doing our part to close the funding gap too. This year, Alzheimer's Research UK committed to spend a landmark \u00a3250 million in dementia research over the next ve years thanks to our incredible supporters.

Mutations and other changes in the genome of cells induce their malignant transformation which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and destructive growth. Survival, proliferation and migration of healthy cells are controlled by an intricate network of signalling pathways. Dysregulation of such pathways is an integral part of malignant transforma- tion and contributes significantly to the loss of growth control and the ability to form metastases. Intramembrane proteases are enzymes that cleave substrate proteins embed- ded in cellular membranes and release the cleavage fragments from the membrane (read more in the October 2018 edition of Open Access Government ). By this, intramembrane proteases actively control signalling pathways as exemplified by the inten- sively studied Notch pathway (read more in the January 2019 edition of Open Access Government ). Following activation of the Notch receptor by its ligand, this receptor undergoes a series of proteolytic cleavages culmi- nating in the liberation of its intracel- lular domain into the cytosol by -secretase, an intramembrane pro- tease, which is also involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease(read more in the July 2019 edition of Open Access Government ). Over-activated Notch signalling plays a well-established role in carcinogen- esis and tumour progression. In certain types of leukemia (T-ALL) over 50% of cases exhibit Notch-activating muta- tions which drive disease develop- ment. Therefore, different means of interfering with Notch signalling have been assessed. Pharmacological inhibition of -secretase blocks Notch signalling since translocation of the Notch intracellular domain to the cell's nucleus is dependent on cleavage of Notch by -secretase. Therefore, inhibitors of -secretase are evaluated in promising phase I and phase II clinical studies against different solid tumours and leukaemias. In particular, patients with a documented activation of the Notch signalling pathway in the tumour may profit from such an approach, possibly in conjunction with established treatment strategies. However, this approach may require further evaluation, since beyond the Notch receptor altogether more thanhundred different proteins have been identified to be cleaved by -secre- tase. Among these are also several receptor tyrosine kinases, which can support proliferation and survival of cancer cells, but it is not clear yet if inhibition of -secretase cleavage will affect the signals induced by thesereceptors and how this will impact on tumour growth. Effects of these receptors may also differ between tumours of different origin and, thus, will require further clinical studies. The reported anti-cancer action of certain -secretase inhibitors may in part also be supported by an accom- panying action of these compounds on members of a mechanistically related protease family, the SPP/SPPL proteases. Among these, in particular Signal Peptide Peptidase (SPP) has been linked with cancer. SPP was found to be highly upregulated in lung and breast tumours. In agreement, SPP depletion significantly reducedRegina Fluhrer from the University of Augsburg and Bernd Schr\u00f6der from the TU in Dresden discuss the potential of intramembrane proteases as targets for cancer therapiesWhat is proteases in Cancer? 184PROFILE Regina Fluhrer, professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the Medical Faculty at the University of Augsburg, GermanyBernd Schr\u00f6der, professor of Physiological Chemistry and Molecular Biology at the Institute of Physiological Chemistry at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, invasion SignalingGlycosylation ? cell growth and migration/invasion capacity of tumour cells in animal models. Since currently no specific inhibitors of SPP suitable for in vivo application are available, a potential anti-cancer effect in humans remains to be determined. With regard to the underlying mechanisms, cleavage of different substrate proteins has been proposed to be responsible for the tumour-promoting activity of SPP. Therefore, further work will be needed to unravel this proteolytic network and its role in cancer biology as well as its therapeutic potential. It is well established that a change of glycosylation patterns can significantly affect and modulate the behaviour ofcancer cells. Sugar moieties are attached to almost half of all cellular proteins during their synthesis by a process known as protein glycosylation. This is also the basis for formation of the extracellular matrix, the material surrounding our body cells constitut- ing a scaffold for their growth and migration. The extracellular matrix is formed by secretion of various glyco- proteins from cells. The adhesion of cancer cells to this network as well as the composition of the extracellular matrix influence their potential to metastasize. In this context, another member of the SPP/SPPL protease family, SPPL3,is of great interest to be explored, as it is a major regulator of cellular protein glycosylation (read more in the January 2019 edition of Open Access Government) and, thus, also impacts on the synthesis of the extra- cellular matrix proteins. In this regard, evaluating the impact of SPPL3 and a modulation of its activity on tumour cells is of great potential. As these examples show, the role of intramembrane proteases in cancer is still emerging. These versatile enzymes regulate central cellular pathways, which also play a major role in tumour cells. Whereas the assessment of the therapeutic potential of -secretase in clinical studies is already quite advanced, our knowledge on other intramembrane proteases in this context currently only results from pre-clinical models or cell biological studies. However, based on these promising results it may be antici- pated from further research efforts in this direction that intramembrane proteases will turn out to be attractive targets in cancer therapy in the future.

They do this as 'biospecimens' are central to theirunderstanding of human biology and the diseases we encounter. At its core, 'biospecimens' contain the information that doctors and researchers use to understand what type of disease a patient has and to determine possibletreatment options that should be used for their clinical management. Through advances in biotechnology, theinformation in the biospecimen can now be readily and routinely extracted leading to vast amounts of digital data being captured in machine-readable forms. This'datacation' of biospecimens generates metabolomics, epigenomics) reflecting themolecular events ongoing in the disease. Or it may be information drawn from medical and microscopic analyses of images of tissue samples. When building a framework for personalised treatment of disease, the complexity of the biospecimen-derived information must be captured in meaningful and actionable ways. As the impacts of the use of digital information to the healthcare system have been emerging, personalised medicine will be directed by computational scientists and data analysts active in the biomedical domains. In doing so, tissue-based science is now an informatics problem. The problem of centralising biospecimens Within biomedical research, centralisation of its core activities into aggregated facilities or 'repositories', such as nodes, databases, or registries is a well-entrenched practice. Current tissue handling practices seek toaggregate biospecimens into giant freezers that arelinked to databases of annotated clinical and 'omic' data, registries of patient information and research project ethical consent. 1Over the past 20 years, aggregation of biospecimens into biobanks have emerged which, in the U.S., is anticipated to become a $2.7 billion industry by 2022.2Biobankers operate their repositories as largely autonomous self-governed entities that obtain their biospecimens through arrangements within pathologyservices or directly from surgery. Whilst the narrative around strategic planning recognises that 'biobanks are crucial for medical research,' 3a bevy of reports highlight how low biobank utilisation fuels unsustainable biobank models.4Despite grand plans to aggregate biospeci- mens into ever- larger centralised facilities, they havenot yet realised their potential. The reason for this is multifaceted and influenced by the following issues: parochialism in research, biohoarding of specimenswithout release to researchers 5, capacity issues, poor business models, separation of biospecimen from the patient record and disengagement of research from the healthcare environment. \"We envisage biobanks would benefit from blockchain technology. Blockchain as an incorruptible shared digital ledger allows for the distributed, secure, transparent and robust transactions by tracking the secure, ethical transfer of biospecimens to researchers.\" Centralised biobanking suers Speci- cally, biospecimen aggregation creates single points of failure within the system which require excessive pro- tections and constant vigilance to maintain security. Centralised storage of biospecimen without clear motivations for their successful use leads to legacy collections that have no purpose, leaving unusedHere, several experts from the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories provide a novel perspective around distributive biobanking models, including why biospecimens need blockchainBIOBANKING 187biospecimen-derived information, creating noise and raising the question of relevance. Finally, centralisation removes the biospecimens from their primary source, which is the patients themselves. This led to a loss of engagement of key stakeholders. The decision-makingprocess reverts to an independent 'authority' who determines access rights, requiring donors to have unconditional trust in biobank practices and motives. In summary, aggregation of biospecimens into central facilities cacoons the information they could provide into systems that are controlled by a limited few who may censor the message biospecimens hold and thus dictate the research narrative whilst restricting open discovery and exploration by many others. The decentralisation of biospecimens using blockchain Bold and innovative strategies are needed for biospec- imen derived informatics to impact digital health initiatives. Shifting aggregative biobanking to a model that manages biospecimens as an integral part of a digital health information flow will revolutionise how we learn from biospecimen-derived information.Distributed models rely on the presence of many inde-pendent participants that manage processes together through common standards performed in parallel. Fordistributed models to work, all components required for the system must be decentralised, including consent practices, ethics and governance oversight, patient engagement, biospecimen transfer logistics, datacation processes, quality management, research results dissemination and even clinical decisionmaking. 6Decentralised environments see processes distributed away from a central authoritative organi- sation or group, with decision making falling to a coop- erative of people having dierent perspectives, leading to greater objectivity. \"At its core, 'biospecimens' contain the information that doctors and researchers use to understand what type of disease a patient has and to determine possible treatment options that should be used for their clinical management.\" We envisage biobanks would benet from blockchaintechnology. Blockchain as an incorruptible shared digital ledger allows for the distributed, secure, transparent and robust transactions by tracking the secure, ethical transfer of biospecimens to researchers.

Use of smart contracts has been iden- tied as enabling the management for human subject regulation allowing Human Research Ethics Committees and governance bodies to comprehensively, transpar- ently, securely and automatically administer the require- ments for research integrity whilst avoiding repetitiveintervention between participants. 7Blockchain is now being used to personalise biospecimen collection and distribution allowing donors to determine how their specimens will be used in research (Figure 1). Blockchaintechnology enables ways of synchronising data betweenparticipants within a system that is not influenced by suspicion. If tissue-based science is an informatics problem, then biospecimens should be the rst block in the chain of information flow.

Catchpoole, (middle) Paul Kennedy, (right) Daniel Uribe Continued from page 187It is well known that biobanks represent crucial infrastructures for precision medicine. However, scientists, students and the public are not totally aware of this fact. This may be one reason why the sustainability of biobanks all over Europe is not self- evident and why funding of biobanks remains a matter of debate. Furthermore, the definition, under- standing and the mission of biobanking is highly complex and heterogeneous. Also, this heterogeneity is not well known. Even if there are several inte- grating societies bringing biobanking communities from the different fields together, a real interaction ofbiobankers and biobanking is manda- tory. Finally, scientists, students and the public are not aware of the innovative potential of biobanking with a view to cytotechnology, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Besides sustainable financing of a biobank infrastructure, the acceptance of biobanking in the public is another essential pillar for the success of a biobank, especially for a clinical biobank since their repository is dependent on the donation of specimens by the patients and their consent to use these specimens for experimental research. Furthermore, the exchangeof know-how is a crucial parameter toguarantee not only the continuouswork with state-of-the-art methods but also to follow recent developments in targeted therapy, as well as new trends in the analytics of prognostic or predictive factors respectively. The last pillar which is essential to ensure the sustainability of a biobank, is the dissemination of the strategy, the methods and the activities of a biobank. This last point is a manda- tory feature, on the one hand, to be attractive for and to get access to the potential participation in new experi-mental studies or trials initialised by third parties and, on the other hand, to ensure the long-term acceptance within patients in case of clinical biobank or within the population inthe event of a population-basedbiobank.BRoTHER (fig. 1) represents a Bavarian Czech biobank network funded by the Bavarian-Czech Research Agency with finance from the Bavarian State Min- istry of Finance, Development and Homeland to promote common biobank projects. This small biobank network consists of the biobank of the University of Regensburg (Germany), that of the Technical University Munich (Germany), that of the Faculty Hospital Pilsen (Czech Republic) and the Masaryk University, Brno (Czech Republic). A crucial focus in this net- work is given by dissemination and exchange of know-how. BRoTHER fol- lows a unique strategy to disseminate and promote the ideas and the activi- ties for innovative biobanking: With posters, presentations at relevantChristoph Brochhausen, Max Karl Friedrich Becker, Judita Ondrej Topolcan, explain here exactly how BRoTHER brings biobank know-how to scientists,students and the publicGetting together in the biobank scene: BRoTHER brings biobank know-how to scientists, students and the public 190PROFILE Fig. 1: The logo of BRoTHER represents the geographical location of the network partners combined with their corporate design colours.

With infor- mation materials in the languages of the involved partners, namely in German, English and Czech, weaddress the broader public. In thiscontext, this publication in Open Access Government is one way to dis- seminate our activities in biobanking. With that, we want to make BRoTHER known and attractive to the reader- ship from the European Parliament, the European Commission but also for European and national research agencies. Furthermore, the dissemination of biobank know-how to the wider public and our work on public relations is important for two reasons. The first is to stay attractive for potential bioma- terial donors and get or to keep the acceptance of the biobank within the public arena. Finally, dissemination of biobank know-how will also be an instrument to enlighten the public about the need for biobanking, its rolefor personalised medicine and in modern biomedical research. To address this issue, we use not only press releases and short information, articles in magazines, journals and other printed materials published regularly both in Bavaria and the Czech Republic, but also public events such as a benefits concert, a plenary discussion with the public and public readings, events which were joined by more than 1,000 people coming not directly from a clinical context. In addition to that, our Czech partners provided national press releases to inform people about the most impor- tant initiatives promoted and organ- ised as part of the project at the national level. Furthermore, coopera- tion with relevant associations, infras- tructures and other relevant partnerswill be initiated to disseminate the information on the project and to open the space for future collabora- tion. In this context, the project BRoTHER and the need for intercon-nected biobanks and biobank research were presented to the publicduring the official opening ceremony of the biobank at the Faculty Hospital, Pilsen at the beginning of 2017. The exchange of know-how is an important aim of BRoTHER which is realised on different levels: with Symposia and workshops, we address biobank staff and researchers. Our Symposia and workshops focus on new technology in biobanking such as cryobiology, IT, as well as AI and robotics (Fig. 2). They are organised twice a year, one with a Bavarian partner and one with a partner in the Czech Republic. The workshops areopen for students and scientists work- ing in the different aspects of biobanking. One important topic ofthe workshops is the practical work on different aspects of biobanking. The subjects of the workshops are: Biobanking data management; Techniques on Whole Slide Imaging; The effect of preanalytical for biobank specimen and; Ethical, legal and social aspects of biobanking (ELSI). 191Fig. 2: Detail of a fully automatic storage system for biobank specimens with a so-called cherry-picking strategy, which means that every single specimen will be stored and restored. The specimens are labelled with code at the bottom and will be registered via scanning. The advantage of this modern Cherry-picking system from the Smart Freezer\u00ae is that in case of re-storing only the needed specimen will be moved. All other specimens will stay under stable storing conditions.192PROFILE Symposia are held once to twice a year in Bavaria and the Czech Republic. The Symposia aims to bring the students and scientist of the partners together with leading researchers in the different fields of the projects. The most important topic of the Symposia is the presentation of the recent research topics and research trends within the field of biobanking, as well as the exchange of knowledge. The first Symposium was held in the cadre of the Opening Ceremony of the Pilsen Biobank in 2017. Furthermore, we have established a student exchange programme which facilitates students in medicine to obtain knowledge about biobankingsince this important topic is not yet represented in the most curricula. Within the exchange programme, weorganised a student summer school. In addition, the students learn more about the different methods in biobanking via hands-on training during site visits (fig. 3). A crucial issue within the BRoTHER Consortium is learning from each other by working together. With a view of the different levels of intercon- nection and cooperation, as well as with a view to the harmonisation of biobank work-flows and processing, the project partners compare work- flows, analyse the ratio behind it and evaluate if these are in accordance with national and international stan- dards in biobanking. In this context, our student exchange programme of graduate and post-graduate studentsrepresent an important element ofthis interconnected work. The stu- dents are properly integrated into the different aspects of the project work regarding harmonisation and digitali- sation. They rotate from one partner to another and will be actively integrated into the project work and in the infrastructure of the different biobanks at the partner sites. With that, the students will become familiar with work-flow, the analytical methods and the standard operating procedures at the different partners of BRoTHER. Thus, they will learn more about the project partners, as well as the recent developments in innovative biobank technology including IT, whole slide imaging and robotics. During the first three years of BRoTHER, two summer schools are organised, one in 2018 in Regensburg and the second one in 2019, in Pilsen. During the Summer School, we bring the students of the partner sites together and they present and discusstheir activities and results with each other and leading researchers in the field. The idea is that the summerschools will be held at each partner site so that the opportunity is given learning more about the partner insti- tutions and the cultural aspects of the partner cities. In conclusion, BRoTHER represents a unique network of biobanks in Bavaria and the Czech Republic, which is specialised in exchange of biobank know-how and dissemination of the biobank idea. We are developing specific strategies to bring the biobank idea near to the public and to interconnect innovative technologies with the biobanking idea. With that, BRoTHER could play a crucial role in connecting biobanks all over Europe and to communicate the relevance of biobanking for the healthcare system within Europe.

In that time, our industry has changed signicantly, from being product- based, to delivering value-based service solutions and increasingly incorporating new elds of science, utilising data, articial intelligence (AI), robotics and nanomaterials. We represent 300 member companies, and as their devices, diagnostics and digital technologies have become increasingly sophisticated, treatment for the likes of cancer and stroke is now quicker and more targeted, supporting improved survival rates and life expectancy. Yet with the well understood demographic shifts2 comes a rise in chronic conditions, often perpetuated by diet and lifestyle factors, with increased rates of dia-betes and obesity 3, which are now the primary drivers of strain on over-stretched healthcare systems4. We must now predict, identify, diagnose and treat patients in a holistic manner and as early as possible to prevent, manage or halt disease progression. There will always be a role for the hospital, but with the right use of technology, we can start to look at delivering care in alternative environments, such as the home or workplace. Through monitoring and predictive algo-rithms, we are positioned to manage our own health, with added focus on prevention and protection, thus, alleviating pressures on health systems. It's not all apps, robots and telemedicine, though. Thereare currently over 11,000 1Digital Health employees working in the UK; applying their trade to infrastructure projects, such as hospital and GP information systems.Programmes that will equip services, such as the UK's NHS, to deliver on what is arguably its prize asset:5its data. As the world's largest single health-payer system,the NHS has a rich data pool. Large datasets, utilised eectively, mean three things for care: it can be morepredictable, more personalised and more precise. \"The UK invests heavily in research, and rightly so, however, there is much less emphasis on implementation and adoption. ABHI are working to develop networks that promote communication and innovation with a strong direction towards implementation.\" This data pool gives us the opportunity to deliver against the four Vs of data6(Velocity, Volume, Veracity and Variety). However, this data pool cannot be constructed or utilised without the involvement and agreement of patients. Patient consent to data sharing must be thefoundation for any revolution in digital health. We must engage citizens to have an informed public debate on the benecial uses of health data. This is particularly the case when commercial entities form part of the datacycle. For this reason, ABHI is partnering with relevant organisations to ensure we support the debate oninformed patient opt-in. Research 7,8suggests that the public does not, in principle, want their health records being shared with commercial organisations and so appropriate regula- tion around data security is essential. People must trustthat their information is being used appropriately. This underpinning principle must be supported by a regula- tory framework that encompasses product, service and data regulation. Data protection legislation provides the framework for sharing of data and further guidance has been provided in the code of conduct for HealthTech 9from the Department of Health and SocialAndrew Davies, Digital Health Lead at ABHI provides an important update on the latest developments in the medical technology sectorMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 195Care. Cloud- based services can help overcome this by providing a route to share anonymised data with entities outside of the consented area. Blockchain/distributed ledgers also have great potential to support sharing of health data, both at an organisational level, but poten- tially in the future as a basis for personal control of data. And so, whilst GDPR has enshrined the basics of dataregulation into law, the sensitivity of health data and itssharing with industry may need further governance to build the trust and reassurance with the public. Given the complexity of the digital landscape, collabo- ration is crucial. Developers, researchers, clinicians, users and funders all have a role to play. However, a great idea will remain an idea, if it is not given the necessary support needed to scale through access tocapital and the right support to navigate and implement within health systems. \"There will always be a role for the hospital, but with the right use of technology, we can start to look at delivering care in alternative environments, such as the home or workplace.\" The UK invests heavily in research, and rightly so, how- ever, there is much less emphasis on implementation and adoption. ABHI are working to develop networks that promote communication and innovation with a strong direction towards implementation. There is a role for companies, regulators, patients and providers to come together and design a system of transparency and privacy, that works for everyone. Theprospect that digital technologies will make our health system more convenient, more coordinated, and more responsive to consumers' needs is enticing. The oppor- tunity for population health management with a focus on healthy living is even more exciting, with a focus on engaged citizens preventing chronic disease and self-managing conditions.

Compared to electronics, where it is the electron charge that carries information, these new materials bring the promise of faster (higher frequency operation) and more sustainable (lower power consumption) technologies in our daily life. Exotic spin configurations such as homochiral N\u00e9el walls[1]and skyrmions[2]have garnered intense interest recently as basic buildingblocks of next-generation magnetic- based memory, logic and sensors [3]. These structures are formed when the various driving forces in play find an equilibrium: exchange interaction favours alignment of neighbouringspins, anisotropy favours alignment along specific directions, demag - netization favours configurations that minimise stray fields and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) favours spins at right angles. The sign of the DMI determines whether the right-hand or the left-hand rule applies in choosing which perpendicular, hence the connection with chirality. In magnetic materials where the preferred direction of magnetization is orthogonal to the plane of the film and where DMI plays a role, the exchange and DMI energy terms favour Bloch and N\u00e9el walls, respectively, while minimisation of stray fieldsleads to flux-closed configurations akin to a toroidal solenoid. The com- petition between these energies leads to complex domain walls that cannot be described as fully Bloch or N\u00e9el[4] and plays an essential role in their dynamical response to applied fields and currents. Understanding this balance is crucial for the development of spintronic devices based on chiral domain walls. The first step in learning how to control spin structures is to visualise them, observe how they respond to external stimuli and assess the relative strength of the various energy terms. Several magnetic imaging techniques are available for this purpose. For example, X-ray resonant magneticscattering, nitrogen-vacancy magne- tometry and spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. However, most techniques are restricted to deduce the domain wall structure from surface states and due to spatial resolution limitations, often fail to measure precisely the wall width, which would provide access to the strength of the exchange energy. A technique called Lorentz transmis-sion electron microscopy (LTEM) is a classic tool to study magnetism[5]. It has been successfully applied to under-stand the local spin order in materials that host skyrmions [2]and other chiral spin structures. LTEM is based on the deflection that electrons experience as they traverse a magnetic sample asa result of the Lorentz force. Since beam electrons fly past a sample at near-light speed, these deflections are tiny. To have any chance of measuring an effect, we need to allow the deflected electrons to travel a large distance by moving the detector wellbelow the sample and take a picture of them only then. This is the concept of \"defocus\": the more out of focus we are, the more contrast we have in the image. However, as anyone who has taken a badly focused picture with a standard camera can confirm, a de - focused image is blurred to the point where the features we want to capture are no longer discernible. This is the conundrum of LTEM, we add defocus because without it we seenothing but the more defocus we add, the less clearly we see the features we are interested in. The results of a collaboration between Brookhaven National Laboratory, the University of Singapore and the Technical University of Denmark, recently published in Physical Review Letters[6], demonstrate how to over- come the intrinsic limitations of LTEM and quantify to high accuracy a critical parameter of spin structures forming in CoPd multilayers: the Bloch/N\u00e9el mixed-character angle defined as the thickness-averaged angle of the plane where spins rotate as they transition from the \"up\" to the \"down\" state. The key finding in this article is arecipe for data analysis that takes asAssociate Professor Marco Beleggia from the Technical University of Denmark, explains to us how to refocus spin structures with Lorentz transmission electron microscopyRefocusing spin structures with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy 196PROFILEinput a set of heavily blurred defocus images of a hybrid Bloch/N\u00e9el domain wall, where the wall appears enlarged and may appear under- or over-esti- mated and produces as output the \"true\" values of the domain wall width and the mixed-character angle. This new algorithm relies on image simu- lations carried out with the full Fresnel propagator in a wave-optical frame- work that includes interference anddiffraction effects. As a result, we are no longer forced to choose between images that are either blurry and contrasted (large defocus) or sharp but noisy (small defocus). We havelearned how to refocus spin structures with LTEM. References 1. M. Bode, M. Heide, K. Von Bergmann, P. Ferriani, S. Heinze, S. R. Wiesendanger. Nature 447, 190 (2007). 2. A. Tonomura, X.

It has attracted a great deal of interest because of its unique combination of qualities. MRI uses non-ionizing radiation, which is harm- less to human tissue, offers very high image quality with excellent anatomi- cal details and additionally is capable of providing not only functional but also metabolic information . On the negative side, it was conventionally argued that MRI suffers from low sensitivity compared to other imaging modalities. However, a new generation of nanotechnology-based contrast agents is making it possible to over- come this limitation and bring MRI into the molecular imaging category. In this context, fluorine (19F) MRI has lately garnered significant scientific interest in the biomedical research community, due to the unique prop- erties of fluorinated materials and the 19F nucleus. The stable fluorine isotope 19F naturally occurs to 100% and exhibits an intrinsic sensitivity for MRI close to that of the 1H nucleus, which is commonly used to produce detailed images of the inside of the body as has been addressed recently . There is negligible endogenous 19F in the body and, thus, no background signal which allows the detection offluorinated materials as 'hotspots' bycombined 1H/19F MRI and renders fluorine-containing molecules as ideal tracers for a wide variety of MRI appli- cations. Importantly, there is a family of compounds - perfluorocarbons - which exhibits a very high fluorine payload and is biochemically and physiologically inert (e.g. Teflon). However, perfluorocarbons are not mixible with water, therefore they have to be dispersed in water by use of an emulsifying agent leading to bio- logically applicable perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions Oxygent \u00ae) were alreadyused in patients as artificial blood substitutes. The recent application of those PFCs for molecular imaging takes advan- tage of the fact, that after intravenous administration an efficient and selec- tive uptake of PFCs by circulating cellsof the innate immune system, in par- ticular monocytes and macrophages, takes place. The subsequent migra-tion of the 19F-loaded, immunocompe- tent cells into inflammatory foci then permits the unambiguous in vivo identification of affected regions by combination of 1H and 19F MRI. This is illustrated in a murine model ofmyocardial infarction induced by occlusion of a coronary artery - a pro- cedure well known to be associatedTranscending morphology, magnetic resonance techniques can be utilised to shed light on processes on the molecular level to unveil pathological alterations preceding anatomical and functional manifestations of (cardiovascular) diseases, in the view of Ulrich Fl\u00f6gel from Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf, GermanyCardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy 198PROFILE Day 1 Day 2 Day 4 Infarction Surgical incision site1H19F1H + 19F1H Day 1 Day 2Surgical incision site Day 419F1H + 19F Infarctionwith an acute inflammatory response in the affected tissue. The upper row demonstrates the principle of the combined 1H/19F MRI approach: The end-diastolic 1H image (left) clearly shows the presence of ventricular dilatation and wall thin- ning within the infarcted area of the heart and in the corresponding 19F image (middle), the signal pattern matches the shape of the free left ventricular wall. For merging of the original grayscale images, a hot iron lookup table is applied to the fluorinedata, which allows convenient dis- crimination of the signals from the 1H and 19F nucleus. The resulting overlay (right) confirms the localisation ofPFCs within the anterior, lateral and posterior walls. Furthermore, 19F signal is also detected in the adjacent chest tissue, where thoracotomy for the surgical intervention was performed. Note that otherwise no background 19F signal from other tissue is present. Repetitive measurements from day one after ligation of the coronary artery reveal a time-dependent accu- mulation of PFCs within the infarcted region as shown in the lower row. The end-diastolic 1H images acquired one, two and four days after induction of myocardial infarction show the pro- gressive left ventricular dilatation as a consequence of the insult. Merging with the matching 19F images (red) demonstrates the successive infiltra- tion of PFCs into the affected area ofthe heart and the region of the chestinjured by surgery. Detected 19F signals are restricted to the area nearthe infarcted region of the heart; at no time infiltrating PFCs are observed within the unimpaired septum. \"...in the near future, this exciting emerging field of 19F MRI has the potential to revolutionise imaging-based cell tracking, imaging of disease and its subsequent therapy.\" This suggests that not only is it possi- ble to clearly detect specific areas of inflammation, but it is also feasible to assess the severity of inflammation damage. Thereby, the described approach offers a wide range of thera- peutic potential: a better understand- ing of the degree of inflammation in multiple disease conditions would hugely benefit individuals, providing an opportunity to offer timely patient-spe- cific therapy and the capability to monitor treatment regimes. Forging the way ahead, active targeting of PFCs - by decoration of the particle surface with ligands binding to specific epitopes - can be exploited to visualise other clinically relevant structures including blood clots and different cell types. By attaching distinct ligands for different targets to individual PFCs that each has its own specific MRI signature, this will allow the concurrent visualisation of several danger signals within one MR session. Here, the ultimate goal will be to advance the 19F probes for in vivo visu- alisation of biomolecular processes, which proceed alterations at the anatomical and organ level and to enable early patient-specific precision therapy. Finally, in terms of a theranostic approach, targeted PFCs could addi- tionally be doped with distinct drugs, which will enable, by directing those PFCs to a specific danger pattern, its concurrent treatment. Since ligands and targets can be easily adapted to a variety of problems, this approach provides a general and versatile platform for molecular imaging which strongly extends the frontiers of MRI. Thus, in the near future, this exciting emerging field of 19F MRI has the potential to revolutionise imaging- based cell tracking, imaging of disease and its subsequent therapy. Ulrich Fl\u00f6gel Professor of Experimental Cardiovascular Imaging Heinrich Heine +49 211 8110187floegel@uni-duesseldorf.de www.nmr.hhu.de risks in the workplace Nanomaterials can be grouped following the directives of the European Center for Ecotoxicol- ogy and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) Task Force on Nanomaterials. Such a comprehensive conceptfor the grouping and testing of nanomaterials was denominated as DF4nanoGrouping (Gupta et al., 2018).This assessment framework assigns nanomaterials to four main groups (MG) as follows: soluble nanomaterials (MG1), biopersistent high active nanoma- terials (MG4) (Liu et al., 2019). Concomitantly, in order to make this characterisation consistent, DF4nanoGrouping considers material properties as follows: intrinsic prop- erties in Tier 1, comprising water solubility, particle mor- phology and chemical composition; system-dependent properties in Tier 2, including dissolution in biological media, surface reactivity, particle dispersibility and invitro eects; testing properties, in Tier 3, comprehending non-animal testing conrmed or corrected using data from short-term in vivo studies (Bianchi et al., 2019). Exposure in the workplace Engineered nanoparticles can be exogenously ingested from hand-to-mouth contact at the workplace. Whereas larger particles of 5-30 m are usually placed in the nasopharyngeal region, smaller particles of 1-5 m are dropped in the tracheobronchial region. Once ingested or inhaled, particles may be further absorbed or removed by mucociliary clearance. If absorbed, nanopar-ticles can penetrate and travel into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Submicron particles of less than 1 m and nanoparticles of 100 nm can penetrate into the alveolarregion, from where they cannot be removed. Moreover, once in close contact with the alveolarepithelium soluble nanoparticles can penetrate other tissues and trigger particle-cell interactions, cross the blood-air-tissue barrier and enter the bloodstream,thereby potentially reaching other target organs. Onthe other hand, insoluble nanoparticles may prolong their residence in the lung leading to injury and immune responses, as well as serving as cleavage for tumour cells (Keller and Parker., 2019). Therefore, typical exposure to nanomaterials at the workplace isdeeply related to a broad spectrum of both acute and chronic eects, including inflammation, asthma, cystic brosis, lung diseases and cancer. Neurotoxicity represents another health risk. Inhaled nanoparticles inside the olfactory mucosa may translocate in the central nervous system (CNS). \"Nanomaterials present various severe health risks for people handling them. The effective and safe management of health hazards associated with the manipulation of engineered nanoparticles must consider the nanomaterial route from manufacturing and distribution to storage and final disposal. Europe is advancing toward the institution of effective policies that strive for a more cautious manipulation of engineered nanomaterials at the stages of manufacturing, use and recycling.\" Final disposal considerations The generation of nanomaterial waste is dicult to assess. Both eective dilution and proven deactivationare crucial for clean and safe nanomaterials disposal. The three pathways followed for nanomaterials waste disposal are: landll, thermal treatment and recycling, all of which are strictly dependent on the material type and the overall conditions of the nanomaterials waste. It is important to highlight that material recovery or recyclingmay involve some lateral risks, such as occupational health eects of recycling processes, the environmentalimpact associated with the nal disposal of the residues and the introduction of residual nanomaterials into recycled products (Resnik, 2019).Cecilia Van Cauwenberghe from Frost & Sullivan's TechVision Group assesses nanomaterials health risks in the workplace, starting with an overall perspective on the topic that includes risk assessment policiesMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY 201Final remarks Nanomaterials present various severe health risks for people handling them. The eective and safe manage- ment of health hazards associated with the manipula- tion of engineered nanoparticles must consider the nanomaterial route from manufacturing and distributionto storage and nal disposal.

Such desirable characteristics having numerous industrial applica- tions can include increased strength of the nano-enabled material, its chemical reactivity, or altered electrical properties. It is generally accepted that the recently developed and upcoming variety in nanomaterials will provide challenges for assessing their risks. Therefore, a variety of new risk assessment tools have been devel- oped. Acceptance and use of one or another risk assessment framework can have a wide range of economic and safety repercussions, therefore itis of considerable science policy interest. For example, in the European Union, nanosafety research has beensupported throughout the last 3 EU Framework Programmes. Whereas only five nanosafety projects were funded in the 6th Framework Programme, around 50 projects and initiatives on nanosafety were funded in the 7th Framework Programme, between 2007 and 2013. By 2018, 19 projects had been funded under H2020. In the USA, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is the leading federal agency conducting research and pro-viding guidance on the occupational safety and health implications and applications of nanotechnology. Inter-national regulatory science efforts are coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop- ment (OECD). On the other hand, it should be noted that partially because of this vigorous science policy interest, the number of publica- tions dealing with the toxicology of nanomaterials has increased tremen- dously, although most studies are not directly applicable in the industrial set- ting for risk assessment of Engineered Nanomaterials (ENMs). ENMs are used in a wide variety of consumer products: from cosmetics and paints to sportswear, mobile phones, computer chips, and batteries.Such materials represent bottom-upnanotechnology, where particles, fibres or surfaces are synthesized from molecules. In contrast, top-down nanotechnology can be exemplified by semiconductor processing, wherenano-scale features are patternedwith exceptional precision on macro- scopic objects. In the concrete case of the semiconductor industry, the chip- makers are using a growing variety of materials, as companies seek tofurther improve devices' performanceto meet increasing market demand in a constant process of innovation. At present, there are more than 200 chemical compounds consisting of elements, such as silicon, germanium, copper, gold, hafnium, indium and many others, which are present in most computer and mobile phonechips. In some manufacturing pro-cesses, ENMs enable superior yields and performance. Other examples include solar cell industry and energy storage, where a number of diverse materials based on rare elements are used. Every one of these applications requires unique expert insight into possible consumer, occupational or environmental hazards. \"...it is important to identify appropriate sources of information and communication channels for all actors along the supply chain, including the general public.\" The NanoStreeM consortium has taken up the challenge in defining a road map of occupational safety of nanomaterials in nanoelectronicswhere we have identified the existing gaps in our knowledge and formu- lated a number of recommendationsfor their mitigation. Definite needs for competencies development were established in terms of informing about the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials, a dedicated nanotoxicology knowledge base, and about the limitations of the traditional occupational chemical risk assess- ment. To meet these needs, the pro- ject composed nanosafety training packages, as one of its major out- comes. The project partners Tyndall , The French Alternative Energies andAtomic Energy Commission ( CEA), and Imeccomposed three dedicated training courses focusing on semicon-ductor industry processes and theHere, Dr Dimiter Prodanov discusses the results and perspectives of NanoStreeM, a consortium which examines occupational safety of nanomaterialsThe NanoStreeM Project: Results and Perspectives 202PROFILEcleanroom environment. Developed training packages will be used by the semiconductor industry and the partnering institutions after the end of the project. Assessment of the risks, related to nanotechnology innovation, requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach due to the complexity of the interactions on the nanoscale. On the other hand, the safety of nanomateri- als and nanotechnology cannot be considered on a case-by-case basis. A systematic framework for risk gover- nance should be centred on generic principles, such as Safe by Design.Conversely, concrete implementationsof such principles can be sector-spe- cific. In the engineering context, Safe by Design can be implemented in the integration of hazard identification and risk assessment methods early in the design process to eliminate or minimise the risks of harm throughout the construction and life of the prod- uct being designed. Safe by Design includes three components: safedesign, safe production, and safe use. In the context of the semiconductorindustry \"safe design\" translates to development of processes, where the used nanoparticles have known haz- ards. \"Safe production\" entails a reduc- tion of process hazards at identified hotspots of risk. \"Safe use\" ought to consider issues, related to recycling and end-of-life. Such knowledge then may be used to inform design choices. The NanoStreeM project demonstrated that the nanoparticle emissions in normal operation mode of cleanroom processing tools are not likely to occur.Therefore, future studies in the semi- conductor industry should focus on the assessment of the environmental impact, product end-of-life, and recov- ery of valuable elements through recy- cling. Finally, the NanoStreeM project has identified some key challenges and data gaps, which the industry is facing. On the first place, it is the lack of reli- able data on nanoform toxicity. Persis- tence of such gap inadvertently leads to uncertainty in regulations. Therefore, it is necessary to identify how much uncertainty is acceptable in terms of cost and impact. Secondly, risk assess- ment methods for nanomaterials arefar from mature, which makes their application very difficult in an industrial setting. Therefore, innovation guided by the Safe By Design principle must be aided by ongoing and future regulatory research. Finally, it is important to iden-tify appropriate sources of information and communication channels for all actors along the supply chain, including the general public.

Dr consortium meeting at ST-Crolles, Crolles, 9 Oct 2018PROFILERESEARCH & INNOVATION 204Finland's priorities in science policy In a socially, economically and ecologically sustainable society, the economy is managed for the people, not the other way round. Sustainable economic growth is built on a high rate of employment and strong publicnances and the Finnish government rates education and research very highly. Education and culture are animportant part of our Finnish and European value systems and are important and necessary means of guaranteeing individual freedoms. In the future, our citizens' wellbeing will continue to draw on knowledge and skills and work and entrepreneurship.Our challenge and goal in Finland is to keep our level of education and competence at an excellent level andeven back to the top of the world league. We want to create the best possible conditions for the best working life in the world. We want to be a nation with happy and competent professionals where every person's knowledge and skills are put to good use. Our stated goal is that by 2030, the Finnish public and private sectors together will invest 4% of the GDP in research and innovation activities in an eective and protable manner. These investments will improve, for their part, the wellbeing of the population and society. Working together for this, both in Finland and abroad, is our duty and a strength. Higher education in Finland is provided by the universities and the universities of applied sciences. Both sectors have their own proles. Universities emphasise scientic research and instruction, whereas universities of applied sciences adopt a more practical approach. However, all higher education institutions areautonomous in organising their instruction and academic year. Entry to higher education is based on student selection with a healthy competition of many applicants. Higher education institutions use variousstudent selection criteria. Most commonly these includesuccess in matriculation examination and entrance tests. Equal access to higher education is ensured by a wide institutional network, free education, student nancial aid, as well as through flexible pathways to higher education. Eorts have also been made to lower the threshold to apply to higher education by developing an on-line joint application system. \"It is now a global trend to use digital and open approach methods to generate high-standard research faster and more effectively. The objective of science policy is to raise the international standard as well as the knowledge and competence base of Finnish science and to increase the innovation capacity in the national economy, to bolster the research infrastructure and safeguard the openness of research and science.\" Institutions of higher education aim to improve thequality of education by revamping education content, teaching methods, learning environments and the competence of teachers, as well as to increasecooperation. The institutions need to make full use of the possibilities oered by digitalisation. They develop their student admissions, procedures for the recognition of prior learning and degree programmes in order to step up national and international mobility. The objective of Finland's higher education policy is to develop higher education institutions as an internationally competitive entity where each institution also flexibly responds to regional needs. The activitiesof universities and universities of applied sciences promote Finnish competitiveness, well-being, education and learning as well as sustainable development.Cooperation and transparency are the key drivers for research and innovation. We need more coherent RDIHanna Kosonen, Minister of Science and Culture, Finland, details Finland's priorities in science policyRESEARCH & INNOVATION 205policies and further support for the building of internationally attractive knowledge clusters and innovation systems which, in turn, will help us achieve our ambitious 4% goal. Using shared approaches and legislative means to strengthen open research and innovation will be crucial in the near future. Science policy helps channel competence into forms such as information, knowledge, processes, products and services. Science policy is also inherently linked to innovation policy and it supports knowledge production. It also enhances the competence level of citizens and the nation in collaboration with dierent stakeholders to make research carried out in Finland more visible, international and eective. The purpose of science policy is to ensure that the organisations that carry out research can engage in research in a way and to a standard that is typical of highly competitive international science communities. Science policy also helps make researched information easily available for widespread use in society. It is now a global trend to use digital and open approach methods to generate high-standard research faster and more eectively. The objective of science policy is to raise the international standard as well asthe knowledge and competence base of Finnish science and to increase the innovation capacity in the nationaleconomy, to bolster the research infrastructure and safeguard the openness of research and science. The openness of science and widespread use of information in society are important aspects as scienceand research have an important role also in Finland insolving the world's wicked problems from climate change to other threats to planetary and human well-being that all need urgent solutions. Hanna Kosonen Minister of Science and Culture, Finland The Ministry of Education and Culture Finnish Government Tel: + FinlandExperimental research of sub- atomic physics involves notori- ously many aspects of physics, technology, industry, and also finances and management. Organising top national research and always scarce economic resources to produce world class results from work with leading global research laboratories, such as CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Geneva, Switzer- land with more than 13000 global users, is a major undertaking. In Fin- land this work is done by Helsinki Insti- tute of Physics (HIP), which successfully coordinates research with CERN and contributions to FAIR, the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, currently constructed in Darmstadt, Germany. HIP - national priorities and agile execution HIP is a national institute and organi- sation operated by five major Finnish universities in geographically separate cities: Helsinki, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Espoo, Tam- pere and Lappeenranta. In addition, the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK, Helsinki) is an interim member since 2018. The extensive expertise related to accelerator research from all involved institutes is fully utilised in the closecollaboration with leading interna-tional accelerator centres CERN and FAIR. HIP currently covers a continuum of research topics from theoreticalphysics, analyses of accelerator experiments, experimental setups andinstrumentation, as well as technology development all the way to the com- mercialisation of products in collabo- ration with technology industries. All research in HIP since its foundation in 1996 is organised in fixed term projects which ensures renewal of research. Projects are counterbalanced by CERN experiments that requirelonger term commitment. Current research activities of HIP are organed in four programmes, which in turn consist of several 3-year projects. Decisions of programmes and projects are done by HIP Board representing member universities and personnel. Board decides also use of funding forthe programmes. Scientific expertise for these decisions comes from aninfluential Scientific Advisory Board, which annually evaluates the perfor-mance of the Institute in a two-day visit and gives recommendations on how to proceed. HIP research programmes - from theory to experiments to technology Currently the main research focus of HIP is on three of the CERN LHC experiments: ALICE, CMS and TOTEM, where Finnish scientists contribute significantly to ultra-relativistic heavy ion physics, new physics searches, standard model measurements and forward physics. The full physics exploitation of these, including the preparation of their high luminosityphase, constitute the highest priorityHere, Professor Katri Huitu discusses the Helsinki Institute of Physics' role in Finnish research of subatomic physicsFinland: Research on subatomic physics 206PROFILE of the Finnish high-energy physics community. Computing and data access are an integral part of this physics exploitation. HIP participates in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid through the Nordic and the HIP centers. Participation in instrumentation is a prerequisite in experimental particle physics for accessing scientific data and for producing new physics. HIP Detector Laboratory for high-qualityinstrumentation is an essential infras- tructure for successful participation in high energy physics experiments. HIP is also involved in other CERN experi- mental activities, such as ISOLDE, which provides radioactive ion-beams, and CLOUD setup, where climate change can be studied in a control- lable laboratory environment. HIP is also actively contributing to two conceptually different designs of the next generation CERN particle collid- ers, compact linear electron-positron collider (CLIC) and future circular collider (FCC). Since 2010 HIP has participated in con- struction of FAIR, the first priority inter- national facility in the nuclear physics community research in Europe. FAIR will provide unique experimental opportunities with antiproton and relativistic heavy-ion beams as well as secondary radioactive ion beams for a broad range of studies in atomic and plasma physics, hadron and nuclear physics and in astrophysics. At the moment Finnish priority is the FAIR NUSTAR experiment. HIP group is involved in the FAIR phase-0 experi- ments that will start soon and the FAIR facility should be in full use for physics by 2026. Researchers of the successful HIP theory programme work e.g. on extensions of the Standard Model(SM) of particle physics. The SM is among the most precise theories of physics but eventually needs to be extended - the fact that galaxies do not disintegrate requires that so-called Dark Matter increases their gravita- tional pull. Dark Matter is not part of the Standard Model. HIP theorists scrutinise the SM in various ways and suggest ways to test it. In addition to accelerators, tests include satellite missions, dark matter experiments, and gravitational wave experiments such as European Space Agency's (ESA) future gravitational wave satel- lite mission LISA. The quality of thetheory programme is demonstrated by the fact that currently two of the five theory project leaders have an ERC grant. The accelerated expansion of the Universe also requires beyond the SM explanations. HIP personnel partici- pate in ESA's Euclid satellite mission, which will be one of the most impor- tant cosmology missions for the next decade. Further synergies with ESA are sought in relation to the harsh radiation environments operations. Technological aspects of radiation safety are developed in close collabo- ration with STUK. HIP also collabo- rates closely with Business Finland, the Finnish agency for supporting and funding innovations, with focus on CERN-related new business ideas. Technology related activities seek active partnerships from industry and improve connections of Finnishcompanies to CERN and FAIR. Tightly connected to the HIP CMS group, HIP's Open Data and Education is a showcase project for Open Science,where huge amounts of data from CERN is made available for wider use in the scientific community and for school education. The HIP project is in a pivotal role and has given courses forseveral years to high school teachers on use of open data in education. The project also organises High School visits to CERN: since 2000 almost 5400 students from close to 400 schools have visited CERN. HIP Detector Labo- ratory also provides hands-on educa- tion on instrumentation. These kind of outreach activities are an integral part of HIP . Boosting HIP community spirit The geographically and scientifically extended research programme of HIP has a risk to lose focus of research and the activities become scattered. In order not to overlook common goals, meetings of the whole HIP community are indispensable. A focal point of internal communication in near future is on communications via various information channels, personnel activ- ities in wellbeing groups of member institutions, and organisation of meet- ings for the whole community. Enthusiastic personnel doing world class research will keep Finland's con- tribution to accelerator related physics strong in the future! Professor Katri Huitu Director Helsinki Institute 2 941 50520katri.huitu@helsinki.fi www.twitter.com/HIPhysics https://www.hip.fi/ 207PROFILEWe begin with the discussion of the ground state negative ion formation in low-energy electron collisions with complex heavysystems, such as the lanthanide and actinide atoms, as well as the fullerene molecules. The knowledge gained is essential for the determination of unambiguous and reliable electron affinities (EAs) for these systems. Gen- erally, the low-energy electron elastic scattering total cross sections (TCSs) for complex heavy systems are charac- terised by Ramsauer-Townsend (R-T) minima, shape resonances and dra-matically sharp resonances represent- ing ground, metastable and excited negative ion formation. The energyposition of the sharp resonance appearing at the second R-T minimum of the ground state TCS represents the anionic binding energy (BE) of theformed ground state negative ion during the collision. This BE has been identified with the theoretically chal- lenging to calculate electron affinity of the considered complex heavy system.Indeed, the delineation and identifica- tion of the resonance structures in the TCSs are essential for the correct inter- pretation of the calculated results and the determination of unambiguous and reliable EAs of the complex heavy systems.II.1 Overview For most of the lanthanide atoms, producing sufficient anions with known anionic BEs that can be used in photodetachment experiments is very challenging; for the actinide atoms, the situation is even worse. Due to their radioactive nature, they are diffi- cult to handle experimentally. Theoret- ically, the large number of electrons involved and the presence of open d- and f-subshell electrons in both the lanthanide and actinide atoms, results in many intricate and diverse electron configurations. These lead to the computational complexity of the elec- tronic structure calculation, making itvery difficult to obtain unambiguous and reliable EAs for these systems using structure-based theoretical methods. These are notorious for their slow convergence. Indeed, many existing experimental measurements and sophisticated theoretical calcula-tions have considered the anionic BEs of the stable metastable and/orexcited negative ion formation to cor-respond to the EAs of the considered lanthanide and actinide atoms. This is contrary to the usual meaning of the EAs found in the standard measure- ment of the EAs of such complex systems as atomic Au, Pt and most recently At as well as of the fullerenemolecules, from C 20through C92. In these systems, the EAs correspond to the ground state BEs of the formed negative ions. In the electron interac- tions with fullerene and fullerene-like systems, simple model potentials are widely used to describe the C60and other fullerene shells. At the heart of these model potentials are the two experimentally determined parame- ters, namely the fullerene radius and its EA. The lack of the appropriateparameters for other fullerenemolecules is the main reason for the struggle by existing theoretical calcu- lations to go beyond the theoreticallysimple C 60fullerene molecule. Accurate and reliable atomic and molecular affinities are essential for understanding chemical reactions involving negative ions. And the EA provides a stringent test of theoretical calculations when their results are compared with those from reliable measurements. For the lanthanide atoms, the measured and/or calcu- lated EAs are riddled with uncertainty and full of ambiguity as well. To our knowledge, there are no EA measure- ments available for the actinide atoms. However, the recent experimental determination with high precision of the BE of the least-bound electron inDr Alfred Msezane from the Department of Physics, Clark Atlanta University, explains ground state negative ion formation in complex heavy systems, including comment on electron affinity determination 208PROFILE Ground state negative ion formation in complex heavy systems: Electron affinity determinationatomic No promises measurements of the EA as well. And this presentation will guide the future measurement of the EAs of the actinide atoms through the determination of their ground state negative ion BEs. Then sophisti-cated theoretical methods such as the Dirac R-matrix, MCHF and RCI can use the BEs of the formed negative ions during the collisions to generate target wave functions and for fine-structure determination. Recently, our robust Regge-pole methodology achieved a theoretical breakthrough through the identifica- tion of the crucial electron-electron correlation effects and the vital core- polarization interaction as the major physical effects mostly responsible fornegative ion formation in low-energy electron scattering from complex heavy systems. The novelty and generality of the Regge-pole approachis in the extraction of the anionic BEsfrom the calculated TCSs of the com- plex heavy systems; for ground state collisions these BEs yield the unam-biguous and reliable theoretically challenging to calculate measured EAs. Very recently, the ground state anionic BEs extracted from our Regge-pole calculated electron elastic TCSs for the fullerene molecules C 20 through C92have been found to match excellently the measured EAs1,2. Also, the agreement between our Regge- pole calculated ground-state anionic BEs and the measured EAs of Au3and Pt3as well as of C604is outstanding. The Regge-pole method requires no assistance whatsoever from either experiment or other theory for the remarkable feat. II.2 Lanthanide Atoms The lanthanide and the Hf atoms provide clear cases of the ambiguous and confusing measured and/or calculated EA values.5As examples, for the Eu atom two measurements determined different EA values for its EA, viz. 0.116eV and 1.05eV. These agree excellently with the Regge-pole calculated BEs for the highest anionic excited and the metastable states,respectively; the ground state anionicBE for Eu has been determined recently to be 2.63eV 5. This BE value should be considered as the EA of the Eu atom. Other examples where the measurements of the EAs correspond to the BEs of the metastable and/orexcited states include the lanthanide atoms Tb, Tm, Gd and Yb as well Hf atoms. 5For Hf the Rel- ativistic (RCI) calculated EA agrees excellently with the Regge-pole calculated BE of an excited state and not with that of the ground state. These results demon-strate the importance of obtaining the ground, metastable and excited ionic states BEs. It is noted here that the determination of the ground statenegative ion BE of complex heavy systems is a great challenge for the structure-type calculations. II.3 Actinide Atoms In6the low-energy electron scattering from the actinide atoms Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu was investigated through the elastic TCSs calculations. The objective 209 PROFILE210PROFILE was to delineate and identify the char- acteristic resonance structures as well as to understand and assess the reli- ability of the existing theoretical EAs. Particularly interesting in the study6is the finding for the first time that the TCSs for atomic Pu exhibited fullerene molecular behaviour1near- threshold through the TCS of the highest excited state, while maintaining the atomic character through the ground state TCS. Very recently, the low-energy electron scattering TCSs for Cm to Lr actinide atoms were explored. We discovered new manifestations in the TCSs of Cm to Lr actinide atoms; namely, atomic and fullerene molecu- lar behaviour near threshold. We have attributed these peculiar tunable behaviours in the TCSs to size effects impacting significantly the polarization interaction. This provides a novel mechanism of tuning a shape reso- nance and R-T minimum through the polarization interaction via thesize effect. The comparison between the Regge-pole calculated ground, metastable and excited states anionic BEs with the existing theoretical EAs demonstrates that the existing calcu- lations tend to obtain metastable and/or excited states BEs and equate them incorrectly with the EAs. Indeed, this leads to an ambiguous and unreliable determination of the EAs of complex heavy systems; they are already populating the literature. 7For an unambiguous and a definitive meaning of the EA, we recommend using the ground state anionic BE as the EA of complex heavy systems, consistent with the use in the deter- mination of the EAs of such atoms as Au and Pt as well as of the fullerene molecules.1,2II.4 Fullerene Molecules For fullerene molecules, excellent measured EAs are available in the literature from C20through C92. Bench- marked on the measured EAs of C604, the Regge-pole methodology was used to calculate the ground state anionic BEs of the fullerene molecules negative ions from C20through C240. Our calculated ground state anionic BEs agreed excellently with the avail- able measured EA values of C20 through C92. Indeed, these results provided great credence to the ability of the Regge-pole methodology to extract from the calculated TCSs reli- able EAs for the fullerene molecules for the first time. The obtained agree-ment represented an unprecedentedaccomplishment by the Regge-pole methodology in electron-cluster/ fullerene collisions. For the fullerene molecules, other theories are still struggling to go beyond the theoreti- cally simple C 20and C60fullerene molecules. It is noted here that the fullerene TCSs are very rich in metastable and excited anionic reso-nances, revealed for the first time in 1,2. Thus, careful delineation and identifi- cation of the various resonances in the TCSs, particularly for the anionic ground states are essential for reliable calculation of their EAs. These fullerene negative ions could be useful in catalysis. Indeed, many existing experimentalmeasurements and sophisticated the- oretical calculations have considered the anionic BEs of the stable metastable and/or excited negative ion formation to correspond to the EAs of the considered lanthanide andactinide atoms 7. This is contrary to theusual meaning of the EAs found in the standard measurement of the EAs of such complex systems as atomic Au, Pt and At as well as of the fullerene molecules. In these systems, the EAs correspond to the ground state BEs of the formed negative ions. For fullerenes, existing theories continue to struggle to obtain reliable EAs. References 1 A. Z.

It provides a formal language to write mathematical defi- nitions, executable algorithms and theorems together with an environ- ment for semi-interactive develop- ment of machine-checked proofs. Every year, software bugs cost hun- dreds of millions of euros to compa- nies and administrations, as assessed by Intel Pentium division bug or Ariane 5 first flight failure. Hence, soft- ware quality is a notion that becomes more and more prevalent, going beyond the usual scope of embeddedsystems. In particular, the develop- ment of tools to construct software that respect a given specification is a major challenge of current and future researches in computer science. Inter- active theorem provers based on type theory, such as Coq , equipped with an extraction mechanism that produces a certified program from a proof, are currently gaining traction towards this direction. Indeed, they have shown theirefficiency in proving the correctness of important pieces of software like the C compiler of the CompCert project . Onemajor area of interest when using such theorem provers from a computer sci- ence perspective is the ability to extract the code that has been proven directly from the proof -being able to run it as any other pieces of code. \"Every year, software bugs cost hundreds of millions of euros to companies and administrations, as assessed by Intel Pentium division bug or Ariane 5 first flight failure.\" Unfortunately, the democratisation of such interactive theorem provers suf- fers from a major drawback, that is the mismatch between the concep- tion of equality in mathematics and equality in type theory. Indeed, some basic principles that are used implic- itly in mathematics - such as Church principle of proposition extensionality, which says that two formulas are equal when they are logically equiva- lent - are not derivable in (Martin-L\u00f6f) Type Theory. More problematically from a computer science point of view, the basic concept of two func- tions being equal when they are equal at every \"point\" of their domain is alsonot derivable and needs to be set as an axiom (see below).Of course, those principles are consis- tent with Type Theory and adding them as axioms is safe. But any devel- opment using them in a definition will produce a piece of code that does not compute, being stuck at points whereaxioms have been used becauseaxioms are computational black boxes. To understand this mismatch, we need to take a deeper look at the notion of equality in type theory. The only way to prove that two terms t and u are equal is by reflexivity, which means that the two terms must be convertible - in the sense that they have the same normal form. To some extent, this notion of equality is emi- nently syntactic. The reason why this notion of equality is used in type theory is that it comes with a niceelimination principle which allows substituting a term by an equal term anywhere in a type. This is Leibniz's principle of the indiscernibility of iden- ticals. To the opposite, the notion of equality in mathematics is eminently semantics, with a definition that is relative to the type of terms being con- sidered. This is why the functional extensionality principle is easy to set in this setting because the definition of equality is specialised accordinglyDr Nicolas Tabareau from IMT Atlantique Bretagne-Pays de la Loire, details equality in proof assistants based on type theory, which falls under the umbrella of computer science and mathematics 214PROFILE Computer science and mathematics: Equality in proof assistants based on type theory ! Axiom fun ext :AB {fg :AB},(x,fx=gx)f=g.when it comes to function types. The problem with that point of view is that it does not come with ageneric substitution principle and, thus, is difficult to use it in a programming language. This mismatch prevents proof developments from using more advanced semantical tools in their reasoning because of the explicit manipulation of mathematical equality together with axioms. The birth of homotopy type theory To correct the fundamental mismatchbetween equality in mathematics and type theory, Martin Hofmann and Thomas Streicher have introduced a new point of view on type theory, where types are not viewed as simplesets but as sets enriched with a homo- topical structure. This way, each type comes with a specialised notion of equality and the homotopical struc- ture describes how to substitute a term by another equivalent one in a type. Field medalist Vladimir Voevod- sky recognised later that this simpli- cial interpretation of type theory satisfies a further crucial property, dubbed univalence, which had not previously been considered in type theory. The univalence principle coarsely says that two types (or struc-tures) are equal if and only if they areequivalent (or isomorphic). The univa- lence principle subsumes the other missing principles of equality and is the key to equip type theory with a notion of equality that is compatible with traditional mathematical reason- ings - it is at the heart of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). The first outcomes of HoTT This new point of view on type theory has now visible consequences in proof assistants such as Coq or Agda. For instance, to give a computational meaning to the univalence axiom, the cubical type theory has been devel- oped by Thierry Coquand and his col- leagues and implemented recently in Cubical Agda . In another line of work, a new universe sProp of definitionally proof irrelevant propositions has been implemented both in Coq and in Agda . The development of this notion of proof irrelevance - which guaran- tees that any two proofs of same proposition A are equal, no matter what they are - would not have been possible without the new insight provided by HoTT. Other outcomes ofHoTT will likely be integrated into proof assistants during the coming years. \"One major area of interest when using such theorem provers from a computer science perspective is the ability to extract the code that has been proven directly from the proof - being able to run it as any other pieces of code.\" Dr Nicolas Tabareau IMT Atlantique Bretagne-Pays /turnstileleftx/y.alt:A RESEARCH & University research funding in the UK Chris Skidmore MP is Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation at the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. He is currently the MP for Kingswood, South Gloucestershire and is the current Vice-Chairman of the Conservative party for policy in 2018. He announced that University research was set to receive a major boost in funding. Research funding isset to receive \u00a32.2 billion between 2019-2020, which is an increase of \u00a391 million from 2018-2019. This is in the hope that more academic ideas and proposals can be translated to reality. This funding boost also includes an additional \u00a345 million for quality-related (QR)research funding, which is a 2.3% increase from last year. This increase includes contributions to theNational Productivity Investment Fund (NPIF) thatsupports universities to implement the government's Industrial Strategy. This is a record high and Skidmore has commented, \"I am delighted that for the rst time since 2010, we have a signicant uplift in QR funding for universities. One of my personal priorities has been to place universities at the heart of innovation for the future and I'm pleased to have worked to deliver on this.\" 1 As well as this, Skidmore announced that postgraduate support for EU nationals has been extended another year. This is a guarantee for those starting postgraduatestudies in the UK in 2020, and is yet another policy that shows Skidmore's ambitions in expanding research and development. He states: \"Increased investment in research and development is a key ambition of thegovernment which has committed to 2.4% GDP spenton R&D by 2027 - a vital part of our industrial strategy. The government has already committed to investing an additional \u00a37 billion on R&D by 2021, the largest increase for 40 years.\" 2 \"This new competition will not only help thousands of young people seize these opportunities but also become the next generation of digital entrepreneurs to stay at the global cutting edge of innovation - a key part of our modern Industrial Strategy.\" Skidmore's reasoning to extending funding for international students is his belief in their contributions to UK universities and hopes that an extension of funding will be an incentive for them to come to the UK to conduct their studies. \"International students make an important contribution to our world-leadinguniversities. This is all about people - giving prospective students the reassurances they need to choose the UK for the next step in their academic career.\" This idea of continued collaboration between the UK and international students is part of Chris Skidmore's widerIndustrial Strategy. One of the cornerstones of this strategy is that innovation, science and research know no borders. As part of this strategy young entrepreneurs are being challenged to create apps and technologies that could help brighten the future. This is to be supported by \u00a31 million of government investment specically targeted at those between the ages of 11-16.

This overarching scientific question passes through the analysis of properties of atomic nuclei, which since the late 1930s have been tirelessly studied in increas- ingly sophisticated experiments. The database of precisely measured masses, radii, electric and magnetic moments, excitation energies, transi- tion rates, decay lifetimes and many other observables are now enormous. The overall understanding of this data, developed in parallel with the experiment, is good. However, is it good enough to declare victory? In fact, when it comes to details, system-atics or extrapolations to uncharted territories, the precision of the quan- titative description of nuclei is still faraway from perfect. Nuclear theory still has plenty of challenging questions to answer. In particular, only now can we begin to build approaches that have controlled uncertainties and can be systematically improved. Why is this so difficult? The fundamental theory of atomic nuclei is the Quantum Chromody- namics (QCD), which says that nuclei are built of two quarks, up quark and down quark, which interact by exchanging The QCD equa- tions of motion are deceivingly simpleto write down and exceedingly difficult to solve. We witness fantastic progress in this direction, mostly owing to the development of advanced algorithms and the employment of the biggest available computers. However, the prospects of deriving properties ofheavy nuclei from such a fundamental approach are still beyond the horizon. The reasons for this are twofold. First, the lower the energy the more difficult QCD equations become to solve. Second, at low energies, those that characterise atomic nuclei, quarks and gluons cluster into composite particles: protons and neutrons. Therefore, although fundamentally the atomic nuclei are built of quarks and gluons, at low energies they look like they were built of protons and neutrons. Nuclear Density Functional Theory (NDFT) The NDFT makes one further step; namely, it assumes that at energies where we do not clearly distinguish individual protons and neutrons, we can limit the theoretical description to using their densities only. This simplifi- cation allows us to describe all nuclei very efficiently. Indeed, in its simplest possible version, the NDFT operates with two densities, the proton density and neutron density, instead of hundreds of individual protons andneutrons. In practice, realistic imple- mentations of NDFT must take into account several other densities, forinstance, their derivatives up to a cer- tain order. Moreover, for many observ- ables, we still must recall that individual protons and neutrons are visible. How- ever, altogether we have at our disposal a consistent and manageable theory that properly describes complicated composite systems like atomic nuclei. What do we really do? Our long-term goal is to build novel sophisticated and precise NDFT that would be systematically improvable and would quantitatively describe low-energy nuclear properties with well-defined controlled uncertainties. To illustrate our present-day activitylet me give you two specific examples. The first one pertains to applications of nuclear theory and to how it can contribute to societal and technologi- cal developments. It relates to the properties of one very peculiar iso- tope of thorium, 229Th, which has the first excited state at an unusually low energy level of 8.24 eV [1]. This energy is so low that the state can be manip- ulated with ultraviolet light. Typically, nuclear excitation energies are thou-sand or million times larger, so the excitation of a nucleus by ultraviolet light can be compared to steering a jumbo jet with a hairdryer. UsingThe Nuclear Theory Group at the University of York, United Kingdom, develops novel theoretical methods for a precise description of ground and exited nuclear states, more of which is explained here by Jacek Dobaczewski, Chair in Theoretical Nuclear PhysicsPhysics: Nuclear Density Functional Theory for determining the properties of atomic nuclei 218PROFILE229Th, it may be possible to build a laser-induced nuclear clock of unprecedented precision, which canrevolutionise applications like anultra-precise Global Positioning System (GPS). The NDFT will never be precise enough to describe such lowexcitation energy; nevertheless, it is perfectly applicable to determining electromagnetic transition probabili-ties, which will be essential for future laser applications. The second example is our study of 225Ra [2]. This nucleus is the best candidate to measure hypothetical electric dipole moment (EDM) of the radium atom. Its unusual ground- state shape of a pear (see figure), favours detection of the parity-violat- ing sector of strong interactions, which we were able to evaluate using our NEDF technology. If such non-zero EDM is ever measured, our calcula- tions allows linking the experimental results to properties of parity-violating interactions and further, to a puzzling feature of our universe being built of the ordinary matter and not of the antimatter.What does the future hold? The nuclear physics studies that employ NDFT belong to the class of basic research that is curiosity-driven. It is the curiosity of what is around the corner that makes us tick. The history of science teaches us that basic research always leads to technological advances and improvements in human life. We do not know which part of it will, but it will undoubtedly. Teaching and training through basic research is the best way to form theminds of young people who then can do amazing things. The NEDF studies of atomic nuclei are an active area of basic research, giving us a possibility of extrapolating nuclear properties from stable to exotic systems and from terrestrial to stellar environments. Finally, doing the NEDF research through one's entire life is absolute bliss and fun. Chair in Theoretical Nuclear Physics at the University of York, Professor Jacek Dobaczewski. References [1] Phys.

The ERA enables free circulation of researchers, scientic knowledge and technology. It also enhances the competitiveness of Europe and allows for the development of solutions to the global challenges that face us. Despite a common view of the goal and benets of the ERA, the question of how to implement it has unfortunately been the subject of a longstanding debate. To bring together several of the key stakeholders in developing the ERA, Science Europe organises an annual High-Level Workshop on the topic. Currently inits 11th year, this event oers a much-needed platform for science policy debates between decision-makers from Science Europe Member Organisations, nationalministries for research and innovation and the European Commission. Science Europe sees this kind of engagement with key partners as one of its direct contributions to the strengthening of the ERA. However, wider commitment and engagement is needed tocollectively build the ERA. \"To help build a stronger and more effective ERA and shape the future of research, Science Europe advocates a better integration of the scientific community in policymaking.\" For future success, Science Europe calls for theuncompromising promotion of scientic excellence at the highest level and the development of the scientic capacity in all regions of the ERA. Both requirements should be pursued in a complementary approach and not be articially combined. They are the cornerstoneMaud Evrard, Head of Policy Affairs at Science Europe, shares her views here on building a stronger European Research Area. We find out that performing excellent, ground-breaking research in Europe in this vein, is a priority Building a stronger European Research AreaRESEARCH & INNOVATIONRESEARCH & INNOVATION 221for Europe's leading role in global research and development and for a coherent and inclusive Europe. Furthermore, research collaboration has often been seen as a powerful tool to promote European values around the world. Today, in some parts of Europe, one of these values and a key component of the ERA -academic freedom - is no longer self-evident. This hasgrave consequences for scholars, science and society. A well-functioning ERA must recognise the fundamentalimportance of academic freedom and institutional autonomy and it must strive to guarantee these to all scholars in the ERA and beyond. \"To bring together several of the key stakeholders in developing the ERA, Science Europe organises an annual High-Level Workshop on the topic. Currently in its 11th year, this event offers a much-needed platform for science policy debates between decision-makers from Science Europe Member Organisations, national ministries for research and innovation and the European Commission.\" Another challenge for the ERA, as also identied by the European Parliament, is the absence of clear, shareddenitions regarding its very concept and related ones in the Framework Programmes for Research andInnovation, such as impact. Science Europe advocates using the value of research as a central concept to the ERA. Wider than impact, it recognises the intrinsic value of scientic research and its capacity to generate newknowledge. The value of research can take many forms and can be found everywhere: from technological breakthroughs and practical applications to intangible cultural value and education; from political, social, economic and environmental changes to intrinsic value that society attributes to knowledge itself. To help build a stronger and more eective ERA and shape the future of research, Science Europe advocatesa better integration of the scientic community in policymaking. Whether this involves promoting full and immediate access to research results, reviewing research assessment practices and their implications on researchers' careers, securing adequate structures to support high-risk research, or ensuring the adoption of research-friendly legislation at the European Union level, Science Europe recognises that science policy developments can only yield tangible results when informed by consolidated advice from scientists.Science Europe, therefore, calls for their voice to be taken into account. Science Europe is the association representing major public organisations that fund or perform excellent, ground-breaking research in Europe.

Traditionally these approaches are linked to the different lengths-scale that are important to the system. Starting from the entire system that is macroscopic and uses geometrical optics, over the miniaturised unit that is based on micro-optics and needs physical optics design, down to the active nano-photonics entity that allows steering light truly at the nano- scale but which requires to be designed with rigorous methods that provide full-wave solutions to the governing Maxwell's equations. A design for the manufacture of next generation opticalapplications necessarily requires bridg- ing the gap between the different length scales and to consider thedesign at a holistic level. Our project \"Noloss: Lossless photon management - Optical design for man- ufacture at different length scales\" is tailored to educate the future genera- tion of optical engineers to successfully cope with this challenge. So how do we prepare and train future engineers for the design challenges and opportuni-ties provided by modern optics tech- nology? In a situation where university research is often decoupled from high technology fabrication, this becomes achallenging task. The necessary educa- tion can only be based on real- world scenarios together with industry and a multitude of projects running in parallelto achieve a \"critical mass\" of scientific subjects and allow cross-disciplinary exchange. In our work, supported by the Euro- pean Union's (EU's) Horizon 2020 initia- tive we, therefore, brought together key players of optical technology in Europe and proposed a training pro- gramme where themes and problems are provided by industry. The research- oriented partners from academy add necessary scientific visions on different subjects, such as small-scale optical systems, nano-photonics and micro- optics. Usually, university training hap- pens in single institutions, which is very limiting when it comes to gathering experience about applications. In our case, the future PhDs are working more than half of their time in industry and learn research and technology transfer on the job. In terms of our approach, we definedthese three objectives that focused on training: Provide an integral educational platform for optical specialists that allow the education of engineers in an interdisciplinary environment and to operate outside their field of specialisation. Provide access to a doctoral (PhD) education programme that is based on state-of-the-art product develop-ment techniques and leading tech- nology platforms available in Europe. Unite the education in different opti- cal disciplines from nano-photonics and micro-optics to optical systems providing interdisciplinary product development based on optical tech- nologies. The research objectives are based on high-level research activities in the industry and focus on the problems that are identified as the main gaps and bottlenecks for optical system developments and commercialisation when miniaturisation is considered. We identified as the main research goal of our proposal: Apply innovative micro- and nano- optics technology to important real-world industrial applications, such as energy conversion (solar cells), imaging, sensing, or lighting. But what is different in our research work compared to purely academic research? In our case of research work, ample attention is given to important practical aspects that are normally left out of consideration, such as the one very important aspect: the limitations set by manufacturability. In more detail, three research objectives are considered for each of the activities: Help industry to solve the most eminent design problems related to nano-micro-optical systems, such as optical multi-scale simulation. Toralf Scharf, Senior Member at \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, charts today's challenges in training in modern optical technologyChallenges in training in modern optical technology 222PROFILEDevelop optical system design strategies for the future of the optical industry that are close to manufac- turing processes and assure compat- ibility of integration into macroscopic systems. Develop and transfer the latest optical design techniques out of the laboratory to be used by industry. Such challenges include lossless photon management, modelling at the system, components and feature level and the link between design and technology. All this need to consider manufacturability of the invented structures and concepts. Lossless photon management is the key in optical system design and appli- cations today. It basically suggests that all photons are steered in a way that they fully contribute to the functioning of the system. All losses that are created by either absorption of light orscattering into undesired channels should be avoided. Two main impact areas of lossless photon management can be identified that are of major concern to our future society: energy saving and enabling functionality. Energy saving is introduced on differ- ent levels for optical technologies and applications. It is not only important to fabricate highly efficient elements, but one needs to consider the fabrication process of the elements and systems itself. An effective starting point is the use of state-of-the-art technologies but to fully explore its potential one has to optimise the design for the manufac- ture. Such a strategy was successfully applied in the semiconductor industry and will be the key to success for futureoptical technologies. This requires link-ing in a highly integrated manner thedesign of individual optical compo- nents and entire optical systems with the manufacturing processes required. Enabling functionality is a second important field for optical systems that can be reduced to a single charac- teristic: contrast. An optical system will always be judged by its ability to mea- sure signals against a background. If all photons contribute to the signal, the background can be neglected and no photon is lost. Consequently, the signal-to-noise ratio becomes maxi-mum. In miniaturised systems, such argumentation is particularly impor- tant, because miniaturisation is often used as a synonym for nomadic and battery-powered devices. Efficiency and lossless photon management translate then directly into new applications, better performance and longer lifetime. To enable optical functionality with maximum efficiency, an integral design approach is needed that allows estab-lishing photon budgets from the source (including energy conversions effects) to the detector. Again, the aspect of fab- rication limitations within the design is the most important factor for success. At the core, are optical simulationmodels developed and used in the aca- demic research and the one used for optical designs in industry. Up to now,only the academic partners apply an integrated approach to include micro- and nano-photonics in their simula- tions. Together with the industrial partners, small-scale research projects are launched to promote the academic developments in optical design and simulation over different length scales. The industry will use the know-how to consolidate their expertise, expand their businesses and occupy new fields of activities. For each research subject, may it be nano-photonics, micro-optics or system engineering, a communica-tion channel can be provided to access particular knowledge and/or stimulatecollaborations. As an outcome, highly trained optical engineers will be able to operate indifferent worlds after completing their PhD because they will have experi- ence in both academia and industry.They can easily integrate into different environments, which is the key to today's dynamic workplaces. Packed with this rich experience, students have a much better starting conditionto pursue their career path as future leaders in the optical industry. Toralf Scharf focuses his research activities at the \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne on interdisci- plinary subjects, bringing micro-system, material technology and optics together. With a background in surfacephysics (MSc), physical chemistry (PhD) and a profound experience in optics, he is familiar with all necessary aspects of technology development and application and can communicate withdifferent scientific communities. In over 20 years of project execution with industry and governmental organisa- tions, he has accumulated the rightexperience to lead and execute the project at different levels. This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 675745. Toralf 224The need for more balanced internationalisation in higher education In the Netherlands, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science aims to create \"a smart, skilled and creative environment.\" For the Ministry, it is key that everybody can enjoy a good education and is, therefore, ready for independence and responsibility in the future. Ensuring that scientists, teachers, artists can undertake their work is another one of the Ministry's important objectives. Minister of Education, Culture and Science This article will focus on the work of Ingrid van Engelshoven, current Minister of Education, Culture and Science in the Netherlands. She recently commented on the need for more balanced internationalisation in higher education. The Ministry of Education, Cultureand Science believe that students from other countries enhance Dutch research, the job market and the econ-omy. Certainly, internationalisation in higher educationis of tremendous value to Dutch society but the growing numbers of international students must not reach extremes, according to the Ministry. Internationalisation in higher education A recent Interministerial Policy Review (IBO) underlinesthat internationalisation might threaten the funding, accessibility and quality of education. In response to this, the Government of the Netherlands aims to bring in stricter rules on the language of instruction, restrict the intake on courses taught in a language other than Dutch, and increase fees for students from outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Looking at the broader landscape, the aforementionedmeasures are part of the Language and Accessibility Bill, which builds on the IBO recommendations on internationalisation in higher education. In recentnews, we learn that the cabinet has approved Ingrid van Engelshoven's proposal to put forward the bill to the House of Representatives. On this matter, the Minister explains more in her own words. \"Internationalisation in higher education is a boon for our knowledge economy, the private sector and the job market. Long may this continue! However, research shows that the proliferation of foreign students and courses taught in English is putting too much pressure on higher education here. There's a real risk that the system will soon be unable to cope with the numbersof new students. It will squeeze funding for higher education and also crowd out Dutch students. So I'm introducing these measures to safeguard the quality and accessibility of higher education, and ensure that the international dimension is more in harmony with other aspects of Dutch higher education.\" A greater focus on prociency in Dutch The minister wants to avert the trend concerning the growth in the number of international students and English-taught courses that could undermine the prociency of Dutch students'. \"As the Minister of Culture, I also have a strong vested interest in the Dutch language,\" Ms van Engelshoven underlined. Currently, the law expects higher education institutions to promote Dutch-language prociency among students in the country. We read more details on the website of the Ministry concerning this important policy development. \"The proposed amendment will extend this require- ment and make institutions responsible for facilitating foreign students' acquisition of Dutch, too. This will enhance the students' links with their host communityIngrid van Engelshoven, Minister of Education, Culture and Science, recently shared her thoughts on the need for more balanced internationalisation in higher education, more of which we learn about here, as well as the wider work of the Ministry she is a part ofRESEARCH & INNOVATION 225and the regional job market, increase their employability and strengthen the position of Dutch as a language of scientic research. It will also raise the chance thatinternational students stay on in the Netherlands,which is good for the job market.\" Tuition fees: Stricter regulation Finally, one other aspect of this development concerns the stricter regulation of tuition fees for non-EEA students. Minister van Engelshoven wants to introduce a higher minimum rate for tuition fees payable by non-EEA students. The idea behind this thinking is that student flows from outside the EEA do not have negative nancial eects on the institutions concerned. (1) Concluding thoughts This recent development in policy is an excellent example of the wider work of the Ministry of Education, Cultureand Science to, \"create a smart, skilled and creative environment in the Netherlands\" and we wish them well for the future as they continue, \"to ensure that everyone gets a good education and is prepared for responsibility and independence.\" (2) References https://www.government.nl/government/members-of-cabinet/ingrid- Engelshoven, Minister of Education, Culture and ScienceOver the centuries, human societies have gone through countless transformations affecting the wellbeing, health andquality of life of people around the world. In many parts of the world, the advent of the 20th century resulted in a clear break from the challenging past marked by widespread povertyand illness. Nobel laureate Professor Angus Deaton described it as a 'Great Escape' from the previous reality marked by early death, poverty and poor health. Despite the devastating world wars and economic struggles that marked the first half of the 20thcentury, this historical period brought exceptional advances in health and human welfare of a large number of countries. Traditional indicators of human living standards, like Gross Domestic Prod- uct (GDP) per capita, do not capture adequately these improvements in welfare trends. (1)Nowadays, in addition to GDP, economists consider other important factors affecting living standards within nations, including working wages, consumption, mortality rates, life expectancy, inequality, schooling and leisure time. Using a multi-dimensional framework of human development, we can take a new and closer look at changes in human living standards and health during the 20th century. A better understanding of the changes brought by the 20th century could have far-reaching implications for the present day. This includes informing how we should best measure the welfare of nations and encouraging the use of more comprehensive approaches that consider a range of different dimensions of the economy and citizens' health. Human welfare in the early 20th century Applying this broader welfare approach, Daniel Gallardo Albarr\u00e1n reported in a recent paper that income growth significantly underes- timated welfare growth in Western Europe between 1913 and 1950. (2) Taking Britain as an example, in 1950, British citizens were at far lower risk of infectious diseases, had anincreased life expectancy of 16 years, lived in a more equal society and spent almost 500 hours less per year at work compared to 1900. For Europe as a whole, GDP per capita showed an improvement of less than 30% between 1913 and 1950, the composite indicator of welfare suggests that the wellbeing of citizens approximately doubled. Between 1900 and 1950, death rates declined substantially. By the late 1940s, many European countries had a rate of 9-14 deaths per 1,000 of population, coming down from 16-27 in 1900. Infant mortality decreased from 90 per 1,000 births to 25. Many of these impressive results were the fruit of 19th century improvements in health, which were driven by the germ theory and by investments in public health, such as the cleaning of water supply, sewage facilities, the setting of housing standards and the clearing of slums. These results persisted, primarily due to further low-cost improvements in sanitation and medical knowledge (new vaccines, antibiotics), which allowed major infectious diseases to be treated. The global picture of health and human welfare How do these early 20th century improvements compare with other regions in the world and with the post-WWII period? In a recent study, Leandro Prados de la Escosura has presented a so-called adjusted Histor-ical Index of Human Development. (3) Around 2007 human development levels in Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America matched those of the OECD countries in the late 1960s; in 2007 China and India had achieved levels of OECD in respectively 1960 and 1929. This is mainly an effect of much higher levels of post-WWII life expectancy of developing countries compared with the rich countries in the early 20th century. However, thisHerman de Jong from the University of Groningen, explores health and human welfare in the 20th century, with a focus on escaping early death, poverty and poor healthHealth and human welfare in the 20th century: Escaping early death, poverty and poor health 226PROFILEindex also reveals that the gap between OECD countries and the rest has widened again in absolute terms. Although there was educational expansion and recovery of income growth at the end of the 20th century in many areas in the world, the non- OECD areas failed to catch up with the longer life expectancies in the Western world. Within the OECD area, there has been a renewed contribution of life expectancy to human develop- ment since 1990, in the present case not from saving the lives of children(which was the first or epidemiological health transition), but from saving the lives of middle-aged and elderly in rich countries. This so-called second health transition has resulted in a falling rate of mortality among theelderly through better treatment and better general health and nutrition circumstances. In its turn it was a result of increasing demand for more healthcare to make our longer life more bearable ('healthy ageing'), reflecting higher real incomes. Improved health of the elderly in society is an income-elastic good. If healthcare is becoming more depen- dent on income growth and less on public policies, like it was in the early 20th century, this may lead to even higher inequality of welfare levels across nations in the future. But we need to put this in the right perspective. Healthcare per capita spending in the U.S. is close to 10,000 dollars per year and is more than two times higher than in the U.K. But this difference is not reflected in differences in life expectancy. Probably, the saving oflives is still mainly an effect of (past) public health measures, better nutrition, access to education and less the result of clinical medicine and interventions. Health transitions take time Indeed, annual per capita expendi- tures on health vary enormously across countries. In most Sub-Saharan African countries, health expenditures fluctuate below or around 200 dollars per person per year. In Bangladesh, Pakistan and India these levels are 88, 134 and 238 dollars respectively. Min- imising the exposure to environmental insults during infancy will increase longevity. The distribution of drugs and vaccines in the developing world and impoverished nations to combat tuberculosis, malaria, measles and all kinds of infections will have positive effects on life expectancy at modest costs. History has shown that this is a long process, but it will finally show up in the health statistics. These research results present a valuable opportunity for both methodological and policy-related developments. From a research perspective, it could lead to the imple- mentation of more comprehensive but realistic measures of welfare that consider a broader range of factors affecting citizens' wellbeing, including health and health services. Future research may also pay greater attention to trade-offs associated with incomeand income inequality and could ben-efit governments and policy-makers by helping them identify critical areas of welfare to prioritise in their inter-ventions. It could also help to shift the primary focus of governments from increasing GDP to developing policies that address a broader range of economic and health-related issues. The 20th century shows that we do not always need economic growth to produce higher levels of wellbeing. References (1) H.J. de Jong, \"Living Standards in a Modernizing World.

It is increasingly being called upon to help tackle complex societal issues, and is reaching more aspects of everyday society more than ever. The Dutch Research Council (NWO) places the utmost importance on funding top researchers, steering the course ofDutch science by research programmes and also managing the national knowledge infrastructure. NWO's core task is to fund talented scientists andresearch facilities. The selection process of research proposals is through a peer-reviewing process, basedon the advice of specialist scientists and relevantexperts in the Netherlands and abroad. \"Striving for a diverse organisation with an inclusive culture where everybody is needed, irrespective of cultural, ethnic or religious background, gender, sexual orientation, health, and age is something that NWO prioritise.\" NWO successfully manages this competitive research funding and ensures that the money reaches the best scientic talent and the best research proposals. NWOfunds specic scientic research that contributes towards solving societal challenges, showing its belief that this funded research is benecial to all corners of society. Today, it funds more than 5,800 research projects at universities and knowledge institutions every year, focusing on all scientic disciplines and elds of research attempting to leave no stone unturned. NWO operates within the following core values that are vital for successfully realising its ambitions andaccomplishing its goals: Ground-breaking Both pioneering and exploring the boundaries of existing knowledge. Committed Always anticipating developments in science and society. Reliable NWO states that it keeps its promises, is honest, transparent and meticulous. Connecting Maintaining an open attitude, connecting expertise and agendas. This nal core value - 'connecting' in modern society is, in fact, the main aspect of the NWO's strategic plan from 2019 - 2022 'Connecting Science and Society'. NWO emphasises its vision as a connecting role by making connections within science and between science and society together with its knowledge partners. For- ward-thinking developments require more collaboration in the science system and more dialogue between science and society. Besides a strong disciplinary basis, facilitating collaboration between disciplines, acrosssectors and throughout the knowledge chain and with societal partners is undoubtedly more necessary than ever before. NWO facilitates excellent, curiosity-driven disciplinary, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, connecting researchers from various disci- plines and across the entire knowledge chain and thus bringing researchers and societal partners together. Furthermore, NWO invites partners from industry, the government and societal organisations to contribute with their own knowledge agendas and questions to the programming, realisation, and co-funding of research. Here we can see active examples of how NWO will con- tinue to place considerable emphasis on collaborationin light of developments in science and society today. Harmonising the current funding instruments to Now is a challenging time for science. Here, we learn about the importance of funding Dutch science and research to help tackle complex societal issuesRESEARCH & INNOVATION 229facilitate collaboration which, as a result, researchers, irrespective of the research domain, will be subject to the same conditions, is, in fact, an extremely eectiveway of ensuring accessibility to all, and also contributes to NWO's focus on inclusivity within research. NWO states that it wants to be an organisation where every-one feels welcome and can bring out the best in them- selves and teams. Striving for a diverse organisation with an inclusive culture where everybody is needed,irrespective of cultural, ethnic or religious background, gender, sexual orientation, health, and age is some- thing that NWO prioritise. \"We can only achieve that if we shift the goalposts and change patterns, structures and processes. We will do this by focusing our attention on our granting policy and employer's policy.\" (1)This will strengthen research in the Netherlands, breaking down the barriers that still prevail today in science. Here NWO emphasises its connecting role, and does this yet again through the importance it places on open science. An important part of the budget is spent on open research and talent programmes. NWO believes that research results paid for by public funds should be freely accessible worldwide, (including both scientic publications and other forms of scientic output.) In principle, it must be possible to share research data with others as well. This allows valuable knowledge to be used by researchers, companies and public organisations throughout the Netherlands and other parts of the world. It is true that the Internet has radically changed the possibility to disseminate scientic knowledge. There- fore NWO's open access aims to make the outcomes of scientic research freely accessible worldwide for everybody. It is benecial because open access increases the impact of research results, open access publications are easier to nd and are more likely to be cited, and it also ensures that public organisations and companies have access to the most recent and up to date scientic insights. Emphasis on these areas can only have positive results on Dutch research. Cooperation is key. It is clear to see that as well as funding, NWO influences, supports and connects. As its mission is to advanceworld-class scientic research that has scientic and societal impact, ensuring not just quantity, but high- quality research, this causes us to question, why is fundamental research the basis of excellence andinnovation? This research allows for opportunities to innovate the world as we know it, from anything as vast as \"purifying wastewater under extreme conditions\" (2) to a cafe that is \"challenging masculinity to stop violence against women in Bangladesh.\" (3)Thousands of scientists can conduct their research thanks to nan- cial support from NWO. There are without a doubt numerous benets of research, and research leads to results. Dutch research is highly regarded and is eec- tive thanks to a smart combination of collaboration, competition, quality assurance, and a good infrastructure. The Netherlands wishes to maintain and strengthen this leading position. Promoting research is vital to ground-breaking innovation in the Netherlands.

With the aim to develop radical solutions for dicult societal challenges, the Government of Japan announced the establishment of the Moonshot Research and Development (R&D) Program in 2018. It is an endeavour to accelerate disruptive innovationsby promoting challenging R&D to achieve ambitious goals or the Moonshot Goals which inspire people in the world. The Government of Japan has allocated a budget of more than 100 billion Japanese yen (about $1 billion) for ve years as seed money. At the end of July this year, the Visionary Council of the Moonshot R&D Program recommended three areas and 13 visions to identify the Moonshot Goals for the program. The council also indicated 25 candidates forthe Moonshot Goals. The Government of Japan plans to invite distinguished scientists, engineers and innovators from around the world to provide advicesetting out the Moonshot Goals. To this end, the Government of Japan is organising the Moonshot International Symposium in Tokyo from December 17th to 18th, 2019 in order to discuss the Moonshot Goals and innovative ways of conducting Moonshot research.Fully taking into account the outcome of the sympo- sium, the Council for Science, Technology and Innova- tion (CSTI) chaired by the Prime Minister will set out the Moonshot Goals for the program. Areas and visions for the Moonshot Goals The Areas for the Moonshot Goals, recommended by the Visionary Council are: 1. Tackling declining-birthrate and an ageing society with radical innovation. 2. Recovering our civilisation and healthy global environment. 3. Pioneering new frontiers with science and technology.The Visionary Council also recommended 13 Visions for the three areas above as follows: Area 1: Inclusive society: anyone can pursue their dreams (inclusion and innovation). A society without health anxiety: everyone can enjoy life until 100 years old (achievement of well-ageing). Industrial innovations by complete automation. Area 2: Signicant reduction of resources requirements. Full recycling of resources.

Thus, AI Robot develop- ment tools should integrate different types of intelligent software modules. They should also give the users development processes that work well with them. 1. What type of AI Robot Development Tool is necessary for Users? Thus we aim to develop PRINTEPS (PRactical INTEligent aPplicationS), which is a user-centric platform to develop unified AI robot applications by integrating five types of software modules. PRINTEPS also supports users to care about AI application design and to develop and revise it easily. PRINTEPS project has been funded by the CREST initiative launched by the Japan Science and Technology Agency, which promotes intelligent information processing sys- tems aimed at harmonious collabora- tion between humans and machines. 2.PRINTEPS Architecture PRINTEPS works for users to develop unified AI Robot applications by inte-grating five types of software modules: knowledge-based reasoning, speech dialog, image sensing, motion &manipulation planning and machine learning with deep learning. The knowledge-based reasoning moduleincludes workflows, business rules, and ontologies. The spoken dialogue module refers to response generation rules, dialogue processing rules, and language understanding rules. Theimage sensing module has object and human behaviour recognition. The motion and manipulation planning module also include obstacle recogni- tion and dynamic/intelligent route planning. Machine leaning consists of conventional machine learning suchas decision tree learning, Bayesian networks, Random Forest and deep learning such as convolutional neural networks and LSTM and so on. Figure 1 shows the architecture of PRINTEPS. PRINTEPS is based on Robot Operating System (ROS), whichis a robot middleware and offers com- munication libraries and various tools. In ROS, a user can employ services, which have a synchronous communi- cation mechanism, and topics, whichoffers a mechanism for asynchronous communications. Because ROS is implemented as a distributed system, ROS facilitates how to handle multiple robots or sensors, and the use of topics enables various other process- ing operations, including the real time acquisition of sensor values. Information State (IS) in PRINTEPS is a database for sharing data among intelligent software modules. PRINT- EPS takes MongoDB store, which is aMongoDB-based storage and analysis for data from a ROS system, as IS. InTakahira Yamagichi of Keio University dives into the PRINTEPS platform, explaining how it helps AI Robot Applications to be more easily to developUser-Centric Platform PRINTEPS for Unified AI Robot Applications 232PROFILE Figure 1. PRINTEPS Architecture (Click to enlarge)PRINTEPS, each software module stores data to IS and refers data from IS. The data format in PRINTEPS is the format of messages in ROS. PRINTEPS also provides a multi knowl- edge-based editor for users to develop integrated intelligent applications easily by combining software modules from PRINTEPS. The details of the editor are described in the next section. 3. Multi Knowledge-based Editor The multi knowledge-based editor consists of a workflow editor and a Business Rule Management System (BRMS). 3.1 Workflow Editor Users can develop workflows using components based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) by the workflow editor. The main components in the workflow editor are services, processes and modules, as shown in Figure 2. Themodules are primitive functions and they are fully compliant with ROS ser- vices, topics, and messages. The pro- cesses play a function-like role in which they deal with multiple modules. In process operation, the processes and modules can be defined in a mixedmanner. The services are functions with the coarsest grain size and are composed only of processes defined as business processes. The first hierarchy (route service) of the workflow editor is composed of a route start, service list, and route end. The service list, whencompleted, will be shared among users as a case library (best practice). It will allow users to locate easily those services, processes, or modules used as best practice. The workflow editor automatically generates source codes in Python that can be executed in ROS. 3.2 Business Rule Management System BRMS includes a Business RulesEngine (BRE), a web authoring and rule management application. PRINTEPS takes Drools as BRMS. Since BRMS has a function to define rules with domain specific language, users can then easily describe business rules with natural-language like form. In PRINTEPS, \"fire business rules\" module in the workflow editor can exe- cute business rules in BRMS and BRMS can execute modules in the \"then-part\" of business rules. The big difference between a traditional knowledge- based system and an integrated intel-ligent application is that sensing results such as person attributes from an image can be described in the \"when- part\" of business rules and robots action such as speaking and moving toa certain place can be described in the \"then-part\" of the business rules. 4. Conclusion We apply PRINTEPS to two real cases: Robot Caf\u00e9/Restaurant and TA Robots in primary schools. The results will be described in future issues.

Three layers with PRINTEPS PROFILE (Click to enlarge)SPACE POLICY 234Meeting the real-life enterprise taking humans to the final frontier Throughout the decades, the gallivanting escapades of the Starship Enterprise - traversing the depths of where no-one has gone before - has enthralled and inspired generations. What seemed like a distant dream for those wishing to cruise the nal frontier, could soon become a reality. With the enter- prising spirit of some of the world's leading business moguls striving for the expansion of space tourism for Hollywood A-listers, Asgardia is seeking to boldlylaunch themselves to the forefront of space residency for a mass audience. In July, we celebrated the momentous 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landings, but in reality, we have been celebrating the achievements of that mission every day since. The technological developments of the mission have had huge implications on the ways thatwe have lived our lives. The lunar drill, created for the mission, revolutionised labour endeavours, leading the way for the creation of cordless, lightweight electrictools. Furthermore, the integration of circuit technology and silicon chips into our consumer technology is now a given in the 21st century. But it was all thanks to thedevelopments of Apollo-associated companies such as Fairchild based in Santa Clara County, California that we enjoy micro-computer chips. Could you now imagine a world without Silicon Valley? Well, you can thank Apollo 11 for that. However, the time is to now look forward once again. From the celebrations of Apollo 11, we must recapture that pioneering spirit and continue widescale develop- ment. The 21st space race has very much been ignited by the pioneering enterprises of Messrs Branson, Musk and Bezos, with the last few years being undeniably the most transformative for the sector. Soon we will see humans travelling into space as a leisurely activityand not just for scientic research. This means that the boundaries for human exploration eectively cease to exist. \"In July, we celebrated the momentous 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landings, but in reality, we have been celebrating the achievements of that mission every day since. The technological developments of the mission have had huge implications on the ways that we have lived our lives.\" The great achievements of the NASA projects in the 20th century showed that space exploration can be done. Space travel was no longer a fantasy but a realis- tic prospect. The beauty of private enterprises taking people to space is that they show how it should be done. Space travel can now be luxurious and comfort- able. Private enterprise has also led the way in devel- oping reusable rockets. This will prove to drag down the costs of space travel enormously and will soon provide a service that is not just exclusive to the hugely auent classes in society. But where does Asgardia t into this? Whilst the exploits of the aforementioned gentlemanhave their own certain ambitions, we believe that noneare quite so multi-faceted as Asgardia. On one front, there are scientic developments to create conditions for which space habitation can flourish. One could saythat our headline development is to research and create the environment by which Asgardia will be able to facilitate for the rst human birth in space within the next 25 years. A particularly large focus of our research and development team is, therefore, to accelerate the developments into creating an environment in which an earth-like gravitational force can be replicated. Dr Lena De Winne, Head of Information and Communications at Asgardia, speaks of how the endeavours of the billionaire class could soon become a reality for a mass audienceSPACE POLICY 235Once we have the capabilities to facilitate human conception, we can then continue to develop our next two stages for research and development. These devel- opments are how people will recognise as Asgardia for years to come. The primary role of Asgardia is to provide a home for humans in space. With plans for low-orbital arks around the earth and then farther out to orbit around the moon, we believe that this ambition really can become a reality. The survival of the human race is dependent on these discoveries too. With technology on Earth that has the potential to destroy such vast numbers of people, it is essential that we have a safeguard in place to protect our species. In addition to human survival, Asgardia intends to develop technology that will defend Earth from Near- Earth Objects (NEOs). Currently, we are at the mercy of chance and lady luck. Quite often when NEOs pass, weare not aware of them until they are due to pass withinthe next ten hours. On many occasions, we don't even know about the NEOs until they have actually passed. With our anti-NEO technology, we will be ensuring the survival of the human race on multiple fronts, setting Asgardia apart from the rest of the pack. Dr Lena De Winne Minister of Information and Communications 1684 lena.de.winne@aasgardia.space https://asgardia.space/en/www.twitter.com/AsgardiaSpace Dr Head of Information and Communications at AsgardiaIput stress1on the great goal of modern cosmology: investigating the physics of the early universe. This very ambitious goal requires combined and synergic contributions from astronomy, particle physics and cosmology. These three research areas are progressively converging into a relatively new research fieldcalled astroparticle physics, which simultaneously addresses fundamental questions connected from one hand with the elementary particles and their interactions but, on the other hand, with the formation and evolution of the large-scale structure of the universe. In 2001, the Astroparticle Physics European Consortium (APPEC) was founded to promote cooperation among the members of the European scientific community and coordination among the national (European) scientific agencies. This was (and is) perfectly in line with the need and the effort to build a European Research Area (ERA), as clearly stated in 2011 by the Euro- pean Council. This is obviously crucial to fully capitalise on Europe's scientific and creative potential. An ERA Roadmap at EU level was endorsed by the Council in 2015, calling for a limited number of top action priorities. Although transnational cooperation between the Member States has increased along with an improvement of all the indicators for research excellence, there is still muchto do. This is why it has been particular timing the presentation of the Euro - pean Astroparticle Physics Strategy by APPEC the 9th January 2018, in Brus- sels, Belgium. The APPEC Recommendations for the2017-26 address specific scientific issues and updates of long-term scientific strategies, as well as societal issues like global collaboration, community building, gender balance, education, public outreach and relations with industry. Among these recommendations, there is the recog ni- tion that: \"The future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) programme sets the stage for a range of opportunities to link key themes together and provides a potential stepping-stone towards further fundamental discoveries\". Interestingly enough, the properties of the galaxies and their spatial distri- bution, as observed \"here and now\", are determined by the physics of the inflation, a period of accelerated expansion occurring in the early Universe just (10 -36seconds) after the conjectured Big Bang. Inflation is nowadays considered the paradigm solving some fundamental shortcom- ings of the hot Big Bang model and, most of all, providing the only self- consistent mechanism able to explain the generation of the primordial seeds out of which (via gravitational instability) all the observed cosmic structures have formed. The CMB is certainly the most power- ful and natural tool to characterise these seeds and to constrain models of particle physics beyond the stan- dard model at energies which will be never reached in laboratory experi- ments. In particular, tensor perturba- tions of the space-time metric lead to a primordial gravitational wave background, which imprints a unique pattern (the so-called B-modes) in the polarisation of CMB photons. primary scientific exploita- tion of CMB B-mode detection will aim to a definitive probe of the inflation paradigm and, hopefully, to elucidate the physical mechanisms behind it. In addition to this, the gravitational lensing of CMB photons due to the large-scale matter distribution willprovide stringent information on the distribution of dark matter and, possibly, on the masses of neutrinos. The comparison between the neutrino properties inferred from cosmological measurements and those determined in laboratory experiments is likely to open a new window on our physical modelling of the micro- and macro- cosmos. To discover the secrets hidden in the B-modes of the CMB, it is necessary to combine observations from space and from the ground. The ongoing and forthcoming ground-based CMB experiments2use large detector arrays gives an absorbing insight into CMB Space missions and why they are a window to astroparticle physicsCMB Space missions: a window to astroparticle physics 236PROFILESpace-borne CMB measurements are not limited by the atmosphere and can probe a wide frequency range to provide an effective foreground subtraction to reveal the truly primor- dial B-modes induced by the primor- dial gravitational wave background. The last space experiment dedicated to CMB observations is the ESA/Planck mission, which has created a CMB community in Europe with a unique expertise in space-borne CMB research. After the completion of Planck and the forthcoming Planck Legacy release, European CMB researchers have continued to play leadership roles in a number of suborbital efforts -both in Europe (e.g., Qubic , LSPE, Pilot) and elsewhere (e.g., by collaborating with the ground-based S4 program) - but still looking for a shared, major European experimental effort. The European CMB community has also recognised the need and theurgency for a new space mission. There was quite a strong R&D effort in Europe in new technologies for the next generation CMB experiments and a proposal for a Core mission submitted to ESA has been, unfortu- nately, rejected. Therefore, LiteBIRD(Lite satellite for the studies of B-mode polarisation and Inflation from cosmic background Radiation Detection) -a JAXA's strategic large mission candi- date in Phase-A1 (concept develop- ment) - appeared to the European CMB community a natural and logical continuation of these Europe-led efforts. At the national level, there is an interest to contribute to LiteBIRD from CNES in France, from both the UK Space Agency (UKSA) and the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council(STFC) and from the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The Italian Space Agency (ASI) has already founded the participation of the Italian CMB community to the LiteBIRD Phase A1 study, which will end by the end of this year. Further interest at the European level has been manifested by Spain, the Netherlands and Finland, along with Sweden. To facilitate a coordinatedeffort of the European communityduring the Phase A1 of the LiteBIRD experiment, there is the willingness to constitute a European Consortium. The governance structure of this Consortium will be finalised during the forthcoming Turin This structure will be revised once the LiteBIRD mission will be approved and the so-called Phase B will start, early in 2019. The participation of the European CMB community in LiteBIRD was solicited by a formal letter of the ISAS/JAXA Director-General. A potential junior partnership of ESA on the JAXA-led mission LiteBIRD could be realised through a Mission of Opportunity (MoO), if there is a clear scientific return to ESA's scientific community. However, ESA cannot approve a MoO before LiteBIRD is formally selected by JAXA. So, while there is the need of not dispersing knowledge and skills acquired with the ESA/Planck mission, the formal selection from JAXA of the LiteBIRD mission seems to be the appointment not to be missed by the CMB European community. See the link to my last book here , which was published in late 2017. 1 Open Access Government May 2017, pp 102-103 Access Government August 2017, pp. http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2013/03/Planck_CMBThe CMB is the oldest light reaching us \"here and now\". The ESA/Planck observations of this light show tiny intensity fluctuations that bring information on regions that had slightly different densities when the universe was 380 000 years old. The existence of these regions explains the large scale structure of the universe we observe today238Astronomical Sciences (AST) is a branch of the U.S National Science Foundation (NSF) focusing on funding and supporting scientists doing basic research within the elds of astronomy and astronomicalsciences. The NSF was created in 1950 by congress asthey stated that this type of support is a primary driver of the U.S. economy. It also vastly enhances the security of the U.S. and advances knowledge that sustains global leadership in the sciences. The AST is part of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS)- another branch of the NSF. Other divisions include the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics. These agencies often collaborate to achieve their set mission which is \"to harness the collective eorts of the mathematical and physical sciences communities to address the most compelling scientic questions, educate the future advanced high-tech workforce, and promote discoveries to meet the needs of the Nation.\" 1The specic aim of the AST is to provide facilities and funding U.S. astronomical researchers. This is to ensure that U.S. astronomical research is to a high standard and to encourage understanding of the astronomical sciences to members of the public and politicians alike. \"We have never seen anything like 'Oumuamua' in our solar system. It's really a mystery still,\" said Knight.\" \"Basic research\" is dened by the NST as scientic research that improves or expands upon pre-existing scientic theories. For instance, recent research by the AST has explored Einstein's 100-year-old theory that light is deflected by \"extremely massive objects.\"2 A team of astronomers funded by the AST discovered that Einstein was correct, stating: \"Our observations areconsistent with Einstein's theory of general relativity. However, his theory is denitely showing vulnerability. It cannot fully explain gravity inside a black hole, and at A glimpse at astronomical sciences in the U.S. Here, we unveil the sterling efforts of the National Science Foundation to further astronomical sciences in the U.S.SPACE POLICYSPACE POLICY 239some point we will need to move beyond Einstein's theory to a more comprehensive theory of gravity that explains what a black hole is.\"3 As well as testing previous scientic research the AST has also looked into one of the more prominent scienticnews stories of this decade. The 'Oumuamua' 4asteroid was the rst known interstellar object to visit our solarsystem and viewed by an NSF funded observatory at theUniversity of Hawaii. \"The specific aim of the AST is to provide facilities and funding U.S. astronomical researchers. This is to ensure that US astronomical research is to a high standard and to encourage understanding of the astronomical sciences to members of the public and politicians alike.\" The object had odd and irregular characteristics: it wascigar-shaped and resembled both a comet and anasteroid. This was extremely unusual which led some observers to question whether or not it was an alien spacecraft. However, an international team ofastronomers part-supported by the AST provided evidence that this theory was far-fetched. Scientist Matthew Knight stated, \"We have never seen anythinglike 'Oumuamua' in our solar system. It's really a mystery still,\" said Knight. \"But our preference is to stick with analogs we know, unless or until we nd something unique. The alien spacecraft hypothesis is a fun idea, but our analysis suggests there is a whole host of natural phenomena that could explain it.\" 5 Now, the NSF is funding a new telescope called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which has been designed to detect more objects like the Oumuamua. This telescope will be active by 2022 and is set to be one of their most advanced telescopes yet.The NSF and AST also built the Green Bank Telescope,which is located in West Virginia and started operating in 2001. The telescope is currently the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope. However, as of 2016,the telescope is now operated by a partially funded group known as the Green Bank Observatory. This is because the NSF and AST are gradually decreasing the funding for the Green Bank Telescope from 2016-2019. They are now still involved in the project but supplyingless nancial support. References 1 www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovEinstein's Theory of General Relativity predicts the existence of gravitational waves (GWs), ripples in spacetime produced by accelerating massive objects. The era of GW astronomy began with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational- wave Observatory (LIGO) detection of GWs from the inspiral and merger of two heavy stellar-mass black holes. Being able to observe GWs has opened up new ways to answer open questions in astrophysics and other areas of science that were not possible beforehand. LIGO, however, is only sensitive to GWs at frequencies of order tens of hertz to kilohertz, where binary neutron stars and stellar-massbinary black holes merge. Different detectors are, thus, needed in order to detect GWs at lower frequencies. The multi-band frequency spectrum of gravitational waves GWs may span a wide range of frequencies. The larger the mass of black holes, the lower the frequency. This is because the size of the black hole increases with its mass. The larger the length scale of a black-hole binary, the longer the corresponding orbital period. Longer orbital periods correspond to lower frequencies. In the future, more frequency bands of the multi-band GW spectrum areexpected to be opened up, with the nanohertz frequency band already expected to develop considerably within the next 5-10 years. \"Being able to observe GWs has opened up new ways to answer open questions in astrophysics and other areas of science that were not possible beforehand.\" What produces nanohertz gravitational waves? Nanohertz frequencies correspond to binary orbital periods of years to decades, much longer than the milli- second timescales that LIGO is sensi- tive to. The loudest sources that areThe new era of gravitational-wave astronomy is explored here by Miguel Holgado, PhD, Candidate at the Department of Astronomy, the University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignThe journey binaries with orbital periods of years to decades. This is because SMBHs are the most massive black holes in the Universe, thus, corresponding to largeGW amplitudes. Almost every galaxy is expected to host a SMBH at its centre. Given that we have seen that galaxies can merge with each other, do the SMBHs of each galaxy merge as well? If so, then such SMBH binaries should frequenciesdecay on timescales longer than timescales. Thus, the primary expected signal for nanohertz GW astronomy is a stochastic background,a combination of the entire cosmic SMBH binary population across the entire sky. \"Next-generation telescopes will also continue to observe current SMBH binary candidates and are expected to find even more as well. The future is, therefore, both bright and loud for nanohertz GW astronomy.\" How can we detect nanohertz gravitational waves? timing arrays (PTAs) are a particular type of GW detector that is sensitive to GWs with frequencies of order nanohertz, which are much lower compared to LIGO's sensitivity at tens of hertz to kilohertz. Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars thatemit radio-wave pulses at regular intervals, with timing precision comparable to atomic clocks. When a GW passes through the Earth and a distance pulsar, the arrival times of the pulses will be shifted due to the stretching and squeezing of space- time. The main smoking gun for adetection is that the PTA as a whole behaves in a manner consistent with what GWs would produce. Any sky pattern of pulses from a PTA that is not consistent with GWs allows for other signal behaviours to be ruled out. The latest developments So far, PTAs have not yet detected the nanohertz GW background and instead have been placing even more stringent upper limits over time. Even though a detection has yet to be made, the upper limits have actually proven to be of astrophysical interest. The most optimistic predictions for what the background might be arestarting to be ruled out. In addition,telescopes have been finding bright galactic nuclei that appear to have a periodic behaviour, which is some- times interpreted to be due to a SMBH binary. PTA upper limits have shown, however, that not all candidates can be real binaries. Otherwise, these candidate binaries would produce a GW background that PTAs would have already detected. What will we learn from a detection? A detection of the nanohertz stochastic GW background will provide new insights about the cosmic SMBH binary population that were not possible beforehand. Measuring the amplitudeof the background and the shape of its frequency spectrum will tell us moreabout how SMBH binaries interact with their environments, including the gas and stars that are thought to be in the vicinity of the binary. Even after a detection of the background, PTAs can still operate during the following years and decades in order to better charac- terise the background in addition to making a skymap of the nanohertz GWbackground. If there happens to be a detection of a single SMBH binary that is louder than the background, then such a source could be followed up by telescopes to look for an electromag- netic counterpart and its host galaxy. With these counterparts, a better understanding of how the properties of the binary correlate with the electro- magnetic emission and the host-galaxyproperties is possible. What can we expect in the next 5-10 years? PTAs are poised to detect the nanohertz from the cosmic SMBH binary popula- tion. Pulsar observations will continue well into the future and new pulsars are continually being added to the cur- rent array. These efforts will improveupper limits on the GW background and lead closer and closer towards a detection. Next-generation telescopes will also continue to observe current SMBH binary candidates and are expected to find even more as well. The future is, therefore, both bright and loud for nanohertz GW astronomy. A. Miguel Holgado PhD, Candidate Department of Astronomy, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign holgado2@illinois.edu 241PROFILECHEMISTRY 242Nanomaterials: A focus on the laser ablation in liquid environment (LALE) technique Laser ablation in liquid environment (LALE) has been used as a straightforward technique to build a broad spectrum of nanostructured materials or nanomaterials. This singularly versatile technique enables to overcome the main challenges faced whenthe mechanism of synthesis remains as the interaction between the laser beam, the irradiated solid target and the liquid environment (Abdelghany et al., 2018). Indeed, a wide range of nanostructured magnetic mate- rials can be prepared by using new synthesis pathwaysbased on LALE technique, taking into consideration that the precursors used come directly from the ablation ofa solid target and the liquid environment. The utilisation of LALE technique during the synthesis process neces- sarily involves non-equilibrium conditions. High temper-atures and pressures, above 100 Kelvin and 100 Pascal, respectively, are generated as a consequence of the interaction between the pulsed laser beam and the solidtarget. In fact, the micro and nanostructure of the pre- pared materials strongly depend on the fluency of the laser beam on the target, as well as, the solvent utilised, in addition to the concentration of reactants in the liquid. The laser beam directly influences the size distribution of the synthesised particles. The concerns broadly addressed Like many other synthesis techniques used to build nanostructured materials, the LALE technique also presents some drawbacks. First of all, it is important to highlight that during the chemical synthesis, metal pre- cursors, reductant agents and stabilising chemicals, are present all together in the synthesis solution with the aim to ensure stable chemical-synthesised colloids. Nevertheless, many of these products and/or byprod-ucts may produce adverse eects on human health. Standards and regulations establish that such potentiallyharmful chemicals must be separated and removed from the nal nanocolloids before their nal utilisation. Overall, LALE technique presents the lower risk and environmental impact, due to the fact that both metalprecursors and reductants are not needed. Moreover, nanocolloids oer higher levels of purity in comparison with conventional chemical synthesis methods (Sportelli et al., 2018). The technique not only avoids the utilisation of reductants but also can fragment metal targets with-out recurring to capping agents (Akter et al., 2018). Thisprocessing feature makes the LALE technique intrinsi- cally safer than conventional methods by dramatically reducing the risk of contamination of the nanocolloids. \"The utilisation of LALE technique during the synthesis process necessarily involves non-equilibrium conditions. High temperatures and pressures, above 100 Kelvin and 100 Pascal, respectively, are generated as a consequence of the interaction between the pulsed laser beam and the solid target.\" Furthermore, in the use of the obtained nanostructured materials for antimicrobial applications, nanoparticles generated using the LALE technique demonstrate a lack of ligands and typical stabilisers on their surface, hence exhibiting higher reactivity and antimicrobial eects in comparison other chemicals (Kaphle et al., 2018). Even a step beyond, nanoparticles created based on LALE technique can be conjugated in situ with biomolecules, thus undergoing a more ecient performance thannanomaterials conjugated ex situ (Sportelli et al., 2016). Conversely, the main drawbacks of LALE technique are related to high investment and operative costs due to the utilisation of a particularly expensive laser system, as well as, the considerable amounts of energy requiredto obtain good ablation eciency. Cecilia Van Cauwenberghe from Frost & Sullivan's TechVision Group focuses on nanomaterials by looking at the challenges and opportunities around the laser ablation in liquid environment (LALE) technique, including an overall perspective CHEMISTRY 243Final remarks Even when exhibiting some disadvantages in terms of costs and operation, so far, laser ablation in liquid environment (LALE) constitutes the most ecient andstraightforward technique to create nanostructured materials in a safe and eective manner for both human health and environment.

For instance, nanoparti- cles of noble metals such as gold and silver exhibit a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) arising fromthe collective oscillations of the free electron cloud, which is sensitive to the nanoparticle size, shape, and compo- sition. As a result, controlling the size and shape of gold and silver nanopar- ticles makes it possible to tune their optoelectronic properties for applica- tions such as photothermal therapy, biosensing, and photocatalysis. Decades of research into wet-chemical synthetic routes to noble metal nanoparticles have led to the discovery of nanoparticle morphologies ranging from atomically precise gold nanoclus-ters with as few as 13 atoms to larger spherical, cubic, octahedral, and trian- gular prism gold and silver tures. This exquisite level of control over nanoparticle morphologies is typically exerted through a combina- tion of two strategies: controlling the nanoparticle growth kinetics through tuning parameters such as reducing agent concentration, temperature, solvent, and salt additives; and adding organic surfactants or polymers that attach to the nanoparticle surfaces as ligands and prevent excessive growth. However, these strategies often require excess quantities of reducingagents and surfactants, which pro- duces significant amounts of chemical waste. Moreover, organic ligands must be removed for certain applications due to their toxicity or because they block catalytically active sites. \"The laser-induced decomposition of water produces two important reactive species that can reduce the tetrachloroaurate ion: hydrated electrons and hydrogen peroxide, which is formed from the recombination of hydroxyl radicals.\" Laser Ablation in Liquid (LAL) methods have emerged as promising routes to colloidal nanoparticles that have myriad advantages over wet-chemical methods. For instance, laser processing can be carried out under ambient con- ditions and requires no toxic chemical reducing agents, thus minimising chemical waste generation. Moreover, laser processing produces colloidally stable noble metal nanoparticles without organic capping ligands, which yields uncoated \"naked\" nanoparticles particularly suited to catalytic and biomedical applications. However, the absence of capping agents makes producing narrow nanoparticle size distributions with LAL challenging. For instance, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) produced by \"top-down\" laser ablation of a gold target in pure water typically exhibit broad size distributions of spherical particles ranging from ~5 - 100 nm or larger. Our laboratory's work found that \"bottom-up\" laser-inducedreduction of aqueous tetrachloroau- rate salt precursor to AuNPs also pro- duces broad particle size distributions from ~3 - 30 nm or larger, depending on the reaction conditions 1-4. From nearly the beginning of top- down LAL investigations in the early 2000's, investigators have addedorganic capping agents used in wet- chemical synthesis such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to the water solvent priorto immersion of the gold target. This strategy effectively produces sub-10 nm tetrachloroaurate reduc- tion, we found that adding PEG to the solution forms AuNPs as small as 3.9\u00b10.7 nm 1, but producing such small and monodisperse AuNPs without PEG had remained elusive2,3. To control AuNP sizes in bottom-up tetrachloroaurate reduction without capping agents, we turned to the otherpopular wet-chemical strategy: control- ling the reaction kinetics by manipulat- ing the availability of reducing agents in solution. The laser-induced decompo- sition of water produces two important reactive species that can reduce the tetrachloroaurate ion: hydrated elec- trons and hydrogen peroxide, which is formed from the recombination of hydroxyl radicals. Electrons are partic- ularly strong reducing agents, and our laboratory found that hydrogen peroxide accelerates the reduction ofHere, Laser Ablation in Liquid (LAL) is explored as means to understand the shapes and sizes of nanoparticlesSize of nanoparticles from laser ablation: Lessons from wet-chemical synthesis 244PROFILEtetrachloroaurate when AuNPs are already present through an autocat-alytic growth mechanism 1-4. We reasoned that hydrogen peroxide- induced autocatalytic AuNP growth was to blame for the difficulty in controlling AuNP size distributions. To block this detrimental action of hydrogen perox- ide, we added the well-known hydroxyl radical scavengers isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and sodium acetate (Ac) to thetetrachloroaurate solution to prevent hydrogen peroxide formation. With sufficient amounts of added scav- engers, the autocatalytic AuNP growth was significantly perse AuNPs as small as 3.8\u00b10.9 nm were produced (Figure 1) 4. In particular, the addition of scavengers completelyeliminated the formation of nanoparti- cles larger than 10 nm, as compared tothe no-scavenger product that exhibits more than 50% of the Au mass in >10 nm particles. These results demonstrate that con- trolling the availability of reducing agents produced by laser-induced solvent decomposition enables excep- tional control over both the reaction kinetics and the resulting particle size distributions in bottom-up LAL. Com- bined with earlier results demonstrat- ing the efficacy of capping agents in controlling nanoparticle sizes both for top-down and bottom-up LAL, it is evident that applying the lessons of wet-chemical synthesis can signifi- cantly improve the quality of LAL-syn-thesized nanoparticles. Our group is pursuing additional investigations into understanding and manipulating reaction kinetics in bottom-up LAL that will equip the LAL community with tools needed to exert improved control over nanoparticle sizes, making them suitable for practical applications. \"...laser processing can be carried out under ambient conditions and requires no toxic chemical reducing agents, thus minimising chemical waste generation.\" References 1 B.

It is true that the bases of many of the core sciences were established a long time ago, in the case of mechanics and hydraulics, for example, centuries ago at the beginning of written history. In the case of my fields of interest, the scientific principles of chemistry go back to late 18th and through the 19th and 20th centuries, a comparatively short time. The point about this remark is that new knowledge rarely comes from nothing; it soundly basedon accumulated prior information and understanding. I follow happily adictum from the Lord Todd of Trump- ington, Nobel Prize winner and former Chancellor of the University of Strath- clyde, which runs: 'Chemistry is the Queen of Sciences. Get your chemistry right and everything else follows'. This is a snappy way of reminding us that chemistry is a science that creates its objects for study and, most impor- tantly, objects that are components of useful materials and devices. Lord Todd's field of study was the chemical synthesis and properties of a class of compounds known as nucleotides, which includes compo- nents of DNA. His work established the basis for the chemical synthesis of nucleotides and related compoundsthat in other people's hands eventually led to understanding the geneticcode, to the chemical synthesis of DNA itself and to many procedures fundamental to molecular biology. Todd's Nobel Prize-winning research in the 1940s and 1950s contributed to making a great deal of contemporary science and technology possible. One of the features of the field in which he worked is the enormous variety of chemical compounds that were investigated based upon a relatively small number of central patterns. This is a characteristic of what is called 'heterocyclic chemistry', which simply means the chemistry of compounds that contain rings of atoms with at least one element other than carbon.It is one of the core fields of chemistry to which I referred in the paragraph above and its sheer versatility and flexibility make it central to modern technologies as diverse as television screens and new drugs (see my e-book published by Open Access Govern-ment: 'Why does heterocyclic chem - istry matter? '). It's important to make new things happen by the intelligent and wise application of science and heterocyclic chemistry is one major field that makes this possible. With this background then, it's no surprise that much of the research that we carry out at the University of Strathclyde has heterocyclic chemistry at its core. In my own laboratory, we are concerned with the discovery ofnew anti-infective drugs for treatingboth human and animal populations and the discovery of newimmunomodulatory and anti-inflam- matory compounds. In both of these projects, we have taken approaches that are not typical of the way the pharmaceutical industry approaches drug discovery. The big pharma paradigm is to find a compound that provides an improvement for the patient (not necessarily a cure) by targeting a single component of the pathology that is causing the disease, be it an infectious agent (bacterium, fungus, parasite, or virus) leading to a single measurable effect; put simply it's one drug, one target, one effect. There are good reasons for working in this way, mostly to do with the minimi- sation of risk, but it's not the only way to advance drug discovery. Indeed, it can be argued that the big pharma paradigm limits advances. In our Prof Colin J Suckling OBE DSc FRSE from the Department of Pure & Applied Chemistry, at University of Strathclyde, explains the importance of getting your chemistry rightGetting your chemistry right 246PROFILE Prof Colin J Sucklingdiscovery programmes at the University of Strathclyde, therefore, we have adopted approaches that industry would consider too risky. In both of our projects mentioned, heterocyclic chemistry and its inherent flexibility have played a major role. I'll illustrate this for our anti-infectives programme which is the most advanced and has heterocyclic chem- istry is at the heart. Our compounds synthesized at the University of Strathclyde being developed for antibacterial, antifungal and antipara- sitic applications belong to a class of compound known as minor groove binders (S-MGBs) that engage DNA to kill the infectious agent in ways yet to be worked out in detail. Our best compounds are very potent butsomewhat surprisingly, are not toxic to mammalian cells and more surpris- ingly still are in general effective in mouse models of disease without evidently causing adverse effects inthe mouse. This selective toxicity is what is needed in an anti-infective drug: kill the disease-causing agent but not the host. Moreover, because of the way S-MGBs work it has proved impossible so far to generate resis- tance to our S-MGBs in laboratory experiments, a very important advan- tage for a drug that would be widelyused in the field over many years. That we can achieve these things is down to the flexibility of heterocyclic chemistry whereby we can make small, subtle changes to the structures of our S-MGBs whilst maintaining the essential properties of binding to DNA and killing bacteria, fungi or parasites. It's unpredictable what a small change in structure will do. For example, we have found that the addition of just one carbon atom as a methyl group improves the potency of an S-MGB by as much as tenfold. Small changes can also influence the physical-chemical properties of S-MGBs so that activecompounds suitable for a variety of routes of delivery, for example, injecta- bles, non-absorbed oral formulations, or topically active creams can be obtained. All of these properties are controlled by the chemical structure of our S-MGBs so that we can truly connect with Lord Todd's dictum: 'Get your chemistry right and everythingelse follows'. \"'Chemistry is the Queen of Sciences. Get your chemistry right and everything else follows'. This is a snappy way of reminding us that chemistry is a science that creates its objects for study and, most importantly, objects that are components of useful materials and devices.\" Prof Colin J Suckling OBE DSc FRSE Research Professor of Chemistry Department of Pure & Applied Chemistry, University of Strathclyde and encouraging research in the chemical sciences The National Science Foundation (NSF) was set up by Congress in 1950, \"to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, pros- perity, and welfare; to secure the national defence.\" (1) This article will briefly focus on the work of the Division of Chemistry (CHE) within the NSF who set out to support innovative research in the chemical sciences. Integrated with education, they believe this aim can be achieved with strategic investment in developing aglobally engaged chemistry workforce that reflects the diversity of the U.S. CHE's values includes the vital role that fundamental scientic research plays to benetsociety. Looking ahead, another value they hold dear is empowering future generations in the elds of science and engineering. (2) In a recent edition of Open Access Government, Carol Bessel and Melissa Olson from the Division of Chemistry (CHE), revealed their thoughts on the kindof chemistry projects CHE are involved with. \"CHE actively solicits and funds projects that design and develop sustainable chemistry pathways from synthesis to recycling; advance algorithms and novel qubit structures for quantum computing; accelerate and complement chemical discovery with data mining and articial intelligence (AI); and seek to understand and engineer the biochemistry governing life processes such as in synthetic biology, epigenetics and studies of the microbiome.\" (3) In recent CHE news, we see that the Critical Aspects of Sustainability (CAS) program is well promoted on the CHE's website. \"This program seeks to support basic research through core disciplinary programs aimed atimproving the sustainability of resources for future generations while maintaining or improving current products in order to oer technologically-advanced,economically competitive, environmentally-benign and useful materials to a global society.\" Also, CAS seeks to support basic research through core disciplinary programs targeted improving the sustain- ability of resources for future generations whileimproving or maintaining or current products to oer economically competitive, technologically-advanced and environmentally-benign and useful materials for a global society. We take this opportunity to wish the program well in their future endeavours as they welcome research proposals that are supported by the divisions taking part that address a wealth of topics such as Chemical Synthesis (SYN), Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI), Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC), Biological and Environmental Interactions of Nanoscale Materials (BioNano) and Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS).

At the turn of the last millennium, we already had over 1 billion people lacking access to safe drinking waterand basic sanitation and nearly 4,000 children under the age of five dying each day 1. This situation has and will continue to worsen with the projected increase in population. Current water purification technologies, often rely- ing on relatively expensive systemsand synthetic materials, are non-sus-tainable for the poorest communities in the most water-distressed regions, where these communities areexpanding the fastest. It is imperative that we break the paradigm of seeking solutions from existing technologies and instead explore new avenues for sustainable solutions that, as of yet, are unavailable. We argue that one possible solution to tackle the problem of 'affordable and sustainable' is to use abundant and underutilised biomass as a source for extracting functional nanostructured cellulosic materials, or nanocellulose, for water purification through effec- tive and low-cost means. Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on earth. Its annual production is inthe order of 7.5 x 10 10tonne2, which isabout 200 times that of the annual plastic production in the world. Cellu- lose is naturally produced by all higher plants, as well as by a wide range of varying bacteria, algae and fungi, so virtually any plant (wooden or non- wooden) can be used to extract nanocellulose. However, the general consensus is that non-wooden plants usually have a lower lignin content than wooden plants, thereby making them easier to delignify with the sim- plest nanocellulose extraction process. Biomass has already been used exten- sively in various water treatments. The most well-known example is activated carbon, which can be produced by aBenjamin Hsiao, Distinguished Professor from Stony Brook University provides an excellent overview of an aspect of chemistry that concerns sustainable water purification solutions from underutilised biomassChemistry: Sustainable water purification solutions from underutilised biomass250PROFILE variety of physical (e.g. thermal) and chemical processes.3Activated carbon materials are usually in the meso- porous or particulate forms and they are effective adsorbents for removing many contaminants, such as volatile organic compounds (taste and odour), synthetic organic chemicals and even some mineral ions from water. From an economic standpoint, the denser the biomass components, such ashard wood and coconut tree nut, the more suitable a source for making activated carbon. Recently, nanocellulose has also been shown as an effective sportive mate- rial with adsorption capacity often better than activated carbon for heavy metal removal from water because of the large surface area and functional sites. 4It is, thus, sensible to consider the use of nanocellulose, extracted from underutilised biomass sources, such as agriculture residues and inva- sive species that are mostly non- wooden plants, for water remediation. Furthermore, nanocellulose can be used as a barrier material to construct highly permeable water filtration mem- branes (e.g. microfiltration, ultrafiltra- tion and nanofiltration) with andlower fouling) over commercial mem- branes. 5Hereafter, we discuss three recent developments in nanocellulose extraction, nanocellulose adsorbents and nanocellulose mem- branes. Continuing advances in these technologies can lead to the realisation of our vision to provide low-cost and sustainable water purification solutions for the communities in most need. Low-cost nanocellulose extraction Nanocellulose, such as defibrillated cellulose nanofibers nanocrystals (CNC), as well as partially defibrillated microfibers,can be extracted from any biomass containing cellulose. Currently, commercially available nanocelluloseextraction processes are mainly based on technologies developed for using wooden plants in papermaking. These processes involve multiple steps such as pulping to convert wood into cellu- lose fibres and mechanical/chemical treatments to defibrillate the fibres. Suitable chemical treatments are particularly important as the resultingnanostructured surface can carry neg- atively charged ions, ideal to adsorb many positively charged contami- nants (such as toxic metals). Recently, a simple nitro-oxidation method has been demonstrated in our laboratory that can successfully prepare nanocel- lulose directly from raw biomass (jute, spinifex grass and bamboo) with a sig- nificant reduction in energy, water and chemical consumption. 6(Figure 1). As the logistics of collection, trans- portation and decortication for bio- fuel production are being addressed to deal with agricultural residues, the developments of new and simple chemistries, such as nitro-oxidation comparing the conventional TEMPO oxidation and nitro-oxidation methods to extract nanocellulose from untreated biomass251PROFILE vastly underutilised non-wooden plants in a cost-effective manner, are definitely within our reach. Nanocellulose adsorbents Nanocellulose is an effective sportive material because the surface cellulose chains are chemically modified to include carboxylate groups (-COO-) making them highly attractive to bind to heavy metal ions (e.g. lead, cadmium, mercury, chromium and uranyl). The maximum adsorption capacity of nanocellulose for heavymetal ion removal can be several times higher than those of the most effective adsorbents reported in the literature.The metal adsorbed nanocellulose flocs can also be easily removed by simple and inexpensive gravity-driven microfiltration or decanting methods, thus reducing the significantly added cost issue related to the removal of secondary contaminants. Besides toxic metal ions, nanocellulose is also effective to remove organic con- taminants, including ammonium ions. This property is particularly useful for nitrogen removal, the number one issue in wastewater treatments and land-based aquaculture, where theammonium adsorbed nanocellulose compound can be used directly as plant/crop fertilisers. Such an applica- tion will provide a new food-water- energy nexus to greatly improve the efficiency of the nitrogen cycle. Nanocellulose membranes Membrane technology remains the most energy-efficient method to remove contaminants (micron size particles to angstrom size hydrated ions) from water in large scale. Recently, nanofiber membranes based on nanocellulose, have exhib- ited better filtration performance (e.g. higher flux and lower fouling) than commercial membranes in microfil- tration, ultrafiltration and nanofiltra-tion (Figure 2). 7Better flux means less time to filter the same amount ofwater, which, in turn, decreases energy consumption and increases cost efficiency. Lower fouling meanshaving the ability to minimise clogging of the membrane pores by foreign matter, such as oil, detergents and biomacromolecules during filtration. We believe the current state of nanocellulose membrane technolo- gies is only in its infancy stage and the field will grow rapidly as these tech- nologies can take full advantage of the knowledge base on paper and packag- ing processes even though filtration membranes have very different property requirements from paper products, such as good wet strength, high porosity and controllable pore size. The combined nanocellulose membrane and adsorbent technolo- gies not only can provide sustainablesolutions to deal with many off-the-grid drinking water challenges, but also will offer new platforms to advance cost-efficient water treatment processes in large industrial scale.References 1 WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme on Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP), 2004. 2 A.

Understanding how well a key enzyme functions in a physiological process often reveals early signs of disease that has a long latency period. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of matrix-degrading enzymes broadly expressed in normal and pathological processes. Structural proteins, such as collagens, are major targets of MMPs. For example, wound healing involves blood vessel epithelial cell reorganisation which requires the degradation of the original matrix and formation of a new matrix. Upregulation of MMP activities is also commonly observed in cancer metastasis where inter-cell adhesion proteins are decomposed to facilitate tumour cell migration. Measuring MMP activities provides information on cancer devel- opment. (1) Synthetic peptide substrates are useful tools for MMP activity assays. A peptide substrate is designed to include consensus sequences that are recognised and cleaved by a specific MMP enzyme. The cleavage reaction rate is MMP activity-dependent and is determined via measuring the hydrolyzed product or unhydrolyzed substrate (or both). Though the concept is simple, there is one major limitationcaused by the way our body controls MMP activity: these enzymes are strongly regulated in the matrix. Therefore, MMP activities need to be, ideally, measured in the original sample matrix. Here, we report a novel integrated microfluidic device that can automat- ically determine enzyme activities that uses peptide substrates attached to a nanoparticle platform and isoelectric focusing (IEF) separation of the substrates after reaction with the enzymes. Magnetic nanoparticles used in this device can be easily dispersed and retrieved from liquid samples, such as blood. (Fig 1.). Cleav- able peptide substrates are bonded tomagnetic nanoparticles via a disulfide bond which is breakable in a reducing environment. The peptide is labelled with a fluorescent dye for the convenient optical detection. Peptide substrates are cleaved when exposed to MMP enzymes, the reaction rate of which depends on sample MMP activities. The workflow of the microfluidic device is illustrated (Fig 2.). Liquid samples such as blood or tissue fluids are collected for immediate analysis or storage at -20\u00b0C. Approximately 30 L of sample is added to the sample reservoir where the sample and the synthesised magnetic nanoparticles are mixed (Fig2-1). With a Neodymium magnet underneath the microchip, the nanoparticles are vortex mixed with the sample.

Under a pH gradient 3-10, the peptide standard is focused close to the low pH end (anode). This also demonstrates that peptides can be designed with an expected isoelectric point. This opens up possibilities to use multiple MMP substrates simultaneously with each substrate designed to be focused at different isoelectric points. References Bossmann, S.

Digested and undigested substrates show different isoelectric points and are separated into two narrow zones in the separation chan- nel (Fig 2-5). A laser-induced-fluores- cence detector scans the IEF channel and collects the fluorescence readout from the two focused peptide sub- strates. This microfluidic device has been integrated into a sample-in answer- out style workstation. (Fig 3.) The workstation consists of a minicom- puter, a linear scanning moving stage, a stationary laser-induced fluores-cence detector, a motorised magnet for on-chip nanoparticle manipulation and the microfluidic chip.

The wash channel contains physiological buffer that rinses off any MMP enzymes adsorbed on the nanoparticle surface to prevent further reaction and provides a clean sample for IEF. The nanoparticles are then transported into the IEF separation channel (Fig 2-4). The IEF separation channel contains reducing reagents that break the disulfide bonds connecting the substrates to the nano - particle surface.

Ecology is the study of organisms' relationships with each other and their environments; evolution draws upon the under-standing of these relationships to elucidate the processes by which organisms change over time andproduce observed patterns in biodiversity. While the term ecology did not exist at the time that Charles Darwin took his voyage on The Beagle, his comparisons of the ways in which organisms interacted with each other and their environments (i.e. ecology) laid the foundations for understanding natural selection as amajor force in evolution and patterns of biodiversity. In the decades since Darwin, technological advancement has transformed our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes, allowing researchers to discern mechanisms underlying biological patterns from globalto molecular scales. Over time, the elds of ecology and evolutionary biology have broadened and deepened, yet the fundamental nature of their interrelatedness continues to argue for them to progress side by side, as is evidenced by the many \"Ecology and Evolution\" programmes across universities worldwide. Accordingly, at the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Biological Sciences Directorate (BIO) provides research funding for core ecology and evolutionaryresearch through a single division, the Division of Envi- ronmental Biology (DEB). DEB supports research and training on evolutionary and ecological processes acting on organisms across multiple levels of organisation - from populations to ecosystems. DEB core programmes are organised into four research clusters - Evolutionary Processes, Systematicsand Biodiversity Sciences, Population and CommunityEcology and Ecosystem Sciences. In these core pro- grammes, innovative topics proposed by the researchcommunity comprise a diverse portfolio of researchprojects, fostering breakthroughs that can transform biology and disciplines beyond. For example, DEB has long supported epigenetics research, in which researchers examine the genome at the molecular level and seek to understand how it interacts with the environment to shape an observed organism's physical, behavioural and other biological traits. Epigenetics is now garnering increasing attention as we learn more about how the environment experienced by a parent can alter the genome and the traits of ospring, including humans. Epigenetics has been a high-prole topic for the Rules of Life theme within NSF's \"10 Big Ideas,\" drawing vibrant interdisciplinary research to exciting questions at the core of DEB research. Many of the transformative advances in evolution and biodiversity research have been propelled by the decreasing cost and increasing performance of genomic technologies; these approaches are now changingresearch throughout ecology as well. Genomic approaches not only add new dimensions to studies offamiliar organisms, such as plants and animals, but also constitute the only feasible mode of comprehensively researching the ecology and evolution of microbes. An explosion of research in all areas of biology focuses on the associations between microbes and larger, multicellular organisms. Most organisms, including humans, cannot survive without their microbial partners. DEB researchers are working to understand how microbiomes evolve and function in ecological and evolutionary processes. For example, bees are the most important pollinators of crops and other plants and are estimated to contribute at least $15 billion to U.S. crop production. Bees depend on their microbiomes to develop from larvae to adult, however, the normal microbial symbionts can be altered by pathogens, Stephanie E. Hampton, Division Director and George W. Gilchrist, Acting Deputy Division Director, at the National Science Foundation's Division of Environmental Biology, convey that now is a time of unprecedented opportunity for ecology and evolutionary biology BIOLOGY 255pesticides and invasive species. Researchers seek to characterise microbial diversity in flowers and pollen and then determine the nutritional role of those microbes in the development and health of larval bees . The goal is a comprehensive understanding of how bees and flowering plants interact via their shared microbial partners. Similarly, in virtually all plants, myc-orrhizal fungi play a unique role in providing essential nutrients for growth. Research enabled by genomic sequencing is being used to probe this symbiosis. This project will determine how mycorrhizal symbioses aect the diversity, productivity and composition of plant communities . A better understanding of these interactions will help scientists and land managers sustain robust and resilient ecosystems. Beyond these advances in core areas of ecology and evolutionary research, DEB partners with other NSFdivisions and agencies to promote interdisciplinary research at the cutting edge of environmental biology. For example, DEB initiated the Dimensions of Biodiver- sity program in 2010 with a plan to revolutionise our understanding of the origins, maintenance and conse- quences of biodiversity. DEB has partnered with the NSF Geosciences Directorate, NASA and international funding agencies to expand the scope of these projects, which now number over 100. One importantDimensions project focuses on explanation and pre - diction of the distribution of animal and plant species in the megadiverse Brazilian Atlantic forest . This work combines cutting edge remote sensing, fossil pollen studies, molecular genetics, physiological assays and modern-day to paleoclimatic data to demonstrate howthe biodiversity of the Atlantic forest evolved over time. The results identify specic factors that have generatedmuch of the biodiversity of this region, providing new insights for resource managers and conservation scientists in this critically endangered habitat. In recognition of both the need to address environmental questions at increasingly large scales and the tremen- dous potential of new technologies, BIOhas taken the bold step of creating the National Ecological Observatory Net- work (NEON), managed by NSF's Divisionof Biological Infrastructure. NEON's network of instrumentation providesdata to researchers in ecology, evolution and allied disciplines. NEON is designed to provide open access for scientists, educators, resource managers, pol- icymakers and members of the general public interested in forecasting the impacts of climate change, land-use change and invasive species on ecological systems. In 81terrestrial and aquatic sites across the nation, data are collected on select variables ranging from the biodiver- sity of native and invasive species to elemental chemistry and gas flux, genomics and disease occurrence. The NEON system is strategically designed to address envi-ronmental questions for which a coordinated network of standardised observations is particularly eective. In 2019, the construction was completed and the Observa- tory moved into full operations, poised to scale up our understanding of the Earth's systems to a degree never before possible. Stephanie E.

This article follows the personal journey of someone who, after com- pleting a PhD studying chromosomes, discovered that her firstborn had a chromosome rearrangement. For most families with a child displaying significant developmental delay, chro- mosome analysis (karyotyping) is the first test they encounter. First applied clinically in the 1970s, the report pro-vides a picture resembling matching pairs of stripy socks. An extra sock number 21 would indicate Down syndrome for instance. Our chromo- somes contain our genes, our genes make our proteins and proteins build every part of us. If a chromosome, or even part of one, is extra or missing, this presents a problem. Every family's case is unique. This is Katie and Brandon's. July 2012: Brandon's parents were called to a meeting with the Lead Genetic Consultant to discuss results of the \"DNA microarray\" test taken threemonths earlier. Since birth, Brandon had gained a mere 1.8kg despite Total Parental Nutrition delivered directly to his bloodstream 24 hours a day; a perpetual struggle to get this five month old baby to just 10lb. He'd had tests for: Cystic Fibrosis (life-expectancy tests (life-expectancy 30 years), Erythema Elevatum Diutinum (requiring a 5mm puncture wound through each layer of skin), ulcerative colitis (two endoscopies under general anaesthetic with multiple gastrointestinal biopsies), heart defects (ECG and ultrasound imag-ing), gastrointestinal motility disorder (multiple x-rays following a barium feed). Not to mention daily blood tests and four-hourly blood glucose heel-pricks. The geneticist explained that Brandon had a small deletion and a duplication on chromosome number 1 (arising while he was still an embryo). No other children had been recorded with this specific condition meaning no-one knew what this might entail for Brandon's future, or his life-expectancy. Microarray results don't look like socks. They contain more precise information as to whether a piece of chromosome is extra or missing. From her PhD training, Katie knew exactlywhat Brandon's result \"1q42.3q43x3, 1q43q44x1\" meant in scientific terms; she was only just beginning to learn however that a clear diagnosis wasthe key to accessing essential support services, therapies and government benefits. Professionals like Katie can search databases to find similar reported cases, or trawl through hundreds of case-studies looking for links between patients; this is however more challenging for most families. Ultimately, even if two individuals have identical rearrangements, they may have vastly different symptoms and life prospects. Dr Katie Finch discusses with Professors Darren Griffin and Alan Thornhill her personal journey involving genetic testing of her son BrandonGenetic testing: What's wrong with my child? 256PROFILE Image: Nicola Rare chromosome conditions para- doxically are collectively common,affecting >400,000 children per year globally. Several professional and academic databases record these rare genomes but they can't always translate into useful information for families. The international organisa- tion Unique (www.rarechromo.org ) supports, informs and networks with families and professionals translatingmedical terminology and genetic results to families while sharing acces- sible stories. For many chromosome conditions, Unique has created com- prehensive guides and can connect families with similar genomes for mutual advice and support. The specific guide for Brandon's condition highlighted an increased prevalenceof flaws in midline brain development and associated seizures. Had Katie seen this guide in 2012, she would have been forewarned that her baby's eyes might roll into the back of his head, his body go limp and his lips turn blue as she held him. She could have learned how to deal with seizures before the first one happened. It's important to remember that having a genetic result does not always trans- late to a specific diagnosis or named condition. The UK's SWAN organisation (Syndrome Without AName was established to support families where a child or young adult is believed to have a genetic condition but testing has failed to identify its cause. SWAN suggests that around 6,000 children with a genetic condition likely to remain undiagnosed are born every year in the UK alone. So, where do we go from here? What if an anomaly isn't detected in a child with a condition, or, even if it is, what if the genes affected don't match the symptoms? The Deciphering Developmental Disorders(DDD) project began in2011 and has decoded precise genetic sequences in genomes of >13,500 families within the UK's 24 Regional Genetics Services. Of the 6,000 children born with complex needs and no diagnosis, one-third will die before their fifth birthday. Questions have recently been raised regarding newborn screening since only nine diseases are screened for in the UK compared to 25-50 in most high- income countries. The rare disease community and Genetic Alliance have asked the UK Government to re-eval- uate its newborn screening strategy. The cost to the NHS of extending services, perhaps to whole genome sequencing, would undoubtedly be significant because, while sequencing costs continue to decrease, the cost to collate information and translate this appropriately to families is high in an already stretched service. Conversely, the potential for massive savings in neonatal and paediatric care is compelling by targeting diagnoses rather than simply testing for the most common disease first in an often fruit- less, expensive and soul-destroyingsuccession of tests - the so-called \"diagnostic odyssey\". In a society where whole genome screening can be ordered over the internet, it should be possible. Finally, what does a genetic diagnosis mean for families affected by chromo- some disorders? For some, it means that they can meet others in similar situations, learn from one another and be part of a wider community in a world that often excludes people who look or act differently. For Brandon, it means that his healthcare team can review other cases and pre- empt his future medical requirements; they can prepare other families that children with this particular re - arrangement often have seizures andcomplex learning difficulties. Katie can seek support and provide it to others with similar rearrangements. Compre- hensive genetic testing gives some families an answer they have previously sought in vain. It can give families the confidence to talk about their child's condition and answer that question that parents of children with addi-tional needs regularly hear: \"What's wrong with your child?\" Rather than an awkward silence or embarrassed hunt for the right words, a parent can confidently reply: \"Nothing, but he does have a bit of chromosome 1 muddled up, which makes him a little different to other kids\". 257PROFILE Darren K Griffin Professor of Genetics University of Kent, School of Biosciences Tel: +44 (0)779 302 8711 d.k.griffin@kent.ac.ukhttps://www.kent.ac.uk/biosciences/ people/1244/griffin-darren www.twitter.com/darrenkgriffin Alan R Professor of Reproductive Genetics and Country Manager Igenomix UKUniversity of Kent, School of Biosciences and Igenomix UK Limited Tel: +44 (0)7780 499 617 alan.thornhill@igenomix.com https://www.igenomix.com Katie A Finch Rare Chromosome Condition Advocate and Principal Senior Embryologist Bourn Hall Fertility Clinic Katie.finch@bourn-hall.com https://www.bournhall.co.uk/ www.twitter.com/drkatiefinchHuman evolution and unique features of the human brain, can be traced to archaic chem- ical processes that began to appear over 600 million years ago. Amino-acid based molecules known as peptides, capable of reducing dehydration,allowed animals to move from aquatic environments to dry land. Particularly relevant to the evolution of modern mammals are two small peptides, oxytocin and vasopressin. Of these, vasopressin is more ancient. Oxytocin appeared much more recently and is central to the traits that define modern mammals. Both oxytocin and vasopressin tunethe central nervous system, setting the neurobiological stage for adaptive patterns of physiology and behaviour. Vasopressin is associated with anxiety and defensive behaviours, increases blood pressure and allows mobilisation in the face of danger. Oxytocin permits mammals to overcome the fear of others and use social relationships and cognition to cope with challenges and trauma. These biochemical building blocks and their receptors are foundations for mammalian sexuality, birth, lactation and the capacity to adapt in an ever-changing environment. The same molecules that protect our bodies and allow reproduction, also facilitate ourcapacity to form social bonds anddefend ourselves and those for whom we care. Chemistry and bonding Oxytocin and vasopressin are partners in a dynamic biochemical dance. Both consist of nine amino acids with 6 amino acid rings that are held together by disulfide bonds (Figure 1). Oxytocin influences the functions of vasopressin and vice versa, in part because these peptides are capable of binding to each other's receptors. Most of the oxytocin and vasopressin in the bodyis synthesised in the brain. However, receptors sensitive to these peptides are found throughout the body giving these molecules a central role in coor- dinating many physiological functions. Other hormones including gonadal and adrenal steroids also regulate both peptides and their receptors. When better understood, the interactions among these will likely help explain much of their biological versatility, ranging from the bonds formed between molecules to the selective relationships found in society. Do oxytocin and vasopressin help to explain human nature? Oxytocin played a central role in the evolution of the mammalian nervous system and may lie beneath the sur- face of several mysteries associated with human existence. Both the birth of a baby and releasing milk are facilitatedby oxytocin's effects on muscles. In the postnatal period mothers (or compara- ble caretakers) provides milk and nur- ture to the dependent newborn. Falling in love with a baby also appears to be facilitated by oxytocin in both males and females. Bonding to an infant can occur in the absence of birth or lactation, providing several layers of physical and emotional support for the newborn. The human experiences of orgasm and, in males, ejaculation also are facilitated by oxytocin, possibly reinforcing adult social bonds. Unique human traits including com- plex social cognition and language rely on the functions of the human cortex. The cortex requires a sophisticatedautonomic nervous system and highlevels of oxygen. The autonomic ner- vous system is dynamically regulated by both oxytocin and vasopressin, with abundant peptide receptors in the brainstem. Vasopressin is a stress hormone, while oxytocin is of particular impor-tance in \"stress-coping,\" encouraging a sense of safety that allows positivesocial interactions even during periods of adversity and trauma. Across the lifespan, oxytocin may modulate emotional reactivity and increase social sensitivity. During mammalian development, variations on these same moleculesDr Sue Carter, Director, Emerita of The Kinsey Institute, argues that emotionally powerful social behaviours are built upon primal functions in her fascinating discussion concerning peptide pathways to human evolutionA focus on biology: Peptide pathways to human evolution 258PROFILEhelp physically sculpt the brain, heart and other tissues. Oxytocin can heal wounds and has therapeutic conse- quences throughout the body. For example, oxytocin appears to be a protective factor against cardiovascu- lar disease, possibly by reducing inflammation and blood pressure, while vasopressin generally has opposite effects. A mother's body is physically remod- elled in part by oxytocin, eventually allowing birth. Oxytocin stimulates smooth muscles, such as those in the uterus, creating rhythmic contractions that are associated with sex and birth. Oxytocin is of special importance to humans, in which infants have com- paratively large heads and commu- nicative faces. Oxytocin plays a majorrole in the innervation of the face and facilitates social communication. Oxytocin physically and functionallyshapes the neocortex, allowing a nervous system capable of language and social cognition. Oxytocin also is analgesic and protects both mother and infant from pain and the memory of pain associated with childbirth.Oxytocin functions in conjunction with other molecules, including dopamine and opioids, to transform experiences from pain to pleasure and to reduce the consequences of traumatic stress. Although characterised initially as a \"female reproductive hormone,\" it is now clear that oxytocin acts in both sexes. In contrast, vasopressin, espe- cially in brain regions associated with defence, is regulated by androgens and of particular importance in males. Both sexes use changes in the vaso- pressin system to adapt to threatening experiences, but there is increasing evi- dence that males are more sensitive to vasopressin than females. Males may show a more mobilised response to danger, while females tend to respond to apparently similar stressors withimmobilisation or anxiety. Depression and a tendency to emotionally shut- ting-down after a traumatic experience are two to four times more likely in females than males. Vasopressin cansupport active defensive behaviours and lowers thresholds to aggression. Itis also possible that sex differences in aggression and reactions to infants areat least partially due to sex differences in sensitivity to vasopressin and oxytocin. Pathways to peace In a world torn by fear and violence, it is easy to forget that humans are the primates that rely most strongly for their survival on social relationships. Knowledge of the roots of both peace and war are critical to our future as aspecies. The deeply-buried secrets at the core of human evolution are only now being uncovered. Understanding the actions of peptides and especially oxytocin is offering new perspectives into the physiological and evolutionary origins of what it means to be human. This knowledge also suggests pathways through which we may optimise human health andwellbeing. Suggested reading Carter, C. S. 2014. Oxytocin pathways and the evolution of human behavior .

VasopressinDisulfide bond ProCysTyr D , a hormone found in some foods and produced by the body after exposure to the sun, is important to our health in many ways: it helps the body build and maintain strong bones, plays a role in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation and helps our nervous system develop and carry messages from the brain to cells throughout the body. Vitamin D also helps the immune system ght o invading bacteria and viruses. Vitamin D in Pregnancy Vitamin D deciency during pregnancy has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes and may predisposewomen to gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. However, according to a recent NICHD study , sucient levels of vitamin D before conception may play a protective role in pregnancy. Insucient vitamin D levels were linked to miscarriage among women with a prior pregnancy loss. Researchers analysed data from about 1,200 women during preconception, attempting pregnancy and throughout the pregnancy. The study tracked time to pregnancy, pregnancy loss and live births. About half of the women enrolled in the study had sucient vitamin D levels, while a little more than half had insucient concentrations. Amongwomen planning to conceive after a pregnancy loss, Vitamin D boosts maternal and child health Dr Andrew Bremer, a Paediatric Endocrinologist and Chief of the Pediatric Growth and Nutrition Branch at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, details NICHD-supported research on vitamin D in pregnancy and early childhood developmentBIOLOGY 261those who had sucient levels of vitamin D were more likely to become pregnant and have a live birth, according to the analysis. Another study linked vitamin D levels during pregnancy to birth weight and bone size of infants. Researchers found that among women who were overweight orobese before pregnancy, low vitamin D concentrations in both early and late pregnancy impacted fetal devel-opment. Considering that almost half of U.S. women entering pregnancy are overweight or obese, the authors wrote, prevention of low vitamin D concentrations inearly and late pregnancy may optimise fetal growth. Vitamin D in childhood Scientists continue to discover new ways vitamin D supports health. A recent study found that infants or young children with low levels of vitamin D may have a risk of high blood pressure later in childhood or ado- lescence. Researchers analysed data from 775 children enrolled at birth in a long-term study of obesity risk factors. The children were followed until the age of 18.Researchers measured vitamin D levels from blood samples taken at birth and in early childhood. The children's systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) was taken annually from ages three through 18. Children with a low vitamin D level at birth had a 38% higher risk for elevated systolic blood pressure at ages six through 18, compared to children with a sucient vitamin D level at birth. Children with a low vitamin Dlevel at ages 1 to 3 had a nearly 60% higher risk of ele- vated systolic pressure from ages 3 to 18. If the studyresults are conrmed, treating pregnant women and young children for vitamin D deciency may help reduce the risk of high blood pressure later in life. Given the many functions of vitamin D and the association of vitamin D deciency with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases, among otherhealth complications, ensuring Vitamin D suciency inthe population is a public health priority. Moreover, the association between maternal vitamin D status and health outcomes for the mother and her ospring highlight the potential ill-eects of vitamin Dinsuciency through the generations.

We all know from experience that struggling to create something such as a working radio, a meal or even the cheque book balance can reveal strengths and weaknesses in our understanding. Almost all the machines and tools we use, from corkscrews to cell phones to rockets highlight our understanding of non-living, physical and chemical systems. On the other hand, despite millennia of observing the living world, human-built living devices do not exist - or at least not until recently. That is about to change now, as a new generation of scientists started engineering biology, establish- ing the new field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biologists aim to create artificial biological systems for specific purposes by modifying and assembling the molecular components of living cells in new ways. It all started with two scientific papers in 2000 Nature 403(6767):335-42 (2000) reporting on switches and oscillators constructed from genes. These new \"gene circuits\" did not just emerge from trial and error: their capabilities were mathematically predictable. In other words, the gene circuits had designable behaviours, just like engi- neers design new machines on paperor within a computer beforehand. Many other gene circuits followed, including pulse detectors, light sen- sors, counters, memory devices, dim- mers and logic gates Nature ReviewsMicrobiology 12, 381-390 (2014) . As the complexity and number of such bio- logical devices increased, discussions and hopes about their potential uses intensified, including medical and industrial applications. The hope for practical applications stimulated the emergence of a second branch of synthetic biology, focused on metabolic engineering and bioproduct fabrica-tion, starting with the successful synthesis of an otherwise expensive anti-malarial drug precursor, by moving appropriate plant genes into bacteria and then yeast in 2003 and 2006 Nature 440(7086):940-3 (2006). A third branch emerged as well, aimed to synthesise and edit entire genomes. Whole-genome engineering started with viruses, then continuedwith bacteria and Science 351 (6280):aad6253 (2016); Science 355(6329): 1040-4 (2017) , reflecting the increasing ease of DNA synthesis. From these achievements, it is conceivable thatfully synthetic human genomes will eventually follow, although it is unclear when. The three branches of synthetic biology have somewhat different goals, meth- ods and promises. Closest to mindful engineering is perhaps novel gene circuit development, which relies most on mathematics for design and performance prediction. The other two branches (metabolic and whole- genome engineering) are closer to automation and tend to rely on biotechnology more than mathematics. In Feynman's terms, gene circuit devel- opment exemplifies human creation ofnovel bio-devices, whereas the other two branches are closer to recreating, copying nature's own, existing designs. Practical benefits from gene circuit development may be less straight - forward and farther-away than the benefits from the other two branches, which are already enabling the cost- effective synthesis of pharmaceuticals, biofuels and cosmetics and are attracting the attention of industry and start-ups. Nonetheless, we will focus here on synthetic gene circuits, to increase public understanding of how they work and appreciation of why they may be important. Gene circuit development relies on the ability to cut, copy and paste DNA, the stringy hereditary material of every living cell containing a code written in four letters: A, C, T, G. Each gene is a piece of DNA, carrying the code the cell uses to produce one of its thousands of proteins. The types and amounts of proteins present in a cell determine what the cell does - whether it sits in specific tissues or moves away, whether it resists external stresses, or whether it produces certain biochemical compounds. Adding, deleting or editing a gene adds, removes or alters the corresponding protein, respectively. However, modifying certain genes can have indirect effects: besides the pro-tein they encode, the levels of some other proteins will change. Typically, these indirectly-acting genes encode transcription factor proteins that bind to promoter regions near other genesG\u00e1bor Bal\u00e1zsi, Ph.D. from the Louis and Beatrice Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology and the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Stony Brook University in the U.S., shares his perspective on the field of synthetic biology in terms of the past, present and future 262PROFILE \"Synthetic biology: Past, present and futureto either promote (activate) or slow (repress) their protein synthesis. Pair- ing such genes and the corresponding promoters in new, artificial configura- tions enables connecting them in pre- designed ways, creating gene circuits. For example, pairing a gene with a promoter it represses gives rise to a simple negative feedback gene circuit that can be used to precisely control cellular protein levels Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 106(13):5123-8 (2009). Pairing a gene with a promoter repressed by another gene and vice versa results in a genetic toggle switch Nature 403 (6767):335-42 (2000) . To become functional, the DNA sequence of gene circuits must be introduced into living cells that can make the proteins corresponding to each gene. Biotechnology is increasingly capable of manipulating DNA strings. Currently, the most exciting advances in biotech- nology involve precisely cutting, editing, writing and reassembling DNA sequences. Longer and longer synthetic DNA pieces can be ordered for falling prices, meaning that gene circuit engineering is simpler and more accessible by the day. However,the ability to reliably predict the capa- bilities and robustness of newly assembled synthetic gene circuits hasnot kept pace. Unlike in electronics where circuit components are typically standardised, with known tolerances and error rates, little of that holds for genetic components. Part of the problem is biological knowledge gaps - we still do not know exactly the function of each stretch of DNA sequence. More- over, even known DNA functions can change depending on the host cell's genome or the environment. Efforts have been underway to simplify gene circuit sequences, min- imise host genomes and standardise genetic parts to eliminate some ofthat uncertainty, making gene circuit behaviour predictable by engineeringsoftware. However the exact details we aim to predict matter - it is unlikelythat we can predict the levels of every protein in every single cell, despite their importance. Second, even if gene circuit function is predictable in some precisely-defined cell type and envi- ronment, the predictions may fall apart as soon as one of these factors (such as cell type) changes. Third, the behaviour of the initially intact gene circuit may change as mutations ran- domly arise, as they inevitably do in nature. Overall, major challenges await to be addressed before synthetic biology can deliver on some of its promises. Once some of these difficulties are resolved, future opportunities for synthetic gene circuits are abundant, almost infinite - considering the immense number of cell types and possible applications. Gene circuits can sense and report on almost anything that happens inside living cells or can act as control knobs that allow humans to interact with cells and drive cell behaviours. Knowing what cells do and manipulat ing their behaviour could revolutionise cell, tissue and organ transplantation and engineering, stem cell- and immuno therapies, aswell as gene therapies. It could alsoaid environmental remediation, bio- material synthesis and biofuel pro duc- tion and it can contribute to cosmic travel and defence applications. Supporting basic synthetic gene circuit research is crucial to enable the future advances we desire. Currently, gene circuit development is the branch of synthetic biology that could lead to the broadest range of applica- tions from medicine to ecology to agriculture. Yet, the interest of the private sector in gene circuits is modest because the deliverables are less immediate than for metabolic engineering and bioproduct synthe- sis. While some nationwide funding initiatives for basic synthetic biology research exist, such as the UK's Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) prioritisingG\u00e1bor Bal\u00e1zsi, gabor.balazsi@stonybrook.eduhttp://laufercenter.stonybrook.edu/ people/faculty 263the field, the U.S. Office of Naval Research or the NSF-funded multi- university consortium Synberc, they are insufficient and do not distinguish between the three branches of syn- thetic biology. Since the area is still young, it is difficult to recruit reviewers for synthetic biology proposals. Syn- thetic biology proposals submitted to national funding agencies are typically reviewed by panels of traditional biol- ogists, along with traditional biology grants, leading to low success rates. This situation is unlikely to change unless definite, unorthodox steps are taken to support this highly promising field, especially the design and basic, quantitative characterisation of synthetic gene circuits, which has attracted less industrial interest and support than the other branches of synthetic biology. Overall, synthetic gene circuits could be exactly the tools we will need to address many societal challenges we will be increasingly facing - including ageing, cancer, drug-resistant microbes, environmental pollution - but whether we will have these tools when such challenges truly arise depends on what we do right now.BIOLOGY 264The role of vitamin D in pregnancy Vitamin D is a steroid vitamin from a group of fat-soluble prohormones. There is no doubt that it's important in pregnancy and expecting moth- ers need to make sure they get the recommended amounts of vitamin D during pregnancy for both their own well-being and the healthy development of their baby. Research has demonstrated it to be safe and eective for both mother and baby and as most of us are vitamin D decient, daily dosages are recommended. The aver- age prenatal supplement contains 400 units of this, butit is recommended that women who are at particularly high risk should take at least 100 units per day. Women who are more at risk of pre-eclampsia, such as thosewho are older, obese, have hypertension or have suf- fered from previous pre-eclampsia, those carryingtwins, those with a history of diabetes, or those who conceived via IVF (in particular with donor eggs) should take a recommended dose of 800 units per day as perthe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). Vitamin D is benecial for both the mother's and baby's wellbeing. The most well-recognised benet is improving bone health. However, it also has an increas- ingly recognised repertoire of nonclassical actions, such as promoting insulin action and secretion, immune modulation and lung development. It, there- fore, has the potential to influence many factors in the developing foetus. Many studies are nding a connec-tion between low serum vitamin D levels and an increased risk of certain types of cancers, autoimmune disease, neurological disease, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. More specically in pregnancy, Vitamin D supplementa- tion has been shown to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsiaand low birth weight. Low vitamin D levels in late preg- nancy were associated with reduced intrauterine long bone growth and lower gestational age at delivery. Adequate levels of Vitamin D in pregnancy were also found to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes, caesarean section and bacterial vaginosis, as well as potentially postpartum haemorrhage. It may also pro-tect against low calcium in the neonate and seizures due to this, especially in women who are South Asian. \"Vitamin D containing foods can help to improve vitamin levels in someone who is deficient. Research also suggests sensible sun exposure (usually 5-10 minutes of exposure of the arms and legs or the hands, arms and face, two or three times per week) can help as well.\" At this time, 40-60% of the entire UK population is vita- min D decient, including pregnant women. Those most at risk are those with pigmented skin, those who are overweight and being pregnant during the Winter andSpring months. Pre-pregnancy obesity has been associ- ated with lower levels of vitamin D in both pregnant women and their neonates; 61% of women who were obese (body mass index [BMI] 30) prior to pregnancy were found to be vitamin D decient, compared to 36%of women with a pre-pregnancy BMI of less than 25. Vitamin D is found in egg yolk, salmon and cod liver oil; however, most vitamin D is consumed through fortied foods like milk. For 75% of the population that is lactose intolerant, fortied milk products are not a reliable source of vitamin D consumption. Age, how much time you spend outdoors, pollution and having a healthy gut are all factors that aect the amount of vitamin D in our bodies. Dr Larisa Corda Obstetrician and Gynaecologist shares her expert thoughts here on the role of vitamin D in pregnancyBIOLOGY 265Vitamin D containing foods can help to improve vita- min levels in someone who is decient. Research alsosuggests sensible sun exposure (usually 5-10 minutes of exposure of the arms and legs or the hands, arms and face, two or three times per week) can help as well. \"Vitamin D is beneficial for both the mother's and baby's wellbeing. The most well-recognised benefit is improving bone health. However, it also has an increasingly recognised repertoire of nonclassical actions, such as promoting insulin action and secretion, immune modulation and lung development.\" However, the best way to really ensure adequate vitamin D is through simple supplementation. When supple-menting, your choices will be between two forms of vita- min D. Ergocalciferol is the vegetarian form of vitamin D and cholecalciferol is the animal-sourced form, usually derived from sh liver oil or lanolin from sheep. There are no data to support routine screening for vitamin D deciency in pregnancy in terms of healthbenets or cost- eectiveness. There is an argument that some groups of women who are pregnant should have a screening test: for example, on the basis of skin colour or coverage, obesity, risk of pre-eclampsia, or gastroenterological conditions limiting fat absorption. Generally speaking, as Vitamin D is safe, universally oering it to all pregnant women has been approved by the RCOG. Dr Larisa Corda Obstetrician and Gynaecologist www.drlarisacorda.comwww.twitter.com/DrLarisaTV www.instagram.com/DrLarisaCorda An individual's experiences during early life can influence their risk for disease as an adult. Dr. David Barker first postulated this in the 1980s following his observations that infants born with low birth weight were at significantly increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease as adults. This idea was controversial at the time because it challenged theconventional thinking that unhealthy lifestyle was the primary cause of cardiovascular disease. However, subsequent epidemiologic studies confirmed Barker's findings and the concept that early-life experiences are an important determinant of adult disease risk became known as the \"Barker hypothesis\". While the Barker hypothesis was derived from evidence linking foetal malnutrition to cardiovascular disease risk in adulthood, the concept hassince expanded to include a broader spectrum of risk factors, diverse disease states targeting different organ systems, and developmental periods extending beyond gestation. In recognition of this paradigm shift,the Barker hypothesis was renamed the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. Several decades of DOHaD research have identified at least four categoriesof early-life risk factors: the nutritional status of the pregnant woman and young child, psychosocial stress, immunological stress, particularlyinfection during pregnancy, and chemical exposures. It is now also appreciated that the risk of most, if not all, adult-onset diseases are influenced by early-life stress, but only if expo- sures occur during specific periods of development. These high-risk periods are referred to as \"critical periods\" or \"critical windows of development\",and these vary depending on the early-life insult and the target organ. For many organ systems, however, the foetal period is the primary critical window. The nervous system is particularly vulnerable to early-life stressors, perhaps because human brain development continues after birth, throughout early childhood and into adolescence. To date, research supports an association betweenearly-life environmental insults and increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, demyeli- nating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD, respectively). Whether an early-life stressor increases an individual's risk for neuropsychiatric or neurologic disease depends on numerous factors. What is the type and magnitude of thestressor? Is the insult continuous, intermittent, or a single isolated inci-dent? What is the timing of exposure relative to critical windows of develop- ment, which vary across different brain regions? Does the affected individual carry genes that confer increased susceptibility or increased resistance to the adverse effects of the stressor? Sex also influences theCarolyn R. Klocke and Pamela J. Lein discuss how an individual's experiences during early life can influence their risk for disease as an adultEnvironmental exposures during early life influence adult disease risk 266PROFILE impacts of early-life stressors, per- haps because gonadal sex hormones influence many of the organisational aspects of neurodevelopment. Examining the sex-specificity of early- life stressors may be important for understanding why many neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases exhibit a sex bias in their incidence and clinical profile. Maternal infection during pregnancyis strongly linked to increased risk of schizophrenia, though it does notappear that any specific pathogen or class of pathogens is responsible. While there is disagreement as to whether a specific trimester of preg- nancy is most vulnerable, the pro- inflammatory environment created by maternal infection is thought to alter the pattern of cellular connections made in the foetal brain, laying the groundwork for altered behavior in adulthood. Emerging evidence also suggests that early-life exposure to the lead (Pb) may increase risk for schizophrenia, particularly in individ- uals that express a mutation in the disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC-1) gene, a gene that is strongly associ- ated with schizophrenia and related mental disorders. AD is the most common cause of progressive demen- tia in elderly adults and it is rapidly increasing in global incidence; PD is the second most common neurode- generative disease after AD. Only a small percentage of cases of either disease can be attributed to solely genetic causes, supporting a role for environmental factors in determiningindividual risk. Recent studies have identified early-life risk factors for AD and PD, including low birth weight,premature birth, living in a rural area, low socioeconomic status duringchildhood, and prenatal or early child- hood exposures to environmental pollutants, including heavy metals, pesticides, and air pollution. Air pollu- tion has also been linked to an increased risk of MS. A key question in the field is how do early-life events influence risk of adult-onset disease? It is believed that environmental stressors disrupt the organisational patterning and/or function of the developing brain by altering cell numbers or interfering with the differentiation of neurons orglial cells. So why do these changes not manifest as functional deficits or disease until adulthood? One explana-tion is that the affected cells are not functional until later in life. For example, exposure of the developing brain to high concentrations of the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG) causes excessive death of neurons in the hypothalamus by triggering apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death. However, functional deficits associated with thefoetal loss of these hypothalamic neu- rons (hypogonadism and infertility) become evident only in adolescence when the neuroendocrine function of these neurons is normally activated. Alternatively, the adverse impacts of the early-life stressor are masked or initially attenuated due to compen- satory mechanisms or plasticity of the brain. However, these developmental perturbations predispose the individ-ual to neural deficits following subse- quent insults, such as chemical exposure, disease, or aging due to decreased brain reserve capacity. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in both animal models and humansfollowing developmental exposures tomethyl mercury or pesticides.In summary, the experimental evidence indicates that early-life insults can fundamentally change the trajectory of brain development, thereby dimin- ishing the ability of the brain to pro- tect against subsequent insults, which increases susceptibility to disease in adulthood. A significant challenge in the field is to identify early-life stres- sors that increase adult-onset disease in humans. Detecting effects in the human population is difficult because the effects do not manifest until well after the developmental exposure. However, the effort to identify these associations merits investment of research dollars because preventing disease by identifying and reducing or eliminating risk factors is more effec- tive than treating disease in terms of both individual and societal costs.

There are many more families out on day trips - so instead of newspapers, laptops and relative silence, there are comics, tablets and the wonderful sound of children's voices. Working in the eld of children's communication development, I know that parents' role in helping children to develop language iskey, so I'm always interested to see how much parentstalk with their children. Given the amount of time children spend at home compared to a nursery or at school, it's probably not surprising that parents are so important in their chil-dren's language development. But studies have shown that the way in which parents speak with their children can predict how procient they become as a commu- nicator. It also impacts on how well they do at school. One large-scale project which followed up children from pre-school into school found that what parents and carers do makes a real dierence to children's development ; activities such as reading to children, teaching songs, taking them on visits and creating regular opportunities to play with friends at home were linked to improved learning. On my journey into work during August, I see this rst-hand. Where families are in open conversation with their children, pointing things out, asking and answering questions their children are fully engagedand often exploring new words. It is a pleasure to sit and observe. Many of you reading this may be thinking - that's obvious, isn't it? Well, you'd think so, but it often isn't the case. In 2018, I CAN the children's communication charity, with the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists produced a report, Bercow: Ten Years On .This reported on the ndings of a review of provisionfor children and young people with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN). One of the key nd- ings was a lack of public awareness of the importance of children's communication and language. In a surveycarried out as part of the review, 77% of parents who were worried about their child's speech and language diculties felt that the information they needed was either not available or dicult to nd and in a further survey, nearly half of parents did not know what to expect their child to be saying at age two. It's now a well-known fact that many children don't develop the language skills they need to start school. In a survey of school leaders about school readiness, children's poor speech and language was the biggestconcern with 97% of respondents identifying this as a problem and 47% saying it was the most signicant. In fact, robust studies show that in some areas of the UKaround 50% of children start school with delayed language. That's a signicant number: half the children in some classrooms nding it hard to sit and listen, withonly a handful of words, unable to string a sentencetogether. There is now more and more known about how important children's language is at age ve. It's the single most important factor in their reading at age 11 and can predict exam results at school leaving age. Children need good language skills to learn, so having poor language puts children on the backfoot right from the start. But there is some good news. The fact that parents play an important role in young children's language development has not gone unno- ticed. In the summer of 2018, Damian Hinds - then theBob Reitemeier, Chief Executive of I CAN, focuses on the crucial role of parents' in helping children to develop languageEDUCATION 269Secretary of State for Education, announced that the number of children starting school with poor commu- nication was unacceptable. He made it his ambition to half that number over the next ten years and theDepartment for Education launched a campaign to help change the home learning environment , with an accompanying website for parents, called Hungry Little Minds . \"Given the amount of time children spend at home compared to a nursery or at school, it's probably not surprising that parents are so important in their children's language development.\" National campaigns such as the National Literacy Trust's Small Talk, the BBC's Tiny Happy People or Hungry Little Minds are providing much-needed infor-mation to parents and carers. Locally, there are many examples of excellent information and resources, for example in Nottinghamshire , Warwickshire , Stoke or Worcestershire . Often dierent parents want information in dierent formats so at I CAN, we are exploring a range of waysto support parents in communities across England. We are leading a Department for Education funded project called Change the Conversation about Language which combines workshops with parents, a network of parent champions and an accessible App so that fam- ilies have a choice of how they get the information theyneed and want. Our Talking Point website is a one-stop shop of really practical information with an online tool for parents to monitor the progression of their child's early talking, listening and understanding. For parents wanting to speak with someone more directly, our free enquiry line provides the opportunity to speak with an experienced speech and language therapist. It is often said that being a parent is the toughest job in the world. For rst-time parents, one of the reasons it is so tough, especially in the very early days, is the enormous sense of responsibility that comes with the birth of a child. It can also be the best job in the world and one way to make it so, is by helping parents under-stand how they can positively influence their child's development. Encouraging language, starting as early as when the child is in the womb, is one very important element of human development, so let's work together to spread the word - literally! Bob of I CANChildren around the world acquire their native language, or languages, without the need for explicit formal teaching. Yet children vary in how well they manage this task in comparison to their age mates. Children's language continues to grow during childhood as they acquire sentence structures, gram- matical elements to mark case,person, tense, agreement of subject and verb, vocabulary, and a host of other details. Some children are behind at the beginning but catch up to their peers by four or five years of age; other children continue to trail behind their peers into adulthood, leaving them with less robust lan- guage abilities for negotiating life's educational demands, interactions with unfamiliar people, and employ-ment positions. Most of this group of children have a language disorder that delays the mastery of language in children who have no hearing loss or other developmental delays, known as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) (1,2). SLI is likely to be undetected by parents and teachers, given the lack of an obvious cause of the condition. This means that a primary need is forhow to identify children with SLI. Once identified, children should receive help to overcome their limitations in learning a language. Robust language skills for every child are robust assets for the individuals to contribute totheir families and their societies to the benefit of others and themselves. Around the world, solutions to these needs and increased likelihood of a good life for all children depend on a careful scientific study across languages of the children's pathways into their native languages. Detection of how one child is different from others of his or her own age requires an understanding of how children master different language skills at different ages. In turn, this knowledge requires a good understanding of the details of each language and similarities across languages. Much of the available research is based on English-speaking children, although there are rapid advances underway in documenting how children acquire many of the world's major languages. The ultimate objective is to provide guidance for the development of effective teaching practices to assistchildren who do not acquire language as easily as their age peers, in order to prepare them for a productive life as an adult. Although this may seem to be obvious, perhaps just a matter of insisting a child talk better or for adults to talk more to a child. Neitherof these approaches are likely to be effective. It would be like insisting that a child be taller or have different hair colour. Instead, effective teaching approaches require a consideration offour factors that vary considerably from country to country around the world. \"Some children are more at risk than others. During the toddler age range, boys are later to acquire language than are girls, a gap that can persist to five or six years of age.\" Governmental/societal policies There is considerable variation across developed countries in the organisa- tion of governmental resources and oversight for services for children with SLI. In the United States (U.S.), the public schools are required to provide speech/language pathology services for children with language impair- ments, in the context of an individu- alised education plan (IEP) developed in teams of classroom teachers and other educational specialists. Speech/language pathologists are required to be certified at the level of a master's degree. States vary widely in the exact definitions of eligibility for services. Some states would exclude children with SLI whereas others would include them and encourage them to be enrolled in services. Schools are not the exclusive setting for services in the U.S. Private practi- tioners, usually but not exclusively speech/language pathologists, also enrol children with SLI in treatment,which is usually but not always paid by private health insurance plans. LessMabel L Rice analyses the cause of Specific Language Impairment (SLI) and the need to identify it early on in children to provide a solutionDetecting Specific Language Impairment (SLI) in children 270PROFILElikely are services provided through military benefits or in association with a medical practice, such as a paedia- trician who specialises in SLI. In contrast, in many countries services are implemented under a public health system, sometimes in arrange- ments with schools and sometimes in private practices with a government- sponsored insurance program. Around the world, there are various configu- rations of these country-wide policies. The availability of speech/language pathologists with specialised training, and the level of training required, also varies greatly. Teaching settings The settings in which language teach- ing can occur also vary widely. Across the world, the most prevalent setting is a home, although home-based pro- fessional services are expensive and unlikely. Instead, the school classroom is the likely setting, as part of the teacher's approach to teaching each child in the age-defined classroom. Obviously, this has limitations related to the size of the classroom and the teacher's training. In the developed nations there is widespread recognition of the impact of preschool settings designed to enhance children's lan- guage abilities, as a strong platform for later education including the transition to reading. Private practice services are more likely to be with an individual teacher than in a group setting. Specialised training Teacher training, as well as paediatric training, involves a wide range of content areas and usually does notinclude specialised information aboutlinguistic structures and sociolinguistic skills that are essential to the identifi- cation of children with SLI or teaching methods. Speech/language patholo- gists in the U.S. are likely to receive this training although training approaches vary widely. There is a great need for the specialised training that will benefit all children. Child characteristics Some children are more at risk than others. During the toddler age range, boys are later to acquire language than are girls, a gap that can persist to five or six years of age. Little is known about how gender differences play outover childhood. A recent well docu- mented but surprising finding is that adolescent girls score lower than boys on vocabulary understanding, with the lowest performance by adolescent girls with SLI (3). Some risk factors have been widely assumed, such as lowlevels of maternal education or low levels of a child's nonverbal intelli- gence, although the evidence for these generalisations is not straightforward,suggesting that the generalisations do not always hold. (1,2) How to teach Teaching should be culturally sensitive and effective for enhancing each child's language development across multiple dimensions of language, including grammar, vocabulary, and social uses of language. Note that the big challenge is how to teach languageto a child with SLI in a way that causes them to learn language faster than their age peers in order to catch up.The catch-up period may extend over the years, requiring sustained treatments, and the age of first intervention will matter.These are formidable challenges and no one method has been shown to reliably meet them. It is most likely that a well-formulated combination of approaches will be needed, across different forms of service delivery. The new world of electronic teaching methods shows promise for how to teach in new settings, using innovative methods, at times when children are available and interested. It is essentialto continue research across many languages in order to arrive at the knowledge needed to teach children with SLI what most children acquire without explicit teaching.

The skills shortages within the life scienceand chemistry-specic related roles in the UK cannot be ignored; we must work towards maintaining a world- leading position for medicinal and vaccine research anddevelopment, as well as in other areas such as food and clothing technology, biomedical science, microbiology, pharmacology and forensic science. The 2018 What do graduates do? report from graduate careers experts Prospects found that only 16.6% of chemistry graduates left university to be hired in science roles, with 19.9% entering the job market in unrelatedsectors. Along with the current skills shortage within science roles, a recent report has also identied Brexit as a critical threat to job growth in the UK within this industry. One of its disruptive eects is a reduction in the number of scientists and engineers from mainlandEurope looking to further their careers in the UK. Jodie Murray, a recruitment consultant from STEM Graduates believes that graduates should be advised better on the dierent types of careers available to graduates. She said: \"Universities should be inviting companies for guest lectures to speak to candidates about what they do, how a science degree is useful in their company and specic roles which are available. I don't believe there is necessarily a skills shortage but more a case of graduates not being aware of all the careers options available and what roles they are qualied to pursue and enhancing their awareness will make a real dierence.\"The demand for sta in specic roles has also resulted in an increase in recruitment rates. Darren Orr, Directorof STEM Recruitment, Solutions believes marrying up the actual requirements of what the science industry expects from new graduates and the training and experience that they receive at University is a huge issue aecting skills shortages in the industry. He believes another issue contributing to the number of vacant roles is the reluctance of employers wanting to hire graduates. He said: \"There are concerns about social maturity in young people which ultimately is a result of mistrust - this is a stigma that needs to be broken. \"Investment in new graduates and sta training hasbeen at an all-time low. There is no contingency market and clients have opted to pay more or wait indenitely for the right candidate. The business strategy for changing this is to fast-track sta and develop more time to planning and executing sta training.\" Addressing skills shortages in the industry The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) worked with over 30 companies to identify theareas of signicant concern. From genomics to clinical pharmacology, identifying these gaps is just the rststep. Employers within the industry must work towards promoting career diversity as well as the specic roles which are available. Marketing an attractive career to attract top talent is no dierent to marketing a new health product or TV series; you need to work at it and target the right people for the best outcomes and results. What are the areas of most signicant concern? Bioinformatics and chemoinformatics - the science of using software tools to understand biological and chemical data to help develop new treatments.Inez Cornell at Radleys identifies what companies and universities can be doing to not only attract top talent and encourage people to pursue a career within science but how to retain employees, as wellEDUCATION 273Clinical pharmacology - experts working at the cutting edge of real-world data and clinical trials to help maximise the positive eects of a medicine and minimise the unwanted side eects. Genomics - sequencing and analysis of the human genome to understand how to develop new treatments for diseases. Immunology - the study of disease caused by disorders of the immune system, vital for theprotection of infectious diseases. Promoting career diversity and the roles available There's a lot more to a career in science than stereotypes suggest and this is a message that needs to be pushed out by employers throughout the industry, as well as by allied organisations such as the British Science Association. It is important to encourage potential employees to discover the dierent roles the industry has to oer as well as the many sectors these roles exist in; from an analytical chemist to a pharmacologist or even a forensic scientist role, there are many dierent career options available, with plenty of them oering progression. What's more, having something - or someone - to aspire to is often all that's needed to inspire changeand initiate action. Employers need to spend more time ensuring positive messages are sent out and getbetter at celebrating and drawing attention to the achievements of scientists and the exciting things they are doing within the industry. Take advantage of the digital world - social mediachannels and blogs are a great way to provide coverage and creates awareness about the work of existing scientists and the kind of opportunities that are on oer. Attracting a new workforce It is essential that the industry as a whole work towards inspiring more young people to pursue a STEM career. New workforces are emerging - enter Gen Z - and they work in dierent ways to the current and previous generations. It's clear that this demographic has very specic career expectations; we hear that they crave job security and thrive in environments where they can innovate and express their individuality - making a career in science the perfect solution, right? They are seeking meaningful jobs which will oer opportunities for advancement alongside the opportunity to learn new skills. EDUCATION 274For the industry to attract and retain the best talent, it's essential that universities, businesses and government work harder in placing graduates intoscience jobs and quicker. Schools and academies can be helping too. Teaching children about science,technology, engineering and mathematics at an early age helps them to grasp fundamental concepts aboutthe natural world, laying the groundwork and possibility for deeper learning. STEM learning doesn't have to be limited to the classroom - parents can support and aid early learning too. \"It is essential that the industry as a whole work towards inspiring more young people to pursue a STEM career.

They are seeking meaningful jobs which will offer opportunities for advancement alongside the opportunity to learn new skills.\" Adopting software solutions to enhance productivity and employee wellbeing Gen Z is the rst generation to have truly grown up with technology, so being able to use it to enhance their job prospects and develop their careers would be second nature to them. Employers can use this to their advantage, as adopting and implementing cloud-based solutions and other forms of technology will enhanceproductivity and encourage employee well-being. Implementing integrated software solutions will not just benet the younger workforce you might be considering attracting; it has unrivalled benets for your current workforce, too. Administrative work hinders employee's ability to focus their attention on their core tasks but certain software solution systems have the ability to strip out old paper-based processes. What's more, organisations are becoming increasingly more collaborative and teams spend more and moretime delivering projects collectively, which means an internal communications system is a must. Having a benecial infrastructure in place to support collaborativework is a benet for the entire group. Internal communication platforms give employees the ability to see updates, track timelines, share information and easily connect from apps or computer desktops. Considering the benets of adopting software solutions and keeping up with technology will not only make pursuing a career in science an appealing option to the current emerging workforce but will increase eciency and enhance productivity throughout the lab and other areas of the business. Understand recognition is the key to retention It is clear that employers are struggling to nd, recruit and retain suitable people within specic roles withinscience. Recognition is the key to retaining sta - by recognising and rewarding hard work, your workers will feel valued. Feeling valued, recognised and respected is within some of the top reasons for employers staying at their current place of work, so it is denitely an aspect to take advantage of. As well as feeling recognised and valued, career growth, learning and development is an important factor amongst talented employees - so promoting this within a career is advantageous. By ensuring employees have the correct tools at their ngertips, they will be able to learn by themselves and identify areas where they can develop and improve. Setting targets and using technology that shows how workers are performing in real-time will help drive job satisfaction and wellbeing levels.

EDUCATION 276Achieving excellence in U.S. science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education The Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) has one primary mission; to achieve excellence in U.S. science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education at alllevels and in all settings (both formal and informal) in order to support the development of a diverse and well-prepared workforce of scientists, technicians, engineers, mathematicians and educators and a well- informed citizenry. It is important that all have access to the ideas and tools of science and engineering to achieve their purpose of enhancing the quality of life of all citizens and the health, prosperity, welfare andsecurity of the nation. In order to achieve this, anumber of goals have been set by the EHR: Prepare the next generation of STEM professionals and attract and retain more Americans to STEM careers. Broaden the participation of individuals, geographic regions, types of institutions, and STEM disciplines to further close achievement gaps in all STEM elds. Develop a robust research community that can conduct rigorous research and evaluation that will support excellence in STEM education, which also integrates research, and education. Increase the technological, scientic and quantitative literacy of all Americans so that they can exercise responsible citizenship and live productive lives in an increasingly technological society. In order to achieve the rst of these four goals and prepare the next generation of STEM professionals, theDivision of Graduate Education (DGE) provide funding to support U.S. graduate students and manage thedevelopment of novel, innovative programs to prepare tomorrow's leaders in STEM elds. Innovation, inclusivity, high-quality graduate education in STEMelds are priorities which DGE advocates for, and their programs help to ensure these factors. This includes the Scholarship Program (SFS), the Research Program, and the Fellowship Program (GRFP) which is critical to the overall strategy in developing the globally-engaged workforce necessary to ensure the Nation's leadership in advancing science and engineering research and innovation. It recognises and supports outstandinggraduate students in NSF supported STEM disciplines who are pursuing research-based Master's and Doctoral degrees at accredited United States institutions. Moreover, DGE manages the Traineeship Program(NRT), which is designed to ensure that graduate students in research-based master's and doctoral degree programs develop the skills, knowledge, and competencies needed to pursue a range of STEM careers. The NRT Program is also designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training. Furthermore, in February 2019 a study found that STEM achievement gaps shrunk by nearly half when facultiesview intelligence as malleable, and professors adopt \"growth mind-sets.\" \"In a university wide sample, wefound that all students \u2014 and black, Latino and Native American students in particular \u2014 earn signicantly higher grades in STEM courses when their professors believe intelligence is a malleable quality that can beHere, we explore the mission of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources at the National Science Foundation to achieve excellence in U.S. science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education at all levels EDUCATION 277developed over time, compared to when their professors believe intelligence is a xed trait that cannot change very much,\"1declared Elizabeth Canning, the study's Principal Investigator. Through thismethod, universities have been able to successfully broaden the participation of individuals, championing accessibility and inclusivity in STEM elds, another ofthe previously mentioned goals of the EHR. The Directorate for Education and Human Resources is part of the vital National Science Foundation (NSF), which is the premier Federal agency supporting basic research and people at the frontiers of discovery in the STEM elds and was created to on the whole \"promotethe progress of science; to advance the national health,prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defence.\" 2The type of support it provides ranges from being a primary driver of the U.S. economy to enhancing the nation's security and advancing knowledge tosustain global leadership. In scal year (FY) 2019, its budget is $8.1 billion. NSF funds reach all 50 states through grants to nearly 2,000 colleges, universities and other institutions. Each year, NSF receives more than 50,000 competitive proposals for funding and makesabout 12,000 new funding awards. Just last year, the NSF awarded $50 million in grants to improve STEM education, improving the opportunity for learning in schools across 24 U.S. states and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Evan Heit, Division Director forResearch on Learning in NSF's Education and Human Resources Directorate, stated, \"we are delighted tosupport these education research and development eorts across the nation.\" 3 References 1 https://news.iu.edu/stories/2019/02/iub/releases/15-faculty- mindsets-shrink-stem-achievement-gaps.html www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGov Nurturing Potential: Inspiring Excellence, our mission- driven tagline, captures the philosophy underlying the extensivestudent and teacher programming provided through the University ofIowa's Belin-Blank Center for Gifted Education and Talent Development. Excellence, the last word in the tagline, holds significance for multiple reasons, beginning with the origins of the word. I thought that I knew the meaning of excellence until I heard it explained by the poet, Jorie Graham. Graham, a multi-honoured (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, MacArthur Genius Fellowship), University of Iowa Writer's Workshop graduate and Harvard Professor of Poetry, offers both explanation and motivation. The root of excellence - from the Greek - is not, properly, to surpass others - or to be greater than they; but, rather, to rise up naturally, to raise - as a crop is raised. The oldest root in that word - from the Greek - is that forhill. Imagine that hill. It was not placed on the landscape to make the prairie feel flat. It was not raised to make the sky tremble. Its job is to be a hill. We do not know why, but we know a hill-less world would be unbearable. True, too, for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs. A world of STEM programswithout excellence would be unbearable. What does STEM excellence look like? From our vantage point, it looks a lot like the Belin-Blank Center's recently- funded National Science Foundation(NSF) program, STEM Excellence and Leadership. Funded in 2017 for four years, through NSF's Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), specifically from the EHR program for Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL), STEM Excellence and Leadership aligns perfectly with sev- eral of AISL's primary aims, including:broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences. STEM Excellence and Leadership includes five primary components: 1. Broadening the talent pool of students who come from under- resourced communities; 2. Drawing from the broadened talent pool to identify rural middle-school students with high STEM aptitude to participate in the STEM Excellence after-school programming; 3. Providing 96 hours of STEM after-school programming scheduled over 24 weeks, twice a week, for approximately two hours per session; 4. Offering professional development to the after-school facilitators of the program and; 5. Conducting research to understand how informal STEM learning shapes the academic and psychosocial Susan Assouline, PhD, Director Belin-Blank Center for Gifted Education and Talent Development, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, U.S., details a model for equalising science, technology, engineering and mathematics opportunities and in this vein, that inspires excellenceSTEM Excellence: A model for equalising opportunities for STEM 278PROFILE outcomes of rural, high-potential students, as well as to identify key characteristics of successful informal STEM learning environments for rural, high-aptitude students and their teachers. \"Our focus on excellence is somewhat unique to the American education system. Many of America's resources have been devoted to closing the achievement gap and enhancing STEM literacy, through enrichment, which is an important goal for society.\" We focused on middle-school students in rural school districts for several reasons. First, Iowa is a rural state situated in the heartland of the U.S. and with an economy grounded in agriculture. Second, fewer students from rural districts, some of which are economically under-resourced, attend four-year colleges or universities com- pared to their urban and suburbancounterparts. Rural schools are also less likely to offer advanced course- work, in part because they must contend with geographic isolation andsmall school sizes that often preclude the possibility of advanced coursework. Finally, we recognised the importance of working with middle-school students while their aspirations and choice of coursework are still flexible. What have we learned? Our method for broadening the talent pool worked. The typical gifted educa- tion program in the U.S. serves about 3 to 5% of a school's population and primarily provides a general enrich- ment program during the school day. Students are selected for the typical gifted program through grade-level achievement tests and ability tests. We used an alternative identification system, above-level testing, and offered this challenging testing experience to about 20% of the students who were considered high-achieving. From that broad talent pool, about 15% were invited to participate in the after-school program; far more than the 3 to 5% identified through the typ- ical gifted identification procedures. We found STEM-talented students with a range of STEM talents, including emergent to exceptional. What are we still investigating? We continue to investigate the impact of an informal, after-school program on the overall achievement and aspi- rations of the students involved in the program. The after-school program takes place throughout 24 weeks of the school year and offers about 96 hours of advanced and enriched programming in STEM. We need to determine the impact of this \"dose\" of informal learning and whether it impacts the likelihood of taking more advanced courses and aiming high for post-secondary opportunities. Anecdotally, we have found that participating students have increased their engagement in STEM, which is a critical first step to increasing achieve- ment and aspirations. Teachers also felt empowered by the program and professional development. Conclusions Gifted education in the U.S. is under- going a paradigm shift from in-school enrichment to talent development in domain-specific areas, such as STEM.Talent development as a philosophy aims towards excellence; as a model, it requires engagement in learning. Our focus on excellence is somewhatunique to the American education system. Many of America's resources have been devoted to closing the achievement gap and enhancing STEM literacy, through enrichment,which is an important goal for society. However, excellence and literacy are not mutually exclusive. An either-or approach is not only unnecessary, it is also a distraction from the work needed to develop STEM talent among all individuals including bright students who attend under-resourced schools yet have the potential to demonstrate excellence through all their years of schooling. Finding talent is critical for the individual student as well as for society. This means broadening the talent pool to include high-potential students who might not typically be discovered. Rurality has many facets, including an agricultural context of raising crops among the rolling hills of the Midwest. Perhaps Graham's explanation of excellence resonates strongly because of the connection with Iowa's rural culture. Our STEM Excellence program has examined the impact of after- school, informal programming on bright students (\"to raise - as a crop is raised\") who might not be discovered through traditional methods or served through traditional programs. This program inspires excellence.

The ISLE approach has two major goals: to engage students in the activities that mirror scientific practice while constructing and applying new knowledge and to help them grow aslearners. The former means that everything that happens in the class-room and at home related to students learning of physics mirrors the activities in which practising scientists engage. The latter means that the decisions that the instructor makes while planning, enacting and assessing the instruction support student intellec- tual and emotional growth. In this editorial, I will focus on the first aspect of the environment and show how it can be implemented with students of all ages. In the traditional approach to teaching and learning, the instructors are focused on what they will do to explain the material better, what experiments they will show, what problems they will assign and how they will grade student work. The students usually sit in a classroom with seats in rows facing the teacherand listen to the explanations takingnotes. The students do not question the information that is supplied to them. The instructor grades them on how they understand this information and how they apply it to solve prob- lems. The grades for student work are given once and those are recorded. The students do not have an opportu- nity to improve their work (in cases that they are allowed to do it, the second attempt receives a reduced grade for being second). If you think about the practice ofphysics or any other science, you will see clearly how the practice of tradi- tional teaching contradicts its every step. The heart of science is its exper-imental nature, the collaboration of its participants, peer review and continu- ous improvement of one's work. We revise and resubmit papers until they are deemed worthy of publication, we revise and resubmit grant applications. We collaborate with our peers and present our findings to large audiences that critique it. Can these practices find their way to student learning? One might argue that scientists have a lot of background knowledge, they read research papers and are trained for a long time. How can students, who are just starting to learn, engage in similar activities? It turns out that this is entirely possible. Imagine that you walk into a class- room where students are sitting in groups of three to four around round tables. On each table, there is a small whiteboard and three to four markers of different colours. Each table has a piece of white paper. The teacher walks around and puts a streak of rubbing alcohol on each paper and asks the students to observe it . After the students watch what is happening for three to four minutes (the wet spot dries), they are invited to discuss in groups their observations without using fancy scientific terms. They write their observations on the whiteboards each using their own coloured marker. Then they lift the boards and everyone sees what the rest wrote. The discussion of the patterns emerg-ing from their observations starts. The students say that alcohol disappeared, that the wet spot shrank, that the pro- cess happened slowly, gradually . Once the whole class agrees on these pat- terns, the instructor asks them to focus on the gradual aspect of the disappearance first. What could be the inside structure of the alcohol to allow it to disappear gradually, i.e. not all at once? Usually, the students say that it could only happen if the alcohol was made of smaller parts or pieces. Now the next step of group workEugenia Etkina, Distinguished Professor of Science Education at Rutgers The State University of New Jersey, continues to share her thoughts on the Implementing Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE), with a focus on the first aspect of the environment and how it can be implemented with students of all agesImplementing the Investigative Science Learning Environment: A focus on the first aspect of the environment and how it can be implemented 280PROFILEcomes: the students discuss in groups and put on the whiteboards all possi- ble mechanisms (hypotheses) that could explain the disappearance of small pieces and then share these with the class using the same approach. The groups of students usually come up with several hypotheses: the paper absorbed the pieces (1), the air absorbed the pieces (2), or the pieces \"jumped\" out of the paper (3). Now the students have three (sometimes more) hypotheses of the mechanisms. How do we know which one is correct? Most students say: Test them! But how to test? What does it mean to test in science? Here the teacher explains that testing in science involves design- ing a new experiment whose outcome can be predicted using the hypothesis under test. If the predictions based on different hypotheses for the same experiment are different, it is a good experiment, if they are the same, the experiment will not help distinguish between different hypotheses. The groups get together again to brainstorm possible experiments. They come up with the following experi- ment quickly: put the wet paper on a scale. If (1) is correct, the reading of the scale will not change as the paper dries. If (2) and (3) are correct, the reading will go down and eventually be the same as for the dry paper. The experiment is easy to perform and the outcome matches the predictions based on (2) and (3). (1) is rejected and (2) and (3) are not. How to test the hypothesis (2) that involves air? Usually, the students suggest wrapping wet paper in a plastic wrap to prevent interaction with air. If (2) is correct, the paper should not dry but it should not dry also if (3) is correct. Thus, the experi- ment will not allow differentiating between these two hypotheses. Atthis moment, the instructor leads a discussion of what makes a good testing experiment. The search for new ones goes on. In our experience, the most attractive hypothesis for the students is that air absorbs the pieces of alcohol (2). How can they test it? Eventually, a group of students comes up with putting wet paper under a vacuum jar and have another one, similarly wet outside. If air takes alcohol parts, then the paperunder a vacuum jar should dry slower than outside. If the pieces jump out (3), then removing air should not affect the rate of drying. This experiment is easy to perform if you have a jar or use the video, here . To students' surprise, the paper inside the jar dries faster! The \"air\" hypothesis is disproved. What is next? Testing the hypothesis of moving pieces. We leave the read- ers to observe the experiment and come to the conclusions themselves . The moving parts hypothesis is not rejected. In summary, the students observed a simple experiment (drying alcohol),worked in groups to come up with two patterns: disappearing (1) of alcohol occurs gradually (2) devised one explanation for pattern 2 and several for pattern 1, tested them in multiple experiments and rejected all explanations for (1), except the motion of little pieces of alcohol. To summarise, the students on their own constructed the concept of the particle nature of matter and the idea that these particles are moving.These two ideas are the foundations of the kinetic molecular theory - the most fundamental theory of nature.The process through which the stu- dents discovered these fundamental ideas follows the ISLE (Investigative Science Learning Environment) approach.Note, that in the process described above, the students participated in most important science practices: they observed natural phenomena, devised multiple explanations for them and systematically tested them with the purpose of ruling out not proving. They worked collaboratively, shared their ideas and continuously improved them. They were not look- ing for correct answers but were engaged in an authentic scientific pro- cess. This is just one example of how one can bring real science into the classroom. We have developed similar sequences for all concepts of intro- ductory physics (Etkina, Brookes, Planinsic and Van Heuvelen, 2019). In my next editorial, I will address the second foundational idea of the ISLE approach - supporting student growth as learners. References Etkina, E. (2015).

There are as vast and diverse an array of technologies, tools and peda- gogies falling under the EdTech label as there is a vastand diverse spectrum of learners and educators using it. With 66% of millennials and 59% of Gen Z surveyed by Pearson agreeing that 'technology will transform how college students learn in the future', it seems clearthat the use of technology in teaching and learning contexts is not just predicted: it is expected. Coupledwith the majority of Gen Z stating a preference for learning through YouTube videos (59%), as opposed to printed books (47%) and the explosion of MOOCs doc-umented by Class Central (an estimated 101 million learners as of their 2018 research ), and it becomes apparent that EdTech is already an important part of the learning landscape. With that in mind, this articleconsiders three key functions of EdTech for this century's learners. EdTech as a way to increase access, widen participation and expand skillsets In 2018, the World Economic Forum warned that as the nature of work changes, by 2022, 54% of the world's employees will require signicant reskilling. Many key skills for today and tomorrow's workforce centre on technology, particularly in areas such as data scienceand robotics; and the demand for skilled workers drastically outstrips supply. Similarly, The European Commission has suggested that 37% of European workers lack even basic digital skills. It will no longer be possible to simply pay for workers with premium skills - there simply won't be enough people with those skills around to full the positions required.This is where EdTech and online education can help. In the UK, government-backed initiatives like the Institute of Coding (IoC) and the National Centre for ComputingEducation (NCCE) are using online platforms to tackle the issue head-on. The IoC was formed to respond tothe UK's digital skills gap and has created an online course catalogue to help guide learners in their jour- ney to a digital career. This online catalogue brings together a wide range of digital skills courses that are being oered by the IoC's 30+ partner universities and industry educators. The IoC not only addresses today's skills gap by upskilling in 21st Century skills but also aims to educate about relevant careers, expanding their reach and making them both attractive and acces- sible to a wider and more diverse group of learners (and future workers). Meanwhile, the NCCE operates at a grassroots level by teaching teachers the skills needed to ensure every child in every school in England hasFelicity Parsisson, Learning Designer at FutureLearn, explains three ways in EdTech will benefit this century's learners Felicity ParsissonEDUCATION 283access to world-leading computing education, indeed, they are an example of an organisation with many online courses to help in that mission. EdTech as a way to allow dierentiation and choice Most classes have a relatively varied learner prole - that is, not every learner is going to be at the same level, have the same method of approaching tasks, have the same educational background or emotionalattitude towards what it is they are learning. Coupled with aective factors that might impact a student'sprogress (home environment, work pressures, physical limitations), EdTech can help to support both teachersand learners personalise the learning experience. \"With 66% of millennials and 59% of Gen Z surveyed by Pearson agreeing that 'technology will transform how college students learn in the future', it seems clear that the use of technology in teaching and learning contexts is not just predicted: it is expected.\" Advances in EdTech and online learning platforms can support educators and empower learners through more easily incorporating addendums to the core cur-riculum in a digital learning environment. Simply link- ing to further reading or the creation of easy-to-share extra practice activities, for example, can provide thesupport or challenge needed to engage students and support learning, whereas choice could be given through learners deciding themselves how they wish to evidence their learning and to so with a variety of EdTech tools. Videos can show step-by-step ways of approaching a task - for example, setting up the stages of a science experiment for learners to check their work against. Another way in which EdTech can allow for dierentia- tion and choice is its suitability for the flipped class-room, where learners spend 'homework' time outside of class more independently preparing for their face- to-face lessons. This directed but self-paced method means learners have more time to get to grips with key concepts and ideas at home, freeing up class time for deeper application of their learning or time to try practical tasks out.EdTech as a way to support, connect and engage The opportunities for diverse, self-selecting communities of learners on MOOCs and other online platforms far surpasses that which could be achieved by even the largest school or university campus. With Pearson'sreport demonstrating that Gen Z in particular value diverse relationships, it is clear that the opportunities aorded by the global reach of learning online can facilitate this. But there's much more to connecting and engaging than simply learning online with a dispersed international cohort. Products such as Microsoft Teams or GSuite can be used successfully to make light work of collaborative projects for learners in a school class,giving students tools to plan, draft, edit and produce work with ease. Specic products also exist to helpteachers easily monitor learners' progress, while onlinetutorials can be more interactive and productive than face-to-face ones as teachers and learners take turns sharing screens or fullling the presenter role. Considering these three key ways which EdTech can impact today's learners is not to suggest that all teach- ing and learning will become fully tech-based, or that face-to-face teaching will be obsolete. Technology with-out pedagogy is simply another teaching tool, and a productive, relevant and useful educational experience is much more than its composite parts, but EdTech can bring to life ideas and experiences in a way that adds richness, practical application and skills developmentto the curricula, while serving to inspire the data scientists and automation experts of tomorrow.

Of the 17SDGs, SDG 4, target 7, is focused not just on providing education, that is 'Quality, Inclusive and Equitable Education' - but also seeks to build peaceful and sustainable societies. To achieve SDG 4.7, education needs not just to be redesigned but its very purpose needs to be reconsid- ered. Why should education be revisited? The world is going through a demographic overhaul. Emigration and immigration patterns are creating societal compo- sitions that are unprecedentedly heterogenous - com- posed of diverse races, classes and cultures. At the same time, a steady deterioration in the Global Peace Index since 2008 (GPI, 2017), a steady increase in internal conflicts 2016, continued decline in empathy(Konrath et al, 2010) and increased mental stress anddepression in children (WHO report, 2017) have highlighted the failures and inadequacies of the current education system. Education needs to be repurposed and redesigned to build not just human capital for economic growth but to create global citizens for human flourishing. We describe global citizens as lifelong learners who possess the critical consciousness to drive 'active citi-zenship', to recognise the inherent interconnectedness and dignity of all life and instil the values of acceptance , equality, respect for diversity, empathy and compassion. To redesign education with this new purpose, we turn to recent advances in the neuroscience science of learning. Recent ndings from brain research have demystied the learning process, facilitating newunderstandings of how learning happens and can be shaped. The human brain has emerged as a remarkableDr Anantha Duraiappah and Nandini Chatterjee Singh from UNESCO, Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development, share their views on the importance of global citizenship for human flourishing EDUCATION Education: Global citizenship for human flourishing285organ which has specialised tissue for both intellectual and emotional learning. The outermost layer of the brain in humans is the neocortex which is involved inbuilding the intellect and includes processes like deci- sion making, sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, conscious thought and language. Older, inner structures of the human brain also called the limbic cortex, process emotion, goal set- ting, motivation and self-control (Gazzaniga, 2008). The neo-ortex is densely connected to the emotional cortex and, thus, all learning is hugely influenced by emotion. Most importantly, we now know that the brain is malleable and can be trained because of a process called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is dened as theability of the brain to form and reorganize connections, especially in response to learning (Draganski et al, 2004). \"Education needs to be repurposed and redesigned to build not just human capital for economic growth but to create global citizens for human flourishing. We describe global citizens as lifelong learners who possess the critical consciousness to drive 'active citizenship', to recognise the inherent interconnectedness and dignity of all life and instil the values of acceptance, equality, respect for diversity, empathy and compassion.\" Thus, to build global citizens, education curricula needsto build not only intellectual skills of critical thinking,rational and logical decision making but also includes Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) through which individuals recognise and regulate emotions, identify positive purpose, demonstrate empathy for others, take compassionate action and promote human well- being. Research now shows that social and emotional learning can be taught in the classroom, just like literacy and numeracy and that explicit inclusion of SEL fosters happier motivated students who exhibit pro-social behaviour. Prosocial behaviour is voluntary social behaviour that represents a broad category of actionsthat are generally benecial to other people and to the ongoing political system (Piliavin et al. 1981). Thus, prosocial behaviour promotes human flourishing and has been shown to be altruistic and motivational and recent reports have indicated that specic cultivationof prosocial behaviour may be a necessity to achieve the SDGs (Asah and Chatterjee Singh, 2019).We argue for a revolution in education - one that is restructured to promote global citizenship rather than only cater to the narrow political or economic agenda of countries. The pedagogical processes of education need to instil in learners the inherent interconnectedness and dignity of all life and create values of acceptance, equality, respect for diversity, empathy and compassion in us. Education-based on this approach can not only nurture the potential of the present generation but also future generations to generate peaceable and sus- tainable future societies consonant with a far-reaching vision of 4.

Malign (state and non-state) actors have taken advan- tage of the rise of new media and digital technologies, exploiting loopholes that exist in the intersectionbehind this set of technological advancements and our traditional model of political and social organisation. These actors have realised over the past decade and ahalf that this new digital toolkit is a relatively easy, far less costly and much more powerful instrument, perfectlycapable of exploiting our human weaknesses and of polarising and dividing societies. The goal is clear. Usually disguised as legitimate andtrustworthy content, disinformation has often exploited the viral power of social media and the echo chambers that digital liked-minded communities often operate within, at times leading to much higher and broader distribution rates than actual news. It has thrived on the polarisation many of our societies are facing and it has served to entrench further these echo chambers andamplify misinformation. In such an environment, asOrwell predicted, when we can't decipher what is real and what is not democracy, its ethos, norms, institutions and foundations, are severely challenged. The com- bined result of this is the subversion of the normalcy ofpolitical life, the sowing and encouragement of discord and the amplication of ssures, divisions, suspicions and distrust within our societies. It is these ssures that have increased and sustained the susceptibility of our societies to outside interference. \"In order to fully safeguard our democracies, we also need to ensure that we exhaust all means available at our disposal to tackle the underlying problems making our societies susceptible to such efforts. It is easy and at times lazy to blame foreign actors for everything negative happening domestically, but have we worked enough to patch up or heal our internal divisions, have we exerted the maximum of our oversight role and have we closed off all possible or imaginable loopholes?\" A measured, imaginative response How is democracy and for that matter, our democracies to respond against these challenges? To react appropriately, we need to make sure that we are neither underestimating the threat nor overestimat- ing it. Take Russian actions in this domain for example. For sure, the Kremlin's eorts have been characteristic of an authoritarian regime's intent to act in this way to discredit liberal democracy and its component elements. Nonetheless, Russian influence operations might be real, but they are neither as detrimental nor as eective as they rst appear. Lumping everythingunder the heading of 'Russian-related eorts to subvert our democracies' may lead to the spread of the belief that Russian influence operations are always ubiq- uitous and wildly successful. On the contrary, they oftenVassilis Ntousas from the Foundation for European Progressive Studies explores an aspect of politics that concerns keeping our democracy true when it comes to foreign information interference and forward-looking countermeasuresPOLITICS RESEARCH 287are inept and poorly organised. This is not to downplay what is at stake here and the threat level involved. It is simply to underline the importance of having a realisticsense of threat perception. In order to fully safeguard our democracies, we also need to ensure that we exhaust all means available at our disposal to tackle the underlying problems making our societies susceptible to such eorts. It is easy and at times lazy to blame foreign actors for everything negative happening domestically, but have we workedenough to patch up or heal our internal divisions, have we exerted the maximum of our oversight role and have we closed o all possible or imaginable loopholes? Finally, we also need to remember that this is as much an exercise about analysing what went wrong (or right)in 2016, 2017, or 2018, as much as it is about setting the rules about it not happening, or happening dierently in 2019, 2020 and so on. Simply catching up cannot be thebasis for sustainable, forward-looking strategies to address the challenges posed; models and frameworks that respond to the needs of tomorrow as much as to the needs of today must be established. There are critical areas where this logic must be urgently applied: we needto now start designing new electoral laws that are in sync with the digital age, we have to take a leap forward in how we improve digital literacy, and we must address the public policy gap that exists by commissioning more comprehensive, systematic, and robust research to explore the correlation between interference eorts andtheir impact on suspicions, emotions and divisions. In this endeavour, Europe must inescapably raise its level of ambition. The GDPR legislation has shown the potential of the European Union (EU) being a leader in digital matters and enforcing a stricter regulatory framework in how the big tech companies operate, but with a large majority of internet users across the continent being concerned about disinformation in pre-election periods, this is clearly not enough. Similarly, recent eorts to boost the funding of the East StratCom Task Force, created in 2015 to address Russia's ongoing disinformation campaigns, are a good step but we need to be much more audacious in ourapproach. Finally, building cyber resilience is neither aspectator sport nor a solitary one. In this regard, resus- citating the transatlantic axis is key; the EU and the U.S. should be the international standards and norms setters in this regard. Combining the regulatory weight of the U.S. Government with European leadership inissues like privacy should create the necessary gravitas for meaningful, positive change globally as well as powerful and costly countermeasures. Ben Franklin, a polymath and one of the founding fathers of the U.S. once referred to democracy as: \"two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.\" In a world awash with disinformation, one might betempted to slightly update this great quote by adding that democracy is two wolves with a keyboard and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. The stakescould not be higher - thwarting digital authoritarianismshould, therefore, be an absolute priority, not least for the next European Commission. As thrilling as it might be to believe otherwise, succeeding in this endeavour will be important not only for the meaningful political battles that are being fought right now, but perhaps more so, for the kind of politics and the kind of democracies we will be functioning within in the years and decades to come.

Since I last wrote about progressive state leadership earlier this year for Open Access Government , there have been two important normative shifts in the politics of the Western world. The first is the consolidation of populist nationalism, most evident forthose residing in the UK in the way in which a 'no-deal' Brexit has becomethe default norm. The second is the normative shift regarding climate change. Since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's special report of October 2018 (advising a maximum 1.5 \u00b0C average global temperatureincrease), perceptions around the social, economic and political impor- tance of climate change mitigation and adaptation have decisively shifted -in civil society, across political parties, and in branches of govern- ment. These two normative shifts are set to clash, as we see presently in the United States and Brazil. State leader- ship is/will become vital in deciding the direction of these clashes. In the context of this quickly moving history , it is important to keep addressing the issue of progressive state leadership. My last article underlined the mind-set of such leadership: re-framing thequestion of borders, of national inter-est, of sovereignty, etc. so that a new internationalism is borne on the back of an alignment of domestic and global interests and values. This second arti- cle asks what the progressive agenda is shaping up to be for progressive state leadership. This entails three ana- lytical/normative questions: First, what is understood as 'progress' today, and therefore what is it to be 'progressive' today? Second, what is a relevant 'progressive agenda'? Third, what does it mean to lead on this agenda? What is progress, what is it to be progressive today? The concept of progress was born in the 18C Enlight- enment (although it has deep historicalRichard Beardsworth, Professor and Head of School, School of Politics and International Studies, University of Leeds, provides the second article of a series on progressive state leadership 288 Progressive state leadership today: Part 2PROFILEroots). History was considered a vehicle for the greater emancipation of humankind. This understanding of history has closed: decolonisation questioned its narrow conception of emancipation; two world wars and the ever-present threat of a nuclear crisishave undermined claims to greater peace; and climate catastrophe uproots the assumptions of modernity and modernisation processes. As a result, the idea of 'progress' must be thought and practiced differently. Amidst re-assessments rehearsed today in universities, think tanks,public reports and the media, I emphasize two lines of thinking here: A sense of limit and an understanding of relations that go wider than those between humans. Progress today entails modesty and caution regarding the place of the human in the world. To be ambitious is not to throw caution to the winds, but, precisely, to open up a world within limits . What does it mean to be 'progressive' in this context of limits? The progressivism structuring U.S. politics from 1908 to 1918 has certainly regained relevance in our populist age: to place 'the people' above specific interests; to redress huge inequalities of condition and power; to consider government as a tool of economic and social change, providing the conditions of the common good, collective purpose and equality of opportunity (set against an excessive individualism and consumerism). These norms are returning. If aligned with the idea of a world of limits , they are today (again) progressive. Maria Jo\u00e3o Rodriguez arguesthat it is the millennials (born between 1980 and 2000) that are most sensitive to this alignment. The last six months also shows a growing political sensitivity among post-millen- nials (School Strikes for Climate, etc.). Progress is about the future; it is inter-generational. The idea of progress emerging from, and for, the younger generations is that of building a world of limits. What, then, is a progressive agenda today? Climate change and planetarysustainability are not simply at the forefront of a progressive political agenda. They articulate the terms through which economic, social and political progress is to be thought and practiced in the first place. Responsibility towards climate change, implementing planetary sustainability, provides consequently the overall normative framework within which progressive goals can be settled. This point has three major implications. First and foremost, to tackle domestic inequality requires at the one and the same time a global approach to social, economic and environmental prob- lems: economic regionalisation and localisation works, in other words, with a spirit of internationalism that seeks institutionalised cooperationamong countries and peoples. The contemporary nationalist opposing of the national to the global (or inversely previous neo-liberal opposing of the global to the national) makes no sense within the progressive practiceof a world of limits. Planetary sustain- ability requires, together, the reorgan- isation of national economies towards the sub-national andincreasing institutional articulation between the more and less vulnerable nations on the planet. Linking in this non-opposi- tional manner the economic, the social and the environmental willincreasingly define, I suggest, the progressive agenda. Second, this agenda must be therefore concretely local and global, re-inscrib- ing the legitimate concerns of populist nationalism (inequality, identity) withineconomies and cultures of sustainable lifestyles. The emerging behavioural norms of 'well-being' and 'respect for biodiversity' suggest progressive orientation here. Lastly, set against the contemporary politics of fear and closed borders, this agenda can nurse social anxiety towards more shared political transformations. Third, and in conclusion, what does it mean to lead on this agenda? To push for progress towards a world of limits at this ideological time requires partic- ular states leading in the rapidly changing, but uncertain international order. As public officers of the UnitedNations all too often emphasise, thetimefor addressing global challenges like climate change is very short, but the scaleof operations to do so is very large. Drawing on their capacities as states, progressive states are those that bring together time and scale. To do so, they forcefully align national and global interests, tailor the global to the local and scale up the local tothe global so that a world of limits emerges as an attainable horizon of human progress. For this, particular states must lead by example; progres- sive state leadership is now required in this sense.

We have 'a new strategic agenda' until 2024, new MEPs sitting in the European Parliament, a new European Commission college that oers gender parity and ongoing discussions on possible new port- folios and areas of work. I'm also pleased to see the rst-ever woman taking on the job of European Commission President, which is certainly a positive change. Meanwhile, the EU has essential promises it must keep. The Paris Climate Agreement for one. We cannot impinge the health and prosperity of future generations whenwe have, in our hands, the knowledge and capability, to do otherwise. Existing challenges must similarly be tackled. With one in four Europeans at risk of poverty or social exclusion, it is now more important than ever to ensure social rights for all people and preserve social cohesion. There are many other issues facing Europe, including those rising up the agenda such as security. In order to deliver on the majority of these agendas, European and national leaders must be prepared to work closely with city administrations, where most people live. Europe depends on its cities Local authorities are responsible for the implementation of more than 70% of EU rules. From nding housing for refugees to meeting climate change targets, we make the EU a reality for people every day. It's clear that the future of Europe depends on how it engages with its cities. Cities across Europe are committed to transition to a greener, more sustainable and inclusive future byworking with citizens and collaborating in partnerships. We ask European leaders to work with us to adopt and implement the vision of a carbon-neutral Europe by 2050. This should include policies directed towards cleaner and fewer vehicles on our streets, investment in public transport networks, support to scale-up energy transition in urban areas and a decisive move towards a circular economy.

European leaders should work with us to boost the digital transformation across the EU by supporting cities' eorts to develop, test and scale-up digital solutions that help providebetter public services, while also empowering people to participate and benet. Cities are taking the lead in the ght against poverty and social exclusion across Europe. We need a fairer, more equal and inclusive Europe that puts people atits centre.

This includes nancial pledges from cities, showing that the local level is ready to engage with other levels of government to create a future that leaves no one behind. A future that works for people Through EUROCITIES 'city leaders agenda for Europe', we are asking European and national leaders to work with cities as partners to bridge the gap between Europe and its citizens. Together we can build an ambitious agenda for Europe that works for its cities and people.While signicant achievements in recent years, such as establishing an urban agenda for the EU, show the growing role of cities in EU decision making, more can be done. To strengthen leadership on urban matters in the EU, we need high level recognition of the importance of urban aairs in the European Commission to ensure an ongoing dialogue with city leaders, strategic direction and stronger coordination of EU policies for cities. The future success of EU-urban cooperation would further benet from the secretariat general taking the leading role in overseeing the Commission's engagement in the urban agenda. This would better reflect the cross-sectoral approach to policymaking adopted by city administrations The more that EU leaders and other levels of government are willing to engage directly with city leaders, the more policy at all levels will create results that matter for people. Working with cities means working with people. EUROCITIES is the political platform for major European cities.

While for most of the world's populations these improvements occurred in the twenti- eth century, and especially after 1950, the process of improvement was much more protracted in now-devel- oped countries, and the first signs of the so-called mortality transition can be traced to the mid-eighteenth century in northern Europe. These early origins pose a puzzle because they predated major investments in public health (which occurred in Britain from the mid-nineteenth century at the earliest) and medical advances (which with the exception of smallpox vaccination, were associated with developments in germ theory and aseptic techniques from the 1870s onwards). \"Paul Slack argued in the case of plague that the steps required for the import of plague-infected rodents and fleas into English ports, and for the subsequent propagation of a human epidemic, constituted a tenuous chain of transmission that could be disrupted even by relatively incomplete or crude quarantine measures.\" Moreover, in England at least, these early improvements coincided with very rapid growth of especially indus- trial, manufacturing and port towns and the urban disamenities associatedwith these environments. Yet in England the largest improvements in survival in the period 1750-1820 occurred in towns. A Wellcome Trust funded project to investigate the early origins of the 'Mortality Revolution' in British towns has provided some surprising insights into these early gains. Analysis of the diseases that diminished in impor- tance before 1850 in the English pop- ulation revealed that these diseaseswere generally the most lethal (Figure 1). Figure 1 depicts schematically the timing of declines in major infectious causes of death between the seven- teenth and the mid-twentieth cen- turies, together with broad estimates of disease lethality as measured by the percentage of those infected who died as a result. Bubonic plague, which disappeared from Britain after the 1660s, was asso- ciated with extremely high case-fatal- ity rates, with between 20 and 60% of those infected dying. Its eruption into medieval Europe as the 'Black Death' was associated with sustained popu- lation falls of an estimated 30-50% in western Europe, and it continued towreak havoc on urban populations until the late seventeenth century, killing an estimated quarter ofLondon's population in 1665. Typhus, which 'ship fever' and 'gaol fever' was a major cause of the high mortality historically associated with harvest failures, warfare and other causes of social dislocation, had largely disap- peared from England by the mid-nine- teenth century. Malaria (Plasmodium vivax) was a major cause of high mor-Romola Davenport and Richard Smith, Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, explore the history and evolution of public health, in this article The early history of public health from an evolutionary perspective 292PROFILE tality and ill-health in low-lying areas of southern and eastern England until the early nineteenth century. Smallpox is estimated to have caused 5-10% of all deaths in England in the eighteenth-century, and accounted for 20% of all burials in mid-eigh- teenth-century Manchester. However, following the introduction of vaccina- tion from 1800 smallpox was reduced to a minor cause of death, accounting for roughly 1% of deaths by 1850. Pandemic cholera spread across Europe in the 1830s and returned in repeated waves across the nineteenth century, however, Britain was preco- cious in preventing major outbreaks after 1866. By the mid-nineteenth-century the most terrifying epidemic diseases had almost disappeared from England, and infectious disease mortality pat- terns were dominated by 'childhood' diseases such as measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough and diphthe-ria, by tuberculosis, and by respiratory diseases. This represented a major change in the structure of mortality, from a regime where even young and robust adults were at risk of epidemic diseases and wealth conferred little protection, to a regime characterised by increasing social inequalities in life expectancy, and the concentration of mortality at the extremes of life, in early childhood and old age. These changes occurred largely before the development of the Victorian death registration system and the system- atic collection of vital statistics, and therefore, the mid-nineteenth century is often treated as reflecting the tradi- tional pattern of mortality before the onset of the modern 'Mortality Revolution', rather than a novel and probably unprecedented stage in the development of modern disease control. What explains the pattern in Figure 1? Why did less virulent diseases take longer to control? Theories of the evo-lution of virulence and pathogen life histories developed in the past forty years in the field of evolutionary biol- ogy offer insights into these historical trends. In the case of diseases that are primarily transmitted directly from person to person, such as measles, chickenpox and whooping cough (pertussis) and most other respiratory pathogens, then there is a trade-off between transmission and virulence. Briefly, for transmission between hosts to occur, the infected host must contact a susceptible second host. This is less likely when the disease is virulent enough to render the host bed-ridden, hideously disfigured or, more obviously, dead. Therefore, there is natural selection in such cases for a mild infection thatleaves the host able to walk about and interact with others. However, virulence is also selected for, becauseit is associated with high levels of pathogen reproduction within infected hosts. High reproduction rates favour 293PROFILE plague typhus smallpox malariacholeratyphoidtuberculosisscarlet fever measlesdiphtheriapertussisvector-borne persistent in environmentwaterborneperson to persondeaths per 100 infections period of onset of decline<1700 1700-1849 1850-1899 1900-1944020406080 Figure 1. Diseases that declined before 1945 in England, by virulence and period of onset of decline. Key transmission routes for the diseases are also indicated. 294PROFILE the survival of the pathogen against host defences, promotes the success of more rapidly growing lineages, and increase the volume of pathogens coughed up or otherwise excreted. In the case of smallpox death often occurred due to the blocking of capillaries by the sheer volume of viral smallpox particles. Importantly, the trade-off between within-host reproduction (associated with virulence) and transmission between hosts is lessened, or absent, where alternatives to person-to- person transmission have evolved.This is especially evident in the case of bubonic plague, where humans are not a normal part of the cycle of dis- ease from flea to rodent to flea and, therefore, the survival of the human host has not been subject to much, if any, evolutionary selection. In the case of Asiatic cholera, the very virulent nineteenth-century cholera subtype, infection rendered the victim prostrate within hours. However, the bacteria reproduced in very high numbers in the gut and released toxins that made theintestines leaky, causing massive fluid loss that carried the pathogens onto clothing and bedding as well as faecal discharges, and thence into water- courses when these were washed or disposed of. Where there was inade- quate separation of drinking water and sewage then this proved a very effective transmission route, despite the death of the victim. Current strains of cholera are much milder,and the evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald, a key exponent of the role oflife histories in trade-off theory, has argued that this reflects selectionagainst waterborne transmission and in favour of person-to-person trans- mission as a result of the enormous improvements in water quality since the mid-twentieth century. \"Smallpox is estimated to have caused 5-10% of all deaths in England in the eighteenth-century, and accounted for 20% of all burials in mid-eighteenth- century Manchester.\" The high potential virulence of pathogens with alternative transmis- sion pathways may have been associ- ated with early control, at least in an English context, precisely because these transmission pathways were rel- atively easy to disrupt (compared with highly infectious 'crowd' diseases). Paul Slack argued in the case of plague that the steps required for the import of plague-infected rodents and fleas into English ports, and for the subse- quent propagation of a human epi- demic, constituted a tenuous chain of transmission that could be disruptedeven by relatively incomplete or crude quarantine measures (although much more stringent measures were required in continental Europe, where import was much more frequent). Similar arguments can be applied to other lethal diseases; that is, the chain of transmission was tenuous to be broken by early public health interven- tions, or as the unintended conse- quence of other changes such as the drainage of swampy land. These pro- cesses probably occurred more readily, and at less expense, in England than in continental Europe for example because its island status reduced the frequency of disease importation, andin the case of malaria, it was a relatively marginal environment for mosquitoes. If this theory is correct, then it implies a large role for early public health interventions in the first stages of mor- tality decline. These interventions have probably been under-appreciated in the history of medicine and health because they were crude and incom- plete compared with later efforts. However, we suggest that these early interventions were directed at the 'low-hanging fruit', and yielded dispro- portionately high returns. As the most lethal diseases were controlled then much greater efforts were required to reduce mortality from very infectious but less lethal diseases of childhood and poverty. Similar processes were probably at work globally in the first half of the twentieth century, butagain the patchy availability of data makes them difficult to discern.

CONTACTeditorial@openaccessgovernment.orgNEWS, VIEWS AND OPINION www.openaccessgovernment.orgGOVERNMENTOPEN ACCESS Creating mixed communities to counter the negative effects of segregation has received much scepticism from the perspective of academics. Bolt & Van Kempen (2013) distinguish between three types of critical arguments in the literature. Thefirst argument is that mixing does not address the real problem. Mixing policy is a way of treating the symp- toms of inequality rather than the causes. The second argument is that mixing has negative side effects, like forced relocations and the diminish-ment of the public housing sector. The final - and probably also the most discussed - argument is that mixing does not work. Most of the expected positive effects of the social mix rely on the development of bridging social capital but in practice, social interac-tions between members of different social groups are quite rare. At the same time, Bolt & Van Kempen also add nuance to the academic debate by stressing that contextual factors play a role in the success of the social mix or the lack thereof. Not all social mix projects have disap-pointing outcomes. Whether projects succeed depends on a combination of different factors, like the quality of the architecture and the public space, levels of investments in communitydevelopment, the level of heterogeneityof the residents and the specific spatial configuration of the project. Magic mix Pierik (2019) made an inventory of the factors that stimulate social interac- tions within mixed housing projects in the Netherlands. He looked at a specific type of mixed housing, whichis coined as 'magic mix.' A magic mixproject is a project in which a combi- nation of vulnerable residents and supportive residents are housed within one housing complex. Examples of vulnerable categories are refugees,homeless people and people with intellectual or psychiatric disabilities.Supportive residents tend to be young households, for whom a magic mix project can be a shortcut to the entry on the housing market as they can bypass the waiting lists for regular social housing. Supportive resident are not the formal caretakers for the vulnerable residents, but they are requested to invest time in organising activities and engaging with vulnera- ble residents. In some projects, sup- portive residents get a temporary residence contract, in other projects they get a permanent contract. The projects vary in scale. The largest case study in Pierik's research consisted of 540 dwellings and the smallest hadGideon Bolt & Rutger Pierik from Utrecht University share their expert thoughts on social interaction in mixed building blocks when it comes to finding the 'magic mix' in the academic literature concerning the housing market 296PROFILE The housing market: Social interaction in mixed building blocks - finding the 'magic mix' only 30 dwellings. Bases on 14 in-depth interviews with researchers, architects, urban designers and representatives of housing corporations and care organisations, Pierik (2019) made an inventory of the factors that stimulate social interaction between vulnerable and supportive residents. Physical factors stimulating social interactions The following physical factors may help to stimulate social interactions between residents. Size: In large complexes, there is a higher risk of feelings of unsafety and anonymity. It is better to strive for relatively small complexes (a maximum of 150 units). Larger com- plexes are feasible if they are split upin smaller compartments. Communal space: A communal space is crucial for the organisation of activities like having dinner together or playing games. As it should function like a living room, it is crucial to create multiple commu- nal spaces in the larger projects, for example, one living room per storey. A living room for each 10-20 person is seen as optimal. Transition zone: There should be a smooth transition between private and public space. For instance, a small garden in front of the apart- ments at the ground level may stim-ulate interactions with passers-by,while a hard demarcation line may lead to retreatment (e.g. having the curtains closed all day). Entrance: The entrance should be designed in a way that it is a welcom- ing place. In this way, fluid encoun- ters or chats between residents arestimulated.Corridors: Wide corridors not only enhance the feelings of privacy (people pass by at a larger distance) but also make it easier for people to appropriate this space (for instance by placing chairs). At the same time, this stimulates fluid encounters with other residents. \"A magic mix project is a project in which a combination of vulnerable residents and supportive residents are housed within one housing complex. Examples of vulnerable categories are refugees, homeless people and people with intellectual or psychiatric disabilities.\" Floor plan: Locating the kitchen at the side of the corridor enables light interactions with passers-by. (In the kitchen, there is less need of privacy than in - for instance - a sleeping room). Amenities: Amenities at the ground floor level (like cafes or shops) stim- ulate interactions between residents within the complex as well as with residents in the rest of the neigh- bourhood. Social factors stimulating social interactions While physical factors are helpful in creating the right conditions for social interactions, other factors are probably more important. For instance, the roleof caretaker is crucial. The caretaker is taking care of the management of thebuilding on behalf of the housing asso- ciation. His role is not only to make sure the complex is maintained well but also to intervene in conflict situa- tions and to help stimulate communal activities. Next to that, much emphasis is placed on the self-management of the residents. To stimulate self-man-agement, residents associations areestablished and several commissions are formed, focused on - for example - the organisation of communal activities, selection of new residents or maintenance of the communal garden. Perhaps the most crucial factor in the success of magic mix projects is the selection of supportive residents. A careful screening process is needed to exclude young people who only apply for these projects to find a dwelling as soon as possible. These people are not likely to invest time in communal activities. Although the requirements in the residence contract concerning investment in the community are not watertight in a legal sense, most projects have succeeded in attracting residents that are committed to the public good.

So, what is unique about our approach at the Alexanderson Institute? In a word, it's openness. Every window is wide open. We are always looking for the best sources of experienceand knowledge, while continuously developing new tools. We mix everyday ingredients of many and varying kinds, and we are happy to let others contribute to the result. We season with untested approaches and new solutions. There is a greatdeal of fresh thinking in everything we do at the Alexanderson Institute. But creativity does not automatically lead to success. Instead, development is driven by experimentation, while also letting those around us contribute, become engaged and judge what we do - often receiving a surprise or two in theprocess. The important thing is that the results of these efforts provide insight, vitality and value to others. We want everyone who contributes to help ensure the results are passed on. That is how organic development is created.REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN SWEDEN THE STORY OF AN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT LAB WHEN YOU PASS THROUGH THE DOORS OF THE ALEXANDERSON INSTITUTE IN SWEDEN, IT IS LIKE SETTING FOOT IN ANADVANCED INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT LAB. IN THIS HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTE, NEW AND EXCITING METHODSARE CREATED TO PROMOTE FUTURE GROWTH, AS WE NOW DISCOVERREVOLUTIONARY YEARS Ten years have passed since the official opening of the Alexanderson Institute, or AI as we call it. The concept of \"Competitive Knowledge\" is central to the Institute's philosophy. Our interpretation is clear: we always start from the conditions and needs of those around us before adding the value and benefit that is demanded. We have pursued this approach in real-life situations - with striking results. Right from the beginning, we had a strong position, enjoying goodwill within the EU-financed projects we participated in. And throughout these years, we have strengthened our position. Today, we are seen as a potential partner in many of the development programmes that established organisations compete to take part in. The reason for this is largely thanks to the way we success- fully deliver value for money. It is through this funding and the tangible benefits offered by international networks that value is created for us in our region and in the regions we work with. It's about give and take - and building confidence between people. THE THREE WISE Ms We are constantly striving to clarify not only our role in the complex interplay of synergies around the development of the region but also how business and public organisations can expect to benefit.We explain this through our three Ms - mediator, meeting place and a motor for competitive knowl- edge. Our activities revolve around these concepts. The Alexanderson Institute facilitates the flow of knowledge, experience and competence. We offer an infrastructure for creating meetings and networks, which, in turn, generate new ideas, methods, business and returns. The motor, the third component, is a result of the other two. A POSITION IN THE VALUE SOCIETY The Alexanderson Institute is located in the region of Halland, Sweden. This is where we have our roots and where we wish to share our success. Equally important for the future is being part of the same value region. Today, value solidarity is even more important than physical solidarity - thanksto the rapid growth of digital infrastructure. For the first time in history, groups of individuals, companies and organisations can establish value links in new ways. Who is to say that a person or company, or even a municipality, derives the greatest benefit from its closest neighbours, when it is just as easy, or even easier, to maintain contact and exchange experience with kindred spirits on the other side of the world? Thanks to its growing international networks, the Alexanderson Institute has created strong links to a value-based region. Every day, we meet people and organisations who are on the same wavelength as we are - and who want to partner with us in developing the future. In Halland, we are the leading player in the new international value arenas. We open doors. We give all those in our networks access to these arenas. And this is just the beginning. A GROWING KNOWLEDGE ORGANISATION The Alexanderson Institute and Campus Varberg are developing in tandem and have built up unique network-based structures. The Alexanderson Institute is in collaboration with governmental and regional platforms, municipalities, universities and national SME's, and is involved in several key EU projects. Campus Varberg through the university programme and vocational college, in conjunction with other seats of learning, are complemented by key contacts in business and the public sector. www.alexandersoninstitutet.seTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT 300Rebalancing the economy - our time is now The recent cross-party Treasury Committee inquiry into Regional Imbalances in the UK Economy, which set out to examine the nature of regional imbalances in economic growth which exist in the UK, isa welcome development. Whilst we wait the outcome of the inquiry a joined-up approach to this issue is truly needed, there is certainly no shortage of evidence out there around the disparitiesand dierences that exists between dierent areas - north and south, towns and cities and urban and rural. Analysis from Communities in Charge , a coalition of community leaders and charities, found that the UK's poorest regions could lose hundreds of millions of pounds of funding to London and the South East after Brexit. The comparison of UK government spending oneconomic development with distribution of European Union (EU) structural funds revealed signicant regional dierences between the way in which the EU and the UK allocates funding for economic development. Communities fear that if the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF) is distributed in the same way the government allocates current spending on economic aairs, it will unfairly benet more prosperous areas. Communities in Charge have warned that economic development funding is set to \"follow the regional pattern of existing UK programmes and end up increasing regional inequalities rather than reducing them\". We know that a dierent approach is needed. Our own consultation on the UKSPF, published in April 2019, provided insight on what the new fund could and should look like and how it must operate in order for it to be successful. However, at the time of writing (although admittedly only a week into Boris Johnson's reign as PM), we remain none the wiser on exactlywhen the government consultation on the design ofthe fund will take place and how much money will be allocated and how it will be distributed. These latest warnings are not new. The Cities Outlook 2019 report, published by the Centre for Cities, high- lighted the consequence of the government withdraw- ing almost all domestic economic development funds for the regions ten years ago. The report showed that cuts to all spending areas minus social care, where there has been a need to make up for shortfalls, have been deeper in English cities. Economic developmenthas fallen particularly in urban areas - spending is down 43% compared to 24% elsewhere. This means that social care has taken up a growing share of overall spending, rising from 38% of spending in cities in 2009-10 to 46% in 2017-18. At the start of the period four cities spent more than half of their budgets on social care. By 2017-18 half of all cities did so. At the same time, the report highlights the importance of cities to the economy. Despite covering just 9% of land, British cities account for 54% of the population, 63% of economic output and 71% of knowledge services jobs. This concentration of the UK economy in specic places occurs because of the benets that cities provide - namely access to lots of workers andproximity to other businesses. And their role goes beyond direct economic links. Because of their scale, they are able to support a greater number of specialisms and provide a wider range of services, also impactingsurrounding areas. Yet despite their scale, many of the biggest cities punch below their weight. Cities such as Manchester, Birm- ingham, Liverpool and Sheeld lag the national aver- age on productivity and a range of other indicators, when they should be leading it. Generally, cities haveNigel Wilcock is Executive Director of the Institute of Economic Development and says that when it comes to rebalancing the economy - our time is now301been hit hardest by austerity. As a whole, there has been an 18% fall in the day-to-day spending by local government in cities between 2009-10 and 2017-18, compared to a 9% fall elsewhere. This meant that British cities - home to 55% of the population - have shouldered 74% of the total cuts to local government's day-to-day spending. \"There is a lot to consider - but our time for rebalancing the economy is now. To ignore the differing roles that different parts of Britain - be they cities, towns or more rural areas - play in the national economy is to misunderstand an important part of how the economy functions.\" To quote The Cities Outlook 2019 report directly: \"In orout of the EU, for the UK economy to be more prosper- ous it needs its cities to make a larger contribution than they currently do.\" We are now seeing on the-ground campaigns for change. For example, across thenorth of England have reached a critical level, more than 30 local and regional newspapers and media out- lets (alongside major political and business leaders) have called on the government to revolutionise the way the region is governed. Papers including the Sheeld Star, Manchester Evening News and Liverpool Echo have demanded \"a fundamental shift in decision- making out of London, giving devolved powers and self-determination to people in the north\". At the same time, we need to champion the rural econ- omy. In April, the House of Lords Select Committee on the Rural Economy called on the government to develop a rural strategy and help realise the potential of rural economies. I have previously said that rural communi- ties are likely to face the most serious economic issues of any locations in the UK over the next 20-30 years andthe 'Fourth Industrial Revolution' is likely to create an existential threat to many. Priority interventions to avoid catastrophe must include digital connectivity, housing, business hubs, community self-help, mobility clubs and decarbonising heat, but rural economic development urgently needs a longer term strategic approach. Balanced growth is an issue for all UK residents. Better balance will ensure that public assets are used moreevenly and eciently - avoiding issues such as under- utilised schools, hospitals and transport networks in some locations and pressure from overcrowding in others. A balanced economy can also, in the long-term, avoid the payment of subsidies to support under-per- forming areas and allow improved public nances from greater taxation revenues from across all parts of the UK. Finally, socially and politically, there is surely a need to avoid parts of the country feeling increasingly left behind. There is a lot to consider - but our time for rebalancing the economy is now. To ignore the diering roles that dierent parts of Britain - be they cities, towns or more rural areas - play in the national economy is to misunderstand an important part of how the economy functions.

Signs of ecolog-ical collapse are getting clearer by the day. Parts of the earth might soon be too hot to live in, more people aregetting killed in floods, forest res and heatwaves every year, putting humankind's very survival at risk. Young people across Europe and the world, led by Swedish 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, have taken to the streets to demand more andstronger climate and green policies. The call has not gone unheard and the proof lies in the ballot box, as Europeans in many countries have increasingly backed green parties at the last elections. But time is short: We must accelerate reforms. The EESC has been since a long time at the forefront in pressing for the delivery of the 2030 Agenda. The2030 Agenda is the strategy through which the Euro- pean Union (EU) can become the world champion of the sustainable competitiveness that balances economicprosperity, environmental issues and social inclusive- ness. As EESC president, I am utterly convinced that the 2030 Agenda is a win/win strategy for the employers, the workers and the civil society. When EU leaders failed to agree on an EU-wide target to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050 last June, many were disappointed. But the deal is not o the table. Finland, who currently holds the EU presidency, is eager to get it done by the end of the year. The UN is holding a climate summit in September in New York City, which could bring new momentum to the negoti- ations. At the same time, we have a new European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who has pledged to present a \"green deal\" for Europe in her rst100 days in oce and legislate to achieve \"climate neutrality\" across the EU by 2050. Is all this a bit more reassuring? Surely. However, we need to understand that grand policies go hand in hand with micro policies. Everything that contributes to reduce our carbon footprint needs to be thought through, not only at EU level but also at the national, regional and city level. \"New laws brokered last year, if fully implemented, could help the EU achieve around 45% emissions cuts by 2030. But countries are not on track to reach that objective.\" In Europe, 210 mayors from all across the continent recently called for more ambitious emission reduction targets. And other local and regional authorities have declared climate emergencies in their constituencies to raise awareness about the issue. So far, countries even the one leading the way on climate,like Finland, Sweden or Germany fall short on coming up with concrete measures to achieve ambitious carbon reduction objectives. In June, the European Commission issued its recom- mendations on the draft national energy and climate plans (NECPs) submitted by the 28 EU member states to achieve their 2030 objectives and called for \"stronger ambition, more policy detail, better-specied investment needs, or more work on social fairness.\" The plans are not up to target. For example, renewable energy deployment could fall short by 1.6 percentage points against a 32% target for 2030. Energy eciency measures risk leaving a gap of 6.2 percentage pointsversus a 32.5% benchmark.Luca Jahier, President of the European Economic and Social Committee, argues that climate doesn't wait but more ambition and accelerated action on it is needed in EuropeENVIRONMENT 303Member states will come up 2% short in sectors like agriculture, ground transport and buildings, which are not covered by the EU's carbon trading system. The current trajectory is heading for 28% cuts rather than the agreed 30%. At best, the National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) could achieve an overall greenhouse gas reduction of 40% compared to 1990 levels, the EU's ocial target, which is now largely considered outdated since it was agreed in 2014 before the Paris Agreement was signed. The European Parliament, as well as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, have called for that goal to be ratcheted up to 55%, saying that would bring the EU in line with its Paris commitments.New laws brokered last year, if fully implemented, could help the EU achieve around 45% emissions cuts by 2030. But countries are not on track to reach that objective. Member states have now six months to raise their national ambition. In the meantime, the EU, which will start negotiations on its multi-annual nancialframework (MFF) must follow suit. To launch a genuine Green Deal, as President Von Der Leyen proposed, the EU must give itself the means. \"In Europe, 210 mayors from all across the continent recently called for more ambitious emission reduction targets. And other local and regional authorities have declared climate emergencies in their constituencies to raise awareness about the issue.\" The EESC has made it clear that the Commission's proposal does not seem ambitious enough in thatregard. We think that the current 1% ceiling for the EU's expenditure be increased to 1.3% of GNI. The MFF is not a book-keeping exercise, it is a political act. It is about providing, or not providing, the European Union with the means to deliver its agenda: a sustainable future for 500 million citizens. We need more political acts as climate doesn't wait. Luca JahierPresident European Economic and Social 90 11 www.eesc.europa.eu www.twitter.com/EU_EESC Luca JahierGlobal climate change has very different regional impacts that are already being felt today (IPCC 2019, IPCC 2018). For deci- sion-makers in politics, administration and business, this means an increasing need for specific information to adapt adequately to the current and future impacts of climate change. The Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS) works to address these needs by developing user-oriented informationand consulting services, verifying them in practice and striving for their operational use by companies, such as consultancies or engineering offices. To further promote operational climate services and scale-up their societal use, GERICS has analysed in a project called \"Bridging the Gap\", how climate services can be transferred from research institutions to commer- cial providers. The process behind thistransfer is commonly referred to as technology transfer (Br\u00e4utigam & Gerybadze 2011). Successful technol- ogy transfer enables research institu-tions to increase the societal influenceof their own research and to actively transfer the developed prototypes to operational providers and, thus, mul- tiply them. There is consensus in thepolitical environment that the poten- tial of technology transfer in non-uni- versity research is not yet sufficientlyexploited (Otto et al. 2015). Depending on the service or product, specific barriers and, thus, new challenges can arise and this is particularly true in a field as youthful as climate services, where experience relating to technol- ogy transfer is limited. GERICS, therefore, extended the com- monly used and established technol- ogy transfer process and its findings to the area of climate services to identify specific barriers related to the transfer of climate services and possible solutions to overcome them. Since several technology transfer procedures exist but none for climate services, in particular, a new procedure has been developed (see figure 1). Parts of the procedure can be carried out simultaneously (e.g. the evaluation of the commercial potential and the analysis of the intellectual property framework). It can be described in the following five steps: Internal product analysis with prod- uct developers (1). Evaluation of the commercial poten- tial of the climate service (2). Analysis of the intellectual property framework conditions (3). Analysis of the technical framework and potential adjustments (4).Establishing a commercial exploita- tion strategy for the climate service (5). As part of the project Bridging the Gap, various methods, such as the \"Business Model Canvas\", \"Workshops\"and \"Qualitative Interviews\" have been applied to identify barriers within the climate service technology procedure. By doing so, barriers were revealed in the areas of commercial potential, intellectual property (IP) and technical framework. For example, parts of the commercial potential of climate services e.g. willingness topay, are not described in known liter- ature and, therefore, identified as abarrier to climate service technology transfer. To research the commercial potential, interviews were conducted with companies in Germany. The results showed that some companies consider the topic of adaptation to climate change as relevant to them and that they are willing to pay for climate service products. Hence, the commercial potential of climate service products, in general, exists. Also, further identified barriers, such as an unawareness of potential multi- pliers (companies, who sell a licensed climate service product) of climate services, should be identified and addressed by scientific institutionsJulius Pr\u00f6ll from the Climate Service Center Germany turns our attention to the importance of bridging the gap between researchinstitutions and commercial multipliers of climate services 304PROFILE Bridging the gap between research institutions and commercial multipliers of climate servicesearly on during the prototype devel- opment process. Moreover, not only should the requirements of the end-user be taken into account by research institutions, but also those of the potential multiplier, to facilitate an increased societal relevant climate service technology transfer in the future. Overall, for future climate ser- vice technology transfer, the identified barriers can probably be overcome when taken into account early on during development and are coordi- nated by a technology transfer manager. In order to support this, a solution catalogue, containing barri- ers and their solutions has been developed (see an excerpt in figure 2). Furthermore, strategic support for technology transfer from the manage- ment must exist and an entrepreneur- ship culture should be promoted. By doing so, the societal impact of climate services can be increased by research institutions.

After thorough consider- ation, it was decided that it was not worth the money. And even though many of the younger dinosaurs kepton telling their parents that they were really scared of the shooting stars they occasionally saw, the older and wiser dinosaurs assured them that shooting stars were beautiful and not something to be scared about. Joking aside, we of course know that dinosaurs did not have the capacity tounderstand this risk, let alone preparea mitigation. That is why it is even more surprising that the apparently most intelligent species that ever walked on this planet does not use its knowledge, intelligence, and combined resources to address the greatest threat to our existence. Let us look at the facts. There is an over 90% consensus amongst climate scientist, globally,that we are heading towards a climate catastrophe. Scientists that say that this is nonsense turn out to be experts in fields that have little to do with the climate of our planet. Changing weather patterns have already nega- tively impacted global agriculture and recent extreme weather events clearlypushed humanity to its limits. 40+ degrees Celsius might be nothing more than a warm day in the Middle East, though across Europe, where houses were not built for such tem- peratures and where humidity levels are significantly higher, the situation had been life-threatening. And not just for humans. Bees are starving because they are coming out of their winter sleep earlier than they should and plants are dying because temperatures and rainfall are not as they used to be. The severity of the situation seems so overwhelming that it is hard to imagine there is still a way to resolve it. When we look at theLaszlo Giricz, Founder and CEO, discusses the work underway at Poseidon to provide solutions for greenhouse gas emissions during the current battle against the climate change emergency 306 PROFILE Fighting the war against climate change wide-spread political and social issues that around four million wartime refugees from Syria have caused across Europe, the predicted hundreds of millions of climate refugees globally seem like an unsolvable challenge. It is clear that understanding this threat is not enough and unfortunately, global action is still far from what it needs to be. In the year 2015, 197 countries signed the Paris Agreement and agreed that the temperature rise compared to pre-industrial levels had to remain below 1.5 degrees Celsius. It was an unprecedented unanimous agreement across all parties of the United Nations that climate change is a severe threat to human existence. Unfortunately, according to Climate Action Tracker , less than 4% of those countries have done enough to keep temperature rise below 2 degrees. Luckily, there is a growing number of eco warriors who understand that the time to act is now. They dedicate their lives towards making this world a better place for all of humanity and they use all their resources to achieve this goal. One of these eco warriors is Laszlo Giricz, the founder of Poseidon. While living in Singapore, he was exposed to the yearly haze, when smoke from largely illegal deforesta- tion in Indonesia results in a significant reduction of visibility and air quality across Southeast Asia. He knew some- thing had to be done, and in 2017, Poseidon was born. Poseidonat its core is the dream that a future where every consumption isturned into positive action truly is possible. Everything, really everythingthat is purchased has an impact on our environment. Whether it is a product or a service, consumption impacts the people and the ecosystems around us.When that impact is negative, both long-term and short-term solutions are required. In the long-term, solutions are required that reduce or ideally even eliminate negative effects. In the short-term, unavoidable negative impacts need to be addressed withpositive action. A utopian future where all transporta- tion will be environmentally friendly, perhaps using electric engines or hydrogen-powered, seems possible. Being realistic, it is clear that this will take decades and not just a few years. What can be done until then? What if it would be possible to address all the negative impacts today by doing good somewhere else? What if releasing a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere could be addressed by ensuring more than that amount is protected somewhere else? Poseidon has successfully been providing a solution for greenhouse gas emissions to corporations like the ice-cream brand Ben & Jerry's , the supercar manufacturer the shoe brand Vivobarefoot , and even govern- ment entities like the council of the iconic city of Liverpool . Since May 2018, Poseidon connected real-word positive impact, protecting the rainforest of Cordillera Azul in the Peruvian Amazon , with the emissions created by everything from shoes to city councils. Of course, the ultimate solution has to be the significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Until that day, Poseidon's platform bridges the gap. To give a more detailed look at the solution, first, the climate impact is qualified and quantified, as for exam- ple the greenhouse gas emissions of the city council of Liverpool throughCarbon Trust. Then, more than the negative impact, more than the green- house gas emissions that the city council is responsible for, is protected by saving an appropriate area of rain- forest from deforestation. By having a greater positive than negative impact, the activities of Liverpool City Council were turned into climate action. And to ensure traceability and trans- parency, Poseidon is using the envi- ronmentally-friendly Stellar blockchain technology to provide verifiable proof of positive action. It is a real solution using cutting-edge technology that is available today. The sheer size of environmental and social challenges globally is overwhelm- ing. A few dozen years ago, there would have probably been very little hope. Today, with the revolutionary solutions Poseidon and other eco warriors are creating, the tools to avert a climate catastrophe are available. It is still possible to change course and rescue an environment that is able to support life on Earth. Poseidon's platform can empower everyone to be part of thesolution and hopefully, humans will not end up like dinosaurs.

For instance, climate change is increasing the levels of exposure of aquatic organisms to UV radiation by reducing the thickness and duration of snow and ice cover, melting of glaciers and permafrost and increases in heavy precipitation. While UV radiation directly damages the health of environmental organisms, less recognised effects include the forma- tion of micro-plastic pollutants, with bioaccumulation in food chains and increased toxicity of contaminants,such as pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. \"Legacy\" pollutants are manmade chemicals that can persist in the environment after banning and end of discharging. Top concern legacy pollutants have been produced at great amounts, bioaccumulate in food chains and show toxicological proper- ties that can affect the current, as well as the next generations, such as endocrine disruption. The chlorinated pesticides identified as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) under the Stockholm Convention share such features (2001 and successive updates): the most well-known is DDT, but the and hexachlorocycloexanes andseveral their lipophylicity, measuring such chemicals in adipose tissues and eggs of animals can indicate anthropogenic influences in remote ecosystems, e.g., the Arctic. \"In an unlucky scenario, the widespread and increasing presence of pesticides residues in important and vulnerable food sources (e.g., seafood, milk from ruminants on pasture) might pose unpleasant choices to risk managers, such as salvaging food availability while weakening food safety standards.\" Despite their persistence, chlorinated pesticides are not eternal; after the ban, their presence in the environ- ments and food chains have shown slow but consistent declining trends over decades, as stated, e.g., by their assessments as contaminants in feeds by the European Food Safety Authority. Moreover, a portion of pollutants is trapped (or \"scavenged\") within some environmental comparts, such as permafrost. Long-range atmospheric transport is a major pathway for delivering POPs to the water and terrestrial environ-ments; atmospheric patterns can be altered and possibly increased, by global warming, which calls for updates of the models to predict and monitorPOPs travelling. Snow and permafrost melting will provide an output of newlybioavailable molecules: deposition into sediments of rivers and seas will lead to uptake by food webs, including those relevant to our diet. As melting accelerates under climate warming, the release of trapped chemicals may also increase, likely following a seasonal pattern, with possible pulses: the seasonal patterns of melting processes may also alter the exchange rates between air and seawater. Warming and continued decline in sea ice are also likely to result in shifts in food web structure, which in their turn, would modulate the deposition of pollutants in seafood, mainly large fatty fishes but also sediment-dwelling organisms such as shellfish. The direction andextent of the above-mentioned modi- fications are currently difficult to assess and more data on a range of trophic levels are needed to estimate the possible increased exposure ofhuman diet, either globally and for specific populations, e.g., communities from the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. The potential for exposure is not thesame for all chlorinated pesticides. For instance, DDT metabolites and hexachlorobenzene feature among the most persistent and bioaccumu- lating substances of the group; lin- dane is more toxic but definitely less persistent than its manufacturing by-product beta-hexachlorocycloexane.Alberto Mantovani and Francesca Baldi - Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 in Rome, Italy, explain to us how the global issue of climate change is modifying our views on risks to the environment with comment on the main effects of chlorinated pesticidesClimate change: Modifying our views on environmental risks 308PROFILEOne might say that the release of banned pesticides is the least of concerns related to climate change. However, let's consider the implica- tions: from a social and economic standpoint, an increased presence in food and feedstuffs of toxic sub- stances, for which legal limits exist, isa source of national and international alerts, calling for increased controls of raw materials by enterprises andpublic bodies, disrupting global trade and weakening the confidence ofconsumers. In an unlucky scenario, the widespread and increasing pres- ence of pesticides residues in impor- tant and vulnerable food sources (e.g., seafood, milk from ruminants on pas- ture) might pose unpleasant choices to risk managers, such as salvaging food availability while weakening food safety standards. What would be the actual health risks? Significant uncer- tainties do exist. The current tolerable limits in feeds and foods for chlori-nated pesticides are based on out- dated data sets: after the ban, only limited research has been carried in order to update health-based guidance values. Yet, according to available data from independent research, the main effects of chlori- nated pesticides include disruption of steroid and thyroid hormonal axes, altered development of neurobehav- ioral and/or immune functions, altered metabolism in liver and adiposetissue. Such effects are of top concern for the international risk assessment community and since the last decade, a major effort is ongoing to update toxicological testing to characterisesuch effects more properly. In practice, we currently have a fairly accurate view of how many residuesof chlorinated insecticides are in foods and feeds and also increasing data on human biomonitoring; con- versely, we have many uncertainties to assess whether such exposure levels might pose a risk to the general population or vulnerable groups (unborn children, toddlers). Last, but not least, the mixture issue must be considered. These pollutants often occur together, in the same matrices (e.g., lipid-rich foods); while the individual levels are usually very low, many substances share toxicological modes of action and effects: forinstance, DDT, lindane, beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, all may exert estrogen-like actions. The available evidence call for a new risk assessment, where individual sub- stances are grouped based on their toxicological properties. The release of currently trapped persistent pollu- tants may, therefore, be a real issue. \"While UV radiation directly damages the health of environmental organisms, less recognised effects include the formation of micro-plastic pollutants, with bioaccumulation in food chains and increased toxicity of contaminants, such as pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\" So what do we do? The global action against emissions that increase climate change must go on and for now, some specific actions can be envisaged: targeted monitoring of ecosystems for a timely identification of trends; updating of guidance values in envi- ronments, foods and feeds with thesupport of new research and mod- elling; considering the mixture issue for risk assessment; targeted monitor- ing of the most vulnerable food chainto prevent health risks. It may be useful to set \"alert\" (calling for atten- tion and investigation in depth) and \"action\" (calling for risk mitigation) levels for the most prevalent chlori- nated pesticides (including metabo- lites and by-products): this couldfacilitate the (sometimes-uneasy) job of risk managers. In the area of Anthropocene, the assessment of the impact of environ- mental changes must include the assessment of their effects on pres- ence, persistence, kinetics and toxicity of chemicals spread by human activi-ties into the environment. The assess- ment has to be pursued with a \"One Health\" approach, linking ecosystems, feed and food production chains and human health.

According to studies performed by the Economist Intelligence Unit , a rise in global temperatures of six degrees (which is the worst-case scenario) would inflict $43 trillion of losses on investment portfolios. This is around 30% of the entire stock of manageable assets. Consequently, a transition to an inclusive green economy is vital. In 2008 the UN created the Green Economy Initiative , aimed at encouraging governments to invest in protecting our environment. They dened the 'green economy as one that results in improvedhuman well-being and social equity, while signicantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.' In order to achieve a green economy, the UN encour-aged a focus on; 'circularity, collaboration, solidarity,resilience, opportunity and interdependence.' During the past decade, there has been a focus on the circularity element. The concept of moving away from the linear economy to the circular economy has been prevalent. Traditionally, our economic model was basedon the linear approach. In other words; take, make anddispose. We would recklessly extract precious materials from the ground, make them into products (which had a short life span) and then we would landll the items when we no longer wanted them. These used items were claimed to be worthless. However, we know this is far from the truth. Items made from precious materials, extracted from the ground are nite. They have a lot of value. This is where the circular economy comes in. The idea that we must consider the end of life process of items being manufactured. The circular economy is based on a model which instead of land-lling products saves them.Not only is less waste better for the environment but it is also better for our economy. Businesses that recycle save costs on extraction. For example, recycling one ton of iPhones will yield 300 times more gold than extracting one ton of gold ore. Other aspects of the green economy involve investing in environmental projects. For example, carbon osetting enables companies or governments to buy carbon credits. This means that carbon emitted can be balanced out by carbon credits purchased. In this way, a company or country can be deemed ' carbon neutral ,' without having to actually stop emitting carbon dioxide. \"According to studies performed by the Economist Intelligence Unit, a rise in global temperatures of six degrees (which is the worst-case scenario) would inflict $43 trillion of losses on investment portfolios. This is around 30% of the entire stock of manageable assets.\" In theory, a company can emit as many tonnes of carbon dioxide as they like but if they buy back the number of tonnes emitted, they can write on their website they are carbon neutral. Transitioning to a low carbon economy in this way is not necessarily the answer. In order to avoid nancial and environmental disaster, we need to ensure that the green economy is executed eciently. https://compareyourfootprint.comWhen it comes to transitioning to a green economy and the extent to which carbon offsetting is the answer, William Richardson, Founder and Managing Director of Green Element provides his thoughts William RichardsonFounder and Managing Director Green Element Tel: +44 (0)207 0960 054 info@greenelement.co.ukwww.greenelement.co.uk www.twitter.com/Green_ElementMany voices say there is crisis all over - and mistrust in politicians and politics. But is it all that bad? The new European Commission sends a strong signal of collaboration and bold ambitions. It is good to see three competitors for the presidency - Ursula von der Leyen, Frans Timmermans, and Margarethe Vestager - now rallying behind one banner. Most European citizens want the Union to become a beacon of sustainability, a place that respects the rights and livelihoods of all its cit- izens and the environment. Smart and comprehensive strategies are needed. We propose a Green New Deal as both a new mission and a programme that brings jobs and quality of life tothe people. The internal and external conditions to deliver are challenging; but we believe there is actually now a spirit and a momentum that could overcome constraints and unleash opportunities. What is Green in a New Deal Summer heatwaves, storms and flooding indicate climate change as a common threat. Hardly anyone will be able to escape hothouse conditions and mitigate risks. Thus, a net zerocarbon target is a 'must have' for the future of Europe. But there's more to it - for change to happen, one needs positive visions and trigger collective aspirations. Ensuring access to modern energy services, affordablehousing, smart mobility, clean water and healthy food is good for people, profits and the planet. To achieve such goals, companies and countries ought to decouple their current key performance indicators such as 'Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)' and GDP from natural resource throughput. Measuring carbon footprints and other footprints for water, land and materials is well established and improves resilience of supply chains. We propose a European reduction of those footprints in line with the Paris Agreement and necessary pollution 312 Here, Raimund Bleischwitz from University College London, Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (UCL BSEER), proposes a Green New Deal for Europe that is able to deliver prosperity to the people and worldwideA Green New Deal for Europeabatement. Doing so requires close coordination among several govern- ment ministries, local authorities and industry, including buildings and construction, energy, agriculture, and transport. The vision would be a circu - lar economy , one that is restorative by design and maintains both private and public values in line with plane- tary boundaries and the SDGs. \"Most European citizens want the Union to become a beacon of sustainability, a place that respects the rights and livelihoods of all its citizens and the environment. Smart and comprehensive strategies are needed.\" Leaving no-one behind Surely, deep transformations are required. As experience with earlier transitions in Central and Eastern Europe and many modernisation efforts reveals, the risk of people feel- ing left behind should be minimised. Existing inequalities hinder human capabilities to flourish, be it for reasons of discrimination, or power dynamics, poor design of change programmes, or imbalanced financing. Why should poor people pay taxes to support photovoltaic installed on houses forthe rich? We propose a deliberately asymmetric deal: put the lower half of the people first. Key workers in health, mobility, education and security deserve to be treated with respect and receive favourable conditions. Urban transfor- mations and rural strategies require participatory planning to identify andaddress the needs of the poor and the lower half of societies. People can be involved via concepts of 'citizen sci-ence' and, indeed, via social media. If done well, the future digital revolution holds further promises for participa- tion and leaving no-one behind. It will be of utmost importance to includethose criteria in revised European regional policies and investments. Subsidiarity and diversity It's been cheap in the past to blame 'Brussels' - and not entirely withoutreason. Complementing Ann Pettifor's proposals on macro-economy, a Green New Deal must come with a bottom-up dynamic, with more polycentric gover- nance, and creativity through experi- mentation and smart assessments. Business roundtables in regions that involve a range of stakeholders do exist. The EU project 'Recreate ' has developed Evidence-based narratives (EBNs) in areas such as Climate Information Services; Nature-basedSolutions; Systemic Eco-innovation to Realise a Circular Economy; SustainableUrban Material Management; Sustain- able Urban Infrastructure Systems; Sustainable Urban Adaptation and Resilience that await upscaling and hor- izontal dissemination across European regions. The data revolution will help to connect people with smart business and governments. Smart enablers - incentives and three programmes Economic incentives are needed, both to enable more human productive activities and to end unproductive waste of resources. A smart combina- tion of carbon emissions trading and carbon taxes are a good way forward, in order to focus on key industries and reach out to more dispersed emis- sions. For a more holistic green new deal, we also propose a moderate tax on construction materials that could boost markets for secondary materialsand also help to safeguard access to mineral deposits of public importance. All this can and should be done in waysthat benefit the people. We propose three large programmes for a green new deal:Sustainable and inclusive housing, with renovation towards net zero carbon and new models of sharing; Smart mobility, with investments in public transportation and high-speed rail and lowering total costs of access, perhaps via a European smart card; Healthy food, with regional and sustainable supply, social kitchen, and food waste reduction. Europe wouldn't walk alone China, Canada, New Zealand and others are on their way too; a Green New Deal is also a huge debate in the USA - perhaps for a future President, or indeed for numerous states. Whatever happens in the UK and its delicate relationship with the EU: The parliament is committed to net zero carbon, and a new wave of industrial policy with a strong emphasis on green growth and a circular economy is on the way, especially in Scotland.In line, we propose international alliances to learn and scale up solu- tions. The Chinese Belt and Road Initiative starts to connect Asia and Europe and other parts of the world. A Green New Deal could help creating clean value chains and good regional and international neighbourhoods. Prof Dr Raimund Bleischwitz The Bartlett School of 313PROFILEENVIRONMENT 314Learning about earthquakes in Taiwan The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) in Taiwan researches seismology, meteorology and provides earthquake reports. CWB also reports on sea conditions and makes astronomical observations.(1) In a previous Open Access Government article from Deputy Director of the Seismological Center Central Weather Bureau (CWB) in Taiwan, we nd out how the country's quick earthquake alert system provides notication when it comes to ensuring disaster risk reduction. \"Several hazard earthquakes have occurred during our history. The most famous one was the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake with Richter magnitude 7.3 in the middle of Taiwan, which killed more than 2,000 and causedmass building damage as well. The threat of an earth- quake is, therefore, a serious issue today in Taiwan.\" Earthquake Early Warning System (EEW) In the same article, we also nd out that the CWB developed the Earthquake Early Warning System (EEW)to detect signicant earthquakes quickly. This means that a warning can be issued about 10-15 seconds after the earthquake occurs. Alerts can be issuesaround 60 km away from the epicentre and as such,give seconds to 10s of seconds warning prior to the destructive shaking occurring. Nai-Chi Hsiao, Deputy Director of the Seismological Center Central WeatherBureau (CWB) explains more about the EEQ during the last ve years, in his own words. \"Since 2014, CWB has provided the EEW warning directly to all the public schools, hazard-rescue agencies and other government departments in Taiwan. Since 2016, CWB has issued EEW warnings through the Public Warning System (PWS) to wireless devices of the generalpublic. The PWS was developed and constructed by the government and communication Corp., which is basedon the Cell Broadcast Service (CBS) on the 4G network. This means that all the people in a high-risk area can receive an EEW warning at the same time! CWB also collaborates with TV companies to deliver instant live pop-up messages during the transmission of programmes.\" (2) The causes of earthquakes Perhaps it is worth taking a step back now to briefly look at precisely what the causes of earthquakes are. According to the CWB, earthquakes can either be man-made, or they occur naturally. Generally speaking, we tend to experience naturally occurring earthquakes which can be divided into these areas: Tectonic earthquakes; Volcanic earthquakes and; Impacting earthquakes (like those caused by the impact of meteorites). Among all these causes, earthquakes for the main part produced by crustal deformation (tectonic earthquakes), caused by plate movement, according to the CWB. On the CWB's website, we nd out more about the science behind earthquakes. \"Rock layers are stressed by pressures in the Earth. When the stress is stronger than the strength that the rock layer can withstand, the rock layer will move outward (dislocation). Such dislocations release a great deal of energy, producing elastic waves called seismic waves. When seismic waves reach the surface of the Earth, they cause shaking, also known as (an) earthquake.\" Here, we learn about earthquakes in Taiwan, including the causes of them, the benefits of the Earthquake Early Warning System and the real-time seismic network in the countryENVIRONMENT 315The real-time seismic network in Taiwan Another important area the CWB highlights on their website concerns the establishment of the real-time Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN) in 1994. We know that observation stations distributed over Taiwan as well as in Kinmen, Lanyu, Penghu and Pengjiayu are part of this network. As part of this network, instruments are installed in every real-time monitoring stations which have a three-component (vertical, north-south, and east-west) short-period seis-mograph. We read more about this fascinating aspect of CWB's on their website, which is extracted below. \"The ground motion signals recorded at these stations are digitally transmitted to the Central Weather Bureau by leased line, and are stored for real-time processing, analysing, and archiving. If the earthquake is felt, the operating personnel will immediately release an earthquake announcement. All real-time signals are displayed in the analogue recorder at the centre, and it is convenient for the sta to check whether or not the earthquake information automatically determined by the real-time processing is correct. The digital datawill be led manually to form a data bank, which will be advantageous for future enquires.\" Closing remarks While earthquakes are worthy of many more articles, we can gain encouragement from the fact that through means of the mass media, convenient telecommuni- cation equipment and the Internet, the general public is alerted about earthquake information as soon aspossible.

We use it to power the molecular engines in our bodies that keep us up and running. As part of this process O2molecules are broken up. Electrons are taken from the carbon and hydrogen in organic com- pounds. They are transferred onto oxygen atoms that change their valence from zero to minus two, form- ing carbon dioxide and water. Simpli- fying the organic matter as -CH2- we can describe process by writing: -CH2- + 1\u00bd O2=> CO2+ H2O However, biologists and the medical community have long known that there are intermediate stages withoxygen becoming indiscriminately aggressive in its chemical and bio- chemical reactivity. The reason is simple: Nature tends to transfer single electrons from one molecule to the next or from one atom to the next - never two at a time. This means that, when oxygen atoms participate in chemical reactions in our bodies, they pass through the O -stage, a radical. O-can create havoc in living cells. They have earned the moniker \"Reactive Oxygen Species\" or ROS for short. To counteract the detrimental effects of ROS Life relies on enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cata- lase. They contain iron that can switch back and forth between divalent (Fe2+) and trivalent (Fe3+), helping to render ROS less harmful. There is a widespread belief within the biochemical and medical communi- ties that ROS first appeared in Earth's history after Life \"invented\" oxygenic photosynthesis to produce O2. The underlying reasoning has a logic ring:ROS are a byproduct of biochemical reactions in oxygen-breathing organ- isms. However, the idea that the appearance of ROS is tied to the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis stands in stark contrast to the obser-Professor Friedemann Freund, SETI Institute/NASA Ames Research Center, provides an insight article into the complexities of oxygenOxygen: The challenge for Life 316PROFILE Breaking of strand Depurina/g415on and depyrimidina/g415on Muta/g415on of bases Protein DNA crosslinksDNAROS Modied amino acids Breakage of the pep/g415de chain Increased proteoly/g415c degrada/g415on Inac/g415va/g415on of enzymeProtein Enhanced Membrane of lipid chainsLipids TARGETSTARGETS Figure from: Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and response of antioxidants as ROS-scavengers during environmental stress in plants. Kausik Das, Aryadeep Roychoudhury. Published in Front. Environ. Sci. 2014. DOI:10.3389/fenvs.2014.00053Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and response of antioxidants in Biologyvation that the oldest single cell organisms produce enzymes such as SOD and catalase. These microorganisms live in strictly anaerobic environments and must have done so ever since they appeared on Earth. The question therefore arises: Why did early microorganisms, whose origin predates oxygenic photo - synthesis by at least a billion years, produce SOD and similar antioxidant enzymes, if there were no ROS-like oxidants around in their environments? Could it be that the geological envi- ronment produces ROS-like oxidants and has done so since the beginning of Life? According to textbook knowledge the answer is \"no\". Rocks in Earth's crust consist of minerals, predominantly sil- icates, in which oxygen always occurs in the 2- valence state. This concurs with the fact that the Earth beneath our feet retains the memory of its origin as a planet accreting in the highly reducing, hydrogen-dominated solar disk some 4.5 billion years ago. Because the 2- valence state of oxygen is so prevalent, the idea became firmly rooted in the minds of most geoscientists that oxygen in the geological environment is always O2-. However, there is a process, thermo- dynamically fully certified, by which oxygen in the valence state 1- is intro- duced into rocks in a sneaky way. Itbegins with the crystallization of minerals from magmas that are always laden with fluid phase components, often mostly water, H2O. Thermodynamics mandates that, whenever a mineral crystallizes in anH2O-laden environment, small but non-zero quantities of H2O will enter the crystalline matrix in the form of hydroxyls, typically O3Si-OH. In other words, hydroxyls become \"impurities\", even in minerals that have no place for them in their crystal structure. Thermodynamics further mandates that, upon cooling, impurity concen- trations must decease. This can only be done by hydroxyls diffusingtowards the grain boundaries. At the same time diffusion slows down.When diffusion comes to a halt, typi- cally around 500\u00b0C, a new reaction takes place that mainstream geo- science has failed to notice: Pairs of hydroxyls undergo a redox conversion and turn into peroxy plus molecular hydrogen: O 3Si-OH HO-SiO3O3Si-OO-SiO3+ H2 Redox conversions are common in chemistry, ratcheting up the valenceof one and down the valence of the other. In the case considered here, hydroxyl oxygens change from 2- to 1-, while hydroxyl protons change from 1+ to 0. The two O-form a peroxy bond. As long as they are held together, these O-are chemically inac- tive. This changes when the O--O- bond breaks. To understand this step requires a bit of semiconductor physics. The reason is that, when the O--O-bond breaks, electronic charge carriers are gener- ated, electrons e' and holes h, similar to the electrons and holes in transis- tors that run our electronics. In min- erals and rocks, the e' and h behave differently than in archetypical semi- conductors: the e' get stuck in the broken peroxy bonds, while the hhave the remarkable ability to leave the sites, where they were born. They can spread into the surrounding rocks, traveling far afield, easily tens of kilometres and more. Why is this important? Because those h are defect electrons in the matrix of O2-, chemically O-. They are ROS - Reactive Oxygen Species. They loom everywhere in the geological environ- ment and have done so since the Earth formed as a rocky planet some 4.5 billion years ago. Therefore, when Life appeared on Earth, the first organisms already had to content with peroxy and ROS. This is why they needed enzymes and why SOD and catalase are found in the genetically oldest lifeforms on Earth dating back at least a billion years before the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis. They needed antioxidant enzymes to survive in an early Earth environment that contained peroxy and could unleash viciously oxidizing ROS. Friedemann Freund Professor SETI Institute/NASA 279 8478 friedemann.t.freund@nasa.gov 317PROFILENCREE have developed an on-site Earthquake Early Warning System (On-site EEWS), which can detect the first coming P-wave of an earthquake and estimate the strength (Peak Ground Acceleration, PGA) of a following strong wave in 1-3 seconds. An On-site Earthquake Early Warning System composed of the sensing (seismic sensors), processing (PGA estimation of the following S-wave) and Action (warning people, relay control to mitigate the seismic loss) as shown in Figure 1. Multiple seismic sensors are applied in various positions for a double-check to mitigate false alarm. The processing unit will collect the first-three seconds of P-wave (the blue area as shown in Figure 2) and provide estimate PGA for warning immediately. After this, the peak ground acceleration arrives, and the time difference between estimated PGA and real PGA is called the warning time- essentially how much time we can provide in advance. In the case of figure 2, the epicentre distance was 38km, where inside the so-called EEWS blind zone, NCREE's on-site EEWS could still provide 5.34s. With the epicentre distance increasing to 100km, the warning time can increase to ~15s. NCREE have more than 300,000 earthquake time histo- ries in Taiwan. Through this seismic database and the AI tech (NN and SVM), the EEWSmodel for Taiwan can be accurately made. Before 2012, numerical and shake table test validations for the EEWS model had been done. From 2013, more and more on-site EEWS's had been installed, validated and refined in field. As of 2019, more than 100 on-site EEWS have been installedby NCREE and serve for 3500 schools, 20 fire departments, 15 office building, 6 semiconductor plants and a high- speed railway. The annual estimation accuracy was made for several yearsas shown in Figure 3. The estimated and measured PGA data were always in agreement.

The first oversea cooperation was established between ISR (Institute of Seismology Research Gujarat, India) and NCREE in 2018. NCREE provide one on-site EEWS, installed in the seismic station of ISR. The on-site EEWS sent a continuous trigger signal, estimated PGA and 3-dir. acceleration through ISR's DAQ and satellite communication back to the Seismic monitoring server in ISR (As shown in Figure 6). Resultantly, ISR can receive the acceleration time histories with the EEWS message (estimated PGA) with the same time and same system. The same system setup has been designed for validation in India. It is believed, with one year of validation, ISR and NCREE will step forward for the application of on-site EEWS inIndia.

Scientic research into the Arctic is, there- fore, fundamental to predicting and influencing global environmental changes. For example, ocean currents massively influence global climate conditions and melting Arctic ice is set to flood the seas with freshwater, lowering temperature and salt levels across the world's oceans and producing a resulting ripple eect across global weather patterns. The Arctic even has a profound impact on the global plastic pollution crisis, with some 1,000 billion plastic particles frozen in Arctic ice , threatening to create a plastic slick across the world's seas. To compound both these issues, polar regions are warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet. It islittle wonder that a recent Parliamentary report described the region as \"both the site and source of some of the world's greatest environmental challenges.\" This has driven increased interest in scientic research into the Arctic, with Britain alone investing $7.8 billion in polar research infrastructure including seven polar research stations and a new state-of-the-art polar research ship . The European Union (EU) is also funding many research programmes through its Arctic cluster . These eorts will, however, require an enormous arrayof new infrastructure to ensure safe and environmentallyresponsible research in remote and hazardous regions. Yet the U.S. Arctic still has no deepwater ports and today 48% of the region either has no or little broad- band connectivity. Research vessels like Germany's RV Polarstern and RV Heincke currently have to switchbetween multiple satellite systems for operations in dierent locations, which comes with its own cost and complexity implications. There are also too few Arctic- wide standards and enabling technologies , resulting in new polar infrastructure being developed in an uneven and un-coordinated patchwork . This impedes research because the Arctic poses partic- ular challenges to safety and pollution. The remotenessof polar waters and risk of extreme weather combined with diculties in rescue and recovery, poor navigation and communication are serious risks to research assets in the area. \"Opening up the Arctic to more research across air and sea and allowing their data to be captured and communicated from any location will create a more comprehensive and current overview of the Arctic and its effects on the world's future climate.\" However, there is now a huge opportunity for change. An estimated $1 trillion is being invested in everything from maritime facilities to roads across Canada, Norway, Finland, the U.S. and Russia. This could open up remote polar regions to research and exploration. Three satellite networks have also recently announced plans to extend coverage across the Arctic, with the rst and fastest service the region starting in 2020, which will connect the entire Arctic region. Universal 24/7 connec- tivity across every part of the Arctic forms a potential enabling infrastructure for universal standards and technologies across the region. This will not only improve safety but also aid the scientic endeavour. For example, Arctic-wide connectivity will allow ice data to be shared across all polar nations in real-time, boosting safety and providing a holistic real-timeDylan Browne, Head of Maritime at OneWeb, reveals how we incentivise greater co-ordination and collaboration between researchers across the ArcticENVIRONMENT 321window into the impact of climate change on ice cover across the region. Connectivity will also support the implementation of universal navigational and environmental standards. The International Maritime Organisation's Polar Code now mandates ships in the Arctic be equipped tobroadcast ship to shore alerts and able to transmit and receive on-scene communication at all times. Connectivity will enable research ships to comply with these requirements by facilitating real-time reporting between vessels and authorities, live exchange of hazard warnings and safe navigation within agreed passage plans. It will even allow research stations to remotely train crews by enabling instructors to 'remote in' to vessels and train mariners from any location. The Polar Code also mandates that ships in the Arctic carry Automatic Identication System (AIS) equipment for safe navigation. Earth's curvature limits the range of AIS to about 74 km from shore, but Arctic-wide satellite connectivity will enable live vessel tracking from any polar location. \"The Arctic even has a profound impact on the global plastic pollution crisis, with some 1,000 billion plastic particles frozen in Arctic ice, threatening to create a plastic slick across the world's seas.\" In this way, connectivity will underpin the standardsneeded to ensure safe and clean research eorts across all Arctic locations. By permitting the live exchange of everything from ice to climate data across every Arctic location, it will catalyse more collaborative and joined-up research eorts and infrastructure across countries and companies. Opening up the Arctic to more research across air and sea and allowing their data to be captured and communicated from any location will create a more comprehensive and current overview of the Arctic and its eects on the world's future climate. Dylan BrowneHead of Maritime partners@oneweb.net www.oneweb.world www.twitter.com/oneweb Dylan BrowneIt is now widely recognised that the Arctic is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth and that this warming is driving significant changes in the Arctic cryosphere - the seasonal snow cover, permafrost, sea ice and glaciers that cover much of the Arctic. In general, this warming is more rapid than that occurring at lower latitudes, a phenomenon referred to as \"Polar Amplification\". However, it is spatially and temporally non-uniform and this has important implications for how it affects the Arctic ice caps. This issue has attracted the interest of glaciologists since the early 1960s. Here I discuss itwith particular reference to work thathas been conducted on the ice caps in Arctic Canada. Bea Alt from the Geological Survey of Canada was one of the first to explore the nature of the specific weather systems that generate snowfall and summer melting over ice caps in the Arctic through field studies on the Devon Ice Cap and Meighen Island Ice Cap in the Canadian Arctic (Alt, 1978, 1979, 1983). Through a 14-year (1961- 74) study of the Devon Island Ice Cap, she investigated how synoptic weather conditions control variations in the mass balance of the ice cap. She noted that the occurrence of a strong cyclone in Baffin Bay during the summer tended to suppress melt on the ice cap and was often associated with summer snowfall that had thesame effect by increasing its surface albedo. Tracking cyclones from else- where might add to accumulation on the ice cap, although surface melting might occur if the warm sector of these systems intruded north of Devon Island. By contrast, anticyclonic conditions would result in melting over the outlet glaciers draining the ice cap, while warm air advection associated with anticyclonic blocking would trigger periods of intense melt- ing and mass loss. The important inference from Alt's studies is that changes in the relative frequency of cyclonic and anticyclonic modes of atmospheric circulation are likely major influences on rates of both snowfall and surface melting on these ice caps - and hence on their mass balance. This idea was picked upin a 1987 paper that explored the nature of the synoptic weather conditions associated with extreme mass balance years in the Canadian Arctic Islands. Three recurring sets of conditions were identified: Years with high summer melt, when there was a high-pressure ridge across the islands at all levels in the troposphere and no trough over North America; Years with suppressed summer melt, when there was a deep coldtrough over Ellesmere Island and down Baffin Bay that encouragedflow into the islands from the Arctic Ocean that suppressed melting and resulted in positive surface mass balance on the ice caps and; Years with high accumulation of snow when low-pressure systems tracked south and southeast across the Arctic islands from the Arctic Ocean, producing summer snowfall and positive glacier mass balance. This was one of the earliest attempts to connect glacier change in the Arctic to variations in synoptic meteorology and climate. In a 2007 paper, Alex Gardner returned to the theme of Alt's work by linking the record of variability in glacier mass balance in the Canadian Arctic Islands to the history of changes in the position of the summer Circum- polar Vortex in the Arctic. This work was triggered by the recognition of a regime shift in the surface mass bal- ance of glaciers in the Canadian Arctic Islands that took place between 1986and 1987 and that was associated with a positive shift in summer air temperatures over the region. Gard- ner showed that annual glacier mass balances tended to be positive in years when the Vortex in July waslocated in the western hemisphere and negative in years when the Vortex was either weak or strong but not elongated over the Canadian High Arctic Islands and when its centre wasMartin Sharp, Professor at the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences University of Alberta, Canada, discusses drivers of Arctic ice cap change and his thoughts on linking climate and weatherDrivers of Arctic ice cap change: Linking climate and weather 322PROFILElocated in the eastern hemisphere. Gardner tracked changes in the atmo- spheric circulation configuration over time, showing that the occurrence of westerly centred vortices decreased by ~40% after 1987. After that date, atmospheric ridging over the Cana- dian High Arctic Islands in summerbecame more common, surface air temperatures increased and regional glacier mass balances became more negative. By the late 2000s, it was becoming clear that further reductions in glacier mass were occurring in Arctic Canada. Gabrielle Gascon (2013) took up the challenge of understanding how these related to the changing climate. She found that the summer melt season on the Devon Ice Cap became longer between 2004 and 2010 by 3.4 days/year at 1800m elevation, 6.1 days/year at 1300m and 8.8 days/year at 1000m (where the surface melt rate rose from 74 to 133 cm yr-1 from 2007-2010). These changes were linked to twomajor drivers: (a) strengthening of the high-pressure ridge over the Arctic in June and July, which resulted in increased advection of warm air into the region, coupled with clear skies over the ice cap, which increased the energy available for melt by 4-24% and (b) increased frequency of south- westerly low- pressure systems in August after 2004 which advected warm air into the Arctic and increased the available melt energy by 12-38% relative to the 2007-10 daily mean, whilst at the same time reducing the shortwave radiation flux and increas- ing the longwave radiation flux. This had the effect of extending the end of the melt season by an average of ~5.5 days per year at the three monitored elevations on the ice cap. The impor- tant message to take from this is thatthe timing and intensity of melting on Arctic ice caps can vary significantly from year-to-year in ways that are con- nected to the changing configuration of the regional atmospheric circulation and the nature of the weather systems that it spawns. These influences are, therefore, apparent in records of the mass balance of these glaciers. In a follow-up study, Peter Bezeau (2015) investigated how glacier mass balance in the Canadian Arctic was affected by variability in the frequency of occurrence of anticyclonic circula- tion over the region in summer for the period 2007-2012. This was a period when positive summer geopotential height anomalies over the Canadian Arctic Islands were 2.5 times more common than the climatological mean and when glacier mass balances were unusually negative. Various explana- tions have been proposed for the increased frequency and duration of anticyclonic circulation over the Cana- dian Arctic between 2007 and 2012, these include increased meridional heat advection and decreasing sea ice extent, sea ice volume and snow-cov- ered area in spring. All of these could potentially contribute to a feedback that would result in an increase in the frequency of positive geopotential height anomalies and anticyclonic circulation in the region. However, the extent to which these changes can be attributed to either natural climate variability or anthropogenic forcing on the climate system has yet to be quantified. Other important points to make are that the timing and rates of climate warming vary across the Arctic so that glaciers across the region will likely respond to warming at different times, at different rates and to varyingdegrees. It is important to recognise this when trying to imagine howfuture climate change will impact the Arctic ice caps and to determine howand when the changes that do occur will affect global sea levels and regional scale water resources and water quality.

OES/ECW also leads on policy formulation to address international threats to nature, such as land degradation, invasive alien species and the illegal trade in natural resources, as well as issues associated with access to and the sharing of benets from genetic resources - commonly understood as almost any biological material containing DNA or RNA, including cells, tissues and whole organisms of plants, animals and micro-organisms. The office is responsible for advancing U.S. interestsin these areas in a variety of international fora, organisations, institutions and treaties, negotiating effective, evidence-based agreements and promoting their enforcement, developing international initia- tives with key partners to employ market forces and creating a foreign policy framework in which public- private partnerships that promote U.S. interests can flourish. Access & benet-sharing Genetic resources are important to innovation and thedevelopment of new products across a number of sectors, including pharmaceuticals, agriculture and cosmetics. As a leader in public and private genetic research and development, the U.S. has a strong interested in international and country-specicapproaches that support access to and benet-sharing from genetic resources. The ECW leads on policy development, working with relevant U.S. agencies and ensures that U.S. stakeholders are kept up-to-date with the changing international ABS landscape. Conservation The conservation, use and management of resources such as food, water, fuel, medicines and ecosystems provides the foundation for healthy, resilient commu- nities and economies, which in turn promotes stability and prosperity around the world. ECW leads U.S. participation in a range of international and intergovernmental processes to promote conser- vation and is also responsible for international policyissues related to invasive species, migratory birds,parks and protected areas, pollinators, sustainable tourism and wildlife conservation.The Office of Conservation & Water coordinates the development of U.S. foreign policy on conserving and sustainably managing the world's important ecosystems, as we find out here ENVIRONMENT 325Forests The U.S. imports and exports more than $50 billion in forest products annually, as part of more than $200 billion in global trade. The United States is also one of the top ve countries in the world in terms of forest cover and is a leader in forest management practices, education and research. As policy lead within the Department of State, ECW seeks to expand U.S. expertise and leadership in forest management, address market distortions that can dis- advantage U.S. industry, reduce corruption, promote stability in rural communities worldwide and advance U.S. forest practices around the globe. Genetic resources for food and agriculture Food security cuts across many key issues in conserva- tion, from stable and healthy land and pollination to sustainable water resources and resilience to pests and diseases. The ECW leads U.S. participation in a range of intergov- ernmental and international processes to ensure U.S. farmers, plant and animal breeders and researchers have access to genetic resources (such as seeds or other propagating materials) needed to achieve food and water security. Water By 2025, two-thirds of the world's population will live in \"water-stressed\" conditions, including almost two billion people who will not have enough water to meet human, industrial and ecosystem needs. Scarcity and poor quality of water will increase disease, undermine economic growth, hit food production andbecome a growing threat to peace and security in many regions. ECW leads U.S. foreign policy on drinking water and sanitation, water resources management and trans- boundary water and conflict issues. It coordinates the development of policies and positions across the U.S. government, including implementing the President's Global Water Strategy, representing the U.S. in bilateral, regional and global fora to advance policy interests, facilitating conversations between countries where water source is a tension and managing pro-grammes that leverage U.S. knowledge and resources to advance policy interests on water and sanitation. Wildlife tracking The illegal poaching, transit, trade and sale of wildlife generates more than $10 billion a year for international organised crime networks. It also has devastating impacts on security, economic development while fuelling corruption and pushing species to the brink of extinction. The multifaceted nature and global scale of the problem calls for strategic cooperation at global,regional, national and local levels. The U.S. is one of the world's biggest markets for both legal and illegal wildlife and wildlife products and, as such, the U.S. government takes a key role in addressing wildlife tracking. ECW acts as co-chair of the Presidential Task Force on Wildlife Tracking, which coordinates inter-agency eorts to strengthen enforcement, reduce the demand for illegal products and expand international commit- ments across multilateral, regional and bilateral forums. ECW also coordinates eorts to implement the END Wildlife Tracking Act, which was signed into law in October 2016. Open Access Government editorial@openaccessgovernment.org www.openaccessgovernment.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGov One of the foundational princi- ples of biology is that a popu- lation cannot grow forever in a nite ecosystem, in this case the Earth. Systems ecology theory predicts when resource limits are exceeded, a progressive system feedback of starva- tion, predation, and disease limits uncontrolled population and con- sumption growth. The global human population has now nearly tripled since 1950, and economic activity increased tenfold, leading many to suggest that humanity is heading toward a population and consumption overshoot and correction this century. The global population, currently at 7.5 billion people, is projected to rise beyond 10 billion by 2100. Future limits become an urgent policy issue when one considers the expansion in living standards aspired to by the underde- veloped world. Is humanity smart enough to anticipate global overshoot, and shift to sustainable policies before these morally unacceptable systems feedbacks take over? Net primary production, or NPP, usually in units of kg/ha (or equivalent) of plant biomass, is the core metric scientist use for quantifying total plant growth over broad areas with- out worrying about the complicating factors of species, yield fraction or other details. Because of these simpli- fications, NPP can be measured for entire regions, countries, and ultimately the whole biosphere. Feeding people is a moral imperative, yet global NPPdata does not now show sufficient increases in crop production to meet these future needs. \"As the Earth's population continues to increase, and climate continues to change, consistent monitoring of NPP will become an even more essential tool for understanding and mitigating damage caused to the biosphere.\" Plant material is also the source of wood fibre for construction and paper products, and for bioenergy - a renew- able energy source such as wood, agri- cultural waste and specifically-grown energy crops, which is burnt for heat- ing, cooking or electricity production. In the future, bioenergy could meet a proportion of our energy needs, as the net carbon footprint is far lower than that of fossil fuels. However, our current estimates vary greatly due to unknown factors, such as the future availability and productive potential of land, which needs to be balanced with food production to feed the growing human population. While food, fibre and fuel are obvious consumption of biospheric NPP , non- consumptive uses are also of prime importance, particularly climate stabil- isation. Photosynthesis continuallyremoves carbon dioxide from theatmosphere, land-based plants absorb around 30% of the carbon dioxide that human activity adds to the atmo- sphere, demonstrating the critical role of NPP in climate change mitigation.Accurate NPP values are vital for scientists who are trying to understand and predict the severity and effects of future climate change on the biosphere. If NPP is degraded, atmospheric carbon dioxide would increase faster, and global warming would accelerate. Conversely, if humanity can enhance NPP it slows global warming down. Until recently, measuring NPP contin- uously on a global scale was not pos- sible. Most previous estimates have been made by taking measurementsof plant biomass from a small plot and roughly extrapolating them to calculate global NPP . To obtain a more accurate picture, I started to work closely with NASA in the early 1980s as a member of the development team of NASA's Earth Observing System. This fleet of satellites has been monitoring the Earth's land, oceans and atmosphere for 20 years. The Terra and Aqua satellites are part of the Earth Observing System and are equipped with a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). For my algorithm, MODIS measures the proportion of Earth's land surface that is covered in vegetation and the reflected sunlight in special wavelengths. My lab developed an algorithm to assesses the amount of sunlight that can be absorbed by vegetation, along with the local weather conditions, to calculate the rate of photosynthesis, and therefore the amount of carbonHere, Dr Steven Running dives into the questions of Net Primary Product and ongoing climate change, to illuminate what the global limits of the biosphere areThe Biosphere: Global limits of human habitability 326PROFILEdioxide that is being absorbed, producing now a large dataset of con- tinuous global NPP measurements. NASA releases new NPP data every eight days, where it is used by various groups, including NASA, government organisations, many other countries and private landowners to aid in land management. \"Photosynthesis continually removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, land-based plants absorb around 30% of the carbon dioxide that humanactivity adds to the atmosphere, demonstrating the critical role of NPP in climate change mitigation.\" During our early research, we identi- fied various climate factors that limit the rate of photosynthesis and plant growth in different regions. The team found that temperature is limiting at high latitudes but overall, water avail- ability is the most important factor. The team's long-term monitoring of NPP has helped us to understand how changes in climate can affect global NPP. For instance, rising temperatures increase growing season length, but decrease water availability, and many of the NPP trends identified can bedirectly attributed to these effects. We showed how significant droughts between 2000 and 2009 caused the reduction in NPP in the Southern Hemisphere. Decreases in cloud cover increased sunlight over tropical areas causing the largest increases in NPP, particularly in the Amazon rainforest. It initially appeared that rising global temperatures were having a positive effect on the growth of plants, poten- tially increasing their ability to act as a sink for excess carbon dioxide pro- duced by human activity. However, thereduction in NPP from 2000 to 2009 from drought effects raises serious issues. If rising global temperaturesreduce plant growth, the ability of veg- etation to act as a carbon sink will be reduced, accelerating climate change. This NPP data is also vital for landscape management, optimisation and plan- ning. Is the Amazon rainforest more valuable as a carbon sink mitigating cli- mate change, or as a food production source? Are trees in a savannah more valuable as a fuel supply, or for carbon sinks and wildlife habitat? What is themost sustainable intensity of grazing on rangeland? The answers to these priorities are different for each tract of land that has differing potential for NPP, and local demands by humanity for consumptive and non-consumptive uses. NPP from a biodiverse ecosystem provides wildlife habitat, and aesthetic landscapes for humanrecreation, note the huge popularity of U.S. National Parks. There is clear potential for conflicting priorities between consumptive uses, and non- consumptive uses of our ecosystems. An example of conflicting uses of NPP is whether land should grow crops for food, or for bioenergy. It has been suggested that biofuels could substi- tute for fossil fuels as part of stabilis- ing climate, so we investigated the maximum global primary bioenergy potential. We calculated a potential bioenergy capacity that is four times lower than previous estimates and would require 55.6 million square kilometres of natural vegetation to be converted to bioenergy cropland - an area greater than Asia and Europe combined! The conversion of natural ecosystems to cropland is not only destructive to the environment, but would also significantly reduce theamount of carbon that can be sequestered, reducing climate stabilisation potentials. By 2050, the demand for global energy is predictedto double, but we suggest that bioen- ergy can only meet less than 15% of global energy needs in a sustainable manner. As the Earth's population continues to increase, and climate continues to change, consistent monitoring of NPP will become an even more essential tool for understanding and mitigating damage caused to the biosphere. It is essential for humanity to not reach catastrophic planetary limits risking collapse. There is no better and available global dataset than NPP, the foundation of food, fibre, biofuel and climate stabilisation, for this habitability.

To introduce theirwork, NSERC promotes and supports discovery research, facilitates innovation by encouraging Canadian organisations to invest in and take part in post -secondary research projects and supports students in advanced studies. Researchers at NSERC are on, \"the vanguard of science\" and perhaps in a way, they arecontinuing the country's long tradition of building on scientic excellence. (1) Investing in climate change research This article will focus on how climate change is being supported in Canada. In a recent press release from NSERC, we learn that according to science, climatechange is real today. Investing in science is a win-winsituation because it really supports the researchers who make the discoveries required to combat climatechange and adapt to its impacts. Certainly, the peopleof Canada expect the government to make decisions with a rm grounding of scientic evidence. As such, Canada will keep supporting cutting-edge science tohelp protect future generations. In July 2019, the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Min- ister of Environment and Climate Change, announced$4.7 million for nine climate change research projects. These projects are important as they will further human knowledge of the role forests play, improve ourunderstanding of how carbon interacts with our wetlands, forests and oceans, and accelerate innova- tion in energy-ecient cooling technologies. These projects are funded by the Advancing ClimateChange Science in Canada initiative, a collaboration of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Councilof Canada (NSERC), Environment and Climate ChangeCanada (ECCC) and Health Canada (HC). The projects will increase the available scientic information so that government decision-making on climate action is well-supported. The Minister of Environment and Climate Change said: \"Science clearly shows us the causes of climate change, and our government is supporting the scientists who we know will show us the solutions. Working with scientists and academics will help us keep pushing forward in the ght against climate change. By coming together and working collaboratively, we can ensure a safer, healthier, more prosperous future for our children and grandchildren.\"Dr Marc Fortin, Vice-President, Research Partnerships, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada added: \"Congratulations to all recipients. This initiative is an excellent example of NSERC's commit- ment to working with other government partners to achieve research outcomes that generate benets for Canada. This important investment supports research that will address the complex and interdisciplinarynature of climate change science for a more prosper- ous future for all Canadians.\" (2) Support for skills and training Let's nish by casting our minds back to the start of this article which included the aim of NSERC to supports students in advanced studies. In July 2019, we nd out that the Government of Canada is investing in projects to get students job-ready for careers inresearch. Certainly, the government understands that by giving researchers the chance to learn and grow, the future of the economy and the next generation of innovators are being invested in. An investment of $29.6 million through the Collaborative Research and Training Experience (CREATE) program ofHere, we examine the role of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada in promoting and supporting research and innovation, for example, in the area of climate change ENVIRONMENT 329the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) was announced in July 2019. We know that this will permit 18 research teams of students and post-doctoral fellows to apply new knowledge to develop the skills required to help them in their future careers. Also, we know that the CREATE grants very usefully support research teams across Canada working in a wealth of areas such as blockchain technology, cybersecurity, soil science and industrial engineering. On this, Danika Goosney, NSERC Vice President, Research Grants and Scholarships said: \"CREATE supports outstanding mentoring and skills training opportunities for students, complementing their science and engineering research training. The result is a cohort of early-career scientists and engineers with a greater potential to become tomorrow's dynamic leaders.\"This and the other areas explored in this article are justa part of the wider work of the NSERC, who invests over $1.2 billion annually in Canada's natural sciences and engineering research. Long may these worthy investments continue to deliver research discoveries and enable partnerships and collaborations.

Terrestrial life, including human, is almost all restricted to a biofilm of few tens of metres above and below the surface. That life-supporting film, the biosphere, has, by comparison with the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydro- sphere, the greatest historical, seasonal and daily variation in environmental conditions, including temperature, moisture, solar radiation, atmospheric disturbances, electromagnetic fluxes and chemical composition. Life forms have adapted to those wide swings in environmental conditions and notably to temperature. It is well recognised that the diversity, abundance and activities of terrestrial life are influenced by two main cli- matic factors, temperature and water availability. Warmth and water favour life. Environmental temperatures may be too cold or too hot to allow certain life forms to thrive. Environmentalmoisture has more complex direct and indirect effects on life. There are, additionally, other environmental factors (e.g. salinity, pH, the nature of substrates) that influence life. Global concern for climate change invokes the effects of the atmospheric build-up of greenhouse gases. Global climate change influences all those factors aslife's diversity, distribution, abundance and activities are affected. The effects of global climate change on life are mostly inferred from general meteo- rology without much consideration for the actual environmental condi- tions close to the ground (micromete- orology) and within life forms (biometeorology). Micrometeorology and biometeorology must be applied to refining scientific understanding of the extent and consequences of climate change. Micrometeorology provides a more accu- rate and complex appreciation of ambi-ent conditions affecting life, its diversity, abundance and activities. Biometeorol- ogy, in dealing with the relationship between living things and the weather, takes meteorology more directly into biology by seeking general, ecological, physiological and genetic explanations into the processes whereby ambient conditions influence life, its diversity, abundance and activities. A prime example of how climatology, meteorology and biometeorology combine is presented by geographical patterns (maps) of plant growth and survival, especially as used for agricul- ture and the predictive utility of heat units (often expressed at growing degree days) and rainfall in farming. Intrinsic to those patterns are microm- eteorological effects, amounts of directand diffuse insolation, as well as atmo- spheric humidity and wind. The actual temperatures within plants are missing from biometeorological consideration. Biothermometry (the measurement of body temperatures) is widely applied in medicine, but less often in other biosciences. For medicine, deviationsfrom normal body temperature are regarded as symptomatic of ill health or stress. Human beings, mammals and birds maintain constant and closely regulated body temperatures and are strict homoeotherms (endotherms). Most other animals, plants and fungi are usually consid- ered poikilotherms (ectotherms) even though many have various means to control their body temperatures. Biothermometry has been applied to plants through direct measurements and by remote IR thermometry. For flowers, the means of warming under cool conditions have been recently reviewed (van der Kooi et al. 2019) 1and include solar basking by orientation of plant parts to face the sun, closing of leaves or floral parts and so retaining heat, adaptationsthat emulate translucent miniature greenhouses and, in some special cases, metabolic heating. For other plants parts, notably stems, Kevan et al. (2018) 2present data Peter G. Kevan, University Professor Emeritus at the School of Environmental Sciences, University of Guelph, explores here how plants regulate their body temperatures, including the implications in this respect for climate change science & policy 330PROFILE How plants regulate their body temperatures: Implications for climate change science & policyshowing that hollowness imbues plants with elevated temperatures in sunny conditions. Cooling under heat stress is less understood. Apart from the orientation of leaves by parahe- liotropism to reduce solar heating, cooling is attributed to transpirational heat loss (i.e. heat loss by the evapo- ration of water through stomata, akin to sweating). The cooling effect of trees is not simply by shading but includes transpiration and may involve paraheliotropism. Those phenomena are increasingly invoked for mitigation of heat in urban landscapes. Herbaceous plants may also exhibit paraheliotropism and so reduce incident solar heating stress,but, additionally, show growth responses mediated by interacting heat and light sensitivities that result in heat avoidance. Thus, plants, although apparently static and passive, show remarkable capaci- ties to regulate their internal tempera- tures by a complex variety of strategies. Those include solar heating, as in diahe- liotropic solar furnaces (Kevan,1989) 3, microgreenhouse effects 2019)4,5, (van Kooi et al. 2019)1and con- comitant cooling by evapotranspiration (the swamp cooler effect (Galen C, 2006)6, paraheliotropism and adaptive morphogenesis (Crawford et al, 2012).7 Thus, plants are, as Michaletz et al. (2015)8argue, but from the viewpoint of metabolism, limited homoeotherms! A major consequence of plant ther- moregulation is atmospheric air con- ditioning. Transpirational evaporation humidifies the atmosphere above the vegetational canopy. With nocturnal, altitudinal and adiabatic atmospheric cooling, moisture in the air condensesas the dew point is reached - clouds form and rain may result, sometimes with violent electrical discharges (thunderstorms). The more humid theair, as over forests, the lower in the atmosphere the processes are initi- ated. By comparison, drier and hotter air rises further, even if somewhat faster, to possibly form thinner, higher clouds that may be blown away. Deforestation, devegetation and desertification forestall, or even preclude, autochthonous, locally derived, moisture cycling. Those pro- cesses, exacerbated by global heating and the influence of increasing oceanic evaporation, may contributeconsiderably to extreme weather events far from the sites of forest thermoregulation. Numerous means for the mitigation of the effects of climate change are advocated and instituted. Strategies range in scale from macro to micro; from direct intervention on atmo- spheric chemistry (reducing the influx of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, cloud seeding), indirect environmental amelioration (irrigation, reafforestation, smoke smudging), to genetic manipu- lations (cold, heat, drought and pest tolerant crops and livestock). Plant thermoregulation and its conse- quences are hardly understood in terms of climate change. A new, dynamic and highly interdisci- plinary, scientific approach to phy- tomicrometeorology is needed. The cast of players must range from theoretical physicists with interests in atmospheric thermodynamics, to cli- matologists, meteorologists, microm- eteorologists, botanists of all stripes and eclectic ecologists. With many organisations advocating the need for scientifically based policy, especially for national and interna- tional laws and accords on pressing environmental issues, it is vital that policymakers embrace broader per- spectives than have been usually taken for initiating action. Governmentsaround the world need to sponsor far-reaching and more expansive, approaches to environmental sciences, especially as they relate to the drivers of local to global climate change. The importance of vegetational thermoreg- ulation in mitigating the effects of both cold and heat, i.e. plants as limited, but highly environmentally influential, homoeotherms, seems like an over- looked dimension to understanding the world's climate problems and in possibly seeking solutions. 1 Casper J. van der Kooi1 , Peter G.

Sc., Ph.

While China and India are the largest growers of the vegetable, countries likeMorocco, Turkey, European nations such as The Nether- lands, Spain, France, Belgium and the U.S. are also prominent. There are hundreds of varieties of tomatofor growers, the choice depending on varying prefer- ences including taste, texture, colour, size and bush type to name a few. Many growers prefer to grow twoor more varieties of tomatoes, including at least one heirloom varieties mainly due to the breed's popularity and suitability to UK's climate. However, the flavour-richheirloom tomatoes are often susceptible to diseases many of the commercially available disease-resistant varieties are not characterised by a rich flavour. Tomatoes generally grow well in a moderately well- drained soil type and various biotic and abiotic factors influence its production and yield apart from physiolog- ical factors such as wind patterns, temperature, humid-ity and inherent varietal resistance, often resulting in blossom-end rot, fruit cracks and uneven ripening. These physiological conditions also play an importantrole in ensuring productivity and yield. The most common problems for the crop are caused by low tem- peratures, over-watering or wet weather. Therefore, it is important to ensure good aeration, water drainage, light and proper nutritional balance of the soil. Judicious use of herbicides is also necessary to avoid curling, stunted growth, discolouration of leaves, strapping etc. Identication and control of infectious diseases in tomato Infectious diseases reduce yield and aect produce quality, the most common categories being wilts, leaf spots/blights, fruit spots and rots. Most of the pathogens are fungal in origin with bacterial- and viral- borne infections close behinds with symptoms varyingwith the host. However, there are certain denitive symptoms that help in the positive identication of thetarget pathogen. For example, the presence of a yellow halo surrounding a tan to the dark brown lesion is an indication of bacterial infection despite the symptom being absent when bacterial spots and blights occur. Fungal blight (especially late blight) is considered as one of the deadly diseases that can aect tomatoes and its impact is devastating just like it is in potatoes and other crops. Viruses are highly infectious and readily transmitted by any means. Dierent symptoms including light and dark green mottling of the leaves can occur because of viral attacks. For example, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) causes mottling of older leaves and may cause the mal- formation of leaflets, which may lead to shoestring-like in shape. Certain symptoms of viral infections are char-acterised by leaf mottling, curling, stem and petiole streaking, spotted fruit and stunted plants; these symp- toms can sometimes be confused with herbicide damage. Therefore, it is imperative for proper identi- cation and understanding of the disease agent and its ability, determining if it's infectious or not, to devise and implement proper control and corrective measures. The use of disease-resistant varieties, certied disease- free seeds, crop rotation practices, sequential planting,sanitation (removal of crop debris) and ensuringproper nutrition, aeration and drainage can to a certain extent, prevent the occurrence of diseases; however,integrated preventive and control measures are stillimportant to ensure product quality and yield. European Union (EU) regulations have reduced the availability of chemical control measures and the current measures, while eective during early stages of the disease are often unsuccessful at later stages, especially for diseases such as late blight and result inAarthi Janakiraman, Industry Manager, Chemicals and Advanced Materials at TechVision, Frost & Sullivan, discusses advances in plant pathology, with a focus on the impact of this on tomato diseasesAGRICULTURE 333the destruction of crops, without any eective ways to control the spread of the disease. Therefore, the selec- tion of disease-resistant varieties has become one of the widely adopted methods to prevent diseases. Despite its success, it cannot be an eective alternativefor integrated pest management (IPM) measures andintegrated glasshouse management (IGM) in case of cultivation in more controlled glasshouse and indoor environment. To successfully implement IPM, it's critical to understand the interactions between plants, environ- mental conditions, disease-causing agents and its eect on growth, yield and quality; continuing advances in plantpathology studies makes it feasible and can help achieve positive results in disease prevention and control. Research advances in plant pathology: Need of the hour While plants inherently develop ways to resist and deal with pathogenic attacks, it's also common thatpathogens are becoming more resistant to control measures and counterattack the plants defence mech- anisms. Therefore, the earlier approach of studying only the influence of biotic factors on plant growth is no longer relevant. Pathology studies are increasingly focusing on molecular and gene- level interactions ofpathogens and plants rather than only morphological and physiological influences. Varying approaches for disease management and prevention are being researched, ranging from encapsulating nanoparticles of HarpinPss to improve disease resistance, use of growth-promoting agents to enhance biological resist-ance of diseases, use of gene silencing techniques for improved resistance and combat diseases, apart from a continuing focus on developing biological plant protection aids. Researchers are also set to develop high-throughputdiagnostic technologies, based on nano-sequencing techniques. The possible use of deep learning platforms and neural networks for real-time detection of tomato plant diseases and pests are also being investigated. Despite various initiatives, there are still signicant gaps in research that can result in the development of fool-proof ways to monitor for potential attacks, scanand monitor for the possible onset of new diseases. There is also a need for initiatives that can help in con- tingency planning to prevent potential vulnerabilities and future threats. Studies on integrated approachesthat can lead to ecient and sustainable cultivation,harvesting and post-harvesting techniques are needed to ensure nutritional quality and microbiological integrity of tomato produce. This can be achieved only through collaborative and joint eorts of all stakehold- ers, ranging from growers associations to academia and private companies. With consumer requirements towards \"clean-label\" and high-quality produce at an all-time high, it is important that key stakeholders focus on research, development and implementation of techniques that can not only ensure yield and prof- itability but also guarantee the nutritive value and quality as demanded by the end-consumers.

Nissan, G. and S.(2019), Diagnosis of plant diseases Tel: www.twitter.com/Frost_SullivanWheat is the number one arable crop grown in the UK and Europe, and globally, the wheat crop provides 20% of the total calories consumed by humans each day. Wheat is also a valuable source of animal feed and is increas- ingly used in a wide range of manufac- turing processes. The EU harvested 142.6 million tonnes of wheat in 2017. Currently, wheat yields are not resilient to adverse weather conditions or various biotic and abiotic stresses. As a result, 'on farm' yields remain static. Each season because of diseases caused by microscopic pathogens, predominantly specialist infectious fungal, bacterial and virus species, potential wheat yields are reduced by 16 to 25%. Pathogens rapidly grow and reproduce within wheat plants and spread disease to neighbouring fields and regions thereby causing disease epidemics and pandemics if left unchecked. Collectively, these pathogens reduce crop canopy, root system and flower health thereby lowering grain yield, quality and sometime grain safety. Within the wheat pathogenomics research team at Rothamsted we focus on several pathogenic fungi of global importance. In this article wewill feature two persistent disease problems of fungal origin which are causing the agrochemical industry, plant breeders, agronomists andfarmers frequent headaches. The first leaf blotch disease is caused by Zymoseptoria tritici and the second Head blight disease is caused by a group of Fusarium species (Figure 1). Our multi-disciplinary team includes plant pathologists, molecular biologists, geneticists, computational biologists and field crop scientists. We are pursuing a two-pronged experimental approach. On the one hand we investigate how fungi attack wheat and cause disease by discovering the genes, proteins and chemical metabo- lites involved, as well as defining the underlying interconnecting networks which co-ordinate the early infection process. In concert with this, we are exploring the molecular processes used by wheat cells to perceive fungal pathogen attacks as well as dissecting the plant defence components that are activated to rapidly stop fungal growth and minimise disease formation. In recent years, our discovery research toolbox has been substantially improved thanks to the full sequences of pathogen and wheat genomes becoming available (i.e. their DNA blueprints). Finding pathogen genes required for stealth or attack To be successful, a pathogen needs initially to attach itself to, and then grow along, across and ultimately into, plant tissues. Whilst doing so it must also mask its presence and remainsymptomless, until its size and strength becomes sufficient to overwhelm the plant and cause disease. Our group has identified several key genes from both Fusarium and Zymoseptoria species which are important for these events. By randomly inducing muta- tions into the genome of Zymoseptoria and then testing for mutants which could not grow on leaf surfaces, we've identified a key virulence gene GT2(a specialist enzyme called glycosyltrans- ferase 2). The identical Fusarium gene is also crucial for the infection of wheat floral tissues. Inactivation of these genes would likely protect plants from the corresponding diseases.We've also identified a key \"stealth\" gene called 3LysMwhich prevents Zymoseptoria being recognised early on by the plant's defences, thus givingit time to build up inside the infected wheat leaves. Blocking this fungal gene would also likely prevent disease. Finding wheat genes required to stop pathogens To be successful, a plant needs to recognise an invading pathogen andrapidly switch on an effective defenceresponse as well as prepare for subsequent attacks. Despite Zymoseptoria being such an important wheat pathogen, only a small number of genes for resistance to Zymoseptoria have been identified so far and surprisingly very little is known about how these genes actually operate to protect wheat. Dr Kim Hammond-Kosack at Rothamsted Research highlights an aspect of plant pathology that concerns the importance of finding new ways to disarm old enemies in wheat diseasesPlant pathology: The global impact of wheat diseases 334PROFILETo help us answer some of these questions, we isolated the very first Zymoseptoria resistance gene from wheat known as Stb6. This gene belongs to a large previously uncharc- terised gene family in wheat, codes for a cell wall residing immune receptor protein that senses a protein secreted by Zymoseptoria during attempted infection and triggers defence. Unravelling the molecular mechanism of Stb6 mediated resistance will help inform future effective strategies for disease control. Moreover, the knowledge already gained in our studies will help to isolate additional resistance genes for deployment through breeding in wheat improve- ment programmes. Outlook The most sustainable solution to reduce plant diseases is through delivering life-long protection within or on the planted seed. This can be achieved by combining a triad of approaches. Through plant breedingby 'stacking' or 'pyramiding' multiple disease resistance genes that activate different plant defences against the same pathogenic species. By removing or inactivating disease susceptibility genes that were unwit- tingly incorporated into elite cultivars by breeders when introducing another, beneficial trait. Through the application of novel chemicals or biological agents to the seed in coat- ings that go on to combat infections throughout the life-span of each plant by reducing the effectiveness of pathogen stealth or attack Blight. Fusarium species infect the flowering crop causing premature bleaching of floral tissues. Infection results in lower quality grains contaminated with hazardous mycotoxins that are regulated by the European Food Safety Authority. (B) Septoria Leaf blotch. Zymoseptoria tritici causes the complete death of infected wheat leaves, preventing the plant from capturing sunlight needed for plant growth. Both fungal species are either partially to fully resistant to all commercial fungicides. (C) A healthy wheat crop. A B C 336The Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). It has a wide- ranging mission to protect and promote U.S. agriculturalhealth, regulate genetically engineered organisms, administer the Animal Welfare Act and carry out wildlifedamage management activities. A key element of the agency's work is the ongoing protection of animal and plant resources from pests and disease. The potential damage of major agricultural pests, such as the Mediterranean fruit fly or Asian long-horned beetle, going unchecked could run into the billions of dollars in lost production annually. Similarly, if diseases like Foot and Mouth or highly pathogenic avian influenza became established in the United States, it could lead to foreign trade restrictions and devastating losses for producers. The Plant Protection Act 2000 was introduced toprevent the importation, exportation and spread ofpests and to provide for their control and eradication, as well as to provide for the certication of plants. The act consolidated related responsibilities previouslysplit between several other laws, such as the Plant Quarantine Act, the Federal Plant Pest Act and theFederal Noxious Weed Act. APHIS takes an aggressive approach to pest control and in recent years has focused on improving a risk-based approach to simplify processes for dealing with low-risk pests and pathogens while allowing greater resources to be focused on high-risk categories. In 2016, the USDA's Plant Protection & Quarantine (PPQ) programme introduced risk-based sampling forimported agricultural commodities. While the most commonly applied plant health measure worldwide, inspection is not necessarily the most ecient tool for keeping pests out of the country, the APHIS said at the time. In addition, most inspections sample a flat percentage, for example, 2%, of every incoming shipment. This approach is widely usedAPHIS, part of the USDA, is using a risk-based approach to protect U.S. agriculture from potentially devasting plant pests and diseases, as we discover here Protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and pathogensAGRICULTURE337around the world but does not produce consistent detection rates for pests: a 2% sample of a largeshipment could inflate detection rates because a large number of samples are taken, whereas with a 2%sample of a small shipment, detection rates can beunderestimated, particularly if infestation rates are low. To make port inspections more eective, the PPQanalysed data to identify high-risk imports without increasing the inspection eort or resources. To do this, scientists employed an online tool that eectively reverse-engineered the process by using a selected detection rate to calculate a statistically appropriatenumber of units to inspect from each incoming shipment at the PPQ's 16 Plant Inspection Stations. Since the change, PPQ inspectors have detected pests at a consistent level because they know how many boxes they need to sample to condently determine ifthere is a problem with a shipment. More recently, APHIS revised the regulations that govern the movement of plant pests to align them with current policies, remove obsolete requirements and streamline the permit process for low-risk organisms. The changes, which came into eect on 9th August, means listed plant pests used by academic, industry and government researchers for activities including studies of micro-organisms, the isolation of novel compoundsfor use in pharmaceuticals, biological control and lab and eld research into plant pest control and resistance,can be moved without a specic permit. The rule also applies to private sector entities, such as zoos, biologically based pest control companies, butterfly release enterprises, some live pet food retailers and speciality retailers that sell products for human consumption. The changes are intended to make permit requirements clearer and more transparent for customers, while making the permitting process faster for low-risk pests and pathogens, and allowing resources to be focused on high-risk groups. 2020 promises to be a big year for APHIS as the United Nations General Assembly has designated it as theInternational Year of Plant Health (IYPH), described as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to raise global awareness of how protecting plant health can help to end hunger, reduce poverty, protect the environment and support economic development. The statistics speak for themselves. Plants make up 80% of our food and produce 98% of our oxygen. Worldwide trade in agricultural products has grown almost three-fold over the past decade, reaching $1.7 trillion. \"The potential damage of major agricultural pests, such as the Mediterranean fruit fly or Asian long-horned beetle, going unchecked could run into the billions of dollars in lost production annually.\" Plant pests are responsible for the loss of up 40% of global food crops and for trade losses in agricultural products exceeding $220 billion annually. At the same time, climate change threatens to reduce the qualityand quantity of crops, while plant pests are appearingearlier and in places they have never been seen before. This is at a time when agricultural production will haveto rise by an estimated 60% by 2050 in order to feed a larger and generally richer population. The IPYH will focus primarily on preventing the spread of plant pests and diseases, emphasising that, just aswith human health, preventing disease is far more cost- eective than dealing with a full-blown outbreak. APHIS Revises the Regulations for the Movement of Plant Pests and Biocontrol Agents . Open Access Government editorial@openaccessgovernment.org www.openaccessgovernment.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovAGRICULTURE The most recent report of the United Nations Intergovernmen- tal Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) painted a bleak picture regard- ing the loss of forests due to the demands of our food system- from the way we clear land for farming, trans- porting products and package them for consumer consumption. One of the strategies for combatting climate change is the planting of more trees, especially in urban and marginal lands. Trees provide numerousecosystem services, foremost among them the removal of carbon dioxide from the air and sequestering it in the wood of trees through the process of photosynthesis. However, as laudableand seemingly simple this goal is, large tree-planting programmes in urban areas often fall short of the desired intent of creating large tree canopies to mop up CO 2. \"If trees are in restricted soil conditions so that the increased demand for water is not be met, tree growth or survival might, therefore, suffer.\" The keys to creating a healthy tree canopy is to assess site conditions, choose the appropriate tree species, prepare and design for adequate growing space - especially below ground - and transplant the tree with a reasonable amount of early after- care. The first step of this process is often overlooked. A site assessment is a thorough and detailed evaluation of landscape site conditions to understand limitationsor opportunities for successful plant growth and to maximise the potential for a healthy tree canopy. With all of the best of intentions, anyone trying to plant trees or create a landscape in an urban context needs to have a firm understanding ofenvironmental resources that allowtrees to grow to their envisioned size. Most of the places we live in, whether rural, suburban or urban have been significantly impacted by human activ- ities, whether it is by building a house,creating roads, laying pavement for a sidewalk or a parking lot. These alterations are unquestionably more numerous in an inner-city areas than rural villages, yet they are fundamen- tally the same in terms of their impact. We need to approach planting activi- ties in human-impacted landscapes as rigorously as we engineer the urban environment into which we place them. No one would think of building a house without adhering to sound construction principles. Yet, with treesin the urban context, we seem to feel that they will take care of themselves. The urban landscape has modified and disturbed urban soils through their removal and replacement, re-grading, compaction, cutting and filling and contamination in the pro-cess of creating the built environment. All these impacts profoundly change the physical, chemical and biological nature of the soil, the very substrate that trees depend on for so many of their vital resources. Back to basics The most basic questions askedduring a site assessment relate to the acquisition of vital resources for plant growth: water, light, oxygen and carbon dioxide, nutrients and appro- priate temperatures. Where is the water coming from? Is the plant get- ting too little water due to soil restric- tions or too much water due to lack of drainage or a high water table - or perhaps both alternating at differentDr Nina Bassuk, Professor at Cornell University, tells us precisely why site assessments are key to sustainable urban tree establishmentSite assessment: The key to sustainable urban tree establishment 338PROFILE Poor tree growth inresponse to poor drainagetimes of the year? Is the soil so dense that roots cannot grow, thereby, limit- ing their ability to take up water in a restricted soil volume? Are there enough available nutrients in the soil? Changes in soil pH can make nutrients more or less available to be taken up by plant roots. In urban environments because of anthropic materials incorporated into the soil, pH can vary significantly. Is there enough oxygen? All parts of the plants, shoots and roots, need oxygen. If soil drainage is impaired and all soil pores are filled with water, then oxygen will be limited and roots may die. Or if a gas leak dis- places oxygen in the soil, plant roots will also suffer. Lack of oxygen in the root zone is one of the fastest killers of vegetation. Is there enough light for plant growth? Light is the driving force of photosynthesis. Many plants haveevolved to take advantage of varying levels of light; however, trees, for the most part, being the tallest plants in the landscape require about six hours of sun a day during the growing season, according to estimates. Urban environments with tall buildings that cause false horizons can limit the amount of direct sunlight that treesreceive. Carbon dioxide is rarely a limiting factor in the urban environment or else-where. It is the essential gas necessary for the production of carbohydrates during photosynthesis. However, if plants experience water deficits, their stomata (pores that regulate water loss and carbon dioxide uptake in the leaves) close to prevent greater water loss. When this occurs carbon dioxide is prevented from entering the leaf and photosynthesis is reduced. \"The keys to creating a healthy tree canopy is to assess site conditions, choose the appropriate tree species, prepare and design for adequate growing space - especially below ground - and transplant the tree with a reasonable amount of early aftercare. The first step of this process is often overlooked.\" Are temperatures appropriate for plant growth? Urban areas are found to create 'heat islands' that can increase temperatures several degrees from the surrounding countryside. More importantly, are the microclimate effects of building facades increasing the reflected and radiating heat fromcar tops and asphalt that can cause trees to lose water faster or in extreme cases, directly damage leaves? If trees are in restricted soil conditions so that the increased demand for water is not be met, tree growth or survival might,therefore, suffer.A process of establishment With a good understanding of site con- ditions that promote or limit opportu- nities for planting, it is now possible to proceed in the plant establishment process. After site assessment, we can then ask about what plants are best adapted and support biodiversity in the site? Matching up the site constraints or opportunities to plant requirements is the important next step in successful plant establishment.

Built in 2016, she is the most recent addition to the sizeable fleet of ice breakers based a mere ten-minute walk away from the HELCOM Secretariat in Helsinki. But does thefact that Finland maintains a fleet of heavy-duty ships to break the sea ice in her waters mean that climatechange has not reached the Baltic Sea? Unfortunately not. In fact, this region is warming faster than Earth as a whole and the sea ice cover has decreased dramatically since the middle of the 20th century. And there is more to come. Over the next 100 years, precipitation is expected to increase but the snow season will likely become shorter and the sea ice cover could decline even further. Other eects of climate change in the Baltic Sea could include higher air and water temperatures, lower salinity, decreased oxygenlevels and shifts in habitats and species distribution. In other words, climate change is adding more pressure to a fragile ecosystem already aected by a wide varietyof anthropogenic impacts, such as eutrophication, pollution, overshing and habitat loss. But HELCOM is working to tackle this issue. A priority of the currentFinnish presidency of HELCOM, climate change has long been on the agenda of our organisation. Since 2007, HELCOM Ministerial Meetings have stressed that climate change will impact on the region's marine environment and should, therefore, be reflected in HELCOM policies.In 2007, HELCOM published its rst thematic assessment of climate change, jointly with BALTEX. More recently, in the Declaration of the Ministerial Meeting held in Brussels, Belgium in 2018, HELCOM Ministers not only reiterated their concern about the impacts of climatechange but also stressed, \"the need for research and adaptive management to strengthen the resilience of the Baltic Sea in the face of climate change impacts.\" They also agreed, \"to increase HELCOM's preparedness to respond to climate change impacts, by taking foreseenclimate change impacts into account when updating the Baltic Sea Action Plan and by exploring the needs and possibilities to further adapt HELCOM's policies and recommendations 1) in line with existing objectives of protection of the marine environment and sustainable use of marine resources, also under the changingclimate and 2) to maximise the capacity of the Baltic Sea ecosystem to contribute to mitigation of climate changethrough blue carbon storage.\" \"Climate change is adding more pressure to a fragile ecosystem already affected by a wide variety of anthropogenic impacts, such as eutrophication, pollution, overfishing and habitat loss.\" In plain language: the Contracting Parties to HELCOMshare the view that the ultimate aim of HELCOM's workon climate change should be increased resilience of the Baltic Sea system to the impacts of climate change and that a long-term, multidisciplinary approach to understanding and communicating its implications for the region's marine and coastal environment is needed. We are, therefore, working to establish HELCOM as aregional platform for policy-science dialogue on climate change, to provide robust, policy-relevant and research-based knowledge on the state, impacts and vulnerabilities of the Baltic Sea with respect to climate change and we are reviewing our policies with a view to promoting climate change adaptation. While HELCOM's various Expert Groups and networks already strive to take account of climate change, HELCOM has now taken the topic to the next level byestablishing a dedicated Network on Climate Change (EN-CLIME), jointly with Baltic Earth, a focal point for technical marine climate change information and expertise in the region. Working in the context of our State and Conservation Working Group and consistingExecutive Secretary of HELCOM, R\u00fcdiger Strempel explores the effects of climate change in the Baltic Sea and in this respect, he argues for resilienceMARITIME AFFAIRS 341of experts from both organisations, EN-CLIME cooperates closely with both other HELCOM Groups and networks and external partners. One of EN-CLIME's deliverables will be a climate change fact sheet. As a science-driven exercise, the fact sheet is intended to oer policymakers a concise and easilyaccessible resource providing a consensus view by the region's experts regarding relevant abiotic and biotic parameters, thus, helping to bridge the science-policy gap. The fact sheet will then continually be updated toreflect advances in science and understanding of climate change as it relates to our region. Based on the best available science, we will also broaden the scope of the Baltic Sea Action Plan, HELCOM's ambitious program of action for a healthier Baltic Sea, toencompass climate change when updating the plan for the post-2021 period. Whether Polaris and her fellow icebreakers will still be needed 50 or 100 years from now is dicult to predict.But as we gain a better understanding of the dynamics and implications of climate change for the Baltic Sea, a clearer picture will emerge of what needs to be done to ensure a sustainable and liveable future for the Sea that denes our region and for the region as a whole.

Communication and collaboration between scientific specialisations and companies at the regional level is essential to harness the industrial and innovation potential of Europe's maritime regions. To support the alliances that lead to discoveries and positive impacts on our environments and ourselves, research facilities, such as European Research Infrastructures (RI), have been developed. RIs are sector spe- cific; they provide the resources and services necessary to support and advance research and foster innova- tion in their given field. The European Marine Biological Resource Centre (EMBRC-ERIC) is a distributed researchinfrastructure that supports researchin the fields of marine biology and ecology. With a network of renowned marine biological stations and insti- tutes across Europe, EMBRC is able to provide access to marine organisms, marine ecosystems, and the facilities necessary to study them. Marine biological resources havebecome major targets for the biotech-nology sector, with application in fields such as aquaculture, production offood, nutraceutics, pharmaceutics and cosmetics, agronomy, and environmen- talhealth assessment. Each marine station that makes up the EMBRC con- sortium has connections to its region and government at local level. Biotech- nology is a growing sector in many peripheral maritime regions, composed mainly of start-ups, small and medium enterprises, and only a few larger companies. This sector is thus of grow- ing importance economically, whilealso being a source of high value jobs in regions that traditionally have been less developed from a technological perspective. The resources that EMBRC brings to its users have the potential to enrichboth industry and the regions where EMBRC facilities are located. To build up the socioeconomic potential of the maritime regions of Europe, EMBRC emphasises marine biodiversity as anHere, the EMBRC-ERIC (European Marine Biological Resource Centre) explores the need to develop research activities by focusing on innovation ecosystemsDeveloping research in maritime regions through innovation ecosystems 342PROFILE The multiregional, pan-European innovation ecosystems being developed by EMBRC.

EMBRC will aim to create links between each region to establish collaborations and cooperation amongst them.

Companies recognise the potential of blue technologies and bio-economy, though they may lack the tools and resources for the research that needs to be developed in the marine field. EMBRC pools resources and skills, offering access to expertise, facilities, and equipment that many SMEs cannot afford, enabling them to innovate and bring new products to market. Furthermore, as a platform for public and private collaboration, companies receive access to research activities best performed by academia which complement private sector research, accelerating the development of the blue bioeconomy. In order to enable the regional inno- vation ecosystems, EMBRC is working to link researchers, companies, sci- ence parks, and company incubators around its platforms and facilities. These maritime regions which boast RIs and stimulate their use through local grants are thus beginning to act as catalysts to attract companiesand investment. Such activity enables research that was not previously possible and results in higher visibility for the regions. The onsite expertise and resources offered by EMBRC are important for solving problematic bottlenecks and help develop the economy of the regions themselves. Integrating the RI at the local level increases the socio-economic impact of the RI by becoming a corner stone of local economies. Enabling local innovation ecosystems leads to the reduction of gaps in research that exist today. Maritimeregions are given a boost in their activities and, in return, provide resources to companies and research infrastructure, which in turn, increases the local innovation potential. Further- more,the international nature of the RIs gives the potential for the mobility of knowledge across disciplines. The transfer of technology developed inthe region not only has the capability to increase but also has the potentialto spread across multiple regions and countries, creating new synergies, co-operations, and markets, giving the regions potentially global reach.Sidonie Gras Scientific Officer and Project Manager Tel: +33 144 277 266 sidonie.gras@embrc.eu Nicolas de Ibon Cancio Associate Professor in Cell Biology Plentzia Marine Station (PiE-UPV/EHU) University of the Basque Country ibon.cancio@ehu.eus 343PROFILEMARITIME AFFAIRS 344How EU decisions affect fish, the ocean and life on earth Europe's seas are home to some of the world's most productive sheries, and the European Union (EU) is the world's largest trader of seafood products.1What we do with sh matters; as well as providing food and jobs for the shing industry - sh keep our marine ecosystems functioning. Fishand marine life are the engines of our global ocean, the ocean that supplies us with every second breath drives our climate, and has absorbed 90% of the excess heatproduced from accelerated climate change. You could say the ocean is the heart and lungs of the planet. So with sh populations coming under severe pressure from both climate change and overshing, the question arises - by ending one problem, can the otherbe alleviated? And can we do it fast enough to make a dierence? The EU has long acknowledged its overshing problem and member governments have committed to putting an end to it. Yet sh populations continue to be shed far beyond what scientists advise - and at the last count, some 1.7 million tonnes of 'unwanted' sh were being discarded at sea dead or dying every year - wasted. This is clearly absurd. Back in 2013, hundreds of thousands of people around Europe thought so too and demanded an end to overshing and discarding. Following pressure from civil society, industry and politicians, EU governments agreed to reform the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to end overshing by2015, or by 2020 at the latest. A great deal of backslapping followed as ministers congratulated themselves on a job well done. But with commitment, action is required; 2015 is long past - and with 2020 fast approaching, EU Member States continue overshing, treating our seas as a resource to be mined, rather than an ecosystem that supportslife on our planet and a collectively-owned public good for the benet of all citizens, now and in the future. As a result, many EU sh populations are being shed beyond what scientists advise is sustainable. In April 2019, a report of the EU's own scientic experts 2found that 41% of assessed populations in the Northeast Atlantic were still subject to overshing in 2017 and 37% of stocks were still outside safe biological limits. In the Mediterranean, around 90% of sh populationsare overshed. \"It's time to sink or swim. The EU and a number of Member States have begun to acknowledge the state of the climate crisis.\" At last December's AGRIFISH Council in Brussels, an annual gathering where EU shing quotas are horse- traded during closed-door, all-night sessions, sheries ministers agreed to quotas a whopping 300,000 tonnesabove scientic advice for the North-East Atlantic in 2019 - increasing overshing by 10% on the previous year. Good, publicly-funded scientic advice is placed on ministers' desks, but when it comes to the crunch, long-term social, nancial and ecological thinking is cast aside in favour of short term prot or political deals. The situation often worsens the following year, when scientists advise even bigger cuts to quotas - because previous decisions have worsened the health of the sh populations - creating a negative feedback loop that spirals downwards. To make matters worse, discarding of unwanted sh at sea has not stopped; the massive waste of sh through bycatch continues and improvements in shing selectivity and catch documentation anticipated by the reformed CFP has not eventuated. Many believe this isRebecca Hubbard, Programme Director of the Our Fish campaign, reveals precisely how EU decisions affect fish, the ocean and life on earthMARITIME AFFAIRS 345largely because there is virtually no policing of shing vessels at sea and without monitoring and enforcement, the rules are simply being ignored. With stories of widespread illegal and unreported catches emerging,Our Fish has launched Fishyleaks.eu , to provide a secure and anonymous website for reporting infringements. Does it have to be this way? Of course not. Will it take a long time to change? No. During two EU Councilmeetings of two days each and one week of negotiations with Norway, the EU sets its annual shing limits. Member States can end overshing by 2020 (as lawdemands), by simply following scientic advice. And they can enforce the ban on discards by introducing RemoteElectronic Monitoring on shing vessels (CCTV in working areas) to verify that what they are catching and reporting,reflects the sh that are being brought ashore. Is overshing the only threat to the ocean? Certainly not. But besides the rapidly worsening impacts of climate change, it is still considered the greatest. Can removing one help the other? A new paper from scientists at the University of British Columbia, released on 2ndSeptember and commissioned by Our Fish, nds that one of the clearest pathways to building ocean resilience in the face of climate change is to end overshing. The paper nds that overshing severely weakens the health of the ocean. So when climate change hits, the ability of the ocean (and its wildlife and sh populations) to withstand that extra impact, is severely undermined.But scientists have found that by removing the pressure of overshing, sh species have a drastically increasedchance of survival. Combined with the fact that sh helpsink carbon in the ocean and reducing extra boats will achieve a more protable and sustainable carrying capacity, it means ending overshing will also capture more carbon and reduce emissions. 3 It's time to sink or swim. The EU and a number ofMember States have begun to acknowledge the state of the climate crisis. They are debating a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and talking about new Green Deals which will prioritise action that pulls back the runaway climate change train and saves nature for our children. But if the EU is going to do this, it needs to put the ocean at the heart of any climate action plan - because the ocean is the heart and lungs of the planet. And we aregoing to need many tools and strategies, including those that can be practically delivered immediately. Not only does ending overshing rebuild marine life and deliver on EU sheries law, but it is also instrumental in bolstering ocean resilience in the face of dangerous climate change. Ending overshing is emergency climate action and it's time the EU slams on the brakes. References 1 EUMOFA, 2016. The EU sh Market 2016 edition.

This leads to an increased demand for food, especially high-value proteins and lipids. Today, only 5% of protein consumed comes from the ocean, while about 17% of the animal protein is supplied by fishand marine food. To increase the availability of high-value protein, there is a need to increase the amount offood coming from the ocean. Since most fish stocks are already fully exploited or overexploited, we cannot expect to increase the amount of captured fish. One way to increase the amount of food from the ocean is to improve the utilisation of the catch. Up to 50% of the fish is commonly discarded when preparing seafood industrially. Others claim that seafood processing discards and by-products make up around 75% of the total weight of the catch. Today, the potential of rest raw mate- rial is not fully exploited. There is no single definition of marine by-prod-ucts. Usually, we talk about viscera, heads, cut-offs, bone, skin and fish thatis damaged or unsuitable for humanconsumption (or further processing) and bycatch. In Norway, 'by-products'are defined as products that are not regarded as ordinary saleable products (fillet, round, eviscerated or beheaded fish), but which can be recycled after treatment. 'Waste' includes products that cannot be used for feed or value- added products, but which have to becomposted, burned or destroyed. Marine by-products intended for human consumption are not included in this definition and the term rest raw material should, therefore, be used. Increasing demand for more conve- nient products - fillets, ready to heat/ready to cook meals leads to a higher proportion of fish that is beingprocessed before sale. The trend in the Norwegian pelagic industry is towards more processing instead of exporting the fish as frozen whole fish. In 2018, Norway generated approximately 205,000 tonnes of rest raw material from the pelagic industry out of a total catch of 1,296,000 tonnes (Richardsen et al., 2018). However, a large part of the mackerel is still exported as round frozen fish. The rest raw material from pelagic fish contains high amounts of beneficial and healthy long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, high-quality protein and other valuable components such as nucleic acids, calcium and phosphorus. The rest raw material, therefore, has high potential in the production of high- quality bio-molecules with various applications within the food, pharma- ceutical and cosmetic industries. This upward trend in filleting of pelagicspecies, mainly herring and mackerel, will produce higher amounts of rest raw materials. It is, therefore, highlyimportant to study different ways of utilisation in order to utilise thisresource to the fullest of its potential. The main challenges with the utilisa- tion of rest raw material from pelagic fish are the high-fat content and the high content of dark muscle. The quality of the raw materials and retaining the quality of the rest raw materials is one of the key factors for successful utilisation where fresh raw material gives better products. Rest raw material can be divided into two main groups: fractions with a high concentration of different endoge- nous enzymes (fractions containing viscera or blood) and more stable fractions such as heads, skin and bones. The first group is especially susceptible to fast degradation even at low storage temperatures. In Norway, the main part of rest raw material from pelagic fish is used to produce fish meal and oil. The fish oil is currently the main product gener- ated from the rest raw material of fatty fish and has traditionally been produced by cooking and pressing followed by centrifugal separation. However, the high temperatures used may be hard on the sensitive marine lipids, leading to faster degradation and oxidation. Carvajal et al. (2015)showed that high-quality herring oil could be extracted from fresh herring rest raw material with more gentle heating (60-70\u00b0C). Different types of protein fractions can be produced from fish rest rawTurid Rustad, Professor NTNU in Norway, explains the opportunities and challenges when it comes to the full utilisation of the catch of pelagic fish to meet the increasing demand for foodFull utilisation of the catch of pelagic fish: Opportunities and challenges 346PROFILEmaterial. Flesh from backbones and cut-offs can be used for the produc- tion of fish mince and surimi. Recov- ery of proteins with good functional properties from rest raw material and small fatty pelagic fishes has been difficult due to the high content of heme proteins and lipids, resulting in pressure lowering and oxidation prob- lems. The pH shift method where the proteins are solubilized at either high or low pH and then precipitated at isoelectric pH has been shown to give good yields and be a good method for removal of heme and lipids (Abdollahi and Undeland, 2018). Enzymatic hydrolysis is a processing method for recovering both fish oil and protein from fish rest raw materials. Fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) havegood functional properties (water- holding, texture, gelling, foaming and emulsification) as well as high nutritional value. Hydrolysates frompelagic rest raw material have also been shown to have bioactive proper- ties such as antioxidant activity and blood pressure-lowering effect. Some of the challenges related to producing protein hydrolysates are related to taste. The production of tasteless hydrolysates from pelagics has been studied in several projects. Both the bitter peptides and the lipids and lipid oxidation products in the hydrolysate fractions have been shown to contribute towards the unwanted bitter taste. The current primary use of pelagic rest raw materials is towards low-end products - for production of fish meal used for aquaculture feed and pet food. A shift towards the production of higher-quality products for human consumption will generate a higher value as well as resulting in higher efficiency in the bio-economy.

It marks the culmination of decades of campaigning by The Wildlife Trusts and a highly signicant moment in thestruggle to get the legislation and political will to deliver an ecologically coherent network of protectedareas at sea. This network of protected areas will ultimately allow our small corner of the blue planet to recover. It has not been easy, however. When I began my career in marine conservation thirty years ago our seas were under tremendous pressure from a range of damaging activities including over-shing, oil exploration and pollution. What's more, there were only three MarineNature Reserves in the whole of the UK and a handful of Voluntary Marine Conservation Areas. We surveyed the myriad sea-bed types and multitude of beauties, curiosities and downright breath-taking marine wildlife around our shores - and talked to anyone who'd listen about the wonders of our seas. Yet, at the same time as we gathered public support to protect the wonders of our marine environment, cod nearly became commercially extinct in the North Sea, hundreds of dolphins were being washed-up dead on our shores and in the 1980s and 90s, horse mussel communities were destroyed in one of our few marine nature reserves by dredging for queenies. It was time for change. In 2002, we called for a marine bill which would allow us to manage and protect our marine environment. The legislation at that time wasout-dated, not t-for-purpose and, most importantly, prevented us designating marine protected areas and managing our inshore sheries sustainably. Then werallied our members and supporters - a staggering 250,000 people signed silver scales during our Petition Fish campaign to Lobby Westminster for action. We were all thrilled when, in 2009, the Marine Act was passed which gave us the legal tools to designate a network of protected areas and the power to ensure that the wider seas were managed in a sustainable way. In the following years, a million people took part in a process to identify where these zones should be located and what they should protect and ten years on,I am over the moon that the third phase of Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) have been announced. This historic move will help protect our seas and the wildlife which live there, constituting the third of three phases promised by the Government in order to full the remit of the Marine and Coastal Access Act bringing the total number of MCZ designations to 91. It marks a turning point for the future of our seas. A tting testament to the huge amount of eort put into marine campaigning by so many, and a recognition that people who care about the hidden depths, the submerged landscapes, the last truly wild place in the UK - have been listened to. The 41 new MCZs are special places and include cold water corals, forests of sea fans, rocky canyons and sandbanks - an astonishingly varied range of sub- merged landscapes and habitats which support the stunning diversity of marine life. They include Bembridge MCZ which is very unusual because it ishome to both species of native seahorse, Solway FirthJoan Edwards, Director of Living Seas at The Wildlife Trusts shares her thoughts on the news that the UK government announced an important new wave of marine protection in the form of 41 new Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs)MARITIME AFFAIRS 349MCZ whose sand banks are resting places for seals, and Holderness Oshore MCZ which is important home for growing crabs and lobsters. However, designation of these sites, referred to by some as 'lines on maps' is only the rst step. Now we must focus on ensuring that all our Marine Protected Areas (Marine Conservation Zones and Special Areasof Conservation) are managed eectively - and the most damaging activities are prohibited to allow our amazing marine environment to recover. We don't know exactly what recovery will look like, but we do know that in the past when destructive activities wereremoved from areas such as Lyme Bay, the seabed's plants and animals showed incredible resilience; even slow-growing and sensitive species such as sea fans and ross corals can reappear after just a few years. So, to sum up, there's much to celebrate... but the job isn't nished. We need to ensure our Marine Protected Areas are well-managed so that these zones will con- tribute towards a network of areas which is urgently needed to ensure a healthy future for our seas.Joan Edwards trained as a marine biologist at BangorUniversity and joined The Wildlife Trusts as their rst marine conservation ocer in 1987.

Iodine-129 is one of three key risk drivers at several U.S. Department of Energy waste management sites. Nat- ural organic matter (NOM) is thought to play important roles in immobilisa- tion of aqueous iodide (I-) and iodate (IO3-) in the environment by forming organo-iodine (org-I), but molecular interactions between NOM and iodine species are still poorly understood. When appropriate analytical tech- niques were applied to determine the chemical speciation of iodine in aquatic systems, regardless of surface or groundwater, fresh or ocean water, solution in soils, sediments or cement systems, an almost equal proportion of iodide, iodate and organo-iodine were found (reviewed in Kaplan et al., 2014; Yeager et al., 2017), even in the presence of minimal amounts of natural organic matter (NOM). All three species are always found simultaneously, irrespective of where one measures it: arid, humid, marine systems, U.S. or Japan (Xu et al., 2016). Therefore, to contain all iodine species at DOE waste sites once they have reached the natural environment, or to effectively remove all radioiodine species from waste streams at the same time remains a challenge. Often,containing at least one of these species, often org-I, is problematic. Organo-iodine species that are found in the environment in the form of humic acids, which are part of the natural organic matter (NOM) matrix,can be either mobile or immobile, depending on conditions. Thus, abetter understanding of the molecular binding of the I to the organic core is required to solve this problem. A recent study by Li et al (2019b) aimed to improve our molecular-level under- standing of NOM-iodine interactions and enzymatically-mediated iodination reactions in aqueous media. These authors investigated the mechanisms iodine and carbon species are boundto three different humic acid (HA)-I systems using C K-edge XANES spec- I- in the presence enzyme and a mediator (2,2- azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sul- fonic acid, ABTS) at pH 4 buffer, 2) I- in the presence of lactoperoxidase and H 2O2in pH 7 buffer, 3) IO3-at pH 3 groundwater. Results showed that in both the oxidase and peroxidase sys- tems, I-is oxidized to I2or hypoiodide (HOI), but the laccase-ABTS mediator system was the most effective at oxidizing I-to I2or HOI, so that I-uptake by HA increased up to 13.5 mg/g of humic acid. IO3-was abiotically reduced by I2/HOI incorporation newly formed benzoquinone species arising from oxidation of phenolic C species. However, org.-I species can still become mobile in the environment under certain conditions, despite the fact that most of them are contained in the soil. Soil and groundwater contamination are ubiquitous at the U.S.Department of Energy waste man- agement sites and, thus, it is impera- tive that technologies are developed to contain all iodine species that have already escaped to the environment. \"All in all, these results show that it is still challenging to contain all radioiodine species in solid waste. This has important implications for estimated risk from nuclear waste disposal.\" Silver (Ag) based technologies are amongst the most common approaches to removing radioiodine from aqueous waste streams. As a result, a large worldwide inventory of radioactive AgI waste presently exists, which must be stabilised and requires disposal. Recently, Li et al (2019a) examined the efficacy of silver-impreg- nated granular activated carbon (Ag- GAC) to I-, IO3-, or org-I loaded Ag-GAC were characterised by iodine K-edgePeter H.

The results showed that Ag-GAC was very effective at removing I- and org-I, but ineffective for IO3-, from slag-free grout leachate under oxic conditions. I-or org-I removal was due to the formation insoluble AgI(s) or Ag-org-I on Ag-GAC. When and slag grouts, the I-was released from AgI(s) to form a hydrated I-species. Conversely, when org-I loaded Ag-GAC material was cured in the two-grout formula- tions, no change was observed in the iodine speciation, indicating the org-I species remained bound to the Ag. Because little IO3-was bound to the Ag-GAC, it was not detectable in thegrout. It was concluded that the grout formulation and iodine speciation inthe waste stream can significantly influence the effectiveness of the long- term disposal of radioiodine associ- ated with Ag-GAC in grout waste. All in all, these results show that it is still challenging to contain all radioiodine species in solid waste. This has important implications for estimated risk from nuclear waste disposal.

The British Geological Survey began a programme to start mapping the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS) in 1966, starting with inshore areas andmoving progressively into deeper and more exposed waters. At the time, the government's commitment to investigate national oshore resources had not been attempted at such a scale by any other country. The oshore survey of the regional mapping programme took over 20 years until in 1986, the United Kingdom became the rst country to completely map its continental shelf. During this work, BGS geologists produced a series of reports, scientic papers and 1:250,000 scale maps showing the distribution of sediments on the seabed,the Quaternary geology of sediments deposited over millions of years and the underlying bedrock. The regional mapping of the UKCS led to interest in further surveys in deep-water areas to the west of the UK, backed by industry funding. Carrying out this work required the development of new oshore surveyequipment, including a one-metre oriented drill speci- cally designed to recover samples for use in palaeo-magnetic studies, autonomous battery-operated vibrocoring systems and a rockdrill capable of coring up to 55 metres below the sea floor in water depths up to 4,000 metres.Today, the BGS Marine Geology and Operations team, based at the Lyell Centre 2 near Edinburgh, undertakes both scientic and commercial projects in UK-desig- nated waters and internationally, from polar to tropicalenvironments. It has expertise in coring and drilling operations, geophysical surveys, seabed sampling and loch, lake and inshore surveys using the BGS survey vessel, The White Ribbon. It is also the European operations facility of the International Ocean Discovery Programme, undertaking the management, logistics, planning and contracts for Mission-Specic Platform expeditions. Marine aggregates Marine aggregates are naturally occurring sands and gravels with the shape, strength and other physical characteristics generally identical to high quality land-based aggregates. They are mainly used in the manufacture of concrete, which accounts for nearly 80% of marine aggregates landed for construction purposes. By comparison, 60%of land-won sand and gravel production and 16% of crushed rock is sold as concrete aggregate. Marine aggregates are also widely used in the production of asphalt, masonry and paving blocks, sports pitches, golf courses, drainage and ll materials, horticultureproducts and steel. The UK has one of the largest dredging industries in the world. Over 20 million tonnes of marine sand andIt is often said that we know more about the surface of the moon or Mars than the ocean floor but marine geoscience research is enabling a better understanding of some of the biggest issues we face, including climate change, coastal erosion and renewable energy MARITIME AFFAIRS 353gravel are extracted from more than 65 licensed areas around the coast of England and Wales every year. No marine-dredged sand and gravel is landed in Scotland. Approximately 17% of the sand and gravel used in England and Wales is now supplied by the marine aggregates industry. The sector also contributes to the economy through exports to the continent. However, activities on the UKCS have undergone major changes due alternations to the planning regime intro duced by the Marine & Coastal Access Act 2009 and the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, as well asincreased pressure on the seabed from new develop-ments, such as renewable energy. \"The UK has one of the largest dredging industries in the world. Over 20 million tonnes of marine sand and gravel are extracted from more than 65 licensed areas around the coast of England and Wales every year. No marine-dredged sand and gravel is landed in Scotland.\" The Marine & Coastal Access Act, which covers England and Wales, established the Marine ManagementOrganisation to licence, regulate and plan marine activ- ities to ensure they are carried out in a sustainable way. It also introduced Marine Plan areas with an asso- ciated planning authority responsible for considering the social and economic needs of coastal communities and how to accommodate dierent activities, rangingfrom seaborne imports or building turbines to leisure and tourism, while protecting habitat. All areas are required to have a plan by 2021. Similarly, the Marine (Scotland) Act introduced a strate- gic marine planning system designed to balance the competing demands on the seas while protecting the marine environment. Following on from this, the Scottish Government produced a National Marine Plan and subsequently Regional Marine Plans to consider the social, economic and environmental aspects of development. As a result of these changes, the Crown Estate, as the owner of mineral rights in UK waters, wanted toimprove its understanding of marine mineral resources and so commissioned the BGS to produce maps of sand and gravel, as well as coal, metallic minerals and evaporites. Five 1:250,000 scale maps were produced covering: East Inshore and East Oshore Marine Plan Areas, Southern North Sea. The English Channel and Thames Estuary. Welsh Waters and the Irish Sea. Scottish Waters and the Central North Sea. A summary map for the United Kingdom Continental Shelf. The maps provide spatial data for strategic planning and accessible information to assist in the protection of these non-renewable resources. Future challenges Looking ahead, an ever-increasing demand for housing and infrastructure will drive demand for construction aggregates. Meanwhile, climate change means demand for large volumes of marine-dredged sand and gravel for coastal protection, replenishing eroding beaches and improving inland drainage infrastructure. The sector has entered a new phase, with geoscience research-backed planning and licensing supporting a more strategic, sustainable and long-term approach tothe management of marine areas. Open Access Government editorial@openaccessgovernment.org www.openaccessgovernment.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovIt is clear the world is facing a shortfall in the supply of critical elements to reach any meaningful target for net-zero carbon emissions this century. However, the deep ocean floor hosts billions of tonnes of metalliferous mineral deposits that may hold the solution. With the recognition and acceptance that fossil carbon-based fuels are environmentally unsustainable sources of energy, causing uncontrolled and adverse effects on the global climate, the world is demanding their replace-ment with renewable energy sources to achieve a zero-net carbon future for humankind in the second half of the 21st Century [1]. The ambition to replace fossil carbon- based energy sources with renewables will be accompanied by a huge increase in demand for metals like copper, nickel, zinc, and elements critical to enabling renewable energy generation. Many of these elements are relatively scarce or restricted to very few areas of the globe and include: cobalt and lithium (used in batteries for electric vehicles); tellurium (used in cadmium- telluride thin-film, photovoltaic electrical energy neodymium and dysprosium (used for permanent magnets in wind-turbines and electric motors); heavy rare earth elements (used in electronics), and platinum group elements (used in fuel cells and hydrogen catalysers).This demand is illustrated by the resources needed to electrify the world's estimated 2 billion private cars. Compared with today's global metal production [2], the best-case scenario requires 126 years' of cobalt, 62 years' of neodymium, 45 years' of lithium, and 31 years' of copper. To power these by wind turbinesrequires 20 years of neodymium and dysprosium [3]or, using CdTe-type photovoltaic solar energy [4], 2000 years' of tellurium supply Potential Deep-sea minerals are rich in these critical elements. There are three main types of deposit. Ferromanganese nodules are iron-manganese oxide- oxyhydroxide concretions, rich in nickel, copper, titanium, cobalt and heavy rare earth elements, and are found on the deep ocean floor between 4,000-6,500 m. The best known is the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), between the west coast of Mexico and Hawaii, and has about 21-30 billion tonnes. The Peru Basin has about ~6-9 billion tonnes while the Penrhyn Basin, located near the Cook Islands, has an estimated 5-7 bil- lion tonnes of nodules with a resource potential of ~21 million tonnes of cobalt (i.e. 210 years' worth of global land-based production). In the Indian ocean, nodule fields are less valuable, containing low average abundances ~5 kg/m2. Worldwide, ferromanganese nodules present anenormous source of metals, with 10 times more manganese, 6 times more cobalt, 4 times more tellurium and yttrium, 3.5 times more nickel, and a third more copper compared with land-based reserves [5]. Cobalt-rich crusts are another type of iron-manganese oxide-oxyhydroxides accretion, up to 25 cm thick, formed on rocky substrates such as seamounts and underwater ridges. They are rich in cobalt (0.5-1.2%) and other critical elements such as tellurium, platinum, rare earths, titanium, thallium and nickel [6]. These crusts occur through- out the global ocean, at all depths below 700 m, but are thickest on the oldest areas such as the prime crust zone of the northwest Pacific. They contain more than half the nickel, a fifth of the titanium, over 3 times the yttrium (and other rare earth elements), 7 times the cobalt, 23 times the tellurium, and 3000 times the thallium compared with land-based reserves [5]. Seafloor massive sulphides and their metalliferous sediments are the product of intense seafloor volcanic activity and form rapidly from high- temperature (up to 415\u00b0C) hydrother- mal fluids (black-smokers). They form 100-300 m diameter deposits, on and below the seafloor, at depths from 1000 to 5000 m, in all oceans. They are primarily rich in iron (up to 32%), zinc (up to 17%), copper (up to 13%), gold (up to 13 ppm), silver (up to 2000 ppm) and have elevated concentra-Professor Bramley J Murton, Associate Head of Marine Geosciences from National Oceanography Centre, discusses if deep-sea minerals can meet the zero-carbon challenge, in this articleAchieving zero-carbon with While estimates suggest about 600 million tonnes of accessible seafloor massive sulphide [8], hydro - thermally inactive deposits may be 10 times more abundant than active ones with between 3 and 5 times more sulphide under the seafloor than above it [9], hosting 20 to 30 billion tonnes of ore worldwide. Challenges There are three major challenges facing the nascent deep-sea miningindustry. First is the uncertainty around the regulations that the United Nations International Seabed Authority is drafting, and due in 2020. Second, there remains considerable techno- logical challenge to deep-sea mineral exploration and mining, thousands of metres below the surface and thou- sands of kilometres offshore. Thirdly, protecting the environment is key to gaining social license, for which much needs to be done to identify potential harm and how to mitigate it. Future options Although ferromanganese nodules receive the greatest attention, cobalt- rich crusts are the most enriched, host the largest global resources of cobaltand tellurium, and are closest to land. This makes them the most viable deep-sea minerals to be exploited. There remains, however, a deep-sea resource barely mentioned, yet is truly sustainable and with the greatest potential to achieve a zero-net carbon future. High-temperature geothermal energy, of the type driving hydrothermal vents, has the potential to generate terawatts of unlimited power. Tapping this, using offshore oil and gas pro- duction technology, and converting it to storable, transportable fuel like hydrogen, poses an as yet unexplored and unlimited resource in renewable energy. Without deep-sea minerals and, probably, geothermal energy, there is unlikely to be a net zero-carbon economy. This may not be a welcome message, yet, because the alterna- tives remain elusive, urgent research and development in this space isrequired now.

The EU and Japan agree tostrengthen bilateral energy dialogues and cooperationon innovation in the clean energy transition and climate action, and this is an example of the EU's continued eorts to ensure that ghting climate change is at the heart of our international cooperation. \"Working together gives us a much stronger voice on the world stage in demanding ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring the protection of vital carbon sinks such as the Amazon Rainforest. This strengthens our credibility as global leaders and allows us to make the case for other international partners to do their part as well.\" The EU and Japan increasingly share a common under- standing of the need to address the threat of climate change. A more coordinated approach between the EU and Japan would have benets for all, as we defend multilateral solutions and promote sustainable, inclusive and climate-resilient economies to the benet of our businesses and societies. The EU and Japan are leading technological innovators and strengthened cooperation will create more oppor- tunities for joint projects to advance the clean energytransition. When we share a common view of both the scale of the challenge, as well as the possible solutions, we are much better equipped to advocate for the actions that are vital to achieving our goals under the Paris Agreement. Working together gives us a much stronger voice on the world stage in demanding ambitious reductions ingreenhouse gas emissions and ensuring the protection of vital carbon sinks such as the Amazon Rainforest. This strengthens our credibility as global leaders and allows us to make the case for other international partners todo their part as well. The importance of strengthening existing international cooperation cannot be underestimated. Major global challenges such as population growth, resource scarcity and food supply insecurity are all exacerbated by climate change. If we are to continue delivering eco- nomic growth and enable our citizens to enjoy high standards of living, we must ensure sustainability across all our economic activities and sectors around the world. Mauro Petriccione, Directorate-General for Climate Action at the European Commission, discusses how the EU and Japan are cooperating on innovation in the clean energy transition and climate action Mauro Petriccione357In a globalised economy, this means placing sustainabil- ity concerns at the heart of our own actions whilst encouraging our partners to do the same. As such, strengthened cooperation increases our ability to deliver on our commitments and ensure a more sustainableglobal economy that leaves no one behind. \"The EU and Japan increasingly share a common understanding of the need to address the threat of climate change. A more coordinated approach between the EU and Japan would have benefits for all, as we defend multilateral solutions and promote sustainable, inclusive and climate-resilient economies to the benefit of our businesses and societies.\" Looking closer to home, after the EU had adopted all the legislation needed to achieve its ambitious 2030 cli- mate and energy objectives, the European Commission in 2018 put forward a strategic vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy -Communication 'A Clean Planet for All', which is the basis for European Commission calls for the EU tobecome climate-neutral by 2050. Achieving this ambi- tious goal requires making smart investment decisions now and ensuring that technological solutions are in place in good time to ensure dramatic reductions ingreenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades. EU climate policy is a continuous process and the upcoming European Commission, building on all this, has already set out its course, re-arming that the EU should endorse the objective of climate neutrality by2050 and proposing to raise the ambition for 2030. Taking these actions will benet the EU in any case but acting alongside global partners like Japan in a coordi- nated way will bring economies of scale and signicantly reduce the costs of the transition for all. More impor- tantly, it will make it easier and more likely for othernations to deliver their share of reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, which is indispensable to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. Mauro Petriccione Directorate-General for 358A priority for Europe: Energy Union and climate change Energy Union and climate change are a very high priority for the European Commission. They believe that in building an Energy Union, all Europe's energy supply will be viable, safe and accessible to all. This is an approach that boosts the economy and attracts investments that have the potential to openup new job opportunities. (1) This article will look at the work of some key gures in this part of the European Commission, with a focus on Maro efovi, Vice-President, Energy Union, who will soon move onto his new role of Interinstitutional Rela- tions and Foresight as part of the 2019-2024 Commis- sion. One of his responsibilities today is leading the project team Energy Union and another is improvingenergy eciency, amongst many more. (2) In recent news, we learn that the European Commis-sion adopted a Communication rearming the com- mitment of the EU to accelerate climate ambition.Commenting on this in more detail in the lead up to the Climate Action Summit by the United Nations Secretary-General in New York, Maro efovi provided further comments. However, by the time you read this, it will have already taken place (on 23rd September 2019) but the comments are, nevertheless, very insightful. \"With the Paris Agreement, for the rst time all parties committed to reduce emissions. Now we must make sure these reductions are timely enough to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. The European Union will bring to New York the fruit of our work on the Energy Union: a realistic perspective of a climate-neutral Europe by 2050, backed by ambitious policies set in binding legislation. The EU has ensured that all sectors contribute to the transition. At the Climate Action Summit, we hope our plans will inspire other countries,and we hope to be inspired. Our message is simple: Europe delivers.\" (3) Energy Union governance ensures that the 2030 Climate and Energy targets are reached. Maro efovi said in July that he has the ambition to provide the nancial sector and businesses, \"with the necessary clarity and predictably to spur clean energy investment across Europe.\" He added that the development of renewable energy generation required a move from a power-centric to decentralised models (with house- holds/communities producing, storing, consuming and selling their electricity). He also explained that raw materials are part of carbon-neutral renewable energy technologies (photovoltaic and wind) and that they are vital for sustainable mobility, like energy storage (industrial batteries) and electric vehicle batteries. (4) Certainly, the EU has been at the forefront of global climate action and will continue to do so. We can see this in the ambition of the President-Elect of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen who plans to make Europe the rst climate-neutral continent by 2050. (5) Picking up on this theme of climate change, we know that it is something that is with us and to which we are vulnerable to, in the view of Maro efovi. In speaking points by Maro efovi on the EU preparation for the UN Action Summit published on 11th September 2019, he said there is no time to waste and draws our attention to the very hot summer that took place in 2019. One fascinating point he made concerns a vision for a climate-neutral Europe by the middle of this century. He details more about this bold ambition in his own words. \"We are delivering on our 2020 targets, we have legislated to overachieve on our 2030 contribution to the ParisEnergy Union and climate as a priority of the European Commission are placed under the spotlight here by Open Access Government359Agreement, and we have put on the table a strategy to go climate-neutral twenty years after, already supported by a large majority of our Member States. \"We are also serious about nancing our ambition, which is why we proposed that 25% of our next nan- cial framework should be dedicated to climate-relatedactivities, including for just and fair transition. And we remain the world's largest donor of international climate nance, with EU and Member States' contribu-tions more than doubled since 2013.\" (6) Another key gure at the European Commission in thispolicy area was Dominique Ristori, who worked there from 1978-2019. During his time there, he held several senior positions, his most recent one being Director- General for Energy. Another one of his positions he held was Director-General of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) between 2010 and 2013. Another was Director in Charge of General Aairs and Resources in DG Energy and Transport, from 2000 to 2006. Ditte Juul J\u00f8rgensen has now replaced Dominique Ristori as Director-General for Energy and we wish her well in this role. Looking ahead to the period of the next Commission from 2019-2024 - we wish Frans Timmermans, who will be in charge of European Green Deal well, as well as the Kadri Simson, who will takecare of energy - when they begin their new roles as they continue the crucial work to tackle energy and climate change. (7) References 1. https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/energy-union-and- climate_en 2. efovi, Vice-President, Energy UnionThe development of renewable sources of energy is widely recognised as a research priority today, with scientists looking to efficiently harness solar power to meet our energy needs. Solar cells are increasingly important devices forelectricity production and have been considered as the most promising candidates to replace fossil fuels in traditional energy harvesting. In addi-tion to traditional field installations and building integrated photovoltaics(PVs), they are envisaged to power, until recently, unpowerable devices (e.g. various sensors and electronicmicrodevices) and mobile objects (e.g. cars, drones). Besides the many efforts to develop various photovoltaic technologies for all these diversified applications, there is still room to improve the efficiency, performance, stability and cost figures of the solar cells. This naturally requires the development of new types of solar cells. Recently, perovskite-based solar cells have emerged and also, other thin-film technologies based on chalcogenides or organic materials show promise. However, these solar cells are thought to be used in the traditional setting of PV panels onbuilding rooves and fields. There is also a need for another type of solar cell that provides sufficientenergy to directly power (i.e. without any use of battery) relatively small electrical devices and occupy at the same time only, a relatively small surface area (such as few cm 2). This is a different philosophy compared with the traditional large-scale PV installa- tions that pump the produced energy to electrical grids or charge batteries in households. Such cell must be conceptually based on non-planar design, utilising highly nanoporous or nanotubular arrays with a huge internal surface to volume ratio, as shown in Figure 1. Dr Macak and his group are exploring such nanotubular arrays based on titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotubes in the Chromtisol project, a European Union (EU)-backed initiative based at the University of Pardubice in the Czech Republic. Layers of orderednanotubular TiO2, shown in Figure 1, offer much potential in this respect, says Dr Jan Macak. \"It has become clear that they are unique, they possess large surface area in a small volume, are very stable upon irradia- tion and can be produced by simple technology. In combination with suitable chromophores, they can very efficiently absorb both sunlight and artificial light. They can efficiently convert this light into electrons, as outlined in Figure 2,\" he explains, \"If you want to make a good solar cell, you have to make sure that it absorbs as much light as possible and reflects as little as possible,\" he goes on to explain. \"Most silicon PVs installations are south-facing, to directly absorbJan Macak, Senior Researcher and Group Leader at the University of Pardubice, Czech Republic, provides insight into novel kinds of solar cell technologies Insight into novel kinds of solar cell technologies 360PROFILE Figure 1: A scanning electron micrograph showing the top view of the TiO2nanotube layer. One can see hollow nanotubes that are closely packed to one another. sunlight. But there are also places which do not experience as much sun. The deemed solar cell can function very well at various angles of illumina- tion,\" points out Dr Macak. Currently, the absorption rate is typically some- where between 80-90%, which means that approximately 10% of light is reflected and not used. This is very little compared to other types of solar cells,\" he outlines. This topic is central to the project's overall agenda. The nanotube layers act as a functional scaffold and provide a large surface area to the cell. \"This is very important, because the larger the surface area, the better for the solar cell,\" explains Dr Macak. When light is shone onto a regular flat surface, a certain proportion is reflected; by increasing the surface area of the cell and adapting the morphology.\" Dr Macak aims to improve absorption efficiency. \"The first major challenge in this project is to make sure that we absorb as much light as possible. TiO2intrinsically can absorb only UV light, but for a good solar cell, it is also important to absorb visible and infrared light. Putting these chro- mophores inside nanotubes is noteasy however, as the scale is so small. \"So the project is not just about devel- oping the solar cell; it's also about finding the right strategy to put the correct type of chromophore insidethe tubes. The aim is to utilise, as efficiently as possible, the space inside the tubes and to have the right nanotube geometry,\" continues Dr Macak.\" A number of different strategies are available for this task. In one of the more complex approaches, researchers utilise a thin-film deposition technique called atomic layer deposition (ALD) to coat the interior of the nanotubes. \"It'sa fascinating technique that has a lot to offer to PV industry in general,\" says Dr Macak. This technique has already been exploited to make active components of various types of solarcells, but also ALD coatings can be used as antireflective, or even to coat the whole call to prevent them against ageing and moisture. Overall, this new physical concept of a solar cell explores extremely promising materials, yet is unseen and unexplored in a joint device, whose combination may solve traditional solar cells draw- backs (carrier recombination, narrow light absorption). \"The costs would probably be a little bit higher than other cells, but the light management and the efficiencies have the potential to be really very high for the applications needed,\" he outlines. \"Currently, we are producing a final prototype of the solar cell and we are excited about the results,\" he says. The team is also considering the possibility of scaling up the tech- nology. \"Through our work in this project, we are also pushing the limits of ALD, which is a prominent topic in research. We are trying to use these deposition technique materials in quite an interesting way and this will be valuable for researchers and new applications in future,\" he says.

The inset graph shows an increase of the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the nanotube layer with the added chromophore. Demand Response (DR) is one of the possible actions included in what is known as Demand Side Management (DSM). DR can be briefly defined as the ability of customers (from domestic to large industries) to vary their energy consumption during certain (usually short) periods of time. These (generally downward) changes in consumption can be both, on con- sumers initiative as per the utility's request in the event that clients are under some type of DR programme such as those shown below. The so-called DR events are usually motivated, in addition to the incentive to save energy at times when it may be more expensive, due to any of the following situations: a) Punctual demand spike motivated, for example, by a heat wave in which air condition-ing consumption soars. b) Temporary system generation capacity reduction due to, for example, the shutdown of a plant. Or because c) Problems with the transport system caused, for example, by a failure in power lines caused by a storm or forest fire. Adoption of DR measures is experi- encing a breakthrough in recent years mainly due to the following reasons:a) Electricity demand increase caused by a greater number of consumerswith more and more electrical appli-ances, despite increasing awareness about energy efficiency. b) Electricity generation costs growth due therising polluting fossil fuels price such as coal and gas. c) Rising strict regula- tions for generation plants that must undertake significant investments to reduce pollution. d) Increment pres- ence of renewable generation, which, although it is true that it can reduce the generation price, introduces huge volatility both in volume and price in the system since in many cases they are not manageable technologies. And e) European directives such as the Winter Package that seeks to empower consumers and make them more involved in the energy system. The rise of the DR is due to the fact that it provides benefits for all stake- holders: Clients, environment and utilities. The latter use DR measures to obtain advantages from a technical and commercial point of view. The energy demanded in an electrical system must be equal at all times to that generated. If the demand is high, it is necessary to turn on more gener- ation plants which produce electricity at a higher price. Therefore, the utilities can benefit onthe one hand by activating mecha- nisms of load reduction by DR, thus reducing their need to acquire energyfor their customers during price peaks and, on the other, in the case of owning generation plants of inflexible technologies, they can request to raise the load avoiding to stop such plantswith expensive boot gradients. Moreover, if a utility has made a mis- take when forecasting its customers' demand and it is forced to acquire this extra energy in auxiliary markets at a higher price, it may request a load reduction by DR compensating customers at a lower price than the possible extra cost incurred in the market. From commercial point of view, it can also mean a new service to offer its customers to retain them and distinguish themselves from rivalcompanies. For clients, participate in DR pro-grammes is essentially an economic benefit for the obtained reward from utilities for being available for (and in the cases required, to carry out) the required actions. On the other hand, contributing to security of supply is in its own benefit, for example preventing blackouts. At the same time, they may feel they are taking part in reducingpollution to achieve a greener future. To joint DR programmes customers only need to contact with their energy supplier and sign an agreement forthis new service. These actions can be classified as automatic or voluntary depending on whether the intervention of the user is necessary. For automatic executionit is necessary to install in customer premises both hardware and software to allow remote monitoring and operation. Some examples of DR actions are the temporary variation Rodrigo L\u00f3pez, Energy Management Deputy Director, Fen\u00ede Energ\u00eda, provides a detailed article about Demand Response, highlighting how you can save money on utility bills during periods of reduced energy use Demand Response 101: How to get paid to cut power use for utilities 362PROFILEof the thermostat temperature or to dim lights. Additionally, there are also \"passive\" actions such as changing consumption habits, for example shifting certain tasks execution to periods of low price or reduced network overload. There is also the possibility of joining a price responsive programmes such as time- of-use (TOU) or critical peak pricing (CPP) rates. DR has been widely used in large industrial customers given its high energy consumption, but its possible application needs to be demonstrated in small customers such as dwellings based on the idea that, although anindividual small load modification is insignificant for the system, the sum of thousands of them, using the figure of the demand aggregator, could bevery useful. The H2020 768619 RESPOND project (Integrated Demand REsponse Solution towards energy POsitive NeighbourhooDs) (project-respond.eu) contributes to this study analysing the feasibility of DR in dwellings providing a software/hardware solution, able to work with legacy devices, that are being tested in three pilot sites (pri- vate apartment buildings in Madrid (Spain), social housing community in Aarhus (Denmark) and detached houses in Aran Islands (Ireland). The project, that started in October 2017, is intended to last 3 years with an EU funding of over 3 M\u20ac among the eleven partners of five countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland, Serbia and Spain). RESPOND's solution consists on a web-based user interface and a mobile app along with analytics services to measure both, trial partici- pants engagement and energy savings. RESPOND is part of the European Commission's Research and Innova- tion Program, known as Horizon 2020, from which it has received its funding by virtue of grant agreement no.768619.Co-funded by the Horizon 2020 programme of the European Union.

This 'day',chosen as a nod to the atomic weight of hydrogen (1.008), has grown from a Washington, DC-focused eventinto an international celebration. National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day was created ve years ago by the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Associ- ation (FCHEA) as a rallying tool for the industry and sup- porters to share groundbreaking announcements, raise awareness of the technology and host events for both public and policymakers. This coordinated eort was devised in order have the biggest impact possible, break- ing through the endless 24/7 news cycle to showcase the current benets and future potential the technology brings to a range of applications and market sectors. \"Countries are increasingly looking at hydrogen for large-scale energy storage and are deploying large systems to utilise excess hydrogen from renewables, such as wind and solar farms to help stabilise the grid and generate clean and reliable electricity at any hour, in any weather.\" That rst year was an impressive success, made even more so with the passage of a bipartisan U.S. Senate resolution. Every year since, National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day has grown beyond simply an industry event to include support from both houses of Congress, the participation of Federal agencies and National Laboratories, proclamations from state governments across the country and even engagement from companies and organisations abroad. The rise in support for National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day is closely aligned with the growth of the industryitself, in the U.S. and internationally. Fuel cell passenger cars from major automakers have been available now for several years and there are dozens of fuel cell buses in operation in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The vehicle market is expanding to include medium and heavy-duty delivery vans and Class 8 trucks, with demonstrations and orders by some of the biggest logistics companies in the world. The material handling sector is continuing to grow, with more than 26,000 vehicles in operation or on order in America and new customers in Europe entering the fold. Fuel cells are also being integrated into everything from small, unmanned drones to the large passenger trains and ferries. The global appeal of hydrogen as a fuel is its ability to be generated from a wide range of local sources and feedstocks, including natural gas, coal, organic waste/biogas, or by electrolysing water, using grid power or renewable solar or wind-generated electricity. Outside of transportation, tens of thousands of hydro- gen fuel cells are ensuring reliable and continuous power to communications networks, trac and rail signals, surveillance and other equipment for a rangeMorry Markowitz, President of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association details all we need to know about the National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day on October 8th and beyond that Morry MarkowitzENERGY 365of customers, including wireless companies, utilities, rst responders and government agencies. Large-scale fuel cell systems utilising natural gas or biogas arebeing installed by both the public and private sector, including some of the biggest utilities and corporations. Countries are increasingly looking at hydrogen for large-scale energy storage and are deploying large systems to utilise excess hydrogen from renewables,such as wind and solar farms to help stabilise the grid and generate clean and reliable electricity at any hour, in any weather. Once the festivities surrounding National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day subside, the momentum of theindustry will continue at the 2019 Fuel Cell Seminar & Energy Exposition (FCS&EE) which will take place November 5th-7th at the Long Beach Convention Center in Long Beach, California. The FCS&EE is the longest-running and most comprehensive fuel cell andhydrogen conference in the U.S. and arguably the world. It combines high-level keynotes and plenarytalks with a bustling exhibit hall showcasing the latest products through the entire supply chain; technical poster and breakout sessions on a range of R&D and commercialisation topics; and networking opportunities galore, with evening receptions every night. Both these events, National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day and the FCS&EE, oer industry insiders perfect opportunities to voice support, highlight progress andcreate critical stakeholder relationships to keep the spotlight on this innovative and important technology and the fuel it uses. They also present a great oppor-tunity for companies interested in learning more, be it as a potential supplier, partner, or customer, about theexpanding potential and benets fuel cells and hydro-gen bring to the table. A technology that can provide power for any size, any need, any application, from almost any feedstock, denitely warrants and deservesthe attention.

This requires multiple solutions where hydrogen plays a vital role. Within the transport sector, the government hasindicated that from 2025, no fossil cars can be sold. To achieve this,hydrogen cars in addition to battery electric vehicles, need to be a part of the solution. In addition, there is a strong push to decarbonise heavy-duty vehicles, such as buses and trucks. This will require robust infrastructure and a steady supply of green hydrogen at reasonable prices. Strong hydrogen ambitions in many sectors There is a strong focus to reduce emissions within the maritime sector and hydrogen is seen as a vital part of the solution. The first hydrogen ferry is under construction and will be in operation by 2021. In addition, other vessel types such as express boats and offshore vessels being prepared for hydrogen propulsion. Within the land-based industry, a zero-emission roadmap has been developed towards 2050 and this shows the need for green hydrogen as a part of the solution. Projects likeTiZir titanium production plant in Tyssedal will require large amounts of hydrogen to replace coal in its production. This plant alone will lead to a demand for up to 30 tons ofhydrogen per day. Hydrogen station accident, a bump in the road, but also a wake-up call for the government The hydrogen deployment around the world has been done in a safe manner although some incidents have been reported. There was a significant setback for the Norwegian hydrogen industry when a hydrogen station inNorway has set out a clear ambition to reduce the emissions from the transport, maritime and industry sectors. This requires multiple solutions where hydrogen plays a vital role. There is a strong focus to reduce emissions within the maritime sector and hydrogen is seen as a vital part of the solutionThe need for a robust infrastructure & strong ambitions for hydrogen in Norway 366PROFILESandvika exploded in June this year. The root cause of the incident was a leakage from a valve that had not been installed according to procedures. All other stations were shut down as a result and the leading player in the deployment of hydrogen stations, UNO X seems reluctant to proceed with further hydrogen projects until the situation is further investigated. Late in 2018, HYOP; the other company operating hydrogen stations in Norway, had to shut down their stations due to the lack of funding. Hence the hydrogen infrastructure development is far from robust and makes it highly risky for potential users to invest in hydrogen vehicles. As of August 2019, no hydro- gen can be purchased in Norway and all the 150+ hydrogen cars are parkeduntil the stations are reopened. The car manufactures Hyundai and Toyota have generously offered replacement cars to everyone affected by the situation. This has been necessary butis not a permanent solution. Despite the dramatic situation for car owners and operators of the hydrogen stations, it seems like the momentum and political support for hydrogen is in place. If lessons are learned from this accident, better and even safer hydrogen stations will be the result. It must also be used as a wakeup call forthe government as the development of a robust infrastructure to support the transport, maritime and industry sectors can hardly be done by private companies on a project-to-project base. An overall roadmap and system plan must be in place with substantial public funding to ensure that volume is achieved. Enova has been given this role, but even though the focus and funding targeting hydrogen have been increased the last years, Enovahas failed to take on the role as the public funding partner of the national hydrogen infrastructure. Public involvement and strong partnerships are vital Different models for hydrogen infras- tructure projects and roadmaps have been developed in other countries and a strong collaboration between the government, car manufacturers, hydrogen industry and energy compa- nies has been seen as important in public/private partnerships all over the world. In Japan, California, Denmark and the UK, these types of models have been put in place and provided the necessary funding for an early phase development. On the discussion of whether you need cars or stations first, it is clear that without a robust infrastructure that allows users to fill hydrogen at a reasonable price, no vehicles will be sold. And with the shutdown of the hydrogen stations in mind, the robustness of the infras- tructure will be a critical factor for future customers investing in hydrogencars, ships or solutions for the industry. At Greenstat, we remain strong in our focus on hydrogen as a zero-emission energy carrier needed to reach our climate goals. The industry and con- sumers are more than ready to invest in projects and hydrogen solutions. We hope that the government will pro- vide a road map for the development of a robust hydrogen infrastructure and that it will follow up with the necessary funding. Vegard Frihammer Green Executive Officer/Founder 367PROFILE ENERGY 368Hydrogen for transport in London Air quality is a fundamental issue for London. London's air is so toxic and harmful it is causing a public health crisis. The recently recognised Climate Emergency also threatens the long-term security and wellbeing of every Londoner. The current Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is committed to helping tackle these twin dangers by working with industry and the Government to ensure that a mix of innovative technology will transition London into a zero-emission and net zero-carbon city by 2050. The London Hydrogen Partnership (now 'Hydrogen London') was established in 2002 as a public-privatepartnership between hydrogen industry and associ- ated public and private entities, collectively forming a centre of expertise for hydrogen and fuel cell (HFC) technologies, and the Greater London Authority (GLA).The GLA is the devolved regional governance body ofLondon, with jurisdiction over Greater London and the City of London. Hydrogen London includes participants across the HFC spectrum, spanning hydrogen production, hydrogen distribution and fuelling station installation and oper- ation; HFC technology developers; vehicle OEMs and vehicle/fleet operators; stationary and portable power systems suppliers and operators. The remit of the Part- nership has broadly been to identify and implement HFC based initiatives that demonstrate and deliver impacts in addressing London's most pressing environmental challenges. London rst participated in HFC single deck bus trials during 2004-2006. These were deemed successful andleading to Transport for London (TfL) to adopt furtherHFC buses in 2011. In 2012, London operated a rst full city centre, fuel cell-powered bus route (the RV1 Tower Bridge to Covent Garden route). These HFC buses ran for around 16 hours per day and the fleet covered over1 million passenger service miles without fundamental issue. These fuel cell buses have been transferred and continue to operate on route 444 (Chingford - Turnpike Lane). With ongoing developments in the hydrogen sector, 20 double deck HFC buses are now set to enter the London bus network from 2020. Other fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) have been deployed since 2011, including London taxis; passenger cars from Toyota and Hyundai in private fleet and taxi fleet operation - such as Green Tomato Cars running a fleet of 50 Toyota Mirai FCEVs; the GLA itself bringing FCEVs to their TfL and Metropolitan Police fleets - with the latter also fleet testing 2-wheel Suzuki Burgmanscooters - and dual fuel hydrogen-diesel vans and serv- ice vehicles (such as for refuse collection). Hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) have been opened in and around the London area to support FCEV deployment, with 10 publicly accessible HRS in operation (plus 2 non-public HRS sites). Beyond transport applications, increasing use of HFC systems has been seen in construction-related sectors for replacement of site-based diesel generators and equipment power, such as lighting systems. Large scale (200kW+) stationary fuel cell systems have also been installed for combined heat, power and cooling provision in new oce buildings. Hydrogen London would like to celebrate these suc- cesses of hydrogen in London in recognition of National Hydrogen Day on 8th October.

It's important to promote inno-vation in the eld for this proven battery technologyfor a range of applications, including energy storage and automotive. CBI and its global membership have the common aim of inspiring the latest research to help develop the next generation of advanced lead batteries. When the world's leading battery manufacturers and research specialists come together, the standard is set for advanced lead batteries and the next generation of energy storage. An interactive map was recently launched which demonstrates how new applications for lead batteries are supporting utility and renewable energy storage projects across the globe. It features examples such as microgrids supporting isolated communities and peak shaving which enables a short-term reduction in electricity consumption followed by an increase in production at a later time when power prices or grid demand is lower. Lead batteries are essential today for powering start-stop vehicles which themselves have ushered in reductions in carbon emissions and are also used in hybrid and industrial vehicles - virtually all cars on the road contain a lead battery. Lead batteries provide over 70% of the world's rechargeable energy storage. As a proven technology, lead batteries have a long track record of reliability and performance and tend to be lower cost. Resource management and sustainabil- ity are key for fast electrication and hybridisation of the economy and the very high recyclability (99% atend-of-life in Europe and North America) of lead batteries enables these huge growth predictions in energy storage. As countries continue rapidly moving to a low carbon future, demand for battery energy storage is set to signicantly increase. A range of technologies will be required to meet this demand and while lithium batteries will be a key player, the only other technology with the scale and capability to meet this vast unmetneed in energy storage is the lead battery. At CBI, we are always looking for new concepts and ideas in support of advancing battery capabilities and their applications. CBI recently announced a project in the United States to roll-out lead battery technology to support electric vehicle fast-charging stations. Supporting green growth through recyclability and sus-tainability, lead batteries also provide key economic ben- ets to societies, with retired energy storage batteries possessing a scrap value as opposed to a disposal cost. Looking ahead to the future, CBI has identied two priority research goals to really push advancements in lead battery technology for automotive and energystorage applications. A target increase of dynamic charge acceptance - the ability of a battery to accept instantaneous energy when charging - by ve times by the year 2022 to 2 Amps/Ah has been set for automotive applications. For energy storage, it is essential to increase battery cycle life - the number of complete charge and dischargeduring its lifetime - by ve times by 2022 to 5,000 cycles. These will ensure that lead batteries remain at the forefront of the market for both applications.Dr Alistair Davidson, Director of the Consortium for Battery Innovation says that battery energy storage holds the key to a clean energy future. However, the growth in demand for batteries and the many different applications will require a range of battery technologies capable of delivering at scaleENERGY 371To help achieve these goals, new technical research projects for 2019 onwards have been established, the details of which will be unveiled later this year but will include partnerships with universities, research institutesand battery manufacturing member companies. \"Lead batteries are essential today for powering start-stop vehicles which themselves have ushered in reductions in carbon emissions and are also used in hybrid and industrial vehicles - virtually all cars on the road contain a lead battery. Lead batteries provide over 70% of the world's rechargeable energy storage.\" In the last fteen years, we have seen a dramatic improvement in lead battery performance. This is due to a range of things such as additives and new electrode architectures. However future applications, whether automotive or energy storage will place ever-increasing demands on the functionality of the battery. It's essential that lead batteries can adapt and improve through research and innovation to meet these requirements. We expect to see steady growth in the automotive market for lead batteries in the next ve years, whilstthe energy storage system market is projected toexpand dramatically. Energy storage across the globe is becoming ever more vital - not only for economies but also for societal needs such as renewable energy, electrication, circular economy and sustainability. Delivering research is, therefore, vital to drive lead battery innovation necessary to meet future energy storage needs. Dr Alistair Davidson CBI Director Consortium for Battery in 2011, the Calorime- ter Center at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology's (KIT) Institute for Applied Materials - Applied Materials Physics, operates Europe's largest battery calorimeter labo ratory. It provides six Accelerating Rate Calorimeters (ARCs) of different sizes - from coin to large pouch or prismatic automotive format, which allow the evaluation of thermody- namic, thermal and safety data for Lithium-ion (or Li-ion battery) and post-Lithium batteries on material, cell and pack level for both normal and abuse conditions (thermal, electrical,mechanical). However, such a sophis- ticated calorimeter is not needed for all measurement types. Importantthermal data can already be collected by a small heat flux sensor (HFS). Measurements with a HFS The thermal management of Li-ion batteries is becoming more and more important with increasing energy density because an uncontrollable increase in temperature (so-called thermal runaway) can cause an igni- tion or even explosion of the cell with a simultaneous release of toxic gases. In order to adapt the thermal manage- ment system to the individual needs of the cells, quantitative data of the thermal parameters are needed. It will be shown how heat flux sensors canbe used to provide: i) Values for the specific heat capacity; ii) Heat transfer coefficients for the different sides of acell and; iii) Values for the generatedheat. A thermopile based Heat Flux Sensor is composed of tiny, serially connected semi conductor piles sand- wiched between two flat surfaces, forming the sensor. Any heat flux passing through the sensor creates a temperature difference due to the Seebeck effect, which produces a volt- age difference proportional to theheat passing through the surface. Thisvoltage difference on different areas of a Lithium-ion cell is read out using a data logger, which is attached to a terminal board connecting the wirescoming from the sensors (see Fig. 1). Depending on the sensor's sensitivity, the resulting values are converted into heat flux. A HFS can detect all three possible types of heat transfer: convection, conduction and radiation. Effective specific heat capacity To measure the effective specific heat capacity Cp of a Lithium-ion cell, a HFSis attached on its surface and the heat flux response and a series of temper- ature steps are recorded, as shown in Fig. 2a). Integration of the peak areas and division by the cell mass gives the effective specific heat as a function of temperature (s. Fig. 2b)). Heat transfer coefficient (HTC) The heat transfer coefficient (HTC) h is another important parameter, that can be measured using a HFS.

In the dummy method, the heaters in the calorimeter chamber heat up a dummy, made from an Al alloy with similar mass and dimensions as the cell, stepwise. The HTC is determined from the slope of the curve of the temperature differ- ence between the dummy and its surroundings vs. the time. Obviously, this situation differs from a Lithium-ion cell where the heat is generated from inside. However, there is a very good agreement between the HFS values (M3) and the values from M2, which are derived from an exponential fitting to the cooling curve after switching off the current. In addition, the HFS methodallows measuring the HTC simultane- ously as a function of temperature and applied charge/discharge current. Generated heat After the determination of the Cpvalue and the HTC, the temperature data that are recorded by thermocou- ples attached to the cell surface can be converted to the generated heat to determine cooling requirements for the thermal management system:Thus, heat flux sensors can determine many parameters that are of theutmost importance for the thermal management of cells. Moreover, they can be applied in the same way on the pack level by attaching them to differ- ent positions within the pack. We hope that our research will help the European Battery Industry tomake further progress in the field of thermal management.

As it edges closer to completion, the project is a signal to the world, the rst rework ofan impressive display. A major milestone in our transi-tion to sustainable energy, the next generation of o- shore wind projects will rival the capacity of traditional fossil-fuelled plants. Over the past 12 months, we've seen several key shifts in focus across markets, project specication, nance and expenditure. OPEX costs are under the microscope In the last year, developers have started to shift their focus away from CAPEX to OPEX. Economies of scalehave driven down capex to a point where initial costs are becoming increasingly xed, yet the OPEX bill forlarger projects increases in line with its size. As more 1GW+ projects are set for development, the opportunity to streamline OPEX and improve ROI grows greater. In tandem with this, we're actively using predictive maintenance techniques for asset performance man- agement, which can lower lifecycle operational costs while maximising reliability without increasing risk. Integration is dazzling Bidding for work as part of a consortium is akin to being a contestant in a beauty contest. For the most part, we all share very similar attributes. So what can we do to stand out? Like any good pageant, some points are awarded for talent, and this year the trending skill is the know how to integrate oshore wind and green hydrogen into one project. Twelve months ago, it was not something industry was talking about. Now, green hydrogen is a top topic for every single developer I meet. And while we don't expectto see hydrogen replacing gas anytime in the next ve years, electricity from oshore wind would allow green hydrogen to be produced at scale in an economical way. As a result, clients are seeking to dip their toes in the water now, in preparation for what is to come. The Netherlands is likely to be a rst-mover on green hydro- gen, as its gas distribution infrastructure is suitable for conversion with minimal modication. \"Well-established market players now see offshore wind as a commercially viable way to move into new energy. They bring significant clout in terms of investment.\" No one size ts all in emerging markets The emerging markets in Asia and the U.S. are gaining momentum, and with them, they are taking the experience gained in Europe to navigate through their individual challenges. However, the approach by each region could not be more dierent. While Asia is very energetic in its approach, the U.S. is more conscious of risk, with developers taking longer to embrace theopportunity fully. Asia is leaning on its existing oil and gas supply chain, allowing it to move quickly. The U.S.'s oshore wind supply chain, having only delivered the Block Island project, is still very much at the embryonic stage and is somewhat hampered by the Jones Act, which requires goods being transported by boat between two American points, do so on American vessels. Despite these challenges, there are many synergies which can be built on in America to smooth the path. By way of example, Orsted recently awarded Worleythe design and engineering for two oshore wind topsides substations for its 'Revolution Wind' project in Rhode Island. In the run-up to U.S. Offshore Wind Conference, Eoghan Quinn, Global Wind Lead - New Energy for Worley, reflects on the ever-evolving environment of the offshore wind sectorENERGY 377Saying goodbye to subsidies Global costs of such projects have continued to come down to the point where, in certain markets and geographies, we are seeing projects planned with zero subsidies. In part, this is an eort by developers to compete against each other by oering projects that require no government nance. As projects become increasingly cost- competitive, the integration of dier- ent technologies, particularly green hydrogen, into oneproject is also becoming a key dierentiator. In a similar vein, we've seen an influx of household energy names into the space, looking to show share- holders they are committed to the energy transition. Well-established market players now see oshore wind as a commercially viable way to move into new energy.They bring signicant clout in terms of investment. Data is in the water Operational data, collected over many years, is begin- ning to play a much greater strategic role. We've always had data to some extent but we are beginning to reap the benets of using it to inform the way we develop and operate projects. It is becoming strategic in its role.And the benets are everywhere, from its ability to optimise the supply chain to reduce costs to informing how to extend asset life safely. Everything going for- ward will be digitally centric - much like turbines at sea, we'll be surrounded. So, what'll be important will be to stay conscious of what oers true value in a world of ever-increasing digital solutions and choices. Eoghan QuinnGlobal Wind Lead - New Energy Worley www.worleyparsons.com www.twitter.com/Worley_ECR Climate and environmental concerns have gained a nearly unprecedented public attention worldwide. The reduction of emission of greenhouse gasses - such as CO2- in order to limit the global warming is among the biggest challenges of modern times. The energy sector, one of the major contributors, is transform- ing from large central power stations burning fossil fuels towards decentral, distributed units utilising renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. The sustainable energy system of the future has to accommodate the electricity input from the fluctuating sources and has to provide/distribute electricity according to the consumerprofile, also at periods of no wind / no sun, by utilising efficiently all sources of energy. This requires not only smart energy system control, but also efficient, flexible technologies forelectricity (and heat) production using non-fossil fuels. Setting electricity (and heat) production into focus, the high temperature fuel cell (solid oxide fuel cell - SOFC) is a highly efficient and flexible technology. In SOFCs, the energy of a fuel such as hydrogen or biogas is converted directly into electricity and heat, which allows for higher electrical efficiencies as compared to combustion based conventional power stations. Valuesof 50% and higher can be achieved at the system level. The sketch below illustrates examples for themanifold opportunities to apply SOFC technology. One attractive, non-fossil energy source is biomass and here in particu- lar waste biomass. This includes residues from wastewater treatment, human waste, agricultural waste, etc.Biomass is a large energy source, worldwide. If not stored and used properly, it contributes to the emission of greenhouse gasses (CO 2and methane), for example from openwaste disposal sites. Selected fuels and applications for high temperature fuel cells Biogas from various types of waste is a direct fuel for SOFC, i.e. after a gen- eral cleaning step, it does not need further gas treatment or separation. An interesting case is biogas from human waste, which forms naturally in the well-isolated landfill sites. The biogas contains large shares (ca. 50%) of CO2and is often diluted and thus difficult or impossible to use in combustion engines. In addition, the specific biogas compo- sition changes over time and depends on the waste type, overall, a challeng- ing fuel to handle. A recent experimen- tal study showed that such biogas is suitable for SOFC, reaching close to50% electrical efficiency without any optimisation (see full article from A. Hagen, H. Langnickel, X. Sun, title:Operation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cellswith Alternative Hydrogen Carriers, published in: Int. J. Hydrogen Energy, 44 (2919) 18382-18392). SOFC is thus a powerful technology to literally convert garbage to a valuable product and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. \"In SOFCs, the energy of a fuel such as hydrogen or biogas is converted directly into electricity and heat, which allows for higher electrical efficiencies as compared to combustion based conventional power stations.\" More mature examples of SOFC appli- cations use natural gas - other fuels like hydrogen are possible -in station- ary units at different scales. For exam- ple, the EU PACE project, sponsored by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking, will install more than 2,800 Fuel Cell micro-Cogeneration units in 10 European countries by 2021 - most of them containing SOFCs. They deliver electricity and heat to houses and small businesses. In order to reduce CO2emissions from the transport sector, mainly two solu- tions are in focus: electrical vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell cars. Their intro- duction and operation cause significant cost challenges. From a user perspec- tive, the problems of an electrical vehi- cle are the short ranges and the long fuelling times, while the lack of a suffi- cient net of hydrogen filling stations is a problem for hydrogen fuel cell cars. Prof Dr Anke Hagen, DTU Energy, highlights the importance of flexible and efficient electricity production as the energy sector continues to lower its greenhouse gas emissionsFlexible and efficient electricity production 378PROFILEFurthermore, at present most hydro- gen is not yet produced via renewable paths but from natural gas - a fossil fuel. SOFC combined with a battery provide an alternative solution. Here the benefit of driving electric unites with a long driving range (several hundreds of km), short fuelling time (few minutes), and dense coverage of fuelling stations from the SOFC side, because they can operate with liquid fuels available from the existing infrastructure. From a society point of view, CO2emissions are reduced and significant investments saved. A recent system study including commercial vehicles demonstratedimpressively how the battery-SOFC vehicle solution extends the driving range, even for a battery size reduc- tion by 50%, which saves expensive battery materials, production costs, vehicle weight, etc. Ranges close to the ones common for conventional diesel/petrol cars are within reach. The integrated SOFC technology uses liquefied petroleum as fuel and acts a range extender. Other fuels are possi- ble as well, including hydrogen (see full article by Y. Bessekon, P. Zielke, A. C. Wulff, A. Hagen, title: Simulation of a SOFC/Battery powered vehicle, in: Int. J. Hydrogen Energy 44(3) (2919) 1905-1918). \"In order to reduce CO2emissions from the transport sector, mainly two solutions are in focus: electrical vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell cars. Their introduction and operation cause significant cost challenges.\" This hybrid solution already exists in reality. Nissan unveiled a battery-SOFC vehicle during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Owing to the widespread availability of bioethanol in Brazil, the SOFC was developed for the use of this specificfuel, in that way achieving a closed carbon cycle and reducing CO 2emis- sions. Apart from extending the range of vehicles, SOFCs are also attractive to deliver electricity to trucks or ships using on board fuel and avoiding emissions of particles or toxic nitrous oxides as it is the case when an idling motor provides the electricity. SOFC technology holds key advantages for shaping a flexible, sustainable energy system, both, in stationary and transport applications. The fuel flexibil- ity and possible high electrical efficien- cies allow for reduction of greenhousegas emissions during electricity pro- duction, for delivery of electricity to numerous applications according tothe desired consumer profile, and forsaving of significant investments by utilising of existing fuel opportunities at present and in the future (biogas, hydrogen, etc.). Prof Dr Anke The renewable energy market is constantly innovat- ing, nding new ways to become cheaper, more ecient and more attractive to both companies and governments. In Asia, great strides have been made in renewable energy , with some of the highest amounts of invest- ment around the world. China has a stranglehold on the renewables industry, holding almost a third of all renewable energy patents. It's also the world's largest producer and exporter of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles. This has helped expand the renewable capabilities of the region, challenging the established dominance of fossil fuels.The bottom-up structure of renewable energy is a par- adigm shift for utilities, traditional fossil fuel companies have always generated energy and sold it on to con-sumers. Now, consumers have the ability to generate their own power and sell the excess on. This energy transformation has big implications for global power. Innovations in technology Google is investing heavily in renewable energy in Taiwan, earlier this year they purchased a 10-megawatt solar facility in Tainan City. A collaboration between the search engine giant and the Taiwanese government, this follows similar deals in renewables Google has made in the U.S. and Europe. The new facility will beExciting innovations in renewable energy in Asia are placed into the spotlight here by Jack Terry, Copywriter at VHR Global Recruitment ENERGYENERGY 381connected to the regional grid, while also powering Google's nearby Changhua Country Data Centre. It also marks another step forward for Taiwan going carbon neutral. The government has recently madechanges to the island's Energy Act, allowing non-utility companies to purchase renewable energy installations. This is likely an attempt to increase investment and generate new business while also making cost-eective transitions into clean energy, a win-win for all involved. \"It's great to see innovations like this driving the marine industry forward, helping to protect the environment in threatened regions. It's proof that the technology is not only a viable alternative to fossil fuels, it's the better option.\" In Thailand, there is a project underway to build a 220-megawatt solar plant in Myanmar. This is the rstlarge-scale renewable project in the country and the largest in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations made up of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. It will be rst of many, as these are someof the areas most vulnerable to the devastating impacts of climate change. To counter this, the ASEAN group has the goal of generating 23% of energy from renewablesby 2025. Energy consumption in Southeast Asia has almost doubled since 2000 and will likely double again by 2040. To stay in line with demand, the region will have to increase renewable energy generation. Vietnam is one of the country's leading the charge, with improved taris for wind and solar initiatives that reward energy providers for each unit of electricity that's fed into the supply grid. So it's not surprising the country has plans to introduce at least 400 megawatts of solar and 500 megawatts of wind energy over the next few years. Cheaper and more flexible equipment has helped developing nations make great strides with renewable energy that wouldn't have been possible a decade ago,but this isn't only happening in energy generation on a national level, it's also changing the transportation sector. Innovations in shipping Historically, the shipping industry has been one of the worst polluters in transport. This is due to the dirty fuel used by ships - large cargo trawlers use a type of fuel with 3,500 times more sulphur in it than the diesel fuel used in cars. The International Council on Clean Transport has found that China, Japan and India arethe three countries with the highest amount of premature deaths linked to shipping pollution. Much of the industry is committed to halving carbon emissions by 2050, but more ambitious projects have their sights set on creating zero-emission ships. Japanese shipping company NYK Group has unveiledplans for a completely emission-free ship, powered through solar panels and hydrogen. It features a cutting- edge hull that reduces power demand by 70% thanks to its reduced weight and hydrodynamic design. \"It's great to see innovations like this driving the marine industry forward, helping to protect the environment in threatened regions. It's proof that the technology is not only a viable alternative to fossil fuels, it's the better option,\" says Alejandro Bello Perez, Marine Expert at VHR Global. Currently, just a concept, ships like this could pave the way for truly green shipping that allows for seamless international trade without comprising the environment.

Many researchers and engineers across the world are focusing on ways to produce this energy by recreating on earth the conditions, such as density and temperature, that naturally occur in stars. Unlike nuclear ssion, where atoms are split to produce energy, in fusion, lighter nuclei are joined together to create heavier nuclei, resulting in the release of energy. This is how stars convert tiny amounts of mass into vastamounts of energy. Life on earth would not be possible without the nuclear fusion reactions that power the sun. Despite the expected benets of generating energy from fusion for society, such as the abundance and accessibility of fuel, the carbon-free footprint and theabsence of high level radioactive waste, putting fusion into practice remains one of the most challengingareas of experimental physics and engineering today; controlling a fusion reaction at over 100 million degrees Celsius is a complex and challenging undertaking. ENERGY Matteo Barbarino, Sehila Gonzalez de Vicente and Danas Ridikas from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) give some useful information about harnessing energy nuclear fusionHarnessing energy from nuclear fusion383Once this challenge is overcome, fusion energy can become a virtually inexhaustible, safe, environmentally friendly and universally available energy source capable of meeting global energy needs. How does fusion work? At the core of a star, fusion reactions between hydrogen atoms take place within a dense plasma, with temper- atures exceeding 10 million degrees Celsius. Plasma is the fourth state of matter and has unique properties, distinct from solids, liquids and gases. It consists of freely moving, charged particles and is formed at high temperatures when electrons are removed from neutralatoms. As we currently understand, more than 99% of the universe exists as plasma, including interstellar matter and stars, such as our sun. In a controlled nuclear fusion power plant, three conditions must be fullled: Very high temperature (over 100 million degrees Celsius) to provoke collisions of highly energetic particles; Sucient particle density in the plasma - where the reaction takes place - to increase the probability of these collisions and; ENERGY The ITER Tokamak will be nearly 30 metres tall and weigh 23,000 tonnes. The very small man dressed in blue (bottom left) gives some idea of the machine's scale. The ITER Tokamak is made up of an estimated one million parts. (Image: US ITER)ENERGY 384Sucient connement to hold the plasma and enable the fusion reactions to take place on an ongoing basis. To date, the connement concept with the best results has been the tokamak , a doughnut-shaped conguration rst invented in the 1950s, which uses powerful magnets to contain the plasma. Tokamak machines can already provide the essential conditions for fusion, in terms of both plasma density and the required temperatureand fusion reactions can, therefore, be generated. What is still missing to ensure the production of net power is better and longer connement, which is a measure of how good the magnetic eld is at maintain- ing the plasma energy over time. What is ITER and why is it so important? ITER (International Fusion Energy Organization), a collaboration between 35 countries, will be the largest fusion experiment on earth. It is under construction in Saint-Paul-lez-Durance, France and is scheduled to become operational at the end of 2025. ITER is designed to demonstrate much higher gains in fusion power than other fusion experiments conducted to date. Following the injection of 50 MW of heating power, it aims to produce 500 MW of thermal power for long pulses of 400 to 600 seconds. Even though ITER will not capture the power it produces as electricity, it will pave the way for a machine that can. The next stage after ITER, converting heat into electricity, will be addressed by a demonstration fusion powerplant known as DEMO. DEMO is expected to explore and demonstrate continuous or near-continuous operation, fuel self-suciency and the large-scale production of energy, including its conversion to electricity and could be connected to the power grid by approximately 2050. Does fusion produce radioactive waste in the same way as nuclear ssion? The easiest fusion process to achieve involves two iso- topes of hydrogen: deuterium and tritium. Tritium is Aerial view of the ITER construction site, June 2019. (Photograph: ITER Organization)ENERGY 385radioactive, but its half-life is short (12.32 years). It is only used in relatively low amounts, so, unlike long- lived radioactive nuclei, it does not present any seriousdanger. This deuterium-tritium reaction yields a helium atom (an inert gas) and a neutron, whose energies can be harvested for powering the reactor and producing electricity, respectively. Therefore, fusion reactions donot create long-lived radioactive waste. However, fusion will result in the generation of neutron- activated materials surrounding the plasma. In other words, when neutrons (as a result of fusion reaction) collide with the reactor walls, its structures and com- ponents become radioactive. Therefore, one of the important challenges when building future fusion power plants is to optimise the construction design in order to minimize this neutron-induced radioactivityand resulting radioactive waste volumes. What is the IAEA's role in fusion plasma and fusion technology? Since its inception in 1957, the IAEA has continuouslysupported nuclear fusion research. The IAEA undertakes numerous nuclear fusion activities, under the guidance of the International Fusion Research Council , an IAEA advisory body with members from around the world. The IAEA coordinates international eorts in fusion research and technology development by involvingnuclear physicists, materials scientists, nuclear data specialists, engineers and plasma experts, among others. It also organises the Fusion Energy Conference - the world's largest international event in the eld of nuclear fusion. Through the DEMO Programme Workshop , the IAEA also acts as a central hub in developing programme plans and initiating new research and development activities, in order to formulate various concepts of demonstration fusion power reactors. Through coordinated research activities, several networks of small fusion devices have been established and are being successfully used to enable an integrated approach in the quest for solutions to a number of outstanding issues. Furthermore, the IAEA aims to broaden the education and training of the next generation of fusion scientists and engineers. This is particularly important, as fusion research and development activities increasingly require cutting-edge technologies , expanding beyond the horizon of present-day know-how.

Inside the reactor, Deuterium and Tritium nuclei collide and fuse, releasing Helium and Neutrons.\" (M. Barbarino, Nuclear Plasma Fusion Specialist, IAEA) In the five previous Open Access Government articles, we have described the plight of controlled nuclear fusion research over the past decades and have chronicled the progress of our work on an innovative new approach called plasma-jet-driven magneto-inertial fusion (PJMIF.)1In this article, we present current conclu- sions and directions of our research in PJMIF and remark on the changing landscape of fusion energy research, driven increasingly by private invest- ment, public-private collaboration and growing global alarm at the rapid onset of anthropogenic climate change. We are exploring the physics of PJMIF at the Plasma Liner Experiment (PLX) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. One of the most important questions that PLX is designed to explore is: can a smooth, supersonic, spherically imploding plasma liner actually be formed from the merging of discreteplasma jets? Standard computer sim- ulation techniques for dense plasmas, based on hydrodynamics, suggest that the formation of shock waves between merging jets may lead to significant density perturbations in the formed liner, making it difficult or perhaps even impossible, to form the desired smooth spherical liner. However, simulations disagree 2,3on the sharpness and magnitude of theperturbations predicted to be formedby the shocks, with little experimentaldata available in the intermediate- density regime that PJMIF targets. At PLX, we performed experiments to obtain benchmarking results for these models in a relevant parameter regime.Dr Samuel Langendorf, Los Alamos National Laboratory, details some interesting results in the area of plasma jet driven magneto-inertial fusion (PJMIF) and his thoughts on the race for fusion energyResults in plasma jet driven magneto-inertial fusion (PJMIF) and the race for fusion energy 386PROFILE Figure 1 - Fast camera visible-light images of supersonic plasma jet merging at PLXTo explore the physical processes underway in the jet merging, we used the coaxial plasma guns designed and built by HyperJet Fusion Corporation(detailed in several of the preceding articles in this series) to fire super- sonic plasma jets and collide them at an oblique angle. These experiments are conducted at reduced energy levels to those estimated to be required to produce breakeven fusion, but allow the physics to be studied at a greatly reduced cost. By varying the angle of the jet merging, we can study the effect of the jet relative velocity on the merging processes. Example fast-camera images of the plasma jet merging are shown in Figure 1. The observations indicate there is more to the story of the merging plasma jets than the hydrodynamic prediction alone would indicate. For example, in Figure 1a, jets collide at a relatively shallow angle and low (but still supersonic) relative velocity and shocks form in accordance with hydrodynamics. At steeper merging angle, however, shown in Figure 1b, rather than a stronger shock wave as predicted by hydrodynamics for the higher relative velocity, a smoothed and diffuse merging structure is observed. We find this result to be due to significant interpenetration of the jets occurring on the merging length scale, preventing the formation of a sharp density perturbation as would occur in a hydrodynamic shock. With benchmark data such as these now available from PLX, we can look forward to projected results at fusion-relevant scale. Such plasma liners would be denser by orders of magnitude than the PLX experiments, raising the question of whether the smoothing effects of interpenetration observed at PLX can be sustained at a fusion-relevant energy scale. Lookingat plasma interpenetration theory, we project that similar smoothing will indeed be achievable if the liner isdriven at a higher velocity, an encour- aging result for the hope of utilising PJMIF as an effective fusion compres- sion driver. These and other resultsfrom PLX are detailed in the current 4,5 and upcoming publications. Going forward, we are upgrading PLX to perform hemispherical and ulti- mately fully spherical experiments,with a significantly increased number of plasma guns. At the time of this writing, 18 new plasma guns have been delivered by HyperJet Fusion Corp. and hemispherical and spheri- cal experiments are planned with up to 36 guns before the end of the cal- endar year. Such experiments will give important results on the density amplification and ram-pressure scal-ing achieved in spherically convergent geometry, information that is a key metric of the concept performance and needed to benchmark designs of a full-scale driver. To conclude this article series, we recall the case made by Dr Scott Hsu in the first article in this series, which is that fusion energy development has been held in check in recent decades by two factors: a high ~$10 billion cap- ital cost of modern facilities and a lack of urgency and public political will in fusion energy development. Today, three years later, the first factor may be finally showing signs of weakness due to aggressive new scientific approaches aimed to achieve eco- nomical fusion power at a much cheaper development cost than thecurrent worldwide tokamak-based path. These approaches include PJMIF and other exciting projects 6,7sup- ported by the ARPA-E ALPHA program, as well as new approaches in mag- netic confinement fusion that seek touse high-temperature superconduct- ing magnets to achieve a productive tokamak reactor at significantly reduced size and facility capital cost8. The second factor, lack of urgency will, may also be weakening as the effects of climate change grow ever more severe and apparent. Private risk cap- ital and philanthropic interests have moved to support fusion at unprece- dented levels and the government has responded with new programmes such as the DOE Office of FusionEnergy Sciences INFUSE program to complement that effort. Whether these approaches will be enough to achieve practical fusion power in time to impact climate change, only time will tell. References 1. Thio, YC Francis, et al.

ENERGY 389Transforming Construction: Driving innovation Sam Stacey is leading the Transforming Construction Challenge, which is backed by \u00a3170 million in research and innovation investment, matched by \u00a3250 million from industry, tocreate new construction processes and techniques forbuilding manufacture in the UK. Prior to joining Innovate UK, he was director of innovation, industrialisation and business improvement at Skanska UK. What made you want to get involved in transforming construction? And why is now the right time? My passion for transforming construction probably dates back to my teens. I knew by then that I wantedto work in construction and I strongly felt that post-war construction was not responding to the needs of society - poor planning, poor design and leading to crime and urban decay. Through my career, I've gradually pieced together the skills and experience that enable me to lead the change we need. I've worked as an engineer, architect,design manager and most recently innovation director at Skanska. At Skanska, I was able to apply many of the techniques referred to as Industry 4.0 - interoperability of components, digital modelling, robotic assistance and distributed autonomous machines. I saw that they represented a fantastic set of tools to improveconstruction. We at UK Research & Innovation (UKRI) have this incredible opportunity now with the technologies, plus industry and the government support to fundamentally improve what we build and the way we build it.How signicant was it for construction to be recognised in the sector deals alongside industries like Life Sciences, Automotiveand Aerospace as being essential pillars of the wider economy? Construction industry turnover in the UK, at \u00a3110 billion, is bigger than aerospace and automotive combined, but has been trapped in a cycle of low innovation and lowproductivity. Other sectors have received generous government support that has contributed to revolutions in performance. Construction is the last great unreformed industry, and the Sector Deal is enabling us to address that. Partially due to the ongoing attention given to Building Information Modelling (BIM) and to site safety - the UK is already a world leader in construction performance - but there is the opportunity to do much more. The Sector Deal has brought the industry together as neverbefore, aligning the aims of clients, suppliers, designers and the users of buildings. This could not have been done without the Sector Deal. What are the key aims of the Transforming Construction Challenge? The explicit aims of the challenge are to achieve the targets of the government's 2025 Construction Strategy, published in July 2013; namely a third reduction in construction costs, a 50% improvement in the construction trade balance, and 50% reductions in speed and carbon emissions. In the process of addressing those targets, we are determined however to achieve much wider benets - including higher wages, osite fabrication jobs in neglected areas of the country, fewer vehicleSam Stacey, Challenge Director, UKRI Transforming Construction, talks to PBC Today about why he took on the role, the key aims of the Transforming Construction Challenge and the future of precision manufacturing and offsite construction 390movements and less construction waste. The beauty of the strategy is that all these aims are mutually supportive. What has been achieved so far? We're making great progress. UKRI has so far provided \u00a3129 million of funding to industry with a further \u00a336 million upcoming for collaborative research anddevelopment projects. Funding is being used on over 100 companies of all sizes to work on solutions in collaboration with academia. Particular highlights include the SEISMIC project, which has developed standard frames for schools that will meet the targets listed above. These are already being procured at scale as part of the Department for Education's Generation 5 programme. Another highlight is the Advanced Industrial Methods for the Construction of Homes (AIMCH) - acollaboration that will improve the delivery of over 35,000 homes per year. What gives me condence that we will continue to go from strength to strength is the support we've had across the industry. Many fantastic people that have joined the programme - my own core team, and theteams at the Active Building Centre and the Construction Innovation Hub. Construction has long had an image of being slow to innovate and even resistant to change - how can that be overcome? The main barrier to innovation in construction has been lack of integration. We are addressing that by supporting value-based procurement, developing digital congurator tools and demonstrating how the use of industrialised techniques across the value chain. The Construction Innovation Hub will be the main driver for this. In order to encourage companies to collaborate, systems for the collection and sharing of data are being implemented, including the use of the internet of things. UKRI is also helping to develop articial intelligence in construction, and the enhancement of skills, particularly in the digital arena. Where do you think precision manufacturing and osite construction can have the biggest impact? Without doubt, precision manufacturing has a lot to oer all areas of construction, but the early impact will be seen with schools and housing. Schools will be a quick win because we have a secure pipeline of demand, a ENERGYENERGY 391clear line through to user benets - in this case educational attainment - and a government client. We'll be using schools to demonstrate the improvements in eciency and quality that can be achieved with a platform-based approach to construction. We want to get to the point where precision-manufacturing ofbuildings and infrastructure is so obviously better that it will become the default approach. What is the role of BIM in improving not only how buildings are designed and put together, but their whole life performance? BIM provides two things: accurate timely information and more certain outcomes. With BIM you have the opportunity to optimise both the production process and the way in which the users will interact with thebuilding. Each BIM project yields data that can be fed back into improving future projects. The modelling of the construction process enables the integration of the lean principles that have transformed value creation in other manufacturing sectors. How do you see the future of BIM and the emergence of concepts like the digital twin? The future of BIM will be based on what we call theGemini Principles, created by the Centre for Digital BuiltBritain. These principles dene how digital twins must be used for the public good, enable value creation and provide insight into the built environment. Trust and openness are implicit, such that wide ranges of organisations can work eectively together toproduce better buildings. The Transforming Construction programme will drive the uptake of the Gemini Principles across the industry, and really turbo- charge the process of innovation and continuous improvement. Where do you see digital technology having the biggest impacts in construction going forward? Longer term, it is through the application of machine learning (AI) that digital technology will have the greatest impact on construction. Today we navigate our way through construction projects like a driver who has a long journey to make, some knowledge of the route and an out of date map. In the future, construction will be carried out as thoughwe had a state-of-the-art Sat Nav to guide us. Continuously updated information will be fed into to the system, covering everything relevant to the success of the project. Powerful computers will process that datato provide clear guidance to everyone working on the project about what they should do at any given moment. We will always know exactly where we are going! Sam Stacey Challenge Director UKRI Transforming Construction StaceyUnder the coordination of the non-profit European Green Cities, with the support of the Danish Energy Agency's Smart Energy pool during 2019 and 2020, a targeted development and dissemination work on \"Smart Energy\" solutions will be carried out in several locations in Denmark, where the focus is on the widespread use of renewable energy in combination with optimised energysupply solutions that seek to utilise heat pumps in combination with so-called groundwater heat and groundwater cooling. \"The yearly energy saving is 75% and more than 90% of stored heat during summer can be recovered.\" I want to emphasise here that based on the expertise from the company Enopsol, and in a collaboration with the Copenhagen energy supply com- pany HOFOR, as early as 2019, that an energy plant has been commissioned to utilise groundwater as a cooling medium in connection with the overall major redevelopment project for Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen. This so-called ATES * technology avoids the normal installation of large and noisy mechanical cooling systems on roofs, while at the same timesaving 75% of the total energy consumption for cooling and heat.This is because it is possible to utilise the heat supplied through cooling by the groundwater during the summer season, using heat pumps in the winter, which then cover the peak of the heating needs during the coldest months. This also ensures that thegroundwater temperature is notaffected from year to year as it is possible to achieve a thermal balance for this. The investment in the overall ATES solution has a positive user and com- munity economy and pays home in five or six years. This can also be used advantageously for other hospital buildings and the like. In addition to this project, there is also a collaboration with the company, Green Island, which is involved in the development of a fossil-free district at Vinge Nord in the Frederikssund municipality. You can find out more about this at http://www.greenis - land.dk, as well as a dialogue on simi- lar solutions using heat pumps and building-adapted solar cells for a new urban development area in K\u00f8ge Nord, as well as renovation projects at Aved\u00f8re in the Hvidovre municipality. Information about the above will be provided on the \"Sustainable Cities and Buildings\" association website and database and on the website . * Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES)ATES groundwater cooling and heating For the Bisperberg Hospital in Copenhagen was chosen to useAquifer Thermal Energy Storage or ATES groundwater based cooling as a cheaper alternative than district cool- ing from HOFOR, the Copenhagen Energy Company. The yearly energy saving is 75% and more than 90% of stored heat during summer can be recovered. 2 stage heat pumps from Sabroe is used ( owned by Johnson Controls). In winter, district heating is base load and heat pumps delivers the peaks. (Only from November to March).Peder Vejsig Pedersen from European Green Cities tells us about the use of ATES technology with groundwater cooling and heating at Bispebjerg Hospital, CopenhagenA focus on smart energy green cities 392PROFILE Peder Vejsig PedersenIn Denmark it has been proven that ATES systems can be used even quite near to drinking water pumping stations, but it is a demand that the ground water temperatures are never heated more than 0,5\u00b0C in the vicinityof this. \"The investment in the overall ATES solution has a positive user and community economy and pays home in five or six years. This can also be used advantageously for other hospital buildings and the like.\" Besides an important effect has been that there has never been any net consumption of water, and there is no noise from the system. This can be compared to normal compressor cooling systems, which have a clearnoise problem from the condenser in the roofs in summer. From the ATES system developer Enopsol's point of view, the new and innovative SOLUS heating / cooling system, from Lindab with 19\u00b0 - 24\u00b0C operation temperatures, is really interesting. Since there can be a per- spective of avoiding the use of a largepart of the heat pump operation, with its quite high electricity use, if theground water temperatures can beraised somewhat in summer periods. For a new city development area, K\u00f8ge Nord south of Copenhagen it has been suggested to implement an advanced low temperature bidirectional district heating solution, which can be ideally combined with the above mentionedtechnologies, and new types of BIPV facades for a large commercial building development area. Peder Vejsig Pedersen Senior Advisor, 6755pvp@greencities.eu www.europeangreencities.com www.greenisland.dkwww.twitter.com/Vejsig 393PROFILE Housing areas can be realized with extremely low temperature operation, so it is possible to cover heating needs by common block wise or quarter based heat pumps with a seasonal coecient of performance reaching 5.0. Groundwater can be utilized as so-called \"Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage\", ATES. In addition, by securing a thermal balance on a yearly basis it can function as a low cost solution to obtain a seasonal based heat storage for the district heating of the future in combination with heat pumps. Commercial buildings can be realized with low temperature heating and cooling. In this way, it is possible to obtain a 90 % energy saving in connection to cooling, and heat pumps with a seasonal coecient of performance reaching 5.0 can cover the heat demand. Building integrated, PV or BIPV can on a yearly basis, match most of the electricity use for heat pump operation and electricity use in general. \"Smart Energy\" model for energy supply by help of ATES technology and BIPV Support from excess heat, solar heat or low temperature district heating as back up.ENERGY 394Marine energy test facilities accelerating commercial deployment: Importance of test facilities The opportunities of marine energy are multiple and substantive: marine energy can play a signi- cant role in the global energy transition, providing clean and predictable energy. It can help meet CO2 reduction targets, boost regional economies and create new jobs. In this respect, test facilities are playing a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of marine energy systems, by reducing risks and raising capital for commercialisation. Tidal power developer, Orbital Power, after having com- pleted their extensive test programme at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney, are now building their 2MW commercial device. Tocardo, after having tested for years at the Dutch Marine Energy Centre facilities, are scaling up towards commercial units. And wave energy developers like Seabased, Corpower, Laminaria,NEMOS and Floating Power Plant are all using various test facilities to demonstrate installation and operations and prove the survivability and performance of their technologies. Increasingly, test facilities are also askedto independently certify performance, loads or sh friendliness of devices, in order to de-risks technology and, thus, provide a good level of condence to insurers,investors and licensing authorities. Test centres are cooperating across Europe, exchanging experience and data and helping the sector to converge. Test centres also give an impulse to local and regional economies. Best practices and recommendations To help marine test facilities further develop their pivotal role, a best practice study on marine energy test facilities has been conducted as a part of the MET-CER- TIFIED project1. This project aims to advance the marine energy sector through the adoption of internationally recognised standards and certication schemes. The study consists of a state-of-the-art assessment ofa number of marine test facilities and a comparison with test facilities in other sectors. Based on this analy- sis, strategic recommendations have been formulated regarding certication and standards, business models and marketing, as well as a call to action for policymak- ers to cooperate at local, regional and national levels,to simplify permitting and increase public funding for the sector. Unlock marine energy's full potential The potential of marine energy can only be unlocked when all stakeholders are involved, including govern- ments at all levels. Despite the strong regional interest and supportive European Union (EU)-ambitions, thesector reports a lack of support at the national level. There is insucient long-term vision and oftenlow-carbon support is targeted at the nuclear, wind and solar industry. More interest comes from the local and regional level since marine energy can boost local and regional economies, provide jobs and make coastal communitiesmore attractive. At the EU level, signicant instruments are available for the sector, underpinned by the strategic Blue Growth vision. Simplify permitting One obstacle all interviewed facilities were faced with is the complex and lengthy permitting procedures and high cost associated with the monitoring conditions. Developers see cheaper, faster and simplied consenting as one of the most critical benets of using a test facility. An eective approach would be to have fully pre-con- sented test sites. This means granting a permit for theSarina Motmans from the West Flanders Development Agency POM, along with MET-CERTIFIED partners from Ghent University, the European Marine Energy Centre and the Dutch Marine Energy Centre underline the importance of marine energy test facilities when it comes to accelerating commercial deployment395test facility that covers all types of testing activity and technologies that may access the facilities during the operational lifespan. The \"Rochdale Envelope\" allows a project description to be broadly dened, within a number of agreed parameters. In this case, the tech- nologies and alternatives described in an environmen- tal impact assessment cover a certain range so that thepotential worst-case scenario is assessed. Conducting the assessment upfront and seeking site-wide consents can save valuable time and costs for the developers.Pre-consented test sites allow developers to focus on environmental impacts that are specic to their project and develop proportionate monitoring programmes which comply with consent conditions. The monitoring experiences from test facilities can help regulators to dene reasonable measures for permits and improve the sector's understanding of the potentialenvironmental impacts associated with the technology. Most test facilities have built up close relations with the appropriate regulators, advisory authorities and stake-holders to mitigate any concerns and ensure monitoring programmes are relevant. In order to support these relationships, test facilities have adopted best practices including: in-depth consultation during the environmental impact assessment and continuous stakeholder engagement exercises during the development of thetest facility and throughout the operation. Increase public funding Another observation from the study is that public fund- ing for both test facilities and marine energy developers is vital to help develop this promising sector. All inter- viewed test facilities rely on public funding in one way or another. Most are not-for-prot entities, supported by both public and private partners. Usually, test facilities need signicant early-stage funding support and are fully or partially state-owned. Once operational, the operations and further development are based on a combination of EU, state and private funds. In addition to the public funding of the test facility, continued funding and support to the marine energy industry and specically developers is crucial. Developers face challenges in securing both public and private nancing for early-phase projects, especially those with signicant technology risk and capital intensity. This gap in commercial-scale nancing hinders advanced energy technologies to become marketable. In addition, most of the support is intended for the test phase, yet the greatest costs and risks are related to marine operations, resulting in a market getting stuck just before the commercial phase. Best practices show that collaboration through Europeanprogrammes that provide funding for testing is bene- cial. Establishment of similar funding programmes could help in the development of marine energy. The study carried out under the MET-CERTIFIED project, calls for policymakers at all levels to give marine energy the attention it deserves and help unlock its potential by facilitating consenting procedures and increasingpublic funding for its testing.

Others, called altcoins, were buoyed by this rising tide and reached previously unfathomable prices. People even started to take out home equity loans to buy into the craze, quite likely to their nancial advisers' dismay. Their popularity was based on the fact they were billed as a safe, albeit not necessarily stable, payment plat- form. Thanks to strong cryptography, in theory, it should be impossible for someone to be able to manufacturetheir own 'coins', steal someone else's, or reverse any transactions. And in most cases this is true, but there are other ways than breaking cryptography to steal them. In January this year, one attacker exploited a flaw found in the majority of cryptocurrencies and made o with $1.1 million in Ethereum Classic. This so-called '51%' attack highlights a critical vulnerability which has been present since the technology's inception and which will, over time, only get worse. So, what exactly are these cyber currencies and how do they work in nancial transactions?Marc Laliberte, Senior Security Analyst at WatchGuard Technologies, looks at the processes, vulnerabilities and dangers posed by cryptocurrencies BLOCKCHAIN INNOVATION397Bitcoin was rst launched about ten years ago and was the rst example of cryptocurrency. It used a blockchain as a distributed public ledger. This is a database which is collectively shared and synchronised across multiple sites and allows money transactions to have 'witnesses' and without the use of any centralised bank. A 'distrib- uted' ledger contains hundreds of thousands of 'nodes' (a connection device), which all participate by validating and storing the ledger. Anyone can take part in themanagement of the blockchain by forming or 'spinning up' their own node. Other examples of cryptocurrenciesinclude Ethereum, as well as the privacy-focusedMonero and the speed-focused Litecoin. How transactions are added Most cryptocurrencies use a system called 'Proof ofWork' (PoW) to build a consensus on what the correctblockchain is. The process of adding blocks of transac- tions to this chain is called mining and the nodes which participate are called miners. This is a simplication, but at a high level the process operates in the following ways:First, a mining node receives transactions and validates them to make sure there is no double spend, for example, spending the same funds twice in dierenttransactions. The nodes then bundle up a number oftransactions into a block. At the end of the block, they add a transaction which gives them an amount of cryptocurrency as payment for their work. Finally, the node begins trying to mine the block into the blockchain. In the PoW process, this intentionally involves very dicult maths which is computationallyexpensive. Miners compete against each other to solve the problem which adds their block and the rst minerto solve the maths gets a reward of some coins. The miner who nds the solution to the maths problem 'announces' their mined block into the network and other nodes then veries the solution and the new block is added to the chain. 'Forks' are created when two dierent miners come up with two dierent but acceptable, solutions and then mine two valid blocks. Over time, one will become longer as the majority of nodes add blocks to it and the longest one is accepted as the correct version and the remaining one is abandoned.PoW blockchains rely on the honest majority, meaningthat a majority of mining power must follow the intended blockchain's mining behaviour. For large cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, with up to hundreds of thousands of nodes, it is prohibitively expensive to amass enough computing power to control this majority under either a single person's or organisations' control, which keeps the ledger safe from attack. Enter Ethereum This altcoin was introduced in 2015 and expanded the idea of a public transaction ledger from just distributed nancial transactions to distributed computing. This is where nodes on the network participate in a decentralised virtual machine and use scripted functions to build fully distributed applications. Over the last four years, developers have built applica-tions on the Ethereum network from cat-trading game, CryptoKitties, to an investment platform called the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO). A year after Ethereum was introduced, however, anattacker exploited a vulnerability in the DAO's underlying code to siphon o $550 million in Ether, cryptocur- the Ethereum blockchain. Because blockchains are immutable meaning that xed and invariable transactions cannot be reversed, the only way to reverse this was to 'hard fork'. This fork essentiallywent back in time, negated the attacker's transactions and created a new version of the blockchain. It's highly controversial to do this because it goes against one of the core tenants of the technology, its immutabil- ity. But due to the scale of the hack, a majority of the nodes agreed to fork so the majority rule succeeded and Ethereum continued on its new branch.

Mining nodes con- vert electricity into computation power in order to solve the complex maths problems involved, so if the cost of the electricity outweighs the rewards earned for suc-cessfully mining a block, it doesn't make any nancial sense to keep on with that particular currency. This, inturn, will lead to a drop in mining power, meaning fewer participants and less of a majority, which then led to the January 7th attack when an attacker exploited the dropin power. The attacker sent several transactions worth from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars in Ethereum Classic to several dierent wallets, which are a device, physical medium, programme or service, which stores the public and/or private keys and can be used to track ownership, receive or spend the cryptocurrencies. They then obtained 51% of the mining power so that they could exclude transactions from their new version of the blockchain and eventually overtake the original version of the blockchain to become the 'real' accepted version. Basically, the attacker created a new reality in which they never actually sent their Ethereum Classic to the exchanges, allowing them to keep both their EthereumClassic currency and the alternative cryptocurrency likeBitcoin, that they traded for before launching the attack. In summary, a 51% attack allows the hacker to double- spend their funds. In this case, spending it once to pur- chase a dierent cryptocurrency and then regaining it to spend again. The recipient of the original transaction has their funds stolen when the blockchain is reorgan- ised and the transaction removed. One of the victims of this attack, Gate.io had $100,000 worth of Ethereum Classic stolen and Coinbase about $1.1 million. Are major cryptocurrencies vulnerable? In technical terms, all the cryptocurrencies that use PoW are vulnerable to a 51% attack, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero. Practically, the computing power needed to do this is astronomical. For this attack, mining power from a cloud provider like NiceHash could have been bought. At the time of the attack, the perpetrator would have needed to maintain 8TH/s (8,000,000,000,000 hashedper second) and NiceHash charges about $15,000 per day for 1TH/s, so this could cost $120,000 for a full day, which is enough time to execute a double spend of this type. Therefore, these attacks are a serious risk to smaller cryptocurrencies as it is economically feasible for an attacker to rent enough mining power to take many of them over. One of the things holding them back, how- ever, is that they are almost guaranteed to crash the value of a currency if their value is already smaller than Ethereum Classic. What are the xes? Although larger cryptocurrencies may all but be immune to attacks like these, it isn't stopping changes being implemented, which can help impede them. An example is Ethereum, as well as others, that are moving towards a process called Proof-of-Stake, which mitigates attacks by destroying the funds the attacker is trying to steal. Smaller currencies could still be in trouble though because while people still put funds into new and cheaper ones in the hope of striking gold during a surge in value, there are still serious risks. Cryptocurrencies are still essentially in the realms of the Wild West and should, as a result, be treated with careful consideration. Marc Laliberte Senior Security Analyst WatchGuard at WatchGuard TechnologiesContinued from page 397The advent of digital is rapidly creeping into every aspect of our daily lives and social relationships. Digital has empowered millions of users to experience a new model for the exchange of informa- tion. The future is decentralised and the technologies of blockchain, mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) will touch very aspect of our digital life. Emerging markets such as the requirements for Smart Cities, Finance, Healthcare, etc. cannot be infected by \"FAKE\" data. Data quality needs to join the same priority as water quality and powerreliability. The digital revolution has brought with it a future with trust and history. The reliability and quality of data will underpin the value of all the other systems. One of the biggest issues with today's digital services is that a device that creates data is generally unknown, because the devices lack strong machine identity or because the infrastructure enables weak identities. Billions has been invested in USER identity but not the health and integrity of the device that creates thedata. It is not enough to just protect critical information in the operating system. The device needs to aggregatethe evidence to ensure that the trans- action reflects the user's intentions. The current models are all built on the foundations of network architecture where compliance and security areverified at the point of access. The challenge is to enable a shift from a centralised compliance model where a third party authorises transactions after they are submitted, to a decen- tralised model where the user, third party services and their device can determine compliance before a transaction is submitted. The shift to a device-centric trustworthy computing model has been proven to work. The Point of Sale terminal model uses the terminal and smartcard together to form secure instructions for the global payments network. The deployment of chip cards and secure terminals in Europe over the last 15 years has driven fraud and the actions by bad actors to historical lows for physical presence transactions in bricks and mortar. The e-commerce security model of only card numbers and security codes has seen continued growth in fraud rates around the world, demonstrat- ing that big data and continuous monitoring is not a viable long-term model. The optimal approach is to pre-validate the cybersecurity controls and compliance before a transaction is committed. The validation can then be bound to the data providing the proof a known device in a known condition produced the data. The core of the data quality problemis anchored in the fact that the mobileapps and browser services markets are built on a foundation of \"any device\" with username and password. The compromise of passwords, a well know industry problem, has resulted in increasing fraud. However, Trusted Execution technologies used in SIM chips, Smart Cards, PCs, smartphones, cable boxes, and other devices have proven to be resilient for managing subscribers and these technologies are standardised in billions of devices today. The challenge of transactional security is not just assuring the proper identity of the originator of a transaction, but also that the instructions associated with that transaction are intended bythe originator. Cyber security technol- ogy enables the assurance that a transaction created was the transac- tion intended and includes not just the signing of the message with an iden- tity but also assurance that the sender verified and consented to the instruc- tions being sent. A secure instruction requires that the sender and receiver are both confident that the identities and cybersecurity controls were used as intended, and that the message wasn't changed after being sent. The Rivetz Solution The 4th Industrial Revolution requires that the user protections and transac-tional security exceed any solution available today. Presently, hooking a blockchain to an exchange or a Steven Sprague, Cofounder and CEO of Rivetz shares his thoughts on the importance of protecting the supply chain of data, ensuring all transactions are purposeful, intended and compliantData with evidence: Building the supply chain for data 400PROFILElightbulb to a phone that authenti- cates via username and password will not meet the needs of billions of users. The challenges of identity, control, privacy, compliance and ease of use must all be addressed. The data must travel with a mark of qual- ity to assure the data is real. The prin- ciples of decentralised operation must be preserved to protect the user's privacy and control. Users must own their private keys to allow for choice. Rivetz is built on the foundations of data and device security standards established over the last 20 years.Rivetz combines the technologies and standards of Trusted Execution, Global Platform, Trusted Computing, NIST Information Assurance, PaymentSecurity Directive 2, GDPR and many others. Rivetz has architected and constructed The Rivetz Network, a collection of cyber security services and policies that are available to applications. Using Trusted Execution technology,Rivetz protects critical security infor- mation and enables users, regulatory parties, or owners of specific digital assets to dictate the required policies which must be evaluated for compli- ance before transactions are submit- ted. In addition to Rivetz developed services and policies, we enable third party providers to also offer cyber services through our provisioning and settlement capabilities of our network. Rivetz has built a key partnership with Telefonica ElevenPaths to research and develop next generation protec- tions for the owner's keys and instruc- tions. The goal has been to leverage the existing hardware that is already present in modern mobile devices. Rivetz uses both the TEE and SIM to protect our private keys - introducing the Dual Roots of Trust. This enables remote over the air control of digital assets independent of physical possession of the device. As our mobile devices have become more important to our everyday livesand contain so much of our personal and private data, we need better ways to protect ourselves. The keys to thesolutions needed lie in the roots of trust that already exist on billions of mobile platforms and the emerging partners and policy services that are part of The Rivetz Network, ensuringa safer, more secure and simpler experience. use in the financial, public and other sectors Blockchain has come a long way in the decade since Satoshi Nakamoto proposed Bitcoin as an alternative currency following the 2008 nancial crisis. Blockchain is essentially a form of distributed ledger, in which each new entry on the chain is crypto- graphically linked to the previous entry. The use of cryptography to link each entry on the chain to that preceding it should mean that the chain is a true and accurate representation of the transactions which have taken place and which cannot be altered. A variety of dierent products, no longer limited to alternative currencies, are now being built and developed on blockchain, perhaps most notably in the nancial and public sectors. As a result, the use cases and appli- cations of the technology have continued to grow atpace. While there remain a number of challenges to overcome in order for blockchain to obtain mainstream adoption, the potential is clearly there to drive eciencies in sectors other than the nancial and public sectors. In terms of the nancial services sector, where previously blockchain might have been the realm of start-ups, traditional nancial institutions are now experimenting with blockchain-based solutions. Blockchain has the potential for banks and other nancial institutions to transfer value instantaneously around the globe, whilst incurring signicantly less expense in doing so (for example by reducing the need for intermediaries) as compared with settlement systems currently used in most mainstream nance. A number of banks are now heavily investing in blockchain, including JP Morgan Chase (\"JPM\"), which has developed the Interbank Information Network (\"IIN\"), a peer-to-peer network, in order to assist banks with cross-border payments. The technology poweringIIN is Quorum, a permissioned version of theEthereum blockchain. Since its launch in 2017, around 75 of the world's largest banks have signed up to IIN and JPM hopes that this will increase eciencies through reduced fees and less delays as a result of member banks exchanging information in real time to verify and approve payments. Whilst there are obvious benets associated with blockchain in terms of speed and immutability of the ledger, there are also risks, perhaps notably (and somewhat ironically) the potential for fraud. For banks, a potential issue in this regard is regulatory compliance when dealing with customers who want to invest in crypto-assets. How will banks determine the source of funds of a customer when those funds are held in assets on an anonymised blockchain ledger such as that of Bitcoin? If the aim is to integrate blockchain and crypto-assets into traditional nancial frameworks, banks and nancial institutions will need to work closely with their regulators to maintain adequate and acceptable compliance. In the UK, the FCA's \"sandbox\" allows rms to test products in a controlled environ- ment before applying for authorisation from the regulator, allowing rms and the regulator to work closely when developing blockchain-based products. The FCA has said that it has accepted a number of rms which will be testing propositions relating to crypto-assets into the \"sandbox\". Just as with the nancial sector, blockchain has the power to revolutionise the public sector. In the UK, for example, HM Land Registry is seeking to utilise R3's blockchain platform as part of the \"Digital Street\" research and development programme. The aim is to explore the potential benets of blockchain to under- stand how distributed ledgers and smart contracts could improve the eciency of property transactions by developing a faster, more secure and cheaper landGuy Robson, Senior Associate and Elliott Fellowes, Associate at Signature Litigation, discuss the use of blockchain in the financial, public and other sectorsBLOCKCHAIN INNOVATION 403registration process. The idea is that land property registers could be built upon a blockchain, making investigations into title far easier and potentially linking the title to any charges created over the property, such as digital mortgages. This would also allow for immediate transfer of title, without the need for the registry to beupdated separately. A further public sector use case for blockchain is the reporting and reconciliation of intragovernmental transactions. Such transactions are common in federal systems, such as the United States. However, they also occur in non-federal systems, for example, transactions between government agencies or between regional and central government functions. Real-time settlement and an accurate, immutable ledger recording transac- tions could alleviate some of the onerous reporting requirements, minimising errors and increasing trans- parency in relation to the utilisation of government resources. With new technology comes new issues and the public sector use cases above are no exception. For example, whilst a blockchain-based ledger may be xed, there remains the possibility for fraud during the property purchase or transaction. This raises the question of what would happen if a fraudulent purchaser of a property is entered as the owner on the Land Registry's blockchain. Blockchain records are intended to be immutable - removing the need for a middle-man is a large part of blockchain's attractiveness. If transactions need to be rectied, due to fraud or some otherreason, how does one easily go about this? What is thenature of the \"damage\" suered by the wronged party and what order could a court make in order for an aggrieved party to be properly compensated? These examples are just some of the potential uses of blockchain technology. There are numerous other sectors also investing in the technology, such as the art world which is considering blockchain solutions to prove immutable provenance of artworks or charitableorganisations considering crypto-donations as a more ecient and transparent means to raise and distribute funds. Whilst the future is bright for blockchain, there remain risks as with any new technology and increasedlegal certainty for the Court and the government will assist in the continuing development of the technology. Guy RobsonSenior Associate Associate404In early 2009, Bernie Mado pled guilty to the largest Ponzi scheme in world history and the largest nan- cial fraud in U.S. history. Over the course of nearly three decades, the nancier turned career criminal had stolen billions of dollars from investors by way of deceit and using fraudulent nancial reporting. While no onehas managed to eclipse Mado in the intervening years, fraud remains a widespread problem in thenance industry. In the UK alone, it's estimated that fraud costs the economy \u00a3110 billion a year, with the global economy suering losses to the tune of \u00a33.2 trillion annually. If authorities are to seriously tackle this scourge and put an end to any future Mados, they need to invest massively in technology, and blockchain in particular. Caught in the past The trouble is, most authorities responsible for detecting and catching fraudsters are using yesterday's technology.In a 2016 op-ed published by The Guardian, former U.S. congressional representative Randy Hultgren points out that the regulators investigating Mado were stuck using the same pen and paper technology as their 1930s forebears. As a result, repeated fraudu- lent reporting slipped between the cracks, despite six complaints about his rm having been lodged between 1992 and 2008. Meanwhile, a recent article in Bloomberg points out that the US$9-trillion business of nancing global trade is still largely paper-driven, making it susceptible to forgery at every point in the value chain. By contrast, the criminals these regulators are sup- posed to investigate and catch, have embraced digital technology and use it to take their illicit activities to new heights.

Banking on blockchain That does not, however, mean that the ght againstnancial crime is lost. Regulators, banks, and the nancial transaction giants whose business depends on correct veriable nancial data and accountability can ght back. Doing so means abandoning current practises, which have so far proved ineectual to the benet of the Bernie Maddofs of the world. Instead, regulators and nancial industry players alike should focus their eorts on blockchain . Its system of cryptographically-linked, unmodiable entries are ideal for the nancial space. Because records cannot be altered or deleted, hiding illicit nancial movements becomes almost impossible. There are several other factors which make blockchainideal for ghting nancial crime. These include: The technology allows independent verication reliance on third parties. Transactions are recorded in immutable chronological order. Records stored in the blocks are contained in millions of computers participating in the chain; making fraud logistically much more dicult. The blockchain is secure and transparent. Every transaction can be tracked on the blockchain. These characteristics make blockchain useful for more than just tracking nancial transactions. Blockchain- enabled smart contracts , for example, could go a long way to eliminating the forgery that bedevils the nancing of global trade. Embracing early adoption Admittedly, some blockchain applications have had teething problems , as is to be expected with any new technology. However, as the global usage of blockchain will increase, so will its accessibility and reliability. Certainly, none of the incidents which have impacted blockchain-enabled applications should deter regula-tors, banks and other players in the world of global nance from becoming enthusiastic early adopters of the technology. Banks are already embracing blockchain at a much faster rate than expected, with some (including major players such as UBS ) implementing blockchain labs to explore potential new applications for the technology. It should not only be banks that embrace blockchain in isolation. Regulators, authorities and other second- ary players also have a role to play. Landed registries, companies worldwide and any ocial registration agencies would benet from the cost eectiveness, automation and accuracy of blockchain. More impor-tantly, these various players all need to work together in standardizing processes and protocols. In some places, this kind of forward-thinking collabora- tion is already in place. The Canton of Geneva's support of the Geneva Fintech Association (which plays a pivotal role in educating and advocating for blockchain) is a good example of what's needed around the globe. These kinds of initiatives need to become far morewidespread. It's time to stop patching up leaks andstart putting in better pipes.

As our economy depends more and more on digital technology and connectivity, we arestepping up our approach to cyber security to meet thedemands of the present and plan for the future. Almost every day, there are new reports of cyber-attacks and data breaches and the threat is on a global scale. That's why we need a skilled and diverse workforce to match the challenge ahead. Our Cyber Skills Immediate Impact Fund (CSIIF) is an example of an initiative weexpect to make a real dierence going forward, quickly increasing the number and diversity of individuals entering the cyber security profession. We recently launched the third round of funding . Training providers will be able to bid for up to \u00a3100,000 to work with employers and design training programmes which retrain a diverse range of people for careers in cyber security. The Fund has already helped over 400 people benet from training opportunities, with twelve training initiatives receiving support so far. One example is the 'Cyber Ready' project sponsored in the rst round. This project run by CompTIA identied and helped thirty individuals in London and the North West of England on the road towards a recognised industry qualication. Graduates from the programme now have jobs in cyber security roles in organisations including Lloyds Banking, Amazon and the NHS. The Fund is designed to stimulate the cyber security retraining system so that the industry can see this typeof initiative is a valuable pipeline for developing and nding talent. In the future, we hope that successful initiatives will help to grow the UK's network of trainingproviders working to help meet the immediate need for cyber security skills. CSIIF is just one of the ways government intervention is inspiring the next generation of cyber security talent through its 'Cyber First' initiatives. Other programmes and competitions, including CyberDiscovery and our range of Cyber First courses, are also encouraging young people to explore a career in the industry. Through our National Cyber Security Strategy, we are investing \u00a31.9 billion to help millions of people and organisations become more secure. We recently announced that the Institute of Engineering and Tech- nology will be the lead for the new UK Cyber Security Council, which will help to make cyber security a well-structured and easy to navigate profession. All of these measures will help to ensure we have skilled people from a range of backgrounds represented across the profession, increasing our resilience for the future. Our digital economy is an absolute priority. We want to make the UK the best place in the world to start and grow a business and good cyber security and the workforce to match will enable companies to seize the many opportunities of a connected world.

At the same time, global tech companies pledged to invest more than \u00a31 billion in the UK. At rst, we may feel a sense of relief at this news. But when you think about it, more needs to bedone before we get too overjoyed, as really, this is thenecessity and the minimum. Investment needs to come in more ways than one andfunding, no matter how large, is just the start. This isespecially true when it comes to national issues suchas the digital skills gap. The good news is that there's a strong appetite toaddress the widening skills gap and awareness of the importance of upskilling in IT. In fact, 61% of busi- nesses strongly agree that the government needs to better address digital skills gaps, according to a report from TCS and CBI . In addition to investing nancially, 93% of tech rms are acting on their responsibility to address the digital skills gap. The main ways that they are doing this is through hiring more external talentWe all have a responsibility to close the skills gap, but what are you going about it? Here, Ramkumar Chandrasekaran, HR Director, UK & Ireland at Tata Consultancy Services shares three steps for business and government collaboration Closing the digital skills gap: Three steps for business and government collaborationICTICT 410from the UK, partnering with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), suppliers or contractors and by organising short courses, among other things. \"Closing the skills gap is too big a job for one government, or one business or one school. It must be a collaborative effort. By pulling in expertise from the supply chain, local SMEs, Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) and perhaps even competitors, companies improve their internal digital skills strength and can train up the next generation of talent.\" Future growth isn't only dependent on money, it's is about a longer-term, broader pledge for change. With this in mind, let's look at how businesses need to work with the government to better enact change in the industry, to help close the skills gap: Know your vision Knowing where you want to end up is essential in determining the path you take to get there. Companies that have a clear vision to improve digital skills, whilst knowing their long-term success relies upon it, will better prioritise the bespoke skills needed to make progress. If guidance is needed to help nd that direction, they can do so by paying attention to government reportssuch as the Tech Competitiveness Study. By seeing what the government is prioritising, businesses can follow suit. Collaborate as much as you can Closing the skills gap is too big a job for one government, or one business or one school. It must be a collaborative eort. By pulling in expertise from the supply chain, local SMEs, Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) and perhaps even competitors, companies improve their internal dig- ital skills strength and can train up the next generation of talent. Support the next generation The next generation is the rst digitally native genera- tion. We should be adapting to embrace that fact. While the government is rolling out initiatives such as mandatory coding in primary schools, businesses canbuild on these foundations and oer more in-depth teaching to pupils through educational outreach. After all, some of the rarest and brightest minds in this eldare in business, not academia and we must share that expertise. Despite the concerns about digital skills, businesses and government are clearly on the right trajectory to turn this around. Each party brings dierent skills, resources and expertise to the table so now is the time to take the steps towards greater collaboration and ultimately give us a reason to celebrate resolving the digital skills gap.

Indeed, advanced comput-ing systems and services are now integral to enabling advances across all elds - and ultimately ensuring the Nation's continued leadership and competitiveness. In support of evolving S&E drivers and leveraging a constantly-changing technology landscape, the Oce of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) within theNational Science Foundation (NSF) provides broad access to an agile, integrated, robust, trustworthy and sustainable cyberinfrastructure (CI) ecosystem for the Nation's researchers and educators .(1)NSF's CI invest- ments align with national priorities for future comput- ing systems, as outlined in the National StrategicComputing Initiative (NSCI). (2)Central to NSF's vision is a balanced ecosystem (as illustrated in Figure 2) that eectively supports a broad and diverse set of requirements, users and usage modes. It increasingly blends translational computational research and cyberinfrastructure, while integrating innovations from the private sector. Furthermore, it includes crosscut- ting coordination, allocation, measurement and user support services and is complemented by the other components of the CI ecosystem including software and data services, networking, cybersecurity and learning and workforce development. Here, we describe some of the key pillars and the asso- ciated activities that OAC has been spearheading over the last year, in support of this ecosystem. Leadership-class computing So-called \"leadership-class computing\" constitutes highly specialised computation and data analytics instruments providing the extreme-scale capability to support S&E research and education that would simply not be possible otherwise.

A key goal of these systems is to leverage federated and/or dis- tributed resources, regional and/or campus supported resources and/or commercial cloud services. In the last year, OAC has funded three such systems: Expanse: Computing without Boundaries: Cyber- infrastructure for the Long Tail of Science , located at the University of California-San Diego, provides increased capacity and performance for users of batch-oriented and science gateway computing; integration with the public cloud and the Open Science Grid is a key component. Bridges-2: Scalable Converged Computing, Data, and Analytics for Rapidly Evolving Science and Engineering Research , located at Carnegie-Mellon University, provides a high-capacity, applications. And Ookami , at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, is a prototype/testbed system that seeks to explore the Fujitsu A64fx processor with ultra-high memory bandwidth to better support memory- intensive applications. It's also the rst such system outside Japan that leverages this processor. Cloud computing services In addition to the innovative advanced computing sys-tems and services described above, cloud computingservices are playing an increasingly important role in supporting academic and research computing - and NSF has explored partnerships with commercial cloud computing providers in recent years to better integrate cloud computing services into the CI ecosystem. For example, through NSF's CloudAccess program,CloudBank , (5)is supporting a collaboration among the University of California-San Diego, the University of California-Berkeley and University of Washington, and is delivering a set of managed services, including education and training, to enhance access for the com- puter and information science and engineering research and education community to public clouds. NSF intends to assess this pilot and potentially scale it 413Similarly, in the E-CAS(6)project, the non-prot com- puter networking consortium Internet2 is helping build partnerships with commercial cloud computing providers to support S&E applications that leverage new and more eective uses of cloud computing capa- bilities. In partnership with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Oracle Cloud,(7)Internet2 is leading the S&E community in investigating the viability of commercial clouds for leading-edge computational S&E supporting a range of academic disciplines. Conclusion Twenty-rst-century S&E research and education is being actively transformed by the increasing availabil- ity and scales of computation and data. The federally funded U.S. CI ecosystem has, thus, become a key cat- alyst for discovery and innovation, playing a critical role in ensuring the Nation's leadership in S&E, economiccompetitiveness and national security. NSF plays a cen- tral role in realising this national CI ecosystem, provid-ing advanced computing systems and services that are critical for enabling discoveries and driving innovationacross all of S&E.

In the last few years, driven by fierce compe- tition from giant e-commerce retailers, many traditionally brick-and-mortar chains such as Macy's, Walmart, and Target have been leading the way towards providing extremely conve- nient shopping experiences for theircustomers. Today, customers of omnichannelretailers have a choice in not only the mode of purchase but also in themode of receiving the product. They can buy through the channel of their choice such as a physical store, online, or on the phone and receive their products via shipment, store walk-ins, store pickup, or secured lockers. Omnichannel customers have also become accustomed to an unprece- dented amount of information regarding the products they buy. This includes in-store availability informa-tion, estimates of delivery times, and the visibility of product movement throughout the supply chain. Despitethis, there is still a demand for increased visibility, and retailers that are able to provide this are at a competitive advantage. For instance, many customers are wary about the origin/authenticity of the product, especially for fresh produce and high-value luxury goods,while others are socially responsible and prefer to use products that are compliant with fair trade practices at all nodes of the supply chain. In sum, to win brand confidence of an omnichannel customer, retailers need to build trust in their relationship by offering a transparent and traceable product supply chain. A quick reflec- tion on this challenge reveals the need of easy access to either real time information or a reliable record of product movement and/or availability in the supply chain. Can blockchain address the current misses in Omni-channel retail? Blockchain, which operates on a digital ledger of transactions distributed among a network of computers, has found many applications in financial services. Interestingly, blockchain could be an answer to the many challengesfaced by omnichannel retailers including traceability, trust, and trans- parency. Indeed, a recent report by fin- tech specialist Monica Eaton-Cardone found that about 78% of retailers will have joined the blockchain revolution by 2023. Further, the study forecasts that the blockchain retail market value could grow to $2.3 billion or at a com- pound annual growth rate of 96.4%, which would be the highest forecasted growth among any blockchain-related industry1. With blockchain technology, both retailers and customers can have real-time access to the product serialnumber and the process status details such as order processing status, pay- ment status, real-time order location, and delivery status. Since blockchain works on a distributed ledger, the information blocks cannot be easily modified and the temporal pattern ofAssociate Professors Joline Uichanco, Stefanus Jasin and Debjit Roy offer their expertise to discuss how blockchain can be used to solve traceability, trust, and transparency challenges faced by omnichannel retailers Blockchain: A magic wand to omnichannel retail challenges? 414PROFILE the information blocks cannot be altered, which means that all stake- holders in the supply chain has a unified view of the information. In addition to making the purchase process more transparent, the real- time information can also provide retailers and customers with details on product flow in the supply chain from factory to store. Such informa- tion can be quite valuable, particularly during food recalls where information from the ledgers can be utilised to quickly trace back the origins of the products. Due to transparency builtacross all nodes in the supply chain, the B2B transaction clearing times that could be long at times is reduced significantly (Treshock, 2016). Further, transaction delays can be minimisedby executing automated transactionsbetween the retailer (franchisee) and customers, also known as smart contracts. Initial success cases LVMH, the world's largest luxury conglomerate, is using blockchain technology to track luxury goods and prove their authenticity2. Walmart is using blockchain to identify the source of its produce. When an outbreak of a food-borne disease happens, identify- ing the source could take several days. As noted in a Hyperledger casestudy, \"(b)etter traceability could help save lives by allowing companies to act faster and protect the livelihoods of farmers by only discarding produce from the affected farms.... For pork in China, it allowed uploading certificates of authenticity to the blockchain, bringing more trust to a system where that used to be a serious issue. And for mangoes in the U.S., the time needed to trace their origin reduced from 7 days to mere 2.2 seconds3.\" Blockchain can also promote respon-sible sourcing of products. Every product is assigned a barcode (digital identifier) and all transactions related to the product movement through its lifetime are recorded in a sequential fashion. For example, Moyee, a coffee roastery based out of Ethiopia 4, uses innovative blockchain technology to track the farmers compensation and makes an attempt to keep as much of the profits as possible in Ethiopia, which is one of the world's poorest country. To track sourcing from the farmers, each farmer is assigned a unique digital identity. Further, each buyer has an access to the price at which the beans are sourced from the farmers, with prices set at 20% above the market rate. In the future, they also intend to use the blockchain platform the tip thefarmers. Likewise, some of the best wool brands in Australia are attempting to ethically source wool by adopting blockchain-based farm management tools. Using a mobile device, they collect information on animal vaccinations, use of pesticides in the farm, stock movement and securelytransmitted back to the consumer'ssmart phone 5. While convenience pushes retail sales and customer shopping experiences, it also increases the complexity andchallenges in serving the omnichannel customers. Although blockchain seems like a promising solution, it isstill in its infancy. First, a shared vision among the participating entities needs to be established and the data entryneed to be automated. Moreover, there are some lingering questions: Is blockchain really safe? Is it scalable for large applications? We have to wait and see if blockchain is the silver bullet to the retailers' challenges.

In June 2019, eight sites for supercomputing centres were selected throughout the European Union (EU) to host the rst-ever European supercomputers. This ambitious endeavour aims to support Europe'sresearchers, industry and businesses to develop new applications in many areas, such as combatting climate change or designing medicines and new materials. The location of the eight sites are Barcelona (Spain),Bologna (Italy), Soa (Bulgaria), Ostrava (Czechia), Kajaani (Finland), Bissen (Luxembourg), Minho (Portugal) Maribor (1) In his blog, Roberto Viola, Director-General of DG CONNECT at the European Commission, underlines the desire for Europe to become a world leader in the eld of supercomputing. He says that when the computersare installed in 2020, they will be the result of a dreamthat the Member States and EU share, having funded the project to the tune of \u20ac900 million. In his own words, he provides his thoughts on how these newsupercomputers will give Europe a massive boost. \"Combined, these new supercomputers will boost European computing by four to ve times compared to current levels, a shot in the arm that will make Europe the world's leading supercomputing power by 2020. But it will do much than just lift us up the global ranking: it is also expected to generate investment of more than \u20ac10 billion in applications made possible or improved by the increase computing power, with benets for all areas of industry, including small and medium-sized enterprises. The EU-funded Fortissimo project (2)has already given many such enterprises in a range of elds the opportunity to use supercomputers to make major discoveries and advances.\" Roberto Viola also says that being the number one region in the world in this vein sends a clear messageabout Europe's ambitions. While this is not an end in itself, it allows Europe to achieve so much. Today, supercomputers are already behind some of the most ground-breaking applications, in almost any area you can imagine, such as advanced research on cancer, personalised medicine, environmental protection and road safety as well as cybersecurity and natural disasters' prediction. He goes on to explain the many opportunities that supercomputing will present, in hisown words, as this article draws to a close. \"But the additional computing power these new sites will bring leads to a wealth of new opportunities to really push the boundaries of what we can achieve. These supercomputers will be accessible to any private orpublic users in the European Union. They will serve over 800 application areas including in critical domains such as articial intelligence and big data analytics, cyberse- curity and blockchain, accelerating the digital transfor- mation of our economy and society. They will supportEurope's researchers and industry in developing new applications and products in many areas, such as personalised medicine, new drugs, material design, bio- engineering and manufacturing, weather forecasting, under- standing climate change and many, many more.\" (3) References 1. https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/europe- announces-eight-sites-host-world-class-supercomputers 2. https://www.fortissimo-project.eu/sites/default/les/Fortissimo_SS_ Booklet_web_0.pdf 3. https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/blogposts/do-super computers-dream-electric-sheepHere, we find out about the desire for Europe to become a world leader in the field of supercomputing, with comment from Roberto Viola, Director-General of DG CONNECT at the European Commission Open Access Government editorial@openaccessgovernment.org www.openaccessgovernment.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovHealthcare is one of the key sectors of the global econ- omy, making any improve- ment in healthcare systems to have a high impact on the welfare society. European public health systems are generating large datasets of biomedi-cal data, in particular, images that constitute a large unexploited knowl- edge database, since most of its value comes from the interpretations of the experts. Nowadays, this process is stillperformed manually in most cases. The use of technologies, such as the recent trend on bringing together high performance computing (HPC) with big data technologies, as well as the application of deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can overcome this issue and foster innovative solutions, in a clear path to more efficient healthcare, benefitting both people and public budgets. In this scenario, the DeepHealth project, funded from the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme, tackles real needs of the health sector with the aim to facilitate the daily work of medical personnel and related IT experts in terms of image processing and the use and training of predictive models. The main goal of the DeepHealth pro- ject is to put HPC computing power atthe service of biomedical applications and through an interdisciplinary approach, apply deep learning and computer vision techniques on large and complex biomedical datasets to support new and more efficient ways of medical diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of diseases. In line with the main goal, one of the most importantchallenges of the DeepHealth project is to design and implement distributed versions of the training algorithms, toefficiently exploit hybrid HPC + Big Data computing architectures by using the data parallelism programming paradigm. To fulfil this goal the DeepHealth Consortium, coordinated by everis and technically led by the Technical University of Valencia (UPV), involves 21 partners from nine European coun- tries, gathering a multidisciplinary group from research and health organisations as well as large and SME industrial partners. The DeepHealth toolkit: A key open-source asset for eHealth AI-based solutions At the centre of the DeepHealth pro- posed innovations is the DeepHealth toolkit, open-source free software thatwill provide a unified framework to exploit heterogeneous HPC and bigdata architectures assembled withdeep learning and computer vision capabilities to optimise the training of predictive models. The toolkit is composed of two core libraries, theEuropean Distributed Deep Learning Library (EDDLL) and the European Computer Vision Library (ECVL) and a dedicated front-end. The front-end will provide a web-based graphical user interface for facilitating the use of the functionalities provided by the core libraries to technical people, mainly computer and data scientists, without a profound knowledge of Deep Learning and Computer Vision. EDDLL and ECVL development are led by The Pattern Recognition and Human Language Technology (PRHLT) research centre of the UPV and the Reggio Emilia, respectively. The Department of Computer Science from the University of Torino and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center are also strongly contributing to the adaptation of the libraries to HPC and cloud environments. The toolkit will contribute to reduce the gap between the availability of cut- ting-edge technologies and its exten- sive use for medical imaging, through its integration in current and new biomedical platforms or applications. Jon Ander G\u00f3mez and Monica Caballero, DeepHealth Technical Manager and Project Coordinator, lift the lid on an exciting project that concerns deep-learning and high performance computing to boost biomedical applications for health 418PROFILE DeepHealth project: Deep-learning and HPC to boost biomedical applications for healthThe DeepHealth concept - application scenarios The DeepHealth concept (depicted in the Figure) focuses on scenarios where image processing is needed for diagnosis. The training environment represents where IT expert users work with datasets of images for training predictive models. The production environment is where the medical personnel ingests an image coming from a scan into a software platform or biomedical application that uses predictive models to get clues that can help them to make decisions during diagnosis. Doctorshave the knowledge to label images, define objectives and provide related metadata. IT staff are in charge of pro- cessing the labelled images, organise the datasets, perform image transfor- mations when required, train the pre- dictive models and load them in the software platform. The DeepHealth toolkit will allow the IT staff to train models and run the training algo- rithms over hybrid HPC + big data architectures without a profound knowledge of deep learning, HPC or big data and increase their productiv- ity reducing the required time to do it. This process is transparent to doctors; they just provide images to the system and get predictions such as indicators,biomarkers or the segmentation of animage for identifying tissues, bones, nerves, blood vessels, etc. 14 pilots and seven platforms to validate the DeepHealth proposed innovations The DeepHealth innovations will be validated in 14 pilot test-beds through the use of seven different biomedical and AI software platforms provided by partners. The use cases cover three main areas: (i) Neurological diseases, (ii) Tumour detection and early cancer prediction and (iii) Digital pathology and automated image annotation. The pilots will allow evaluating the performance of the proposed solutions in terms of the time needed for pre-processing images, the time needed to train models and the time to put models in production. In some cases, it is expected to reduce these times from days or weeks to just hours. Advances made so far and upcoming news and results DeepHealth started on January 1st,2019 and during the first few months,relevant advances have been made mainly on fine-tuning the 14 use-cases and the specifications and require- ments of the platforms supporting them and on defining the libraries' APIs and the infrastructure requirements. Also important is the definition of ethical and data privacy requirements to deal with medical data. Please, follow us closely since in the upcoming months, it is expected the first public release of the EDDLL and ECVL. This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 825111, DeepHealth Project.

We know that the Unit sets out to push forward the development of a competitive industry in robotics and articial intelligence (AI) throughout Europe. Certainly,this includes industrial and service robots plus the growing eld of autonomous systems from drones anddriverless vehicles to computing and cognitive vision. Also, the Unit encourages the wide uptake and best use of robotics and AI in all societal and industrial elds. The Unit takes responsibility for the European Commission's participation in the contractual PPP on Robotics and for the implementation and development of the relevant strategic industrial agenda. As well as managing RD&I projects within Horizon 2020, the UNIT keeps up-to-date with legal and ethical issues in the eld of robots and autonomous systems, for example, aspects related to the impact of automation and robotics on jobs and work environment, as well as liability and safety. Currently, Juha Heikkil\u00e4 is Head of Unit at Robotics and Articial Intelligence (Unit A.1) (2). Juha joined the Euro- pean Commission in 1998 and today works in their (3) Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT). This is the department \"responsible to develop a digital single market to generate smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe.\" (4)In July 2019, we nd out that the European Commis- sion launched a call to develop a vibrant European Net- work of AI Excellence Centres. Under the Horizon 2020Work Programme 2018-2020, proposals for this can be submitted up to 13th November 2019. Europe has important potential to lead technological advance- ments in AI, with a strong research infrastructure and world-class community of scientists at their disposal. It is, therefore, crucial that the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me research teams in Europe collaborate to combat signif- icant technological and scientic challenges. The Commission is looking ahead at a long-term eort to unify the European AI community and make the region an AI powerhouse. To achieve this, they believe that two actions are needed: 1. Research and Innovation Action to mobilise the best researchers into networks of excellence centres to reach a critical mass on important AI topics. 2. Coordination and Support Action to enable exchange between the selected projects, as well as other relevant initiatives. These aforementioned actions should create synergies with the industrial sector and, \"foster an ecosystem of R&D resources, expertise and infrastructure (in areas such as HPC, robotics equipment, IoT infrastructure).\" (5) In other news, a signicant piece of robotics news from the European Commission came in late 2018 when they awarded \u20ac66,000,000 to robotics projects that will help digitise companies throughout the European Union (EU). As part of the Digitising European Industry Call of Horizon 2020, the EU's research and innovation programme, one coordination support action and fourHere, we focus on robotics and artificial intelligence, two areas that come under the European Commission's wider Digital Single Market policyICT 421projects have been awarded. We read more about this on the European Commission's website. \"They will all help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) adopt new technologies in the robotics and articial intelligence area. Nearly half of the money dedicated to these Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) proj- ects will be dispatched to local companies by involvingthem in mini-projects or experiments.\" The four awarded projects are: 1. DIH^2 :A network of 26 DIHs to reach no less than 170 DIHs. 2. DIH-HERO :A broad pan-European network of DIHs specialising in healthcare robotics will be established. 3. TRINITY :The aim here is to create a network of multidisciplinary DIHs consisting of research centres, university groups companies that cover a wide array of topics. 4. RIMA :This sets out to establish a network of 13 DIHs on robotics to facilitate the uptake of maintenance and inspection and maintenance technologies. (6)The topics briefly discussed are just a few examples of the excellent work of the Robotics and Articial Intelli- gence (Unit A.1) within the European Commission and we look forward to future developments in this most exciting area of work. It's a really important aspect of the Digital Single Market but it's not the only part of it.

However, SMEs face difficulty in over- coming the infamous \"Valley-of-Death\",which \"traps\" innovations from being transferred to the market. ESMERA pro- vides the means for innovative SMEs to implement and prove new technology that addresses real-life problems and, thus, already have a market. The European Commission has been supporting the industrial uptake of KETs in Europe. Key Enabling Technol- ogy -hereafter \"KETs\"- are the technol- ogy that enables process, goods and service innovation throughout theeconomy. In terms of robotics, suchtechnology involves but are not limited to: novel robotic structures, mobile robots, manipulators, sensing technol- ogy, gripping and actuation mecha- nisms, navigation and control software, perception, among many other areas. Also, Europe is home to plenty of inno- vative SMEs, capable of producing and delivering highly innovative solutions for the industry. However, SMEs face difficulty in overcoming the infamous \"Valley-of-Death\", which \"traps\" key enabling technology (KET) products and services from being transferred into the marketplace. Within the European Commission's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, the project ESMERA aims to boost robotics innovation for Euro- pean SMEs. ESMERA aims to embraceand support SMEs that are oriented towards the development of novel technology and require both technical and business support to accelerate the transfer of their ideas to market. In the scope of ESMERA, key European companies defined real-life industrial challenges, that is specific problems that seek innovative solutions in man- ufacturing, construction, energy and agri-food. SMEs are developing robotic technology to provide solutions for these challenges. Thereby, SMEs get a chance to implement, apply and prove new technology that addresses real-life problems and, thus, already have a market. On this basis, ESMERA aims to support SMEs in the realisation, testing and promotion of robotic technology through: Providing industrial challenges defined by key European Union (EU) companies, stimulating SMEs to flourish by developing and promoting new technology to address real-lifeproblems that already have a market. Engaging several competence cen- tres that can provide an accessible environment for developing, evaluat- ing, testing and demonstrating novel robotic technology. Offering direct financial support through a cascade funding mecha- nism to supplement the technical excellence offered by the competencecentres, allowing prototype/product creation and promotion. Offering mentoring and support in developing business cases and man- aging the complete chain from \"idea to market product\" by EU champions in robotics that have successfully undergone the process. Involving industrial associations and networks that can directly promote the developed solutions to their members, therefore, addressing a wide range of industrial sectors and applications. The project relies on the execution of a number of cross-border technical 422PROFILE Dr Sotiris Makris, from the Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems & Automation, explains how innovative SMEs can implement and prove new technology, including robotics, that addresses real-life problemsEuropean SMEs robotics applications Dr Sotiris Makrismini-projects, which have been defined as so-called \"experiments\" involving SMEs, industrial end-users and facilitators. The single experi- ments are heading on the path towards developing and realising robotics solutions. Based on that, SMEs have the opportunity to pro- duce tangible results by applying high tech in practical industrial applica- tions. These results can be validated and communicated and appropriate plans to exploit these can be set in motion. ESMERA is offering expertise by the so-called Facilitators , who lead the mentoring of research experiments and eventually support the concrete commercialisation plans through engaging with distribution partners, investors and working with first users in the industry. In addition, the results of this first industrial application will be the basis to enable the continuous development of research experiments (after the end of the experiment). By closely monitoring the evolution of the experiments, the Facilitators actively support SMEs and aim to help them develop their strategy to maximise and exploit the potential of each experiment. The experiments being currently supported by ESMERA are covering a broad range of application areas. Some examples of experiments beingfunded are listed below and follow the above-mentioned process: AutoTAP deals with Automated Taping of Wire Harnesses and addresses the current manual approach used by companies to assemble wire harnesses with insulating taping. WIRECOBOTS deals with Wire har- ness assembly using collaborative robots to increase efficiency and ergonomics aims to provide a robotic solution to the ESMERA-M.1 challenge: wire harness assembly task.eQUALS deals with a Quality Check System for automotive paint shop, aims to advance the quality control in manufacturing paint shops using robotics technology.

MANDEYE focus is on localisation/ navigation/perception/collision avoid- ance system for mobile robots working in harsh environments. ESMERA is a four-year project funded by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 research initiative. The consortium is coordinated by the Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems & Automation, University of Patras (LMS). The project consortium involves several research institutes, namely the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), IK4 TEKNIKER, Technical University of Munich (TUM) and three industrial companies: R U Robots, Blue OceanRobotics (BOR) and COMAU. ESMERA distributes to SMEs financial support of 4,4 M\u20ac in the form of open calls. The second open call of ESMERA is currently open and SMEs are invited to submit their applications to receive funding on developing advanced robotics technology. More information is available on the project website . Dr Sotiris Makris Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems & Automation (LMS) Department of Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics University of entered a new exciting era. For the first time, robots are facing the challenge to work in close interaction with humans in everyday life activities. This new field, called Interactive Robotics, is receiving particular attention in the research community, with an increas- ing number of projects and initiatives. Most of the current research & development efforts are focused on improving robots' abilities, e.g. stabil- ity, robustness, and safety in out-of- the-lab environments. To allow these new machines to be perceived as a real value by the society and survive in this rapidly evolving technological landscape, one question is yet to be answered: \"To what extent can robots meet real users' needs?\". Without a concrete and quantitative answer to this question, the entire robotics innovation chain is put into danger. Benchmarking can, therefore, be the key solution. What is benchmarking? Benchmarking is the process of comparing different systems by using a common standard or point of refer- ence. Benchmarking aims to generate quantitative and clear performance scores that help costumers quickly identify which products better fit their needs. Benchmarks can be eventually translated into international stan- dards, to drive policymakers in ensur- ing a smooth and safe introduction of novel technologies into existingmarket domains. Benchmark- ing can be also of great help to scientists and technical developers, establishing clear technical targets to demon- strate a certain readiness level of the technology. Benchmarks are well estab- lished in many markets and scientific domains, e.g. mobile phone technology, electrical appliances, automobile and internet connections. Unfortunately, when it comes to robotics, these aspects have been largely overlooked. With the advent of Interactive Robots, which are going out of the classic industrial environment entering the consumer market at an exponential pace, the need for benchmarks and standards is now evident. Neverthe- less, a generalised, well-accepted and comprehensive benchmarking methodology does not exist yet. The EUROBENCH and GET2EXCEL projects aim to fill this gap. The EUROBENCH project The H2020 Project EUROBENCH is creating the first framework for thebenchmarking of Interactive Robots worldwide. The project is currentlyfocusing on bipedal robotics technolo- gies, i.e. wearable robots (exoskele- tons and prostheses) and humanoid robots, aiming to expand towards a wide range of robotic technologies. The EUROBENCH Consortium, withthe help of 17 Consortia funded bythe first EUROBENCH Open Call (FSTP-1, now closed), is currently developing the three main pillars of the benchmarking framework: Two testing facilities. EUROBENCH is creating two testing facilities (one for wearable robots and one for humanoids) equipped with state-of- the-art testbeds, which replicate the main conditions encountered byhumans in daily life locomotion, such as slopes, stairs, obstacles, unstable terrains, as well as external distur- bances, e.g. pushes. These testbeds will allow testing the performance ofthe robotic machines in typical human-like environments. One Benchmarking Software. The project will release a Benchmarking Software suite to allow any researchers, developers or users worldwide to repli- cate the testing experiments in their own laboratory settings and automati- cally calculate relevant indicators on robot performance.The H2020 Project EUROBENCH and GET2EXCEL are creating the first benchmarking and standardisation framework for robotics innovation worldwide, much more of which we find out about hereBenchmarking: The keystone of robotics innovation 424PROFILE One unified database. EUROBENCH will gather and organise all the data recorded by the EUROBENCH users into a unified database. This data, com- bined with AI techniques, will produce efficient comparison algorithms and reliable predictors to allow users toidentify the best match between their needs and available technologies. With the community, for the community: the GET2EXCEL Center of Excellence The ultimate goal of EUROBENCH is creating a sustainable \"benchmarking infrastructure\" and to make it available to the general public, as well as the research and industrial community worldwide. For this reason, we are now creating a portfolio of services for future users of the framework. To involve scientific and industrial experts in validating and improving these services, we will allow third parties to become beta testers of the EUROBENCH framework, at zero costs. Through the Second competitive Open Call (FSTP-2, open from June-August 2020), we will offer financial and technical support to a selected number of participants to exploit the EUROBENCH tools (facilities, software and datasets) to test their robotictechnologies, either commercial or prototypal. All the testing experiments will be developed in total respect of confidentiality and industrial secret requirements of participants. This is not all. EUROBENCH is at the core of a new initiative, the GET2EXCEL Center of Excellence (CoE), a global network including all relevant stake-holders and organised in five cluster areas: North America Cluster, Europe Cluster, Asia Cluster, Pacific Clusterand South and Central America Clus- ter. Each of the cluster areas is coordi- nated around physical sectoral Hubs, where testing, benchmarking and R&D infrastructure are available. Therefore, the EUROBENCH reach has been broadened through this CoE for global leadership, including collaborations with several international standard organisations (e.g. ISO, ASTM) to boost the process of converting the current and future benchmarking procedures and methodologies into acceptedstandards for the evaluation of the dif-ferent facets of robotic performance. This will facilitate the efficient intro- duction of these new technologies into the different domains, e.g. healthcare, manufacturing, logistic, consumer, each of them characterised by theneeds, requirements and regulations of diverse users and applications. In conclusion, EUROBENCH and GET2EXCEL are working hard to pre- pare the Society to improve and accel- erate the introduction of Interactive Robotics in people's lives, by means of new tools that will help: 1) Developers to identify the key technological fac- tors to improve current robot abilities; 2) End-users to identify whether a specific robot can meet a real user's need' 3) Researchers to \"stand on giants' shoulders\", replicating scientific experiments across laboratories and robotic platforms, achieving true com- parison of results and 4) stakeholders,to be fully involved in (and able to influence) the standardisation process worldwide. Both initiatives are now welcoming new participants. Be part of it!

Digital technology underpins almost every aspect of modern living across work, travel, leisure and health and digital infrastruc- ture is now as important to our economy and society as traditional infrastructure and utility services. However, most of the UK's internet has been powered by copper wiring. It is no longer t for purpose and hopelessly out of date for the requirements of the Third Industrial Revolution. The deployment of telecoms networks and infrastruc- ture is, therefore, essential to ensure that everything and everyone can connect - but access to the digital world does not happen uniformly. Over the last veyears, close to \u00a31.7 billion has been spent on reaching 95% of homes and businesses in the UK with superfast speeds of 24 Megabits per second (24Mbps). Yet thegap remains between the communities that have access to this technology and those that do not. More work is required to close this digital divide. The step towards world-class connectivity for all, coupled with making it easier and cheaper to deploy mobile infrastructure, requires the fostering of next-generation Gigabit (1000Mbps+) capable full-bre infrastructure. ADEPT's Digital Connectivity Working Group was estab- lished with the Local Government Association in 2018 to explore digital connectivity, focusing on: the number of new-build homes being built that are not bre-enabled; the disparity in mobile coverage; and how to drive the deployment of a world-class digital infrastructure. As a result of this group, ADEPT published its policy position on Digital Connectivity in June 2019. The policy sets out the importance of having a full-bre network, with 5G linked to this and contains seven asks of government, Ofcom and the industry. These include issues around coverage, quality, competition, new builds, delivery impact, local industrial strategies and inclusive connectivity. Ultimately, ADEPT wants to see digital connectivity enshrined in local industrial strategies and local development plans so that it is prioritised in the same way as other utilities. One critical area outlined in the policy position isaround new builds and infrastructure capability. Whilst Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) coverage is improving, anatural time lag between various policy changes and their implementation exists. Most of the major homebuilders have entered into partnerships with network operators to better facilitate the roll-out of full-bre and slower hybrid bre-based technologies. A 2016 EU directive, which was adopted into UK law, means all newly constructed buildings are equipped with infrastructure capable ofdelivering high-speed broadband. However, it is still left up to the developers and Internet Service Providers to decide whether to deploy an actual working service. Although more new homes have superfast and/or full-bre availability, we are still a long way from seeing united support for superfast in new build premises. Recently, the government identied that approximately 10% of UK premises, largely in rural and remote areas,In June 2019, the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport published its key policy position on how to deliver digital connectivity across the country post Brexit. The new Chair of ADEPT's Digital Connectivity Working Group, Nicola McCoy-Brown, talks about delivering digital connectivity across the countryICT 427would be unlikely to receive gigabit-capable connec- tions commercially by 2033. To address this, the Rural Gigabit Connectivity programme was launched, whichuses an 'Outside In' approach to ensure rural areas arenot disadvantaged. This approach targets the rural and remote areas rst and should see the identied 10% of premises reached at the same time as the commer-cial roll-out happens across the UK. The decision to tackle some of the hardest to reach places rst is a signicant shift in government policy and will be instrumental in delivering the ambitious plans for a nationwide full-bre broadband network by 2033. In addition, the government has pledged full- bre broadband coverage by 2025, which equates to moving the goalposts forward by eight years. Neither deadline, however, is backed by actual plans. ADEPT's policy position also calls on the sector to work together to deliver access to fast and reliable broad- band and mobile coverage across the country, to unlock the economic benets of digital technology. We know that collaboration is key to delivering digital con- nectivity - we need to ensure that dialogue is open, transparent, that information is robust and reliable and that we share it eectively. ADEPT recognises there are unique challenges for local authorities too. When councils became involved in the technology industry, many local authorities were notequipped to respond eectively, with skills gaps insome areas. Although we now have a talented bank of people, moving into the mobile networking industry may present similar challenges. ADEPT needs to be ambitious in its remit around digital connectivity. We have a unique opportunity, given our links to both government and private sector corporate partners. Local authorities have an integral role as influencers, purchasers and decision-makers where inclusivity and diversity need to be embedded in all the services we design and commission. When it comes to rolling-out full-bre, this means removing barriers and creating opportunity for all segments of the population. We need to challenge the denition of 'value for money' and instead target some of our remotest communities and those excluded due to the cost of delivery. The UK is playing a serious game of catch up. Less than 10% of the nation currently has a full-bre connection, which is miniscule when compared to Spain which has more than 33.3 million access points, covering more than 75% of the population. It is for this reason that ADEPT also wants to see more incentives, as well as requirements for mobile network operators (MNOs) to provide better, aordable services for rural areas. There must be more certainty and powers to ensurethat coverage and compliance are assured by Ofcom. Only through these measures will we achieve world-class connectivity for all.

Pake shared his prediction for the future office. He cer- tainly predicted some of it accurately,saying that: \"everyone will have a TV-display terminal with a keyboard at their desk\" with the ability to: call up documents from my files on the screen, or by pressing a button... I can get my mail or any messages.\" George also said: \"I don't know how much hard copy [printed paper] I'll want in this world.\" And for that, he is almost right. For those who are unfamiliar with the 'paperless office' idea, or 'paper-free' office, it is the concept of a working environment in which the use of paper is eliminated. This is done via digitisation; converting documents and other documents into digital form and recycling the tangible items. Let's move towards becoming 'paper-light' instead of 'paperless' Currently, 65% of people of all ages say they print \"very frequently\", defined as every day or three to four times a week (IDC Office Printing Survey, 2017). With figures this high, it makes the concept of an entirely 'paperless' office a broken dream. Now is the time where the conversa-tion has the opportunity to change. Rather than being paper-free, offices can aim to achieve to be 'paper-light'and do paperwork accordingly for each establishment, with digitisation processes to support. Paper and local government Every part of the public sector requires paper to be processed effectively and in line with compliance regulations, to allow the secure delivery of services provided. The regulations, client demands and data security issues can be confronted to make the capturing and processing of documents into information systems crucial for local government establishments; especially for those staff members working directly with the public in a customer- facing role. Paper is often piled up on desks, in drawers, or tucked away in filing cabinets. With paper spread across so many different places, it is difficult to both track and record the information it holds. The public sector is under pressure to capture and retrieve data from documents and make decisions rapidly based on insight from all data available. To better serve the public, the new reality is to make paperwork effectively, not merely becoming paperless. Being able to scan documents mas- sively reduces the time spent doing manual input and also immediately delivers the captured data for decision making.Digital transformation There is pressure on the public sector to undergo a 'digital transformation' and now, with the advent of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), there are further pressures on staff to ensure public information is stored securely. \"It is unlikely that a genuine \"paperless\" office is achievable, for the foreseeable future, but with affordable automation solutions and the changing nature of our relationship with paper, the tools are certainly in place to make progress in becoming paper-light and making paperwork better for local government offices.\" Often this feels like another mountain to climb, but for local government establishments, the opportunity to automate processes using digital tech- nology is available offering significant benefits. For many sectors, document capture is the first step towards digital transformation, allowing data to be freed from its paper prison, to support better planning and decisions. Physical storage costs can be reduced by scanning archived documents and storing them in a secure cloud-based system. The digitised documents can be archived in a safe, easily accessible way, reducing the costs of both needing to store the originals on-site and physically retrieve them. Is the future paperless for local government offices? No - and we shouldn't force them to be, says Robyn Boyd on behalf of PFU (EMEA) Limited - a Fujitsu companyIs the future paperless for local government offices? 428PROFILEA growing demand is a rise in working from home or flexible working. It enables collaboration, even when not face-to-face. An example where this is already happening is within the healthcare industry, where patient records can be simultaneously accessed amongst teams of medical professionals. When hardware and software collide, to help make paper work At PFU, our product portfolio of hard- ware is split into two: ScanSnap and Fujitsu Imaging Scanners. ScanSnap is designed for personal productivity and when it comes to software for the machines, we offer ScanSnap Cloud with our ScanSnap products. It can classify and sort your paper and sends it to the right cloud space. Doc- uments, receipts, business cards and photos are delivered directly to the cloud service you use. ScanSnap Cloud is not a cloud storage system in itself, but instead, it complements those services. It's an intuitive cloud- based image processor and enhance- ment tool paired with the intelligence to classify scanned input into fouressential types of content; as either document, photo, business card or receipt. This means departments can share documents easily and informa- tion shared is not constrained by the brick walls of an office building. For our Fujitsu Imaging Scanners, we have the PaperStream software. By combining market-leading Fujitsu fi Series document scanners with our PaperStream software, you can trans- form time-consuming and error-prone manual paper-handling into super- fast, error-free, high-quality document digitisation that significantly increases your efficiency and productivity. Organisations have been using scan- ners for many years and multipleindustries rely heavily on scanners to turn paperwork into digital formats that can be saved and shared. How-ever, until recently, they have built on a very manual approach in terms of how they classify and manage cap- tured data. That's where our Fujitsu fi-7300NX model and our partner,Lemmana, Machine Learning-sup-ported content services software have changed the way businesses canwork. Making it possible at the touch of a button, to scan, automatically extract, classify and use data to deliver a more agile way of working. Plus, because it can learn, this new generation scanner can recognise previous data, for example, patient or customer details and then file similarinformation away in the same place, saving time and eradicating any human error. It is unlikely that a genuine \"paperless\" office is achievable, for the foreseeable future, but with affordable automation solutions and the changing nature of our relationship with paper, the tools are certainly in place to make progress in becoming paper-light and making paperwork better for local government offices.

Miss Robyn Boyd PR & Social Media Executive PFU (EMEA) Limited to new opportunities for cyber-stalking. Cyber-stalking is a form of cyber-crime that takes place online when a person uses technology to harass or threaten another person or business. Cyber-stalking includes trolling, which is essentially a group or an individual harassing others online. Sometimes this can be for entertainment and sometimes this can be very intimidating. The internet and social media make this possible. They create a breeding ground for would-be stalkers and allow individuals, who could be anywhere in the world, to mask their identity by using fake proles in order to attack their victim at any time, with little possibility of being caught or identied. For the attacker, there might be a sense of righteousness in pursuing a course of conduct that would amount to harassment. For the victim, it can become anything from a small nuisance to a huge nancial burden. For exam- ple, an attacker may go beyond sending multiple critical messages about the victim, to sending messages that are defamatory and/or threatening of violence. Attackers may also exploit the vulnerabilities of their victim to blackmail them - for instance, if the attacker were to gain access to their victim's online accounts or proles. We are now in a globally connected world, where much of our social life is public and on social media. This means that for an attacker, it is easy to spy on a person's activities via social networking. It is, perhaps,Ernest Aduwa, Solicitor at specialist criminal defence and civil litigation firm Stokoe Partnership Solicitors, charts the rise of cyber-stalking ICT The rise of cyber-stalkingICT 431impossible for anyone to truly inoculate themselves from becoming a victim of cyber-stalking unless one isto completely 'log o' from the internet entirely. There are ways to minimise the risk and aect cyber-stalking has, which include: Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to protect your personal data and online browsing habits. Make all social media accounts private and only accept invitations to connect from people known. Use long passwords, with symbols, letters and numbers. Regularly change your passwords and neveruse the same one for dierent accounts. Never share your location on social media. Be awarethat when you upload pictures you can inadvertently share your location. \"We are now in a globally connected world, where much of our social life is public and on social media.

It is, perhaps, impossible for anyone to truly inoculate themselves from being a victim of cyber-stalking unless one is to completely 'log off' from the internet entirely.\" If you are a victim of cyber-stalking, you should try to gather as much evidence as possible, documenting all contact. It is also important to report any cyber-stalking immediately after becoming aware of the situation so that, where possible, techniques can be used to trace the suspects before data is lost. In the United Kingdom, the Protection from HarassmentAct 1997 contains an oence of stalking covering cyber-stalking, which was introduced into the act through theProtection of Freedoms Act 2012. Depending on the act committed, a person may also be committing oences, contrary to other UK laws such as the Oences Againstthe Person Act 1861, such as threats to kill; the Sexual Oences Act 2003, such as sending indecent images; and the Malicious Communications Act 1988, such as sending grossly oensive communications. In the UK, oences under these Acts are treated very seriously and could result in immediate prison sentences imposed upon a person convicted of such an oence.

Cybercrime,illegal content and harmful activities don't have to threaten our national security or the physical safety of ourchildren. Information and communications technologies (ICTs) enable world citizens to instantly access digital sys- tems that have the potential to create better standards of living, improve health, save lives, educate, entertainand inspire. For the three billion of us who have access to the Internet, very few of us could imagine living produc- tive lives without Internet connectivity. And many of us live, eat and breathe access to online systems that define careers, family life and for many, our very identity. The world, with its circumference ofover forty thousand kilometres, hasshrunk to the size of our hand-held devices and we are able to go anywhere, see anyone and do any-thing at the touch of a screen. And therein lies not just the bright future of our children but also the concernfor their safety and well-being. The vast potential the Internet holds for billions of people across the world is balanced by the responsibility to use this tool in the most effective and responsible manner possible, espe- cially when safeguarding the world's children. \"As we are at the midpoint of connecting the entire world, it's time to consider how we are doing at reducing cybercrime and child exploitation.\" Against that backdrop, responsible digital skills and enhanced cyber wellness are increasingly important inMarsali Hancock from EP3 Foundation underlines that we don't have to turn a blind eye concerning cybercrime, illegal content and harmful activities onlineCybercrime, illegal content online: We don't have to turn a blind eye 432PROFILEa civil society. Information super - highways bring more than just conve- nience. Studies suggest that a 10% increase in internet penetration is correlated with a 1.35% increase in GDP for developing countries GDP. However, the superhighways also bring cybercrime, exploitation and radicalisation. The list of risks could be considered overwhelming. Online predators and cyber-stalkers pursue and prey on children. Impressionable youth are the victims of bullying, cyber-attacks and fraud. Terrorist cells have discov- ered that the internet can promote their activities and methodologies and also act as an effective recruitment tool among the younger generation. Sexual violence and other harmful products and problematic behaviours are exacerbated by their almost effortless accessibility. Additionally, intellectual property theft and identity theft have repercussions that could harm a person for decades. As we are at the midpoint of connecting the entire world, it's time to consider how we are doing at reducing cyber- crime and child exploitation. New tools and privacy-protecting data practices are, therefore, required. When first connected, children need protection. Digital skills, alone, cannotsubstantially reduce the risks fromchildren's access to harmful content or being targeted and groomed for sexual exploitation and radicalisation.New data paradigms are required to shield them and protect them from their own youthful experiences and indiscretions, including self-generatedcontent. To thrive, they must under- stand this new environment, but we also need to implement ways to protect them. We cannot completely control what they consume online, but we can protect who sees their actions online. Every action they take is tracked online, whether it's because of cook- ies, web beacons, or e-tags. Offline, teens have their movements tracked by new sensors in devices, loyalty programmes or discount codes. Eachaction carries a code that enables companies to track and sell that data and since it is connected to the child, their actions can be revealed to malicious entities, such as hackers. It is vital to establish new systems to protect our children and ensure the internet serves as a driver for innova- tion, scientific research, economic growth and social development. How we manage the internet and the deployment of the Internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies (DLT) will deter- mine whether our society is able to move toward an internet that benefits all people around the world. What better way to do this than to hide the identity of the child and only send out relevant data to companies rather than every action the child has taken? Rather than tracking everything the child does online, EP3 Trusted Data Networks break down the data to the attribute level, keeping the informa- tion, but hiding the identity of the child. This still gives organisationsaccess to important data that could track societal trends but never reveals the child's identity. The only way for the child's identity to be revealed is for a trusted identity to directly ask the child to reveal it. Once they have this layer of protection, guardians and parents can then support and protect their child from risks they can manage, such as cyberbullying. There are many risks associated with going online, but we can take steps to protect our children from malicious entities. It may be a challenge, but we can do something to protect our children online. After all, \"the power of the Internet hinges on users' willing- ness to trust it\" and in the end, use it for the benefit of all. (1) (1) See Supra.

Marsali Hancock EP3 Foundation Tel: +1 4088 007 202 marsalih@gmail.comF O U N D A T I O N 433PROFILE434Since 2004, the European Union Agency for Cyber- security (ENISA) has worked to make Europe cyber secure. Going into a bit more detail, we know that ENISA actively contributes to European cybersecurity policy, in that it supports the Member States and European Union (EU) stakeholders to respond to large-scale cyber incidents across borders. This work is a vital part of the correct functioning of the Digital Single Market. ENISA works closely with the Member States, as well as the private sector to deliver solutions, advice and aim to improve their capabilities. Amongst other things, this support includes: Pan-European cybersecurity exercises; The evaluation and development and of national cybersecurity strategies and;Studies on smart infrastructures and the Internet of Things (IoT), privacy-enhancing technologies and privacy on emerging technologies, addressing data protection issues, eIDs and trust services and identi-fying the cyber threat landscape. (1) In terms of the organisation's leadership, we know that Prof Dr Udo Helmbrecht became ENISA's Executive Director back in October 2009. He was appointed tothe role after making a statement to the European Par- liament and replying to MEPs' questions during April 2009. In September 2014, ENISA's Management Board extended the Director's term of oce for ve years and, of course, that recently came to an end. During his 10 years at ENISA, Prof Helmbrecht was assisted by an Advisory Group and ad hoc Working Groups on technical and scientic matters. (2)In his CV, we nd out how his leadership clearly benetted the excellent work of ENISA. Here, we find out some of the ways how the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity works to improve cybersecurity in EuropeENISA: Working to in EuropeICT 435\"Under Helmbrecht's leadership, ENISA has consoli- dated its role as a centre of network and information security expertise, and continued its work to facilitate cooperation in network and information security across Europe.\" (3) Of course, the vital work continues with Mr Juhan Lepassaar, who was appointed Executive Director of the Agency. On 16th July 2019, the Management Board of ENISA selected him as Prof Helmbrecht's replacement.(4) In more recent news, we learn that ENISA and the European Security and Defence College (ESDC) hostedand organised training dedicated to information security risk management (ISRM). 27 seasoned professionals from nine Members States and four EU institutions had their cybersecurity knowledge reinforced over two days. Such an event isa fantastic opportunity to exchange good practices andexperiences and, of course, to hone their cybersecurity and risk management skills. Those taking part can, therefore, transfer what they have learnt back to their respective organisations which can only be ofenormous benet. (5) \"Under Helmbrecht's leadership, ENISA has consolidated its role as a centre of network and information security expertise, and continued its work to facilitate cooperation in network and information security across Europe.\" A signicant piece of ENISA news from early September 2019, when a report was published to direct incident response teams who must facilitate information exchange among teams and improve reaction time to security incidents. The press release gives us a valuable insight into the vital work of incident response teams in sharing threat and incident information. \"As of June 2019 there are more than 414 incident response teams in Europe. These teams work together to respond to cyber-attacks and need to use secureand reliable communication channels to share threatand incident information while protecting European citizens and businesses. These incident responseteams are often organised in communities such as CSIRTs Network, TF-CSIRT, FIRST and other regional, sub regional or sectorial communities and they contin- uously communicate and exchange information. Typical information exchanged among teams include threat intelligence, indicators of compromise (IoCs), malware samples and details about relevant incidents.\" In closing, I would like to say that the above examples illustrate really well ENISA's work since 2005 in supporting Member States and Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) communities in Europe to build and advance their incident response capabilitiesby means such as onsite and online training, hand- books and dedicated projects. A key part of ENISA's work concerns setting up, developing or running or capabilities of CSIRT's. Let's nish with the words of the ENISA: \"The goal is to dene minimum common base- line practices across the EU to improve operationalcooperation, preparedness and information exchange for the next generation of cyber-attacks.\" (6) References 1. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa 2. Government editorial@openaccessgovernment.org www.openaccessgovernment.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovConnected devices are entering our homes, our lives and ever more intimate spaces, collect- ing data about incredibly private moments and we are asked to trust these opaque systems with the data they collect. Their usefulness is some- times questionable and sometimes undeniable, but the crucial question is: Who is responsible for the behaviour of these devices? Google's infamous \"Don't be evil\" motto seems to give a simple answer to this ques- tion - if technology developers are not working with explicitly evil intent theneverything should be alright. Yet today's realities caution against such unbridled optimism. The VIRT-EU pro- ject addresses this problem by creat- ing tools that can help technology developers to bring ethics into theirconversations and decision-making. Technology developers face systemic challenges of balancing personal data management with mounting privacy concerns in an increasingly complex regulatory environment especially in the area of the Internet of Things (IoT). Connected technologies render prob- lems of data sharing and responsibility more acute as features and risks are'designed into' devices and services that are entering our lives and homes in ever more intimate ways. There isno playbook, no rules of conduct andIoT developers are essentially charged with making moral choices about how the technologies, some of which have become indispensable to our lives, ought to behave. Many developers are concerned about the tools and ser- vices they are building but have little practice or training for dealing with ethical questions they encounter in the process. Worse, where ethical issues become visible, it can be diffi- cult to explain the problematic nature of particular design requirements or client requests and to push against demands for more invasive features and capabilities. The VIRT-EU project steps into this gap arguing that if we want a better digital future, we best consider how to help the people that are building it for us. The VIRT-EU project VIRT-EU is a three-year project (run- ning from January 2016-December 2019) funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 and led by Professor Irina Shklovski (Coordinator) from the IT University of Copenhagen. The pro- ject consortium includes three other higher education institutions: London School of Economics and Political Sci- ence led by Dr Alison Powell, UppsalaUniversity led by Dr Matteo Magnani and Politechnico di Torino led by Professor Alessandro Mantelero; one SME: Copenhagen Institute of Interac-tion Design led by Annelie Berner and one non-profit organisation: Open Rights Group led by Javier Ruiz. VIRT-EU sets the groundwork for a more ethical European ICT innovation environment by employing state-of- the-art multidisciplinary empirical research in combination with legal scholarship and design research. We aim to develop a VIRT-EU toolbox rooted in a practical approach to ethics through a blending of key ethical approaches, design methods and broad stakeholder engagement to identify how to connect such tools to everyday practices of developers and innovators as they are building new technologies. What do we mean by ethics? In general terms, ethics concern the frameworks and principles that defineand shape our ability to lead a life in accordance with our values and to actaccording to our rights, obligations and responsibilities. Ethical frame- works have a similar role in technol- ogy, guiding decision-making in theprocess of design and development. It is not always about what decision has been made but how it has come to be made. Ethical reasoning requires reflection, discussion, deliberation. It might slow the process down - we might not always be able to \"move fastIrina Shklovski, Associate Professor at the IT University of Copenhagen, explains meeting the ethical challenges of connected technologies in today's world and how the VIRT-EU project helps to address this concern and move us towards a better digital future 436PROFILE A better digital future: Meeting the ethical challenges of connected technologiesand break things\" but perhaps that is exactly what we need - to slow down and think things through. VIRT-EU con- ceptualises ethics as values in action taken in contexts - within power relationships and constraints. For us, ethics is a process that must include the acknowledgement of responsibili- ties for power. After all, technology design is a position of power to shape the way we think, the way we live and,ultimately, our future. We studied how developers, smallenterprises and individual designers in the IoT field discuss and share knowl- edge, how ideas and ethical values develop and travel. From this, we noted that there was a proliferation ofstatements, calls and manifestos for better, more ethical and more respon- sible technologies, which speaks to a broadly shared concern about how technological decisions might play out in the long run. Despite sincerity andpassion, these documents demon- strated a stark failure of imagination in proposing significant alternatives orsolutions (Fritsch, Shklovski, & Dou- glas-Jones, 2018). Across the diversity of start-ups and small companies that we studied, we found that somedevelopers postpone ethical decision- making, while others take it to be their responsibility to face them. Building a start-up is not an easy undertaking. Founders are underenormous pressure in a world full of uncertainties and unknowns. There is little wiggle room for ideals and prin- ciples when the needed trade-offs concern the basic survival of the fledgling businesses which are pushed by their investors to deliver products. VIRT-EU has developed tools to map, consider and deliberate decisions in a structured and supported manner. We aim to support the kinds of arguments developers may need to marshal as they debate the ethical dilemmas they will inevitably encounter. VIRT-EU ethical toolbox Policy efforts such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aim to protect the fundamental rights of European citizens with respect to data processing, making explicit high- level European ethical considerations. Yet, our research shows that without interventions that are relevant and appropriate to the social milieu of technology developers (Ustek-Spilda, Powell and Nemorin, forthcoming) - including impact assessments - such legal provisions risk becoming tick- box exercises. VIRT-EU addresses this problem in the following way. First, we have produced a tool that goes hand in hand with the GDPR providing ameans for a different kind of impact assessment - not only concerned withprivacy but also with social and ethicalimpacts. The Privacy, Ethical andSocial Impact Assessment (PESIA) fitsin with the assessments already famil- iar to both developers and regulators and mandated by the GDPR, but goes beyond compliance by providing a means for broader reflection. Second, we created a suite of stand- alone tools to support ongoing deliber- ation and decision-making throughout technology development, necessary in a field characterised by rapid change. These include immersive explorations of value conflicts, ethical mapping of values, conflicts and compromises that emerge and evolve over time, methods for identifying mismatches betweenvalues and material choices in develop- ment processes. These tools are conceptualised on a foundation of our practical theory of ethics, which inte- grates three different yet complemen- tary ethical traditions and provides an accessible language for those unfamil- iar with social and moral philosophy. This suite of tools will be available at the end of the project for open access download from the project website maintained by the Open Rights Group.

ISSN 2053-9517. Irina Shklovski Associate Professor collected and analysed by law enforcement agencies (LEAs) has become a critical component in legal investigations following a series of major criminal acts and terrorist attacks. On one hand, the amount of video data is continuously increasing with the rapid deployment of video equip- ment, surveillance cameras in public and private areas, body-worn cameras of police forces and smartphones or digital cameras used by bystanders. Indeed, we know that even criminals or terrorists themselves post videos on the Web that they have recorded during their acts. On the other hand, and in spite of this growth, the video investigation work is still mostly carried out manually by the LEA officers. These current practices are too resource-intensive to handle the huge and steadily increasing volume of videos that need to be analysed. Consequently, post-event extraction of vital first clues fromvideos takes a substantial amount of time, causing further delays that no one wants. There is without question an urgent need for efficient tools that can assist the LEAs in their daily video investigationtasks. Tools that can help them process the huge volume of video material with less effort and find clues and evidence faster. The urgency of addressing this need has become particularly clear after the wave of terrorist attacks that have hit several European countries since 2015. The three-year EU-funded project VICTORIA, launched in 2017, is addressing this need. By the end of the project in April 2020, the consortium will deliver an ethical and legally compliant Video Analysis Platform (VAP) prototype that will accelerate the video analysis tasks of LEAs. Developing technologies that meet the real operational needs of LEAs As legal investigation videos are kept confidential by the LEAs, the VICTORIA consortium with its partnered LEAs, selected six operational scenarios, covering the majority of cases encountered by the different LEA units in Europe, with various levels ofimportance, i.e. from police surveil- lance to terrorist attacks. These sce- narios and their variations were then staged and filmed with actors, using alternative light and weather settings and with camera resolution and video quality normally encountered in realconditions. Once filmed, these video datasets helped fine-tuning and test- ing the VAP and the algorithms throughout the project. The VAP integrates a set of robust, accurate and advanced video analytics modules that have been developed, based on the specific needs of legal investigations. Among the topics covered are generic objects analysis, people-centric analysis, audio analysis and vehicles-centric analysis. The modules, accompanied by 4D crime scene reconstruction technology and advanced metadata querying mecha- nisms, integrated into the VICTORIAVideo Analysis Platform enable inves- tigators to easily navigate through a vast amount of video material. This enhances capability in LEAs daily investigation tasks, improving response time for their operations, solving crimes more rapidly and therewith protecting potential newvictims. Indeed, the VAP is offering a unified human-machine interface and is based on big data technologies that are bothscalable and open. Additionally, third parties can integrate their analytics into the VAP with minimal effort, extending the capabilities of the platform even further. VICTORIA stands for VIDEO ANALYSIS FOR INVESTIGATION OF CRIMINAL AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. It is a Horizon 2020 EU Security Project, which is developing robust and accurate video analysis technology to boost the law enforcement agencies' investigative capacityVICTORIA PROJECT: How can video analysis facilitate investigation of criminal and terrorist activities? 438PROFILEHigh-level VICTORIA Platform Concept After more than two years of work and several workshops with project technical partners and LEAs, the VAP is now ready to be deployed at the project LEAs' premises (Spain, United Kingdom, Romania and France). Following the final training workshop of the LEAs, the field trials carrying on from mid-September 2019 to end January 2020, will provide substantial and important feedback on the performance of each technical com- ponent and the usability of the last version of the VAP in real case scenarios. One of the addressed topics will be to evaluate how the daily work of the end-users has been supported by the VICTORIA platform. A roadmap of new developments and improvements needed in the future will be defined to pave the way to a successful contin- uation of the VICTORIA platform developments. Lastly, to encourage even further development and demonstrate howopen and flexible the VAP is and how it has been designed to support analytic tools from third parties with varied features, VICTORIA has launched its Analytics Contest. Audio and video analysis technology developers are invited, starting from 2nd December 2019, to propose and/or integrate their algorithms, to be benchmarked with the VICTORIA video datasets, into the VAP. The main positive societal impact of VICTORIA will be the improved protec- tion of the citizens against crime and terrorist activities, thanks to the enhanced video investigation capability of LEAs, enabling them to set-up targeted operations to stop offenders and provide evidence to support criminal charges. The investigation of an increased volume of video material will potentially contribute not only to convict offenders but also to release wrongly accused people. VICTORIA avoids negative perception from the public, such as the \"Big Brother is watching you\" syndromebecause the project does not target surveillance applications but rather post-event investigations carried out in the context of specific crime and terrorist activities. Therefore, solving more criminal cases and accelerating legal investigations with VICTORIA will reinforce the confidence of citizens in their police forces. An international conference presenting the VAP to LEAs and audio/video analytics developers will take place in Spring 2020.

Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states for people with disabilities to lead a full and independent life they must have equal access to information throughthe Web. This is a fundamental human right, yet here we are in the golden age of the Web and as far as accessibility goes it's in the dark ages, quite literally for someone with severe visually impairment. To quote 1 from Robert Stevens, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Manchester and someone who is blind: \"There are no heroics; there is no winningthrough against adversity. There is, however, getting onwith it. One takes one's opportunities where one can.\" Web accessibility is where technology can play a key role in ensuring those opportunities exist. However, ONS data 2collected in 2019 showed that 22% of disabled adults have never used the Web, compared to 9% in the general population who've never used the Web. It seems reasonable to suppose this is in large part due to unacceptably poor accessibility of Web services, rather than a lack of desire by disabled adults to use the Web. This is a major concern as interaction with healthcareand social services will gradually move to being oered only online in the long-term. Lack of accessibility in websites is a major barrier for disabled adults beingable to have full participation in a digital society. The new government Web Content Accessibility Guide- lines 3(WCAG) for public sector websites and apps that are to be enforced through new regulations are a wel- come and positive move towards improving accessibil- ity. We will need to closely monitor whether these result in a step change in overall website quality in addition to monitoring technical compliance. We also need to work with public service website developers to help them understand the needs of our diverse communi- ties and how best to improve the overall quality of theuser experience and move beyond minimal regulatory compliance that the new regulations will require. In essence, the new government regulations are addressing the issue of ensuring website functionality is accessible. This is essentially a technical remedy to make sure online functionality is accessible to everyone. Functional accessibility is one aspect of wider concerns about ensuring online public services are truly inclusive.In other words, they are necessary but not sucient for our public services to be truly inclusive. \"The new government Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for public sector websites and apps that are to be enforced through new regulations are a welcome and positive move towards improving accessibility. We will need to closely monitor whether these result in a step change in overall website quality in addition to monitoring technical compliance.\" What's also important if we really want to improve real inclusivity, is to have a comprehensive range of online public services that give the maximum help possible to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups to become fully engaged citizens. Providing the most help possible includes ensuring we have absolute trust in the services we access to be fair, to treat us all as valued members of society and be absolutely reliable at all times. We need to think about how Web accessibility is part of the overall accessibility problem within a public service. Consider a recent example of the complexities around providing public services through the Web. Recently theGuardian newspaper reported 4a scam in which crimi- nals obtained social security claimants' personal details, sometimes by posing as Department for Work and Pen- sions (DWP) sta, to make bogus online applications for universal credit. This illustrates how some vulnerableBill Mitchell, Director of Policy - BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT explains why one in five disabled adults never used the Web in 2019441individuals through lack of understanding of complex social security regulations, the risk structures in place in nancial institutions and lack of access to trustworthy independent support can be criminally exploited. Nowimagine that scenario for someone with a disability, trying to understand through an online public service what's gone wrong, how to get help and how to deal with all the agencies that are possibly going to be involved in sorting out the mess, if they even can sort out the mess. The technical regulations being introduced to imple- ment WCAG are absolutely essential as a very basic rst step in ensuring Web access is equal for all, but access doesn't just mean readable fonts or carefullydesigned HTML 5.0 layout. We must all do our part to help build public services that genuinely provide thebest possible service that the 21st century Web can deliver for everyone.

What's hidden in our devices? Deep in our phones, computers, TV's and tablets, is a series of menu items which provide a feature set which makes most items easy to use. If you or someone you know needs specificbackground colours, font size, audio output, or interacts with their device in a specific way such as using a third-party keyboard, there is a good chance they have additional access requirements. In this instance, thefeature set listed under the 'access - ibility' menu of your device is a good place to start. What will you find? You will find a list of options, designed to make using your device easier, and having such tools can only open up a world of possibilities for the end user. Tools which might seem pretty cool to some people, are the same tools that mean the difference between being able to use a device or not for others. As a totally blind person, I use a screen reader, which causes a device to announce what is on screen, which allows me to use my phone, laptop and TV. Screen readers are just one example of an accessibility feature now available on many devices. When talking to people about accessibility and describing some of the features they will have on their devices, the level of surprise because a person didn't know what the additional func- tions did is always interesting. Some of the key features you are likely to find on a wide range of devices today are: Screen reading software. Magnification options. Font and colour adjustment, and hearing aid compatibility as well as Switch control.Knowledge is power You may be reading this article andfeeling confident that you have no need for such features as switch access, which enables users with lim- ited mobility or a cognitive difficulty to use their device. You may not feel the need to change the font, colours or magnification of your device screen;however, being aware of these clever tools may help you in the event that a friend or relative, or even a colleague should need them. Longer life expectancy means that at some point, it's likely that more people will rely on built in accessibility fea- tures, and will need to utilise the vari-ous items I briefly mentioned above. The Disability Living Foundation key facts information page indicates that: In 2016, there were an estimated 308 people of a pensionable age for every 1,000 people of a working age. By 2037, this is projected to increase to 365 people [14] There are now 11.8 million people aged 65 or over in the UK. Thenumber of people aged 65+ is pro- jected to rise by over 40 per cent (40.77%) in the next 17 years to over 16 million. By 2033 the number of people aged 85 and over is projected to more than double again to reach 3.2 million, and to account for 5 per cent of the total population [15]Mike Taylor, Senior Accessibility Analyst and Comms and Training from Digital Accessibility Centre, highlights what hidden features can be found in our digital devices in order to promote accessibility Digital accessibility: What's hidden in our devices? 442PROFILE1.6 million people are aged 85 or over. The number of people over 85 in the UK is predicted to more than double in the next 23 years to over 3.4 million. [16] Taken from The Disabil- ity Living Foundation Key Facts page: https://www.dlf.org.uk/content/key-facts Some tips about using your device with built in accessibility features Once an accessibility feature is set up for use, its generally a case of set and forget. The only way this might change is by additional customisationfrom the user of the device, or having a handset or software update. It is possible to set up short cuts to access various accessibility features, so it may be worth doing some research, asking a friend or relative, or the company you are buying the device from about which accessibility options are available. Many manufacturers of mobile, tablet, or computers offer cloud storage facil- ities, it's worth remembering that it's not just documents and photos which can be stored here, some accessibility settings can also be saved. If you areupdating your device handset for example, it's a good idea to back up tothe cloud before erasing your content, and when going through the set-up of your new device, you can turn on accessibility features and restore your previous content, which will include your settings. What about voice assistants like Siri or Google? The 2 main manufacturers of smart phones include voice assistants on all their devices. Apple and Android have made life easier by allowing users to implement Siri and Google voice respectively, and windows also contains Cortana. There is no doubt a discussion to be had about weather voice assistants fall under the category of accessibility features, however, I would suggest this depends on the person using them, as everyone will no doubt have different reasons for using them; and what is convenient for one individual, is a game changer for someone else. My personal use of Siri for example, is purely to enable me to do things quickly, like calling someone, or setting a timer. Siri is great, but I am unable to use social media, remove and install apps, and customise the layout of my home screen using Siri; So again the view is subjective. Getting online Using the various features available, it is not only possible to access the device settings, customise your screen, and access social media and messaging functions, as the increased technology now enables users to get online. No matter if using apps, or websites, content can now be viewedas long as the material is coded to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standard. If you are new tothe term WCAG, it's a set of guidelines which all content authors and web developers should adhere to, in order to allow as many people to get online as possible. The future of built-in accessibility features While it's difficult to predict future developments relating to technology, it's clear to me that we are already witnessing a shift in how users access and use the technology on their devices. The increase in such features mean that users have morechoice when purchasing a computer, mobile or TV, which can only be agood thing moving forward. Mike Taylor Senior Accessibility Analyst and Comms and Training Manager Digital \"There are now 11.8 million people aged 65 or over in the UK.

Long before she joined anygovernment department, Alison already had experi- ence of meeting user needs and delivering more for less. Alison explains that she was given the chance to run the garden bar at the family pub at the age of eight. While she was only dealing with soft drinks and nibbles, this experience taught her that rst, people appreciate good service. Alison elaborated on her thoughts at this point.\"They liked to be listened to, they liked to be served quickly and eciently. They also like to get the best value for money; it turns out asking them how much change they need generates some interesting revenue outcomes.\" \"PwC estimates that AI could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. The UK is in the top three countries globally in the development of AI technologies and this strength puts us in a prime position to unlock this projected global growth. The same estimates indicate AI could increase our productivity by 14.3% and grow our GDP up to 10.3% by 2030.\" Alison was a systems analyst and systems designer at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and she also worked in the Equalities Oce, for example, heading up the latter for the roll-out of gender pay gap reporting.

Her current aims include accelerating momentum on the GDS's business, including all the vital tasks around EU Exit. While this is a huge part of GDS's eorts, she also outlined her bold digital goals. \"We also need to build our future, setting the boldest goals for digital advancement across government, a big push on data analytics, digital identity and embeddingof innovation. To do that, we need the right resource, capability, powers and influence. \"And I have a duty to help land permanent leadership of GDS in a way that we don't miss a beat and so we can springboard into the future state for digital government.\" (4) Articial intelligence (AI) in the public sector Back in June 2019, the GDS and Oce for Articial Intelligence (OAI) published joint guidance on how touse and build articial intelligence (AI) in the public sector. In essence, this guidance covers how to assess if using AI will help you meet user needs; how the public sector can best use it and; how to implement AI fairly, ethically and safely. In the Ministerial Foreword to this, we nd out that daily, AI is changing the way in which we experience the world and we already use it to locate the fastest route to get home, lter out spam emails or alert us of suspicious activity in our bank accounts, for example. In closing, I'll leave you with some words from the Min-isterial Foreword which highlights the importance of AI to the public sector, the impact it could have on the global economy and how it will help GDS deliver more for less, the latter point which we alluded to near the start of this article.\"The UK government recognises the importance of this technology's development to both business and the public sector. Indeed, Articial Intelligence and Data was named as one of the four 'Grand Challenges' in the Industrial Strategy White Paper, which are global trends that will transform our future and contribute to the government's long-term plan to boost productivity in the UK. \"PwC estimates that AI could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.

AITs may funda- mentally alter where decision-making takes place, as well as how, by whom and when. It opens a radically new field of political and institutional relation- ships in public policy and services. These developments significantly chal- lenge our systems of political respon- sibility and accountability, and createpotentially new roles for state, political and private sector actors. Nor is this a distant future: Automation and the use of machine-learning in governmental decision-making is growing rapidly. AITs, automation and public policy Automation has for more than a cen- tury in fact been a commonplace fea- ture of government decision-making. It is expressed in forms, checklists, conditionality criteria, decision rules, and regulatory guidelines that createsmooth-running government and bureaucratic machines. So far, so normal. What is different now is that thediverse new forms of computerised automation - from algorithmically automated decision-trees, to proba- bilistic risk evaluations, to unsupervised machine-learning - signal a qualitative shift in the meaning, significance andpractice of automation. AITs promise efficacy, accuracy and reliability in public policy. Yet in practice, they risk rigidity, de-contextualisation and opacity in decision-making. Indeed, AITs may not always be appropriate, effective or available to use in government decision-making. The current wave of AIT adoptions raises problems of: Explainability and accountability in automated decision- making; how uncertainty and context are accommodated when decision recommendations are automaticallygenerated through risk-based calcula- tions; bias, and the capacity of policy- makers and front-line staff to interpret AITs into their professional judgement. When considering the social, political and ethical implications of introducing and managing the use of AITs in public policy, it is essential to take account of two things. First, the diversity and limits of the technologies themselves, and especially the variety of automa- tion that is now available. Second, the need to explicitly manage the complex- ity of decision-making - that increases, rather than decreases - when they are adopted in practice. Types of automation using AITs 1. Single-stage algorithmic automation can be based on pre-defined decision- models, using regulatory criteria for example. This is often based on'imperative programming', of the classic step-by-step, 'if...then' type. By itself, this not AIT-based automation. However, where an algorithm is programmed to produce a particular outcome (decision), but not instruct the software about how it should reach that outcome, this might use classic AI-based 'declarative programming'; 2. Two-stage algorithmic automation uses machine-learning on data from previous decisions to generate a model of those decisions. This model is then used to design an algorithm that is applied in actual type (1) automation. Like all machine-learning, this type of automation is in practice heavily dependent on the quality, detail, appropriateness, and format of the data used for training the algorithm. Most technological developments are in this area; 3. Concurrent automation uses machine-learning and/or neural networks in 'real-time' to make decision-recommendations. As such, the decision-recommendations use past and current data to inform therisk-based recommendation; 4. Autonomisation is where machine learning and neural network systems make decisions based on patterns in data, and these decisions have policy and legal effect. AITs and existing decision- making processes AITs involve increased complexity andDr Emma Carmel, Associate Professor, University of Bath, offers her expert insight into the use of artificial intelligence technologies (AITs) within government to transform public policy Artificial intelligence technologies (AITs): Transforming public policy 446PROFILEtransformation in the importance of different parts of decision-making processes, even though the decision to act on recommendations in most cases remains in the hands of humans. Key elements of AI-based policy decision-making include: Decision to adopt AITs, including impact assessment and ethical review; Procedures for, and terms and conditions of, procurement; Model, algorithm, system design and iteration; Data selection, cleaning, harmonisa- tion, storage and formatting, requir- ing improved data collection for all government systems; Learning-system functioning in prac- tice, its application and outcomes in specific service contexts; Evaluation and audit of system adoption, relevance, and use over time, in specific services and wider institutional and policy settings; System revision and termination.As such, AITs are being introduced into bureaucratic processes and institutional contexts that are shaped by human, organisational, digital, temporal and financial resources and capacities. These can generate conflicts between: Technological demands for speed, data, and sustainable computing capacity; Policy and legal requirements for fair, rigorous and legible decision-making; Human, technological and financial resource capacities that promote sustainable and accessible decision- making over the long-term. These conflicts involve a wide range of political actors. Senior public servants who approve, procure and regulate AIT adoption and use; public technol- ogy and data specialists who oversee the design, use and revision of the technologies; and corporate actors who develop, sell and provide AITs to governments; as well as wider policy stakeholders and citizens whoencounter AITs, whether knowingly or unknowingly in their day-to-day dealings with the state. So what to do? Policy leaders must urgently address the challenge of increased automation and particularly the use of AITs for government decision-making. There are five inter-connected priorities: 1. Draw on, develop, and make widespread use of the ethical frame- works around AIT adoption and use in government that have been emerging internationally in the last 12-18 months; 2. Design new processes to manage accountability between data specialists, technology designers and professional/ 'front-line' teams; 3. Revise and clarify procurement pro- cesses specifically for AITs, particularly around contractual obligations for openness, rigour and accessibility; 4. Train non-specialist staff in inter- preting the risk-based calculations of automated systems, and the limits ofAIT-based decision-recommendations; 5. Acknowledge their own knowledge gaps and reflexively engage inter-dis- ciplinary teams to oversee AIT design,adoption and use, both generally, and in specific policy sectors. Dr Emma Carmel Associate Professor, & Director, MSc in Public Policy Faculty of Humanities and Social to digital transformation In the UK, there is an increasing number of govern- ment transformation programmes underway, designed to manage the introduction of new technol- ogy and associated changes. Whether it's an online portal for tax returns, chatbot apps for customer inter- actions or large-scale smart city services, technology isnow a vital part of public life. Today, there are at least 19 such digital transformation programmes in operation, together costing the taxpayer almost \u00a338 billion. Despite the UK Government's clear commitment to using technology to improve services and save money,it's accepted that squeezed public sector budgets and complex requirements make adopting digital technolo- gies on a large-scale dicult. Compounding the com- plexity in this highly regulated world, any tech initiative must be trusted, secure and reliable. However, whilst the government recognises that digital transformation programmes are \"extremely challeng-ing\" 1the risks in not transforming are also signicant, jeopardising the future quality, value for money, rele- vance and quality of public services. A smarter approach Digital transformation is necessarily complex and high-risk. However, many reports2show that the UK is still at the early stages of its digital journey, where the primary aims are to cut costs and make savings, rather than to embrace the truly transformative potential of digital disruption. At the moment, there is a focus on discrete initiatives, such as a move to more digital communications with the public, or workplace programmes that aim to provide government workers with digital skills. What's needed is a broader strategy that harnesses the power of technology to provide for all in an inclusive, accessi-ble and sustainable way - it's here that the \"smart city\" approach comes in. There are a range of denitions of a smart city, but the consensus is that smart cities use IoT sensors, actua- tors, and technology to connect components across the city. This connects every layer of a city, from the air to the street to the underground. It's when you can derive data from everything that is connected andemploy it to improve the lives of and communication between citizens and the government that a city becomes truly smart. \"A broad and collaborative approach to smart living is vital to public sector digital transformation, but truly transforming government through the power of digital technologies will be a journey and schemes like those in Helsinki and beyond are only possible when the IT Infrastructure is in place to support them.\" In Helsinki's Smart Kalasatama district, for example, connected applications take centre stage. Its residents are the initiators and testers of new technology and smart services - and the local authority reports that it wants to become so ecient that its residents gain one hour of extra time per day. Smart projects in the dis- trict include parking places with car charging facilities, as well as automated waste collection systems thatreduce the trac of garbage trucks by up to 90%. Added to this, the municipality is embracing smart grids and real-time energy monitoring pilots that aim for a 15% reduction in energy usage, and apps that plan the most ecient trac routes with any type of transportation method. Businesses too are beneting from a smart city envi- ronment, seeing greater eciency in their operations and ultimately better service to customers. ImprovedDarren Watkins, Managing Director of VIRTUS Data Centres explains his thoughts on overcoming the obstacles to digital transformationICT 449trac management, for example, with better supply chain and logistics for online retailers, whilst smart lighting may improve footfall around physical shopping centres, boosting sales for local businesses. Getting the basics right A broad and collaborative approach to smart living is vital to public sector digital transformation, but truly transforming government through the power of digital technologies will be a journey and schemes like those in Helsinki and beyond are only possible when the IT Infrastructure is in place to support them. Digital infrastructures must be able to physically link dispersed machines and sensors, so they can exchange information in real-time - and to tap into the potential value of big data, interconnections between people and applications, data, content clouds, and networking needs to be seamless. Being able to store data eectively and access and interpret it as meaningful, actionable information, is vitally important to organisations across the board. It will bring huge advantages to the institutions that do it well. However, the implications of not getting it right are signicant. Failures in the network could result in transport systems being shut down, power outages and a huge disruption to citizens. The right infrastructure to support the demands of technology- powered living means lots of connectivity, storage and computing power, and this is facilitated by the data centre. When it comes to getting the data centre strategy right, government departments and local authorities have signicant challenges to overcome. Most will have to mix the old and the new - dealing with legacy infrastruc- ture as well as creating new facilities. For some, this might mean that traditional \"core\" connectivity hubs will have to work alongside smaller data centres optimised for edge computing. As more and more applications are required to service immediate engagement - such as media streaming or payments - data centres must be placed correctly for this type of need too. Ultimately the extensive nature of digital transformation needs something beyond a company or governmentdepartment's in-house storage capabilities, and this presents signicant opportunities for data centre providers to help. Already we are seeing many govern- ment departments and wider organisations are turning to third-party IT suppliers to help them navigate their data centre strategies - engaging with colocation facili- ties that provide the best in interconnectivity, flexibility and scalability - and this is a trend which looks set to continue and grow. So, for any wide-scale digital transformation to succeed, it's vital to start with getting the basics right - ensuring the impact of new technologies on infrastructure ismanaged. Digitally savvy public sector organisations must look at the infrastructure. Indeed, it's no exaggeration to say that as our UK cities grow, whether they thrive and deliver a good quality of life to millions of citizens is down to the IT backbone that underpins them.

Before you rush off and start spending, we suggest that you take a little time to potentially save yourself money and elapsed time. We have used a set of architecture techniques with a number of councils and discovered significant ICT assets languishing at the back of their metaphoric dusty cupboards. It should be understood that I am not pointing the finger here, finding unused hidden treasure is very common for us. I managed architec- ture teams in local government for a number of years and know all too well the effects of a sharp change of focus for the organisation, sending certain technologies and projects to the back burner. I have also known suppliers to sell bundles of software components that contain an 'extra' that unknow- ingly to them can turn out to be a nugget of gold in the future. At Fotheringham Associates, we work with organisations to help understand and unlock their business, technology and internal capabilities to meet the challenge of digital transformation. In the first of four articles on the practical use of enterprise architecture I havesought to provide a cautionary tale and a nod to our articles in previous issues \"Observations on pragmatic digital transformation\" and \"Finding a dividend for transformation\". Potential benefits Let us consider the potential benefits for this kind of exercise for a moment. The obvious money saving is by re-using the technology that you have, but even if you do need to make aninvestment to extend its use you should find that the power relationshipwith the supplier has changed. As you have discovered something you didn'tknow you had then you could discard it and buy new as you thought you would be forced to do. However, when communicated to the supplier in an appropriate way it isnormally enough to obtain a signifi- cant discount on the incremental cost you need to pay in order for them to keep the maintenance, subscription or even market share ticking over. If we look at the saving in time this is the avoidance of long-winded procure- ments. For strategic software you may well be looking at an OJEU process which as we know is even difficult to complete within four months. In the happy path of re-using existing software you need no procurement at all, saving the whole four months. However, if you do need to procure some kind of extension to the capabil- ity, as you have already made a significant investment in the software, procurement options such as the negotiated route and waivers areRob Fotheringham, Managing Director at Fotheringham Associates, offers advice on how to get the most out of your digital transformation strategy with the potential to save money on unnecessary investmentSaving on your digital transformation strategy 450PROFILE available as legitimate ways forward. This could still save you at least a couple of months from your transfor- mation roadmap and the quicker realisation of benefits. \"At Fotheringham Associates, we work with organisations to help understand and unlock their business, technology and internal capabilities to meet the challenge of digital transformation.\" What do you need to do? You need to create a comprehensive view of your application landscape, capturing information on the applica- tion's function (at a high level), under- lying technology, business usage, cost and licensing information. It should take you no more than four to six weeks to gain a complete enough picture to begin shining a light into those dark cupboards. Having conducted this kind of exercise across many organisations we know what we are looking for and by using a set of accelerators we quickly establish an audit of the application landscape. The application catalogue provides a standard way of describing the appli- cations, capturing vital attributes and information that we can analyse later. Whilst these catalogues can run to 200-500 entries we can deploy a further accelerator to provide focus. The reference architecture that we use provides a way of categorising and grouping applications aligned with their function, for work with councils it has previously discovered council applications to further speedup the mapping process. This map-ping also provides a foundation for a number of enterprise architecture led activities which we will discuss in subsequent articles. Examples from our casefiles At one unitary council we discovered an enterprise class integration technology that had been bought as part of a dealbundle a few years previously. After a version upgrade this proved itself to be capable of enabling business processesto link applications and work across departments. This discovery saved in the region of \u00a3300,000. At the same client we also found spare licences and unused modules for a major Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) suite. WhilstERP systems may not be 'on trend' these days they do typically constitute a major investment and therefore should be made to pay their way. The unused modules were dusted off, licensing was restructured (for a fraction of the true cost) and the ERP system is now the critical customer engagement platform in the council's digital transformation. At a second unitary authority our pro- ject again found unused integration software gathering cobwebs. The council has now developed in-house skills and it has been used to integratethe Oracle cloud-based HR system and the onsite user directoryautomating joiner/leaver processes saving considerable time within the business. It is also now the default means of integrating systems across the council. Additionally, we also discovered a modest investment in a useful Office365 add-on that was bought as part of a proof of concept the year before. Although this technology is not the answer to the strategic workflow needs across the council it was clear it could be used as a tactical response to automating work across back office departments. Requiring limited training, in-house development was embraced and it is now contributing to the transformational benefits column. What is clear from this experience is while you will undoubtedly have to invest in technology in order to achieve your transformation goals, by first fully understanding what you already have, including looking at its untapped potential, you could seriously reduce the cost and the time spent on lengthy procurements. As abonus your cupboards will have had a spring clean.

Some organisations are hesitant to patch or upgrade their systems, as they are so worried about the poten- tial operational impact that they end up not doing it at all. \"We work with our customers to design an autonomous patching cycle for their Windows estate that works for them by maximising exposure to early release issues and minimisingthe potential impact on business operations.\" You may have heard the term Evergreen IT, if you haven't, it's been around for several years and the term is used to capture an approach to the provision of loosely coupled services that are designed to always be up to date. In the past, IT services have been engineered around a stack of software with several layers of inte- gration resulting in an unnecessarily complex solution that can make it difficult to update or costly to replace certain elements. Adopting a stack of loosely coupled services counters this by using software and services that are self-contained and accessible viastandard interfaces, such as web browsers to minimise or remove the requirement for complex integration and simplifying the move to an alternate product. The move to modern cloud services that are updated and maintained by established organisations largely removes the decision to upgrade outof the consumers' hands, which can be worrying but helps ensure exposure to new vulnerabilities are minimisedacross back end systems. This, how- ever, does not resolve the same issue with the client operating systems and associated software packages as these are not typically treated as self-con- tained and have dependencies across multiple systems. Windows 10 and Office 365 click to run goes a long way to extending this evergreen IT model out to the desktop and with the right implementation and operational procedures, can create a secure and easily maintained environment. Microsoft Office 365 delivers several well-known services via both a browser and through the client installed applications and han- dles all the back-end management of Exchange, SharePoint and file services and so customers don't have to. Windows 10 and the office client are designed to be automatically updated on a regular basis and will adopt this approach by default. Embracing the automatic updates is critical for ensuring the most recentMaintaining an up-to-date well-patched end-user device environment has been a challenge for many organisations, but with a modern approach, it does not need to be, Sam Newman, Technical Director of OGEL IT LTD explains how 452PROFILE The challenge of maintaining an up-to-date well-patched end-user device environment vulnerabilities are addressed, there- fore, keeping organisational assets secure. There are many ways to manage the release effectively to min- imise the risk of an update negatively impacting the business operation and this is all about preparing for the updates and identifying problems early. Creating a phased release strategy with key system owners early in the release scheduled helps move the testing burden from IT teams to the business reducing overheads and having suitable processes in place to capture and report issues early is critical. OGEL IT has transitioned several cus- tomers to Window 10 and Office 365 helping them to embrace the 'Ever- green IT' strategy, resulting in a signifi- cant increase in the update compliance of their end-user devices estate and a reduction in the overhead on opera- tional teams to patch and maintain the environment. We work with our customers to design an autonomous patching cycle for their Windows estate that works for them by maximisingexposure to early release issues and minimising the potential impact on business operations. \"Embracing the automatic updates is critical for ensuring the most recent vulnerabilities are addressed, therefore, keeping organisational assets secure.\" We encourage our customers who have previously outsourced the management of their end-user estate to external providers to take a more active role in the management of their devices which improves the quality of the service to the end-users and reduces costs. Where organisations don't have the capability in-house, we work with them to help build it up by providing a flexible support service that can adapt over time as the inter- nal capability grows or where they just don't have the headcount or desire totake on the management we have done that for them. Our entire team started their careers in IT support and have been in receiptof poorly designed solutions and ser- vices that don't consider the associated operational overheads and, therefore, everything we design and deliver takes this into account and we take great pride in the quality solutions and services we deliver to our customers.

But you may be left wondering what you need to do, what approaches you can take and some of the key pitfalls to avoid. You have realised that your organisa- tion needs to adopt multiple cloud services - but that's a long way from where you are today. You are facing a myriad of existing systems, technolo- gies and contracts that you need to disentangle. But you don't have the capacity or expertise to properly focuson turning your vision into an exe- cutable plan. Without a coherent plan, your use of cloud is tactical and piecemeal. It's difficult to keep control of these new cloud services whilst also keeping your existing IT afloat. In effect, things are getting worse - and you need them to get better. 4 Key Steps to Cloud: High-level Recognising these challenges, we have identified four keys steps that can simplify, de-risk and accelerate your journey to cloud as outlined below in Figure 1:4 Key Steps to Cloud: Detailed UKCloud provides a range of services at each step, that supports organisations as they progress their journey to the cloud.

Digitising the online civil money claims service, achieving 90% public satisfaction ratings. Sending civil servants on secondments to digital companies to learn from innovative cultures and enhance technological skills. These small, almost imperceptible changes are drivingpositive outcomes across the public sector. Since the Cabinet Oce launched the Government Transformation Strategy in 2017, which covers every- thing from citizen-centric public services to ensuringgovernment buildings have interoperable technology, promising progress has been made - and this should make public sector decision-makers and citizens veryexcited indeed. Ultimately, if the Government Transformation Strategy is successful, civil servants will feel empowered to achieve their objectives much faster, and citizens will benet from public services that make their liveseasier. While incremental and manageable changes are leading to successes, there's still more to do - especially when it comes to enhancing infrastructure and supporting modern working practices. Embracing winning structures Part of meeting the Government's ambitions is embedding a winning structure at the heart of digital transformation projects. By 2020, the Government plans to deliver at least 86 digital services using an end-to-end structure where members of the public can follow simple step-by-step online processes to achieve their goals. Not only is this an example of positive digital change, but it also demonstrates the power of digitisation to make people's lives less stressful and more straightforward. The Government has also adopted a structure for user verication, known as Gov Verify, which allows people to access 18 key central government services, including checking income tax on HMRC and claiming for a redundancy payment via the Insolvency Service. Unifying user authentication systems might seem like a small, routine change, but it's actually a major struc- tural development that has delivered added conven- ience for users and, for example, has encouraged people to check their tax codes for accuracy. While there has clearly been progress, the next step isfor public sector leaders to focus on enhancing infrastructure. The importance of constant and secure connectivity can sometimes be deprioritised in thepublic sector - perhaps because networks are ultimately invisible forces. Martin McFadyen, Head of Public Sector, Virgin Media Business argues that small changes are the secret behind public sector transformation ICT 457However, it's crucial to remember that digitisation is ultimately driven by networks which not only process the data that drives public service delivery but also manage pressures on the system from customers andadapt bandwidth management accordingly. Moreover,these networks need to be secure, otherwise, they risk exposing condential information and compromising the integrity of entire public services. Rolling out next-generation networks will be vital to delivering the next tranche of iterative improvements. Combatting the remote working conundrum One key challenge is responding to demands for remote working. By 2020, the Government expects 70% of departments to comply with the Smart Working Code of Practice written up by the British Standards Institute - which means they will need to update their technology to support flexible working for civil servants. This is particularly complex for the public sector, as there are dierent levels of security to consider acrossdierent departments influencing the extent to which a 'Bring Your Own Device' (BYOD) policy could be introduced, for example. However, there's no doubt that to attract top talent, support for remote working will need to be delivered - and a large part of that will involve empowering employees to access a corporate network while they are on the move. Delivering this is critical for an organisation, and public sector leaders should seek a strategic technology partner that can act as a co-pilot on this journey. Overall, while there are encouraging signs, there's still work to be done to implement winning structures and deliver twenty-rst-century services for citizens. The public sector needs to continually implement small changes, ensure data and knowledge are shareable and put power in the hands of people.

Once you have identified an issue, you need to decide how you are going to solve it. Below are the broad steps that need some thought: 1. Specify the problem 2. Deciding on the research needed for a solution 3. Collect the data: a. Identify the audience b. Run qualitative analysis (focusgroups, depth interviews) c. Construct a questionnaire d. Fieldwork (getting questionnaires completed by the target audience) e. Ensuring data is in a form you can run qualitative analysis on (i.e. in digital format) 4. Run the analysis 5. Interpret the results 6. Communicate the results to the stakeholders 7. Make a plan, communicating this to your teams 8. Implement the solution to your problem 9. Monitor, review the results of your plan 10. Assess and refine your thoughts to see how you can improve things further. Then start again at point 1 changing the problem based on the evidence you have obtained.I will be writing a series of articles covering the data science subject areas (points 1-5). I will do this from a conceptual point of view and try to keep the complexity of the mathematics to a minimum. 1. Specifying the problem Phase 1 is the most critical phase as Albert Einstein said: \"The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill.\" If you don't get this correct, you could be wasting money and resources, implementing a poor solution as the problem was not specified correctly. Consult with all stakeholders to get an understanding of the problem. Try to identify what result you are trying to achieve.Data Science covers a range of different disciplines that are to do with the collection, analysis and reporting of data. Chris Cook, Managing Director, PAL Stats, offers his expertise to discuss what data science in market research is 458PROFILE What is data science in market research? Assess the impact of resolving the issues and the benefits that would derive from the solution. Determine a budget to resolve the issue and what the potential cost savings/benefits the solution may have. Assess the value for money of the implementation would bring budgeted costs vs costsavings. If the budget allows, bring in professional help. If it is not value for money and you can work with the existing deficiencies, it may well be better not to embark on the project. Try to identify any issue and risks that the project may cause and try to mitigate these when specifying the problem. 2. Deciding on the research needed for a solution You need to decide how you are going to solve the problem. What data are you going to collect What information you need to collect that will give you the answers you need From where and who do you need to collect data Decide what methods of data collection you are going to use Decide how you are going to analyse the data Decide who is going to interpret the results and then action them How are you going to communicate the results to the stakeholders? How do you assess whether the plan has worked or not? 3. Collecting the data a. Identify the audience Specify who your audience is, do you have access to every member ofthat audience? Ideally, you should. Everyone in the audience is called the population. Try to identify any holes in the audi- ence and see if you can reduce those holes, perhaps see if there are others with whom you can partner. Ensure that the audience has given their per- mission to be contacted so that you are GDPR-compliant. If you ask every member in the audi- ence and they reply it is called a census. If you take a subset of the audience from the population, it is called a sample. The larger the sample, the more accurate the results are. How- ever, depending on the specific case, a sample of 500 is usually good enough. Every person in the popula- tion should have an equal chance of being picked (this is known as the uni- form probability model). If they don't have an equal chance, then bias can be introduced. Any bias can distort the results. b. Run qualitative analysis Often this an important phase. Depth interview Asks a lot of why questions to under- stand the topic areas providing descriptive data about people's behaviours, attitudes and percep- tions, helps to understand complex processes, from this it will help you construct relevant questions in a questionnaire. Focus Groups A focus group discussion is an interac- tion among one or more experts and more than one individual. The inten- tion is to gather data. In a focus group, discussion investigators interview people with common qualities or experience for eliciting ideas, thoughts and perceptions about subject areas or certain issues associated with an area of interest. It is particularly useful in segmentation studies as, when the participants take different views on a topic, there is a possible segmentation to be had. If the topic has consensus, then the topic is not discriminating and should not be asked in a survey that's aim is to segment the population. Next time I will cover the other elements of \"collect the data\".

In addition, the Department had key Inf ormation Services deliver ed and hosted on the Public Services Netw ork (PSN) where the Netw ork itself was a secured \"Ocial\" en vironment. Visionist were able to grasp the scale, scope and complexityo f the challenges the Department faced, and deployed its resourc es, to support the IT Department as they led theirc ommunity through change at pace, in an organised and prioritised fashion. The Solution Initially, Visionist designed the road-maps through acceptance, technical debt, inherited backlog and beyond. Thereafter, w e embedded high performing agile teams, working in collabora tion with Civil-Servan ts to ensure e ective skills and knowledge transfer , helping them transition from using out-dat ed technologies and methodologies to a future-proofed department, using an aggregation of loosely c oupled Cloud Technologies and an agreed Refer ence Architecture.

Requests to work flexibly need to be inwriting and employers must have a sound business reason for rejecting them. Moving forward, according to conservative MP Helen Whately, flexible working should be the default position for all employees, rather than it being up to individuals to request it as she laid new plans before Parliament earlier this year. The Government Flexible Working Taskforce has also expressed its commitment to promoting wider understanding and implementation of inclusive flexiblework and working practices. But despite this dramaticshift in working culture, reinforced by a change in the law and Government manifestos, questions remain as to how far and how soon agile working will follow suit. The death of the traditional oce has been muchdiscussed. Maintenance and upkeep costs are certainly signicant. Scan the horizons of Britain's largest cities, however, and you can see many new oces are still being built. In the City of London, for example, several million square feet of commercial oce space are currently under construction, with several million more planned over the next ve years. Some explanation comes from a report by Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL), which predicts that flexible working spaces are set to grow by up to 30% annually for the next ve years, changing how businesses of every size organise their workforce. Last year, flexible workspace operators took up one-sixth of all new commercial property in London while their footprint grew fastestin Manchester and Birmingham. Firms like WeWorkand IWG provide oce space, enabling clients to vary the number of desks and how long they need them for. This, in turn, serves as a boost to agile working. But much of that impact still lies in the future, not the present. For now, company oces are still the norm, not the exception, but companies can still apply an agile working mentality by thinking of their employees' work in terms of performance and outcome as opposed to hours spent in the oce. Technology, of course, is key - the fuel which allows much agile working to happen. When applied to computers, it enables employees to work wherever and whenever they choose. \"...tech-enabled agile working is no longer a new phenomenon: millions of workers now use computers and smart devices outside the office as part of their work.\" Productivity is a much wider issue in the British economyas it lags stubbornly behind many of its European neighbours. Some research suggests that flexible workers work more productively than their xed hours counterparts. A study by HSBC found that theprofessional services industry is the most likely to oer employees flexibility, with 36% of professional services employees saying it is available to them and that 89% of employees believe flexible working is a key motivator to their workplace productivity levels, more than nancial incentives. By allowing employees to work flexibly and applying the \"working smart\" philosophy that applies to agile working, businesses can both save money and boost employee eectiveness and productivity. Businesses which deploy agile working structures can be the key to employees being able to work how and when they want and still be able to ensure excellent client service. Every survey suggests that employees likeShella Snehi, a specialist employment lawyer at Excello Law, argues that agile working is key to work-life balance and business profitabilityICT 463the freedom which it provides. Agile working can lead to lower absenteeism and greater employee loyalty. Innovative working practices, therefore, result in a win-win situation for both businesses and their employees. Companies may otherwise be losing out on talented and valuable employees if they do not provide the flexibility desired. Encouraging and supporting a flexible approach not only support a healthy work-life balance but also contributes to business success and growth. Of course, tech-enabled agile working is no longer a new phenomenon: millions of workers now use computers and smart devices outside the oce as part of their work. But predicting how future technology might enable businesses to improve employee engagement is hard, particularly since the evolution of articial intelligence (AI) is set to change the world of work in a myriad of ways. How such technology will facilitate evolving working patterns, therefore, remains to be seen, although forecasts suggest that the convergence of AI systems with the agile world is set to have a signicant disruptive impact in the next decade. As agile working continuesto become more prevalent across both the private and public sectors, it will undoubtedly continue to play an important part in meeting the aim of working better and more eciently, not longer and allowing for greater work-life balance. It remains to be seen if the traditional 9-5 model will be declared 'dead' as flexible oces and agile working continues to rise. For some, agile working already brings a world of exciting opportunities for working in a way that personally suits and from any location - all that is needed is a laptop and a reliable internet connection. Shella Excello LawWhen it comes to training for #GenerationAgile and beyond, the pace of change and the need for adaptability and innovation have made agile working and business agility essential skills for all aspects of business and commer- cial life. However, most professional agile accreditations are designed for practitioners already in the workplace, working in agile teams. A short course and qualification were needed to offer agile beginners an overview of agile principles and prac- tices; one that would improve their employability and act as a foundation for further career development. Early education in agile knowledge and skills is the objective of the Agile Business Consortium's campaign for Generation Agile. Offering agile train- ing to students through University- based programmes is an effective way to deliver valuable knowledge before young people enter the workplace. However, the same training and approach are also suitable for those already in work who have little agile knowledge - whatever stage of career they're in. The academia/workplace divide \"Today's workplace is highly competi- tive,\" states Dr Islam Choudhury, Asso- ciate Professor at Kingston University and Director of the Agile Business Consortium. \"Kingston University has worked with the Agile Business Con- sortium to design this new programme to give students and professionals the understanding and vocabulary they need to talk confidently about agility and demonstrate that they have the mindset and attitude to create success in the workplace. \"It's valuable to have short, focused training to introduce agile as practised in industry. Agile Practices provides this as a standalone certification course where attendees engage in interactive teaching sessions and workshops. This increases their knowledge, under- standing, authority and credibility with various agile approaches. \"Agile is gaining increasing traction in public and private sectors alike\", Islam affirms, \"The education system mustprepare people to be effective in the workplace and deliver the skills that industry needs and the marketplace demands. This Agile Practices course is an important step towards closing the gap between education and industry. \"The course content for this certifica-tion can be delivered in a variety of ways - it is itself very agile. It can be absorbed into scheduled teachingtime and spread over a semester for those in education, or it can be taughtin a couple of fast-track intensive days. Each university or organisationcan decide what works best withintheir teaching/learning and develop- ment system.\" \"Our experience with the Agile Practices certification is that attendees value the broad learning it offers. It also helps that the exam mimics the format of other professional exams, so attendees are well prepared for further study in the workplace.\" Kingston and Westminster universities leading the way The Agile Practices certification now sits alongside AgilePM\u00ae as part of the learning portfolio developed at the Agile Business Consortium and over 500 students have now achieved the Agile Practices Foundation Certificate through Kingston and Westminster universities, with an average pass rate of over 80%. Islam continues, \"I believe that Agile Practices equips the agilists of tomor- row to think outside the box and build for themselves a practical and effec- tive agile toolkit. It also offers a broad base from which to move forward to study other agile certifications and a practical baseline of knowledge for organisations to utilise.\" Dr Nadia Amin is Principal Lecturer in Information Management at West-minster Business School. She intro- duced the Agile Practices exam for the first time in 2018. \"Agility is now a mainstream business skill and we areCreating more agile organisations requires a level playing field of agile knowledge for all employees. What can the public sector gain from new approaches in higher education? Kim Whitmore from the Agile Business Consortium explains moreAgile awareness: Creating an essential baseline 464PROFILEmaking our agile project module compulsory from 2020. We believe that supporting students to gain a good understanding of business agility and agile methods will improve their employability. We need to equip people not only to understand differ- ent agile frameworks but to be able to develop further to create hybrid methods and solutions in practice. \"Our experience with the Agile Prac- tices certification is that attendees value the broad learning it offers. It also helps that the exam mimics the format of other professional exams, so attendees are well prepared for further study in the workplace. Agility for all sectors \"Businesses and public sector organi- sations in the future will have a grow- ing need to be agile\", Islam affirms. \"This course provides a life skill that will be valuable for students of all dis- ciplines. My students that have moved into roles as wide-ranging as teaching or marketing have told me how useful this grounding in agile has been for them.\"Agile Practices offers a way to move forward when your workload feels overwhelming. When change is rapid, we need constant adaptation,incremental progress and to benefit from transparency and the drive for continual improvement. We need to be able to stand back and review what we have done objectively, to accept feedback and move forward to make our results even stronger. \"In today's world, we simply cannot do everything in one go. Agile Practiceshelps students and employees to see change as a benefit, rather than a whirlwind of loss.\" Between the main agile approaches of XP, AgilePM, Scrum, Kanban and SAFe, the terminology alone is confusing. Gaining an understanding of these concepts is essential in an increasingly agile working world. Availability in the workplace Following successful delivery at Kingston and Westminster Universi-ties, Agile Practices is now available for delivery by training organisationsand learning and development departments by agreement with Agile Business Consortium and is being very positively received. \"It's valuable to have short, focused training to introduce agile as practised in industry. Agile Practices provides this as a standalone certification course where attendees engage in interactive teaching sessions and workshops. This increases their knowledge, understanding, authority and credibility with various agile approaches.\" In fitting with the Consortium's mission to lead, support and enable business agility worldwide, the financial barrier to entry is low, with Consortium members being charged just \u00a360 for the exam.

The recently issued Internet First; Policy and Guidance from NHS-Digital has been interpretedthat the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN) is a temporary transition network residing in timebetween the N3 network and the Internet. The N3 network existed for 16 years supplied by a single organisation. At the end of the contract, a tran- sition arrangement was put into place allowing NHSusers to transition to the Health and Social Care Net- work (HSCN). This transition is still undergoing, with the rst wave of connections starting at the end of 2018,following competitive procurements. During 2019, themajority of the N3 connections will be replaced by HSCN connections. The aim is that by 2020, all connec-tions will be on HSCN rather than N3. This activity sets the foundation going forward. One interpretation is that the recent policy paper means the 34,000 HSCN connections will be now replaced by internet connections? Has the procurements and invest-ments by industry and consumers alike been a waste of time? No, but it does raise some interesting points that users and suppliers should consider. In simple terms, what is the dierence between HSCN and the Internet? Firstly, we should take note that HSCN includes internet access. Indeed, HSCN does not state whether a private connection or internet connection is used to deliver services. The ubiquitous access oered by the Internet is partic- ularly attractive to a more mobile workforce. As patients increasingly adopt Full Fibre connectivity and with the dawn of 5G connectivity around the corner, it is likely that in ve to six years' time, health workers will have reliable remote connectivity to enable access to patientrecords and much more. This will reduce the time taken to update and le reports. It potentially will allow more data to be shared with more agency workers. Similarly, the movement of private servers to the public cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google will hasten the adoption. We have seen a number of international healthcare application providers viewing the opportunity that the open HSCN market provides. The cost of porting an existing service into a UK instance of AWS or Azure and delivering to NHS users is almost negligible. The result will be cheaper and faster services using the latest technology. When it comes to the choice to use a public internet or a private network connection, the answer depends on the business criticality of the connection. Whilst a private connection appears to be the same as a public internet connection, there is a big dierence behind the scenes. The infrastructure is much the same, but itis in how the data is monitored and routed that the dif- ferences arise. A private connection (IPVPN or SD-WAN) it can be likened to a 'Bus only' lane in a city. The private connection has a dedicated routing through networks to ensure that bottlenecks are avoided, trac is delivered and the routing is known and monitored. Just like a bus lane where the segregation of the bus trac means that buses have a greater chance of keep- ing to the timetable, road sensors provide progressupdates which means that bus stops are not missed and journeys are not held up. The Internet is more like a public road. The trac can be held up or slowed depending on the volume of trac, the shortest route may not be taken and detours and re-routing are common. Journey times can be a rough estimate rather than xed. The time of day can impact driving time signicantly and it is likely that you don't know where someone is on the journey. Mike Thomas, Managing Director of Innopsis, the trade association for suppliers of digital infrastructure and services to the UK public sector asks if a health and social care network is a vision or reality467Given the clear benet of reliable network connections in pre-emptive healthcare scenarios (e.g. wearables formedical use) and the increasing move towards centralised cloud services, the understanding of the dierence between a congested internet connectionand a network service with guaranteed SLAs is crucial to the success of the digital vision. This vision is also supported by both the guidance from the NCSC and the GDS, where the needs of the application service are paramount in determining the assurances required. In relation to interpretations on the NHS policy paper, we need to understand the context of time. To fullymigrate into an 'Internet Only' world, this would rely on all relevant applications being available on the Internet. The National Centre for Cyber Security (NCSC) suggests that an internet connection is an acceptable option, provided that the service is treated as untrusted and that additional security should be deployed to protectthe data in transit. Currently, the vast majority of applications that NHSworkers would need to access are not internet-enabled and do not have the application security recommended by NCSC yet. Indeed, the estimate is that it could be well over seven years before those applications meet the standards published or are replaced. Whilst there are pockets of NHS workers where this will be achievablemuch sooner as new applications are being deployed, there will need to be a greater focus and investment tobring this gestation period shorter. Therefore, HSCN will remain as the prime choice for NHS consumers for some time. It is also important that we need to consider the cost. The recent round of procurements were benchmarked against standard Internet connections. The HSCN connections were around 5% to 10% cheaper. Savings will typically be made within the applications and more ecient work practices rather than the connectivity. The focus for NHS-Digital should be enabling publicfacing, internet- delivered, front ends to their current applications, where appropriate. This will help realise the Secretary of State's vision of an internet- based Health Service, complementing Managing Director of InnopsisPrime Minister Boris Johnson may have pledged a cash injec- tion for some public services - a reputed \u00a31.8 billion for NHS hospitals and a further 20,000 bobbies on thebeat - but the wounds of deep austerity cuts will take many years to heal. Whatever your political persuasion, whatever the rights and wrongs, the 2010 austerity programme embarked upon in response to the 2008 financial crisis by the coalition government, gathered momentum and led to unpar- alleled change within public services. The infamous note left by the outgoing Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liam Byrne, for the new incumbents which read: \"I'm afraid there is no money\" was a postscript to a situation which prompted central and local govern- ment to find ever-more inventive ways of saving cash. With human resources being a significant overhead, it is perhaps not surprising that the axe was the first tofall there. But at what cost? Local authorities have been pushed into becoming the facilitators of services rather than the delivery. With the loss of experienced employ- ees, skills and local knowledge ebbs away, along with the quality of service, squeezed by demands for lower costs, often questionable employment prac- tices (poor wages/conditions, zerohours contracts etc.) and contrary tothe philosophy of those contracting out the services. Those put forward the argument for outsourced services believe that they open up competition and that the private sector is more likely to achieve efficiency improvements, is more innovative, less hierarchical and more focussed, leading to improved value for money. In doing so, the core workforce is reduced to a lower level which is initially viewed as win-win, less cost and guaranteed assured service levelsbut it all too often lead to a lack of engagement in the workforce with poor motivation and a \"them and us\" culture. Failures have been seen over the past few years in G4S and Serco toname just two.As the public sector begins to claw its way up from the austerity precipice, it may wish to consider an alternativesolution that enables it to do more with its core workforce by managing it in a demand-responsive way. Underinvesting in the workforce, can result in an organisation becomingmore expensive not less so. It is by no means easy but by following these steps can cut costs while maintaining services. Plan work patterns using as much information as is available Work with employees, representatives and unions to engage the correct number of people in any shift pattern taking account of absence sicknessand holidays. Analysis may even show,Neville Henderson, Senior Consultant, Crown Workforce Management discusses how the public sector can recover from the pain of austerity in this articlePublic sector: Recovering from austerity 468PROFILE irrespective of other benefits of reduc- ing excessive working hours, that this may even be a cheaper option espe- cially where higher overtime rates are prevalent or external support is costly. Understand any reasons for absence and whether you are able to actually address them not just fill them. When do they occur, who is absent, what issues are caused by the absence e.g. could multiskilling prevent additional hours requirement. Is absence repeated by specific individuals, for what reasons - they may or may not be genuine? Does it occur at specific times such as around time planned off? Ensure that holiday time is taken in to account, if holiday is taken evenly then with average holiday entitlements an additional person is required for approximately every nine employees. However, holiday is not normally taken evenly! Is there anything that can be done to ensure that this is planned to fit not only with workforce requirements in mind but also those of the business e.g. a blanket rule of a number of people allowed off may not be suitable if there is a period of slack - encouraging employees to take time off when the business doesn't need them or service level is lower may at times help both parties. Matching short term peaks and troughs through better shift planning Analyse requirements to see if there are different needs for people to be at work at different times then try and plan for them. A simple example may be where you currently have five, eight-hour shifts, Monday to Friday. However, Monday, for this example, was generally the busiest day of the week, often required extended work- ing through overtime, with a lighter requirement the rest of the week. Theresponse should be to build a shift pattern with a 10-hour Monday recip- rocally seven-and-a-hour shifts the rest of the week. It may be that it is possible to increase the hourly rate slightly to offset any employee losses from this overtime reduction - in reality all then become winners as the employee is at work fewer hours and the business may well maintain a better productivity level, although this wage increase may be only aspira-tional. This type of system is frequently seen in accounting where month-end weeks have longer shifts than other weeks. Matching longer term peaks and troughs using banked hours schemes There are a multitude of working arrangements that range from flex- itime to annualised hours that rely on banks of hours to allow different shift lengths to be worked in different periods of the year, month or day. Flexitime is generally seen as a form of working aimed more towards help- ing employee flexibility but with care schemes can be designed to workwith matching business demands as well. The best schemes will help both. An Annualised hours scheme is in essence a banked hours scheme based on a year. They often go slightly further than simple banked hours as other entities such as holidays and pay are also based on a year so all can be aligned Managing banks and/or overtime levels ensuring evenness Whichever form of flexibility is chosen or even if you stay with overtime then the problems can be reduced throughmaintaining a good record of hours worked by each individual. This would include monitoring all types of hours, normal hours and overtime/banksand ensuring that there is a good balance of hours - ideally across all relevant employees. Workforce Management Systems, such as that provided by Crown Workforce Man- agement, ensures that planners are able to look at attendance demand and can rank employees based on a variety of criteria, such as cost (labourgrade), attendance information, banklevels or overtime usage to ensure fairness whilst making sure thatpeople are in the right place at theright time. Whatever the future holds in store, one thing is certain: ours is a changed land- scape. It is only by thoroughly under- standing our organisations and the demands placed upon them can we affect change to similarly respond tothose needs and deliver better service.

A detection and mitigation platform that exploits the available CTI is crucial for tackling the grand challenges inherent in securing the ecosystem of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Such challenges rest with the structure of typ- ical IoT networks that are comprised of heterogeneousconnected devices whose flawed design allows the cyber-attackers to easily compromise them and form enormous IoT botnets 1. Eective response and mitiga- tion of sophisticated cyber-attacks are crucial and asystematic approach to model attack strategies needs to be developed so as to properly identify the possible weaknesses of a system, the relevant security risks in relation with the possibility of an attack being success- ful, as well as the countermeasures required for addressing these security issues, both proactively andreactively. This is a non-trivial task, taking into account the inherent complexity of IoT ecosystems, as well asthe fact that new vulnerabilities - and thus relevant security risks - are constantly arising. CTI tools are responsible for the ecient collection of information regarding emerging cyber-threats or pos- sibly unknown vulnerabilities that are available fromvarious sources and their ranking in terms of criteria like popularity and impact; the dissemination of CTI tothe relevant cybersecurity controls is imperative for increasing an organisation's defensive capabilities. Typical solutions should address key security aspects 2,3like:Ecient identication and crawling of sources with valuable cybersecurity information to retrieve relevant (and time-varying) content on vulnerabilities, exploits, products, etc. \"Many tools exist for detecting open ports and vulnerabilities on a network's devices, but their limitation is that they identify vulnerabilities and plan any mitigation action on a per host basis; therefore, they are unable to detect sophisticated multi-stage attacks, which usually occur in highly complex and dynamic environments as in the case of IoT, by correlating such information.\" Accurate extraction of site-specic content from the retrieved data (ltering out irrelevant content) to obtain information on vulnerabilities, aected platforms,exploits used, etc. Ecient storage, indexing, etc. of gathered CTI and dissemination amongst the cybersecurity experts, torate the quality of the CTI and increase awareness. In addition, CTI may be used to augment the knowledge that intelligent cyber-defence controls have in order to eciently detect and prevent attacks. Such security controls - typical examples of which include host-based malware detection systems 4and network-based intrusion detection systems5,6- sophis- ticated machine learning (ML) algorithms having incre- mental learning abilities. To this end, novel intrusion detection approaches have been proposed, relying onDr Nicholas Kolokotronis from the University of Peloponnese and Dr Stavros Shiaeles, School of Computing, Faculty of Technology at the University of Portsmouth, impart their expert thoughts on effective response and mitigation of advanced cyber-attacks via an intelligent cyber-defence framework. Both authors have received funding from the EU's Horizon 2020, under grant agreement 786698Effective response and mitigation of advanced cyber-attacks via an intelligent cyber-defence frameworkICT 471properly designed convolutional neural networks (CNN), that convert data (e.g. software binaries of IP packets' payload) into 2D images to increase eciency6; CNNs are particularly suited for the classication of images and can be easily retrained to learn quickly fromupdates to the neural network. Such methods may achieve high accuracy (more than 92%), which meets the accuracy needs for practical use, as well as high precision and recall (again more than 92%) showing the ability to dierentiate malicious from benign data. Intelligence may also come in the form of eciently modelling the attack strategies and proles that char- acterise the resources available to attackers (e.g. budget and tools) for exploiting vulnerabilities of any kind to attain their goals, such as privilege escalation, quality of service reduction, etc. Graphical cybersecurity models (GCSM) constitute important primitives for eciently representing multi-stage attack strategies, thus, enhancing the capability of intrusion detection systems to respond to advanced cyber-attacks 7. GCSMs need detailed information about software weaknesses, miscongurations, network connectivity, rewall rules, etc., of the devices in a network in order to identify, via specialised algorithms, the possibleattack paths a cyber-attacker might follow (possibly inan adaptive manner) towards achieving his goals and the associated impact. Many tools exist for detecting open ports and vulnerabilities on a network's devices, but their limitation is that they identify vulnerabilities and plan any mitigation action on a per host basis; therefore, they are unable to detect sophisticated multi-stage attacks, which usually occur in highly complex and dynamic environments as in the case of IoT, by correlating such information. The combination of ML-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) and GCSMs can lead to an innovative class of intelligent intrusion response systems (iIRS) providing dynamic security risk assessment and intelligent mitigation strategies to defend against adaptive multi-stage cyber-attacks in an optimal and autonomous fashion 8. This can be achieved by building upon advanced game-theoretic security approaches that, given a GCSM for the IoT network under consid- eration, accurately model the players (attackers anddefenders) and their interactions. This model includes what each player knows about the network, what attacking and defending actions can be performed, what goal (and the associated reward) is to be attained, ICT 472etc. The key aspects that such solutions need to address include: The development of an ML-based IDS that can identify unknown (i.e. zero-day) attacks. Accurate modelling of cybersecurity aspects via game- theoretic frameworks and eective tackling of thecomplexity and eciency issues arising in each case. Enhancement of defenders' capabilities against multi- stage attacks by incorporating GCSMs into game-the-oretic models specically for intrusion prevention and response. Development of algorithms for solving the formulated games, in a centralised or decentralised manner, to yield the optimal defender's response and minimise attackers' success. By achieving the above results, the designed iIRS willprove to be valuable as part of solutions oering built-in resilience, which will help stakeholders to betterprotect their assets against advanced large-scale cyber- attacks. Thus, to generate a positive impact for smalland medium-sized enterprises, but also for critical infrastructures and industrial IoT facilities, further research and development on the following aspects is required: methods for the detection and mitigation of (unknown) sophisticated cyber-attacks, solutions for the acquisition of actionable CTI, the development ofintelligent defense methods and most importantly, innovative tools for embedding cybersecurity in future autonomous intelligent products.

In the run-up to 25 May 2018, preparations for the implementation of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) were a key priority for organisations. The GDPR's entry intoforce was viewed with concern, given its complexity, the challenges of putting the new data protection rulesinto practice and the extremely high nes that can be imposed for breaches. The majority of infringements can be punished by a ne of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% ofan organisation's total worldwide annual turnover for the previous nancial year (the higher of the two). Over a year on, with the rst wave of decisions and nes issued by a number of national data protection author- ities (DPAs) and many ongoing investigations, it is inter- esting to examine if and how the GDPR rules are actually having their desired eect. Enforcement authorities in many countries have used this rst year as a grace period to educate and promote compliance with the GDPR. Corporate awareness of the GDPR rules and potential repercussions of breaches has increased and new or enhanced data protection policies have been implemented as companies' abilityto handle personal and sensitive data safely and in compliance with the data protection principles has been subjected to fresh scrutiny. These include a sig- nicant increase in the employment of Data Protection Ocers (DPO). If a DPO is appointed (which is not always mandatory), it is the DPO's responsibility to inform and advise with respect to data protection obli- gations, to supervise compliance with these obligations and to cooperate with the DPA(s). As awareness has risen, there have been a growing number of complaints and breach notications across the EU. DPAs in some Western European countries such as Germany and France appear to have been very proactive in enforcement. For example, the FrenchData Protection Authority ('CNIL') imposed a \u20ac50 million GDPR ne on Google LLC in January 2019. The huge ne was based on a lack of information and trans- parency for users and took into consideration the large volume of data and number of individuals involved in this violation of privacy. \"The GDPR has faced some criticism, with commentators noting that the law in its current state is broadly worded, meaning the regulations are open to differing interpretation. This means there is a risk of divergent decisions in different jurisdictions when investigations are carried out.\" The UK's Information Commissioner's Oce (ICO) alsorecently announced its intention to impose large nes on Marriot and British Airways, as a result of data breach-related incidents. The proposed nes announced were \u00a399.2 million for Marriot and \u00a3183.4 million for British Airways, highlighting the seriousness with which the ICO treats such cases. Others, however, have been slower to take signicant enforcement action and in Eastern Europe, many coun- tries have taken a mild approach to enforcement. While the Polish and Lithuanian DPAs have imposed relatively signicant nes, Latvia, the Czech Republic and Hungaryhave only imposed very minor penalties. At the time of writing, the Slovak DPA has only ned organisations for failing to comply with inspections and not for GDPR breaches and the Bulgarian DPA has mainly issued warnings and reprimands. Slovenia is one of the EU Member States that has not yet completed the process of implementing the GDPR into national legislation.Warnings have been issued in a number of jurisdictions and the various DPAs are making orders for bringing processing activities into compliance; there should be further activity over the coming year.Ius Laboris share their thoughts on what the first year of GDPR looked like and where they see it heading in the futureICT 475The GDPR has faced some criticism, with commentators noting that the law in its current state is broadly worded, meaning the regulations are open to diering interpretation. This means there is a risk of divergent decisions in dierent jurisdictions when investigations are carried out. Further, given that GDPR is an EU Regulation, its validity in the UK will come into question following Brexit. Most experts believe that the GDPR will be enacted in UK Law after Brexit under section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. In light of recent high-prole cases, however and with more predicted imminently, global businesses now have a better insight into the nancial and reputational repercussions of failure to comply with data protection principles. The trend towards stricter data protection rules is likely to intensify, as the value placed on an indi- vidual's data privacy continues to rise. It is clear that compliance is key to avoid very signicant penalties and organisations and individuals should continue to invest in education and training and promote compliance and best practice. This article is based on information contained in a comprehensive report 'The GDPR: One Year On' pre- pared by Ius Laboris in May 2019. Further information on how the GDPR has been enforced across various European jurisdictions in the year following its entry into force can be found in the full report, here .

Infor- mation Governance is not a tick box exercise and often there is no right and wrong answer, it is a judgement call. IG Solutions, Cardiff Council's Infor- mation Governance training service, was established in order to share our extensive knowledge and expertise of Data Protection and Information Gov- ernance with public service partners across the country. IG Solutions delivers practical training designed to help organisations over- come the challenges they face andunderstand their responsibilities to manage the strategic risks of fines and reputational damage. Our training is focused on Data Protection, Freedom of Information and Records Management and we are able to tailor courses to meet your specific needs. Our vision Our training is designed to help you understand how compliance can be achieved based on our knowledge, experience and best practice approaches adopted across the publicsector, including frameworks such as the Wales Accord for Sharing Personal Information (WASPI), which we hope will help facilitate increased use of consistent methods of controls and assurance. Busting the myths that: The law is new and we have never considered the privacy of individuals. The public sector is resistant to change and not good at managing risk. The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) andData Protection Act 2018 arrived with the bluster of being 'the new kid on the block.' We explore how the chal- lenges around data protection have grown and how they work to protect the rights of individuals developed and that many of the changes intro- duced in 2018 were enhancements to existing laws and best practice. Public services have always been resilient and are often the leaders in the areas of change and risk manage-ment. We explore our journey and experience of making significant changes to our processes as a resultof focussing on the increased enforce- ment powers of the Information Commissioners' Office in 2012; the plethora of Codes of Practice issued over the past 10 years; keeping up-to-date with the developing GDPR legislation; taking the decision to anticipate some of the changes whilst looking to secure traction for activelymanaging the Council's risks around data protection; and information governance more widely. We hope that our training helps you to tackle these myths and considerthe practical application of the key areas of organisational and technical control as part of your approach to managing risk. Building capacity and control Good working arrangements acrossWales are already in place with collab- orative and regional working amongst Information Governance Managers and Data Protection Officers. However, with increasing demand for regional collaboration and alternative servicedelivery models across the public ser-vice, we need to ensure that there is improved awareness and understand- ing of information governance to support the drive for change. We have built our training on the experience we have in supporting Cardiff Council and collaboration models, such as Rent Smart Wales, the National Adop-tion Service, Vale Valleys and Cardiff Regional Adoption Service and Shared Regulatory Services. Our training and educational support will help you to increase the 'information governance' capacity within your organisation, enable you to share the 'informationCardiff Council's Operational Manager, Information Governance and Risk, Vivienne Pearson and Information Governance Manager, Dave Parsons, set out the vision and benefits their training offersPerspectives on Information Governance 476PROFILEgovernance' responsibility across your employees and help you to identify the risks and controls around the use, and sharing of personal data. Developing a risk-based approach to Information Governance Public services will continue to face increased scrutiny by the Information Commissioner in the coming months and years. Much of the focus of the Information Commissioners' enforce- ment powers has been on large-scale privacy infringements. Recent public- ity around the intent to fine several large organisations is a testimony to this. It is vital that the public sector does not become entrenched in an attitude of 'this will never happen to us' and the perception that 'it is not in the interests of the Commissioner to fine the public service.'A large-scale data breach has the potential to damage public service in more ways than one. Not only would a financial penalty have potential con- sequences on your frontline service provision, but would also bring about irreparable damage to your organisa- tion's reputation and standing. Our training is designed to help organ- isations focus on the key controls and assurance that they need to prioritise enabling you to demonstrate that due diligence is in place to protect personal data in the event of a data security incident. Raising awareness and supporting a culture of responsibility The importance of education and training cannot be understated as part of any ICO investigation one ofthe first questions they ask is for evidence of the training you have provided for your employees. Our approach enables you and your organisation to have a fresh, indepen- dent, insight to the world of compli- ance with data protection, as well as providing a range of tools and skills for you to consider taking forwardwithin your organisation. Ultimately, we are all in this together. Information Governance is not just the domain of subject experts it iseverybody's responsibility.

Adrian Dinsmore, Headteacher, Hawthorn Primary SchoolPROFILEGOVERNMENT 478The government's relationship with commercial suppliers: A focus on prompt payments The rst task for anyone starting a new job is to get to grips with their in-tray. As Minister forImplementation, I have got a broad brief: as well as the government's digital service, property portfolioand cyber resilience work, a core part of my job will be managing the government's relationship with our commercial suppliers. \"Prompt payment is an issue at the heart of the supply chain, and of crucial importance to the small businesses that form the backbone of our economy. Failure on behalf of government outsourcers to pay settled invoices promptly can threaten the very existence of their smaller suppliers and cause sectors of the economy to stagnate.\" And a key element of that is the new prompt paymentrules we have brought into force at the start of Sep- tember. They demand that government outsourcingpartners pay 95% of all their invoices within 60 days or risk missing out on major government contracts. Prompt payment is an issue at the heart of the supply chain, and of crucial importance to the small businesses that form the backbone of our economy. Failure on behalf of government outsourcers to pay settled invoices promptly can threaten the very existence of their smaller suppliers and cause sectors of the economy to stagnate. I am condent we've implemented a workable and pragmatic solution to this decades-old issue. The newrules are a vehicle for behavioural change and a shift in payment culture which will produce long-termresults. Rather than impose punitive measures that willdo little to improve the delivery of public services, we will work with outsourcing partners to try and get them where they need to be. Outsourcers deliver vital public services, savings for the public purse, create opportunities for smaller suppliers and are a consistent source of innovation. But we need to ensure the health of the whole supply chain and I am determined to look after the wellbeingof small businesses. That's why we have clearly set out these new rules. It is now for our outsourcing partners to meet them. Simon Hart MP, Minister for Implementation at the Cabinet Office in the UK, underlines an aspect of his brief that concerns managing the government's relationship with our commercial suppliers, with a focus on the importance of prompt payments Simon Hart MP Minister for Implementation Cabinet Office Tel: +44 (0)20 7276 1234publiccorrespondence@cabinetoffice.gov.uk www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office www.twitter.com/cabinetofficeuk Simon Minister for Implementation at the Cabinet OfficeWe have come a long way since January 2013 when the Public Services (Social Value) Act was implemented and there is now clear evidence that the Act is not only transforming the relationship between the public sector and its suppliers but also that it is delivering real additional value for those organisations embed- ding it properly into how they are doing business. Leading organisations are now deliv- ering an additional +20% for every pound spent which for a typical council spending \u00a3100 million per year could be as much as an additional +\u00a320 million for local communities. However, councils can and should be doing more to help their suppliersdeliver and it is disappointing that so few buyers make it easy to find social value policies and nor do they provide toolkits. A survey carried out by Social Value Portal to assess how easy it was to find and download guidance about social value on councils' websites found that barely 10% of councils have a social value policy available to suppliers and only 17% mention it in their procurement strategy leaving a staggering 73% who make no mentionof social value on their website at all. But the total opportunity is enormous and with a total local and central government spend of \u00a3188 billion per year, this could lead to an additional\u00a336 billion of social value for our communities which is extended even further by an additional \u00a315 billion if social value were to be embedded into planning; Surely a prize worth fighting for? What is the Social Value Act? Social Value refers to the wider finan- cial and non-financial value created by an organisation through its day to day activities in terms of the wellbeing of individuals and communities, social capital created and the environment. Social Value is defined through the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012 (Act) which came into force in January 2013 and requires all public sector organisations (and their suppli- ers) to look beyond the financial cost of a contract and consider how the services they commission and procure might improve the economic, social and environmental well-being of an area. As local authorities are becoming increasingly financially self-reliant and central government budgets are cut, they need to be looking at how to make their limited resources go even further while still maintaining the qual- ity and breadth of services. Social value represents an area where additional community benefits can be derived and may be seen as a complementary activity to other strategies such as commercialisation.What are the benefits? The Act provides a significant oppor- tunity for the public sector to engage with its supply chain by rewarding organisations that go beyond the provision of just the core contract requirements to deliver more value for the community. This can deliver solutions that are the most economi- cally advantageous and will also, over the long-term, help to reduce cost and build a more resilient, healthy and economically strong community. Key benefits can include: Better value for money delivering more for the public pound by requir- ing your suppliers to do more than 'just' deliver the core services. Increases local spend by rewarding organisations that are local or have a local supply chain, especially SMEs and VCSEs. Increases opportunities for disadvan- taged people and promotes social mobility. Promotes a responsible supply chain by requiring businesses to compete. Leads to a cleaner, greener city. Builds stronger more resilient communities. Leads to greater innovation and long-term thinking.Guy Battle, CEO OF Social Value Portal explains how social value has now gone mainstream, including how the Public Services (Social Value) Act has transformed the relationship between the public sector and its suppliersSocial value goes mainstream 479PROFILEHow can social value be measured? The National Social Value Task Force sponsored by the LGA and supported by Social Value Portal developed and published the National Social Value Measurement (National TOMs) Frame - work in 2017. The National TOMs were the culmination of over 18 months consultation with over 40 separate public and private sector organisations designed to help organisations identify and measure the social value being delivered through a contract. The TOMs are built around five Themes, 18 Outcomes and 38 Measures (hence the name TOMs) that reflect activities that a potential supplier could provide in addition to the delivery of the core service that they are being engaged for. Typically, this might mean jobs for those furthest from the job market, spend with local SMEs, opportunities for voluntary organisations, environ-mental improvements and volunteering in the community. Each opportunity isgiven a value that reflects the fiscal and economic benefits for the community and allows organisations to report their total contribution to society through the contract they are delivering. How is the Act being applied? There is no one way to embed the Act and organisations should considerwhat is best for their communities and suppliers to allow them to collaborate in the way that unlocks the most value. Despite the fact that the Act is specif- ically aimed at the commissioning and procurement of services contracts(e.g. consulting services, repairs and building maintenance as a 'service') falling under the EU ProcurementRegulations, many local authorities are choosing to extend the Act to cover all of their tendered contracts (services, goods and works) usually above \u00a3100,000. In addition, they arelooking at how the Act could be included within the planning process.Across the UK, planning represents an annual opportunity of delivering anadditional \u00a315 billion per year However, there is an emerging consensus on what good practice looks like and public bodies looking to maximise its steps should consider the following: Social Value Policy. Ensure that coun- cil policies, especially those relating to procurement, mention social value and describe how suppliers must consider it within their proposals. Weightings. Ensure that an appropri- ate and stand-alone weighting is used within the procurement evalu- ation. Total weightings should be 10- 20% requiring bidders to submit afinancial proposal (using the TOMs) and a method statement to ensure their supplier has the capabilities of delivering against their pledges. Thresholds. Agree on a threshold above which all procurements con- tain a requirement for social value (e.g., \u00a3100,000). This will ensure con- sistency across the council and sends a clear message to your suppliers. Build Capacity. Work with your sup- pliers, especially SMEs and voluntary organisations to help them under- stand opportunities and provide support to build market capacity. Make it easy! Make it as easy as pos- sible for suppliers to understand and deliver social value. You should make all of your policies easily accessible, publish supporting information such as needs analysis and provide links to local delivery partners. Going global In 2015, world leaders agreed to 17 goals for a better world by 2030. The Global Goals have now been adopted 480PROFILE Themes Outcomes Jobs: Promote Local Skills and EmploymentMore local people in employment More opportunities for disadvantaged people Improved skills for local people Improved employability of young people Growth: Supporting Growth of Responsible Regional BusinessMore opportunities for local SMEs and VCSEs Improving sta wellbeing Ethical Procurement is promoted A workforce and culture that reflect the diversity of the local community Social Value embedded in the supply chain Social: Healthier, Safer and more Resilient CommunitiesCrime is reduced Creating a healthier community Vulnerable people are helped to live independently More working with the Community Environment: Protecting and Improving Our EnvironmentClimate Impacts are reduced Air pollution is reduced Better places to live Sustainable Procurement is promoted Innovation: Promoting Social InnovationOther measures (TBD) Figure 1: The National TOMs comprise 5 Themes, 18 Outcomes supported by 38 Measures481PROFILE by 193 world leaders and are designed to catalyse global action in order to end poverty, fight inequality and stop climate change. They require the active participation of all sectors of society: governments, businesses, civil society and the general public. There is a significant overlap between local government priorities and the Global Goals and as a result the LGA passed a motion at its 2019 annual conference in support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the role of local government in delivering them. There is also a clear alignment between the sustainability agenda promoted by the Global Goals and the social value promoted by the National TOMs Framework and organisations deliver- ing social value through the NationalTOMs are very likely to be contributing to the Global Goals agenda. For those organisations that are already contributing or want to start to contribute to the Global Goalsagenda, the TOMs can help organisa- tions answer the questions: \"How Can the National TOMs Contribute to the Global Goals for Sustainable Develop- ment?\" - and explore how different Measures contribute to specific Goals. FAQs Does embedding social value lead to price increases? If applied well, with the correct weightings and proper education of suppliers there is clear evidence that embedding social value into procure- ment delivers additional value; there is no evidence that the Act is leading to price increases as long as appropri- ate balance in weightings is found alongside 'price' and 'quality'. What about SMEs? The TOMs provide a level playing field as all bidders are provided with the same list of opportunities, regardless of their size. However, it is essential that local authorities recognise that SMEs have less resources and that they look at way to build knowledge and capacity in the market place.What weightings should we use? Weightings should be high enough to send a clear signal to the market that social value is important but not so high that bidders add costs to boost their social value score. 10-20% is presently recognised as good practice. What happens if a contractor does not deliver? The key to preventing failure to deliv- ery is to make sure that suppliers do not over-promise in order to win the work. It is, therefore, essential that the tender documents make it very clear that successful bidders will be contrac- tually held to their commitments and that there are a range of remedies available to councils if a contractor fails to deliver including holding back payments for non-delivery.

At Proxima, we've been trying to envi- sion what the future of procurement could look like and how commercial teams can influence their organisations to drive even more value out of their supply chains. Of course, technological advances will be a part of this; driving efficiency, speeding up decision-making, improv- ing data availability and quality, but other factors and drivers are also coming to the fore in the current climate: social and sustainability objec- tives, welfare and wellbeing issues, all contributing to an overall desire for \"innovation\" and \"creativity\" to meet these needs. The value equation is, therefore, no longer a simple a cost versus quality comparison but has become increas- ingly complex as the number of vari- ables multiplies. Embracing the digital trend If we don't embrace digital in procure- ment and commercial, it will embraceus anyway. You can't live a day in the world of procurement without hear- ing from those anxious to \"go digital\", to adopt the latest AI, \"to automate\",to find the edgiest algorithm machine learning etc. etc. But practically-speak- ing, how applicable is this to solving procurement's issues...? Our advice to our clients is: don't start by thinking about technology! Think about why you need technology and what benefits it will bring to the way you operate.Modern procurement professionals are not just trying to go digital; they should be trying to change the value proposition of a future-ready Procure- ment function. The function of the future is a tech-enabled, high-capability business partner, capable of bringing real market insight to the stakeholders whenever they need it (insight part- ners), and capable of building net- works of suppliers and stakeholders to launch the latest innovative prod- ucts and services (network partners). The evolution of the commercial function as we see it is shown in the diagram overleaf: This is really important - technology is going to help enhance and free up from the transactional, through the analytical and eventually to the spot- buy and much of sourcing itself, as well as providing insights further down the supply chain to manage risk. In other words, digital procure- ment technology is going to shrink the base of the procurement organisation pyramid.Is the public sector being left behind? It's very tempting to see public sector procurement as being stifled by bureaucracy and regulation, unable to access the best suppliers and most innovative solutions or practices. Yet that would ignore the great strides taken in recent years to improve the competence, working practices and collaborative working that have been driven by individual departments, the Government Commercial Function,Crown Commercial Service and other cross-functional organisations. It wouldalso underestimate significantly the complexity of the landscape. Asking colleagues about their experi- ence of working with our clients, we highlighted many ways in which the public sector is actually ahead of the game in best practice management of sourcing and supplier management as well as having the skills to deliver this, such as: \"The processes force more discipline in setting out requirements and how we'regoing to evaluate them.\" \"Suppliers don't get complacent due to fixed-term contracts.\" \"The definition of 'value' can be much broader than simply cost - issues such as social value, sustainability and the use of SMEs make for richer decision- making.\"Commercial teams in the public sector are taking huge strides to improve their capability and influence, but do we risk being blinded by undeliverable promises and expectations? Proxima tell us more here about the future of procurementThe future of procurement is bright... but are we staring at the sun? 482PROFILE\"Suppliers are treated more fairly and in a less cavalier fashion than in much of the private sector.\" Yet at the same time, we also see that \"some buyers are scared of conversa- tions with the market,\" \"the fear of challenge leads people to default to certain tried and tested procedures,\" and as a result \"buyers' ability to be proactive and develop the market is constrained.\" So what's stopping you? Within the public sector there are some inherent obstacles in the path of a radical change of direction: 1. Investment in technology is fre- quently constrained by budgets that demand short-term cost reductions from any investment - too often pro- curement-related investments havehistorically under-delivered against their business case and other political priorities will often hold sway over \"back office\" investments. 2. Regulations - the perception that public contracts regulations (PCR 2015)hinder the effective use of supply mar- kets is strongly-held in many organisa- tions. Supplier days, innovation forums and an increasing use of negotiated procedures and even innovation part- nerships are all examples of public sector teams embracing the need to work with suppliers. 3. Government policies - there's a lot for the modern-day commercial pro- fessional to do alongside 'traditional' procurement activities: many new policies and drivers are coming to the fore, such as social value, where sup- pliers need to show how they can help improve society by tackling issues such as modern slavery and climate change, and; prompt payment, espe- cially to SMEs, to increase resilience in the supply chain. 4. Cultural - resistance to change and the reliance on \"how we've always done things\" is probably the one way in which public sector buyers and stakeholders may fail to grasp the opportunities the future could bring; and in this, it is no different to the private sector.So, take inspiration from the many good news stories from across Govern- ment Commercial, and in particular use the Government Commercial Function's role in sharing best practices and building coordinated strategies and approaches. In order to drive tan- gible behaviour change, departments now need to consider how to practi- cally adopt these best practices into everyday ways of working, and tracktheir own journey to meet the higher commercial standards which are now expected and achievable in this new era of Government Commercial.

The distinction is important and we at CCS urge customersto consider it carefully before embarking on the process: If you need a temporary worker for business-as-usual or service delivery activities, you need a contingent labour solution; this includes interim managers and specialist contractors. The worker will more thanlikely be part of a team and be line managed on a time basis rather than output. A typical example of a contingent labour solution is back-lling a permanent hire who may be on long-term sick or maternity leave.Contingent labour can also be used on a specic,time-limited project. However, if you're looking for objective, time-limited advice outside the business-as-usual environment when in-house skills aren't available, you need consultancy support. Consultancy tends to relate tothe strategy, structure, management or operations of your organisation to help you achieve your objectives.They might work outside of business as usual hours, dene a level of resource, assume a degree of risk, solve a problem for you, set outcomes and be paid based on output.

Public sector procurement should addvalue beyond the goods and services being procured and should positively impact communities, local economies and the environment. With this in mind, NEPO launched a number of pilot projects to trial measurement of social value using the NationalThemes, Outcomes and Measures (TOMs) framework. The pilots cover a range of procurements including solutions for electricity, agency staff, consultancy and training providers. To date, five of the pilot projects have been awarded and have calculated a proxy value of \u00a3135 million in social value commitments, including appren - ticeship schemes, school engagement and community volunteering. Thissuccess has resulted in NEPO adopting the TOMs framework across all new procurement activity. What's next for NEPO? NEPO has entered an exciting phase, with a revitalised strategy that features a strong commercial focus. This will see the organisation further support its associate membership base, export North East supplier talent across the UK and extend a greater range of offerings beyond the public sector through different operating models. Collaboration continues to underpin everything we do. NEPO's successful strategic partnership with The Pro- curement Partnership Limited (TPPL)on a range of fleet solutions is a testa- ment to the opportunities in this area. In addition, cross-government collab- oration through our chairmanship of the Government Commercial Function Northern Group and membership ofthe LGA National Advisory Groupensures that best-practice and leader- ship are at the core of our activities. NEPO will also continue to identify innovative ways to address publicsector challenges. We are currently working with colleagues in Yorkshire and Humber (YORprocure) on 'Open', an ambitious project to develop a single system that seamlessly fulfils public sector requirements for spend analysis, procurement and contract management. Open will enable insightful and informed decision- making, whilst providing supply chains with a transparent and user-friendly platform for doing business with the public sector.

Dating back to the 17th Century, peer-review of research articles is a long-established and important part of the scientific and academic communities. The advent of the internet and web-based technology has decoupled peer- review from its original environment and made it more accessible to the professional and consumer sectors. Previously ad hoc recommendations from trusted friends, fellow profes- sionals and industry experts have effectively been widened and formal - ised, with the creation of dedicated review sites such as Checkatrade and TripAdvisor, as well as retail platforms such as Amazon and eBay incorporating review functions into their systems. However, these customer rating review systems themselves are not without their faults and are open to exploitation. In addition to customers increasingly suffering from review fatigue, the largely anonymous and unaccountable nature of modern review systems is cultivating a thriving \"fake review\" industry. Which? recently described the number of fake reviews on Amazon as unacceptable, whilst the Competition and Markets Author- ity (CMA) is urging eBay and Facebookto take action against the numerous fake review services that are being offered via their platforms. Govern- ments across the world are scram- bling to get ahead of the evolving fake review industry; with the CMA warn- ing that it's illegal to either solicit or write fake reviews, U.S. Congress sum- moning the Chief Executive of Amazon to explain what his company is doing to tackle the issue and the Italian courts sentencing a man tonine months in prison for selling fake TripAdvisor reviews. As well as over-inflated \"five-star\" fake reviews, there is a similar problem with malicious \"one-star\" ratings given by competitors or those with an axe to grind. The overall effect is that bias is creeping into the peer-review system, skewing the playing field and eroding trust in the system's integrity. Review sites still have a valid role to play in modern vetting systems. Indeed, in its recent Market Study on Statutory Audit Services, the CMA is recommending giving the regulator the power to appoint a reviewer \"toimprove audit quality and by intro - ducing an additional, independent quality check\" in certain pre-defined circumstances. The underlying theme is that in order for review systems to be trusted, they need to be robust, measured againstthe same universally accepted standards and independently verified. However, there is no need to reinvent the wheel as the process of accredited testing, inspection and certification are already delivering confidence in the integrity of peer-review systems in a wide number of fields. The United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) itself is subject to a peer-review process by other national accreditation bodies from overseas. In the health and social care system, UKAS accreditation helps deliver confidence in the competence and impartiality of both clinical peer reviews and scientific data. UKAS is part of the NHS England Knowledge Partnership Network programme, which aims to enable the information exchange between clinical and scientific leaders of high-value new approaches to improving patient outcomes, increasing efficiency and inward investment in life sciences. Following a submission to the CareQuality Commission (CQC) third party peer- review and accreditation scheme panel, three UKAS healthcare accredi- tation schemes (Clinical PathologyAccreditation, the Imaging Services Accreditation, and Physiological Services (IQIPS)) are now formally recognised as part CQC inspec- tion programme. UKAS also accredits organisations that carry out a peer-review of health and social care Suzi Daley, External Affairs Manager at United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS), focuses her thoughts on customer rating review systems online and UKAS accreditation in the health and social care systemCustomer rating review systems and UKAS accreditation 488PROFILEservices against quality standards developed from National guidance. Far from being unique to the healthand social care sectors, the principles, benefits and lessons learned from UKAS accrediting these peer-review systems are readily transferable to other industries. UKAS is currently engaged in liaising with government and the regulators to identify the peer-review sectors where accredita- tion would be most effective and would welcome dialogue with industry bodies, key stakeholders and other interested parties. About UKAS The United Kingdom Accreditation Service is the sole national accreditation body recognised by the UK Government to assess the competence, integrityand impartiality of organisations carrying out conformity assessment activities e.g. testing, calibration, inspection and certification against international standards. UKAS accred- itations underpin a wide range of economic and other activities, as wellas government policy in areas such as environmental management, food safety and quality, medical services and forensic science. More recently, we have been working with government and industry partners to develop new schemes in areas such as climate change, aesthetic medicine, cybersecu- rityand the internet of things (IoT).

We've been on both since they launched and recently noticed a worrying trend of government departments using the Digital Marketplace to procure so-called 'bench contracts'. These are where a buyer procures a team or individu- als with particular specialisms at short notice. Done the right way, it could be a way to fund teams rather than projects , or take a \"one team, many outcomes\" approach. But if they go wrong (and they often do) they risk reducing the ability of teams to do good work and as a result, erode the quality of public services. They can disadvantage smaller rms, yet these frameworks were put in place to help the public sector benet from the agility and innovation of the self-same small andmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs). After 14 years working in central government, I under- stand commercial realities and why bench contracts are attractive. They oer buyers the flexibility to draw down against existing contracts to bring in teams or individuals to meet challenging deadlines in shifting contexts, without having to engage in drawn-out business cases, procurement exercises, evaluation and everything else required to bring in suppliers. However, the pressure to spin up teams or provide individuals at very short notice - often two weeks - reinforces short-termism and impacts on quality. Working this way doesn't help organisations build their own capability or retain history and institutional memory. And no good supplier is going to have a team of great people waiting for a call. They can juggle theirschedules to spin up teams quickly, but this means shrinking or swapping teams elsewhere, which will impact on other clients' projects. Some larger suppliers might have a number of juniors available, but it's unlikely they will have experienced sta on standby with the capability to build services that meet the Service Standard . Making it work At dxw, we always engage constructively to nd the right way ahead. Companies who have won contracts like this have the practical experience of how to get the best value from them. We recently attended a Crown Commercial Service-sponsored event with some of our SME peers where we talked about many of these issues and look forward to more. As a community, we have to get this right or we risk a return to the oligopoly of old where a small number of big suppliers dominate and we all suer the consequences of poor service delivery. In the meantime, as bench-style procurements become more common, we've identied four things that would help them create better outcomes for both users and buyers and ultimately for all of us as taxpayers. 1) Set realistic start dates The pressure to start immediately means neither buyer nor suppliers are ready to achieve anything valuable. This means the rst few weeks of any engagement are spent getting the team in a position to start work and understand the brief. Sensible start dates and mobilisation times would givesuppliers sucient time to mobilise the right team for the job. Just as importantly, they would give buyer teams time to be ready to start work. David Mann, Managing Director, dxw digital shares his expert thoughts on making bench contracts work, including the UK Government's G-Cloud and Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS) frameworksGOVERNMENT 4912) Genuinely work together Bench contracts require a close partnership and trust to deliver real value for users and buyers alike. That means a partnership where the suppliers can use their expertise to influence and shape the project portfolios to best meet the needs of users. Partnerships can be particularly helpful to build capability and support for smaller and medium-sized organisations, or functions, where a small number of experienced people can make a huge dierence to the future success of the work. Public sector organisations need to work alongside their chosen supplier, as the supplier will not have the knowledge of the business and ability to operate within it without that context. For example, current work with the Maritime & Coastguard Agency is an example of a partnership to deliver a series of projects, all working towards the same organisational goal, that is to become a digital organisation. Therefore, one begins with the condence that a pipeline of future work lies ahead and can be staed appropriately. Buyers need to honestly appraise their internal capa- bility and ability to operate these type of arrangements. Managing a large portfolio of work is hard, even for the most digitally mature organisations. It requires experience to understand the necessary trade-os and inevitable compromises, while maintaining a focus on user needs and quality. 3) Use the Service Standard The Service Standard is not a veneer that can be applied after work is done. It must be the bedrock on which the product or service is researched, built and operated. The danger with rapid deployment and thepressure to deliver fast means that corners will be cut. Meeting the Service Standard should not be one ofthem. 4) Encourage partnerships One of the ways these contracts could add value is ifthey are designed to be as friendly as possible to SMEs working together. Dierent companies bring complementary skill sets and capabilities. For example, we currently partner with Content Design London, AI research consultancy Oxford Insights and Sheeldbased researchers Paper. One company recently won a two-year contract to helpOfsted run discoveries. A specic part of the procure- ment focused on the other organisations the company worked with and the capabilities and specialisms theybrought. There were also questions about how the company could scale to support multiple projects atany one time. The language was key: the buyer was explicit in describing how the opportunity was suitable for SME partnerships. Buyers want to access the besttalent available and working with more than one SME is an eective way to do this. What next? The success of the GCloud and DOS frameworks to date has been because they've met the needs of procurer and supplier while providing better services to the end-user. As a community, it's up to all of us to work together to ensure they continue to do so.

Also, it incorporates regulation of electronic and digital communications, network and information security, for example, plus digital infrastructure and broadband access. This important area of public policy in Sweden also concerns e-government issues, such as usingdigital policy to ensure the activities of government agencies are more ecient and to simplify how the public makes contact with them, for example, using electronic signatures and open data. 1 Anders Ygeman is currently Minister for Energy and Digital Development, within the Ministry of Infrastructure2. On the subject of digital development,we read that in June 2019, Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven met French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, France, where the countries' strategic partnership forinnovation, digital transformation and green solutions was deepened and updated. It is worth noting here that when the aforementioned gentlemen originally entered into this partnership back in November 2017, it was agreed that Sweden and France needed to work together in several strategic areas to better deal with digital transformation and climate adaptation. This partnership is going forward in the future, especially where sustainable development in articial intelligence (AI), 5G and a fossil-free transport sector are concerned, as well as achieving inclusive climate-neutral cities by 2030.The exciting future of digital development in Sweden is explored here, with a focus on the potential of artificial intelligence The exciting future of digital development in SwedenGOVERNMENT495\"It is natural that we cooperate to benet from digitalisation and speed up the green transition through investment in articial intelligence and batteries, areas where Sweden and the largest EU Member States are at the forefront. They are central to a European industrial strategy,\" Minister for Enterprise and Innovation IbrahimBaylan comments. 3 Picking up on the aforementioned theme of AI, you maylike to know that the Swedish Government has identied an overall direction for such work in Sweden and to lay the foundation for future priorities, here . One highlight of this document is how AI can make a massive contribution to the economic growth of Sweden, amongst other areas. \"AI has the potential to contribute signicant benets in a variety of areas through increased economic growth, and solutions to environmental and social challenges. According to some studies, the use of AI has great potential to increase economic growth. \"Examples of the contributions that AI can make are already evident: AI can help to better identify diseases, lower energy consumption, reduce trac accidents,create new services, streamline industrial production, develop new pharmaceutical products and shorten processing times.\" 4I commend you to read more about this very exciting area of AI but let's nish by looking at how in 2018, the Nordic and Baltic regions expanded their cooperation to keep their position as Europe's leading region in the policy area of digital development. The then Ministerfor Housing and Digital Development, Peter Eriksson said: \"Our region is currently the European leader on digital development. Today's AI declaration means expanding the cooperation between our countries. Now Sweden is also taking on the responsibility of leading the Nordic-Baltic cooperation into the next stage, by moving the work forward and proposing necessary measures.\" 5 References 1 https://www.government.se/government-policy/digital-policy/ 2 Ygeman \"Examples of the contributions that AI can make are already evident: AI can help to better identify diseases, lower energy consumption, reduce traffic accidents, create new services, streamline industrial production, develop new pharmaceutical products and shorten processing times.\"GOVERNMENTBrexit has been the centre of UK politics for some years already, with people on both sides of the debate arguing that leaving or staying in the European Union (EU) will have an immediate effect on their quality of life. Yet, a recent article in the FT titled \"What the UK's 'left-behind' areas want after Brexit\" highlighted that better public services, more tight-knit com- munities and increased job opportuni-ties were key concerns for both sides. Indeed, for the population, the percep- tion of how well the EU or the British government is doing is often amalga-mated with how well their local authority is performing. After all, it's all about the simple things: are jobs stay-ing in the area? Is my neighbourhood safe? How easy and quick is it to apply for a benefit or access a government service if I have to? Regardless of where people stand on Brexit, there is an overarching concern with the 'Local'. One of the EU's working principles, subsidiarity, holds that problems of a certain scale must be tackled on that same scale. This is why we don't expect the EU to issue directives related to local bin collection frequency or local library opening times. Yet, although states have put a lot of effort into pooling sovereignty \"up\" to tackle, say, the movement of goods and people,they have often been bad at pooling sovereignty in the opposite direction. They have not sufficiently empowered local authorities to increase citizen participation in decision-making at a local level or allowed councils to invest in improving access to and delivery of local services. Developments in technology provide an opportunity to become more responsive to public needs, modernise service delivery and increase trans- parency. Local governments can be at the centre of this digital transforma- tion. The reason is simple: they inter- act with businesses, citizens and other public service organisations with a very high frequency, generating a myriad of granular data. However,keeping pace with the expectations of digital citizens, exploiting data and making the right organisational changes is difficult. In an adverse budgetary context, it may seem like there are other, more pressing priorities. We know that austerity has left local governments fighting to keep the lights on in the UK. In Scotland, devo-lution hasn't meant that local author- ities have the funding or staff requiredto fulfil their new missions. Residents everywhere complain that libraries close, doctors disappear and that communication with the authorities isinadequate. A recent LGA poll on resi- dent satisfaction with councils found a significant decline between 2013 and 2018, with residents \"feeling well- informed\" dropping by 17% and \"satis- fied with the local council\" falling by 13% during the period. Such deteriorat- ing customer experience is concerning. \"Our company, Novoville, is making it its mission to save the local, and re-establish trust between people and government. That's why we offer a civic engagement platform which transforms the way citizens interact and transact with their local government, reducing friction and costs.\" We believe that putting local residents back at the centre of the frame and harnessing their collective intelligence is a key part of the solution to this crisis of the 'local', with positive conse- quences for the country as a whole. Contrary to what most in the sectorFotis Talantzis, CEO & Co-Founder of Novoville tells us how councils can solve Brexit by transforming public services with digital 496PROFILE \"The council that solved Brexit\": Digital transformation and better business process for local authorities Fotis Talantzisbelieve, this doesn't hinge on spend- ing lavish sums of money on grand transformation programs, but it does have a lot to do with applying newtechnology intelligently and improving business processes incrementally to deliver open, responsive and partici- patory public services. To achieve this, emphasis must be placed on both access and delivery of services. If you improve the interface with residents, but delivery is not efficient, all you're doing is raising residents' expectations and creating more work for the council's staff. If you fail to improve the interface with residents, however, their satisfaction and engagement rates will continue to drop, accentuating this impression of being ignored or left behind. Our company, Novoville, is making it its mission to save the local, and re-establish trust between people and government. That's why we offer a civic engagement platform which transforms the way citizens interact and transact with their local govern- ment, reducing friction and costs. It allows councils to capture all incoming resident communications and issues ina single system. It gives residents access to all the digital services offered by the council in one place. It allows everyone to engage with their local authority using whichever channel best suits their needs: a free mobile app, web app, chatbots, or social media. Everything is intuitive, the experience the same across devices, and it's built to enabledialogue. Yet, we know that technology itself isn't a silver bullet. That's why Novoville always starts by auditing and improving business processes. We also know that simply making technol- ogy available is no guarantee that people will use it. That's why Novovillealso helps with the process of reaching out to residents, raising awareness about local matters and engaging with them on social media. At Novoville, we take a piecemeal approach: we solve problem by prob- lem and improve process by process. We don't impose multi-million pound contracts or locked-in multi-year deals. We offer training, technology and transfer of skills, and we deliver it in two to three months. Our focus is solely on empowering the Local. In councils like Watford and Guernsey, Novoville has tripled responses to con- sultations on local matters. Using our in-house chatbot technology, councils can start an automated discussion and collect local intelligence on any popular chat application. Thousands of people have already voiced their opinion quickly and easily, achieving an average of 65% re-engagement rate. This costs 20% of traditional consultation methods...For cities as large as Athens (700,000 residents and 2 million daily com- muters), Novoville has served as a state-of-the-art CRM system. Within six months of Novoville operation, post-crisis Athens handled more than 60,000 citizen requests and resolved 84% of them. New processes have saved thousands of man-hours,increasing municipal services' efficiency by 24%. Three months later, Novoville complemented this with a brand-new parking app able to integrate sensor data (e.g. occupancy of a parking spot) in real time. On the whole, with an easy way to report a local problem, give their opinion, and buy mobility in the city, residents feel listened to and their city finally feels like it's improving. Athenians are not alone: at present, 3 million people around Europe have started rebuilding their relationship with the local through Novoville. Whether you're a diverse regional city, a market town or a rural community, Novoville can help you solve your key local issues. Over time, this will have a big impact on the perception of problems that have led to decisions as important as Brexit. The local is the key to a bottom-up regeneration of moredemocratic, sovereign and indepen- dent communities. That's a good startfor the country. the new European Commissioners? The President of the European Commission is the rst woman to hold the role, Ursula von der Leyen. Voted in on 16th July 2019, she is described by the Commission as a \"European by heart and byconviction\", with an aspirational climate plan to make Europe the rst climate-neutral continent by 2050. Her Commission is gender-balanced, and she further urges her Commissioners to consider the talents of allin the European Union (EU) regardless of race, sexuality and gender for the formation of their own cabinets. In Leyen's agenda for the future, she said: \"It is an aspiration of living in a natural and healthy continent. Of living in a society where you can be who you are, live where you like, love who you want and aim as high as you want. It is an aspiration of a world full of new technologies and age-old values. Of a Europe that takes the global lead on the major challenges of our times.\" With 200 million voters in 28 EU countries going to thepolls to elect MEPs in May 2019 and the ongoinguncertainty of Brexit negotiations, the executive body of Europe has taken on a new level of signicance. This Commission will sit from 2019 to 2024. On 10th September, she announced a list of new Commissioners, who are currently waiting to take their new posts. Who are the new Commissioners?

A look at some of the key players: 1. Frans Timmermans, European Green Deal Timmermans began his career in 1980, with a degree in French language and literature. He worked his way through foreign aairs and embassies, joining the PartijHere, we discuss the freshly elected European Commissioners of the 2019-2024 period, including their duties and a vision of the EU their work could shape499van de Arbeid (Dutch Labour Party) in 1998. His last role in the EU was related to Inter-Institutional Relations, the Rule of Law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. His new portfolio is the European Green Deal, which includes \"leading international negotiations\" to encourage other States to increase their environmental ambition, and putting forward a cohesive \"Just Transition Fund\" to help those most aected during the Green Deal transition, e.g. coal regions. 2. Maro efovi, Interinstitutional Relations and Foresight Moving from the Energy, Space policy and (temporarily) the Digital Single Market portfolio to this one, efovi is being returned to the department he worked for in 2010-2014. He has been given a legislative focus incontrast to the applied policy and cacophony of evolving topics in his former role. He is now to focus on elements such as \"the Commission's work on the European Battery Alliance\" and help Member States to \"avoid unnecessary additional red tape\" when converting \"EU legislation into national law.\" 3. Stella Kyriakides, Health Starting with a degree in Psychology, Kyriakides then worked in several roles that touched on NationalCancer Strategy and clinical psychology, becoming a representative to the European Commission on health matters in 2018.She is now focusing on the Health portfolio, which includes ghting vaccination myths, ensuring \"thesupply of aordable medicines\" for Europe, and the \"Farm to Fork\" strategy, which focuses on the food chain to support a circular economy and further ensure sustainable practices. 4. Kadri Simson, Energy With a degree in history and subsequently political science, Simson moved through advisory and research roles, even working for NATO. As of 2009 she became a member of the Estonian Centre Party, through which she became the Leader of the NATO parliamentary assembly delegation for Estonia. From here, she joins the European Commission. Her Energy portfolio largely overlaps with the European Green Deal, with goals to rapidly implement cleanenergy, the potential of aordable liqueed natural gas, and the design of the \"new Carbon Border Tax\". In the mission letter, the new president emphasises that 50 million European households are unable to aord heating and highlights solving this crisis as a priority. 5. Virginijus Sinkeviius, Environment and Oceans Sinkeviius has worked in economic policy and withfarmers, whilst also spending time as an editor after attaining his Master of Arts in European Studies. He was formerly Minister of Economy and Innovation, which lends to the current role managing Environment and Oceans. President Leyen describes the natural resources of the EU as \"great natural and economic wealth\", highlighting the importance of an economist's mind in nurturing both. His work will include managing the Biodiversity Strategy 2030, attempting to secure an agreement between States at the 2020 Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and full implementation of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy. Open Access Government editorial@openaccessgovernment.org www.openaccessgovernment.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGov GOVERNMENTGOVERNMENT 500The evolving workplace: How the digital economy has expanded boundaries The digital economy has expanded boundaries and driven a fundamental shift in the nature of business meaning the 9-5 work life has changed dramatically. It's almost unrecognisable. The World Bank recently published its World Develop- ment Report for 2019 on The Changing Nature of Work - a study of how work is changing as a result of advances in technology. While the report addresses the impact of technological progress on the workforce - nding that life expectancy has gone up; basic health care and education are widespread, and that most people have seen their incomes rise - it also looks at the future of work and how it is being driven by the competing forces of 'AI', automation and innovation. \"There is no doubt that companies thrive and win when their workers feel informed, valued and engaged. The technology and the devices now exist to drive employee engagement and help both the business and people who are the driving force to flourish.\" Interestingly, it found recent evidence for Europe that suggests while technology replaces some workers, it also raises labour demand. Overall, the technology that replaces routine work is estimated to have created more than 23 million jobs across Europe from 1999 to 2016. These ndings coupled with the fact that the digital economy has expanded boundaries and driven a fundamental shift in the nature of business means the 9-5 work life has changed dramatically. It's almost unrecognisable. In 2018, the Oce for National Statis- tics reported that the UK national unemployment rate had fallen to 4.1%, its lowest since 1975 and the UK gig economy has now grown to an estimated 5 million self-employed people. According to Consultancy.uk this shift correlates with a huge boom in self-employmentand freelance employment, as part of a much-heralded decline of the conventional job, following the 2008 nancial crisis. The professional services sector has been a major driver for growth with the number of freelance workers reaching 2 million since 2001. These 'gig' or freelance workers are also likely to be part of the over 2.7 billion people known as 'deskless work- ers', spanning industries such as agriculture, education,healthcare and retail to hospitality, manufacturing, transportation and construction. And businessesappear to be embracing this new approach to resourc- ing and servicing their requirements. Why and how? They're adopting the technology and mobile computing platforms to reach people with the right skills, in the right place and at the right time. How people can work hasn't just changed, it's 'who' is actually working has also evolved. There's no doubt that millennials have had a huge impact on how businesses operate, calling for greater transparency, flexibility and demanding that organisations make themselves more attractive to the workforce. And businesses are also nding a new wave of worker too, the 70+ which has increased 131% in the UK alone over the last decade thanks to pensioner poverty. Diverse workforce Never before have businesses faced a more diverse workforce and with it, these employees come with very specic needs and wants. The advent of social media, messaging and smartphones have made some indus- tries, such as retail, get smart on how to capture their target audiences. People want that personalised, con- sumer experience to transcend into their workplace. They are no longer just a national insurance number;they are as unique as their DNA. So how do businesses go about addressing these needs?Cyrus Gilbert-Rolfe, EMEA MD SocialChorus explains the nature of the evolving workplace in terms of how the digital economy has expanded boundaries and driven a fundamental shift in the nature of businessGOVERNMENT 501It's an employee engagement predicament, if ever there was. Business leaders are facing a variety of chal- lenges from the tight job market, to \"fake news\" and \"digital water coolers\" running rampant in the enter- prise, to digital distractions inundating employees withinformation. It's never been more dicult yet critical to keep employees aligned and informed. Gallup has looked at employee engagement over the years andmost recently cited that over two-thirds of employees today are classied as not engaged, costing businesses 21% less protability on top of productivity, retention and customer engagement. \"Interestingly, it found recent evidence for Europe that suggests while technology replaces some workers, it also raises labour demand. Overall, the technology that replaces routine work is estimated to have created more than 23 million jobs across Europe from 1999 to 2016.\" The best internal communicators understand theiraudience and support employee engagement thatdrives desired business outcomes. And a more con- nected workforce is a catalyst for improved business results. Dierent employees consume content dier-ently and with today's diverse workforce the needs are going to vary greatly. Some employees will check emailregularly, others only have access to their smartphones or tablets during work, some may prefer a phone call or a notice on the company intranet. One method ofcommunication will not be enough. Businesses need to meet employees where they are, and this includes having a plan in place in case their primary means ofcommunication is not available. One area where companies are continually failing is in spamming their employees and assuming that one size ts all. This observation breaks down into a few keyareas. Content should be bite-sized and varied as the data from a recent SocialChorus study showed that employees use their company app for around two min- utes at a time. That doesn't necessarily mean the con- tent should be shorter, but it does need to be broken up with headlines, photos, links and other content that is easy to scan or read on smaller screens. The way in which it is presented should all be mixed up. A variety of visuals ranging from photos to infographics will help employees to grasp your communications more easily.There is no doubt that companies thrive and win when their workers feel informed, valued and engaged. The technology and the devices now exist to drive employee engagement and help both the business and peoplewho are the driving force to flourish. In today's cutthroat environment businesses really can't aord to keep doing the same old newsletters and emails knowing thatno-one is reading or interested. An engaged workforce is a loyal one. Intelli- gence, was plucked from history and adopted in 1956 to describe the processing logic of a programmable computer. It's quite marvellous that we are still using an expression coined over sixty years ago to describe the kind of 'futuristic technologies' that many of us are only just beginning to acknowledge - yet so far few of us have experienced. But while for most of the time since then we have been happy enough to adopt a whole range of technology advances, why in the last ten or 15years have we become increasingly cautious about the growth and development of AI? It might well be because the technologies we've experienced in the general office workplace so far haven't really made the big breakthroughs we were promised they would, and what hasbeen delivered has made only incre- mental differences to our everyday lives. There has been no big bang as such, and so we've had sufficient advance warning and time to adapt, retrain or reinvent our way of working. Whilst in some environments the prospect of working alongside AI has been embraced and is well established, what we're continually being told is AI will in some industries and sectors replace people. We haven't heard too much about the impact AI will have onthe office workplace. Is the workplace immune or have we perhaps beenlured in to a false sense of security because although office-related tech- nology has unmistakably developed, on the whole the office workplace itself remains largely the same -albeit tweaked over time thanks to different generations of fashions in furniture and decoration styles. Is Smart Working creating an opportunity for embracing emerging technologies? Now that Smart Working is being widely acknowledged across both the private and public sectors, however, we should be poised and ready for the next wave of AI related technology- enabled change - not simply withregard to where we work but also how we work. Yet there are still barriers to embracing the real benefits of Smart Working, and some of those barriers include technology - what's available, how we should use it, how well it performs, and how we are supported when we are increasingly reliant on it. Our recent field case studies highlight common Smart Working implementa- tion issues. In amongst broader refer- ences to inconsistent and untargeted communications, one specific issue stands out: the lack of anyone who is able to articulate (in a language anyone in the business can understand) exactly how the technology device, hardware or software about to be implemented will actually improve a User's day-to-day working experience. Too often the purpose for the upgradebecomes muddled by the process of roll-out, and project management 'time and cost' measures dominate feedback. Targets for User improve- ments are rarely defined, and almost never tested or reported and so the prospect of unknown AI related tech- nology entering the workplace can be viewed with dread. But with the principles of Smart Working now firmly established, the opportunity should really exist to embrace the next generation of technologies that will facilitate a step change in our working processes, patterns and styles. In order to foster this culture, we need to recognise and address the challenges that preventmany from fully trusting the technol- ogy solutions already available. But what we also need to do better is engage Users in envisaging what sort of workplace experience they want, and subsequently present better the technologies on offer so that they can be seen to meet those expectations. If we can articulate what we want in non-technical language then we have a better chance of encouraging people to use and benefit from such technology investments. We asked a selection of Users who have already embraced Smart Working to envisage their future workplace experience, highlighting what theyPLACEmaking considers if emphasising the 'artificial' in AI distracts from the range of benefits that are there to be exploited in the Smarter WorkplaceSmarter Workplace: Does the 'artificial' in AI distract us? 502PROFILEthink could be achieved and improved by AI. 'We are now working remotely more and more often. When we do go to our (employer's) office Building we frequently feel like a visitor - tolerated but not necessarily welcome. We want to be able to interact with the Building so that our personal preferences, needs and expec- tations are recognised and facilitated as much as those people based in the building full time. 'When we're working remotely, we want to use that time to concentrate on completing specific tasks or hitting dead- lines. When we go into the office, we're there for a reason which includes collab- orating and interacting with others, so we want the Building to actively connect us with the people who can help solve our problems and assist us with seeking out solutions. We want facilities that support our needs to be available and we want to use space and facilities that will directly help us to complete our intended tasks. We want the Building to do more than that though - we want it to facilitate our activities but also monitor our progress in achieving our planned objectives and nudge us to stay on target and avoid getting distracted'. How could AI change that User experience? 'We want AI to support us in effectively removing repetitive, mindless and basic administrative duties, freeing up our time for tasks and interactions that are more skilled, creative, engaging and empathetic. But we also think AI could help us to solve problems or make better choices.'For example, we want to explore systems that go beyond simple booking or scheduling tools. Perhaps what we want AI to do is not just agree to a basic request for booking travel, but to analyse the request and offer alternative responses or suggestions including options that we may be unaware of or had simply not even considered. AI should be able to adapt to and help solve the issues that we are facing, opening up alternative options for us to consider and poten- tially select.' How could AI help Smart Working support services to operate more effectively? 'What we want is active problem-solving support with dynamic, adaptive help that is tailored to our individual needs rather than simply reading from a script. We need a more intelligent form of assistance that not only records that there is an issue, but analyses the context of the problem we have and provides an intelligent response. 'For example, we often get frustrated by the standard response we get when we contact support services if we've got an ICT problem, which too often is just \"contact the (outsourced) Help Desk\". We then have to repeat over and again what the problem is......only for them eventu- ally to say that we need to take the laptop in (where?) for repair!\". AI should make the response more personal. As well as a first line of support to help us with common problems it should recog- nise our specific circumstance, offer a more appropriate response relevant to the context of our working environment. One size definitely doesn't fit all!'The future of technology in the work- place does not lie with the adoption of AI for the sake of AI, but in using it in an intelligent way that people can recognise will assist them in their day to day duties. Rather than simply being a tool for everyday tasks, AI could - and should - be a valuable con- tributor to the collaborative process: facilitating an ongoing conversation between user and system that not only assists in project development but also acts as an intelligent facilita- tor and collaborator in achieving a valued outcome. Presented in this way, the next wave of AI-based tech- nology should be welcomed and not feared. Not regarded as a background device that sits idly by, only stimulated into use when needed, but instead a fundamental and active part of any team and in partnership with people.

From 1563, when the Statute of Articers rst set up a national framework for apprenticeships, to the present day, the system hasbeen through endless twists, turns and reinventions. Despite this instability, there are a few areas of clear agreement. Firstly, that apprenticeship's structured combination of work and training are a good thing forindividuals, employers and the country. Secondly, there is a need to rebalance the education system away from the academic route. This requires an increase in the status of the vocational route, which is often described as 'parity of esteem'. Higher and degree apprenticeships One requirement for parity of esteem is that an apprenticeship can oer access to a good career and progression. In other words, apprenticeships can't be a dead-end and should be able to oer as clear a path- way to the good life as traditional A levels and degrees. England made a big step forwards when higherapprenticeships (levels four and ve) were introduced in 2010 and degree apprenticeships (levels six and seven) in 2014. Learners can now follow an apprentice- ship pathway and end up just as qualied as someonewho followed the academic path. What is more, the apprentice who has progressed to degree level will have done it without paying university fees and while building up a lot of work experience. Higher and degree apprenticeships have been growing rapidly since their introduction and now makeup around 13% of all apprenticeship starts. Employers are very enthusiastic about higher-levelqualications, particularly in light of the introduction of the apprenticeship levy in 2017, which requires employers to spend 0.5% of their pay bill on appren- ticeships. As one employer that we talked to for our recent research on the apprenticeship system commented, \"Our capacity to spend the levy at the lower end is very limited. We are a high-skill business. If we only recruited at level 3 it wouldn't drive our business forward. Degree apprentices are essential forour business.\" So, the levy is incentivising employer engagement with apprenticeships, but it is only when this is coupled with high-level training opportunities that apprenticeships really become relevant to all employers. What's the problem? In many ways, the introduction of higher apprentice-ships has been a good news story. They have increased the status of apprenticeships and provided appren- tices with a progression route to high-skill careers. What is more, they have been growing steadily and have won over employers. Institute of Student Employers (ISE) has been cam- paigning to support and extend higher and degree apprenticeships as part of a campaign that we launched with the publication of our report, 'Stability, transparency, flexibility and employer ownership: Employer recommendations for improving the apprentice - ship system . Not everyone agrees with us. Some commentatorshave been arguing that higher apprenticeships are too expensive and that they move resources away fromlow skill workers. However, we think that this misses the point and frames the debate on apprenticeships in an unhelpful way.Tristram Hooley , Chief Research Officer, Institute of Student Employers explains precisely why higher apprenticeships are critical to businessHR & TRAINING 505Firstly, employers are not very sympathetic to the government crying poverty. Employers have recently injected a massive new funding stream into the apprenticeship system through the apprenticeship levy. Secondly, there is a need to move away from seeingthe apprenticeship system as a way to address socialinjustice and failures in the educational system. These are important secondary aims, but the primary purpose of the system should be about developing the skills that businesses need. Businesses are telling us that they need higher apprenticeships and so it would be dangerous for the government to try and limit this. What needs to be done? ISE believes that the government should rearm its commitment to higher and degree level apprenticeshipand resist short-sighted calls to restrict access to these apprenticeships on the basis of prior qualications. The specic point about higher apprenticeships is con-nected to a broader vision of how the apprenticeship system should develop. We have outlined four principles that we believe should guide any future revisions and reforms of the system: Stability: Business thrives in a stable environment. The government should ensure that the apprentice- ship system remains as stable as possible and that new innovations are introduced carefully and with employer consultation. Transparency: The apprenticeship system, and particularly decisions about funding, needs to bemade more transparent. Flexibility: Systems need to be designed with an understanding of the operational requirements of running a business. Employer ownership: The government rightly committed to the principle of employer ownership of the system when it was launched. It is important thatthis principle guides all future thinking about the system.

A growing number of organisations in government and across the health sector are now looking at how they can use their Apprenticeship Levy tofund these high-quality management development programmes, which are designed to build the skills and behaviours executives need to lead their people effectively in challenging times. So, what are the key advantages of going down a degree apprenticeship route - and what do organisations need to do to set their programmes up for success? A pragmatic approach Ashridge Executive Education is a key player in the degree apprenticeship market and is leading the way with the development of three, highly prag- matic programmes which aim to raise standards of management practice and equip leaders with the agility and resilience needed to succeed in the new world of work. The Level 6 Degree Apprenticeship is designed to boost the skills and performance of junior and emerging managers, by providing them with thetools and knowledge to make an immediate difference in the workplace. The three-and-a-half-year programme results in the award of a BA in Business and Management. There are two Level 7 programmes. The Executive Masters in Leadership and Management is aimed at fast track, middle and established man- agers who want to stretch themselves using a flexible, self-directed learning approach. The two-year programme covers a range of subjects, from inno- vation to digital transformation, and places a strong emphasis throughout on personal impact and relational skills. The more advanced Executive MBA is targeted at experienced managers and functional specialists who want toaccelerate their progress into strategic management and leadership roles. This Level 7 qualification is part-fundedby the levy, with the employer paying a top-up fee. The appeal for organisations is the practical, grounded-in-reality approach taken during the programmes. Partici- pants draw on live workplace scenarios as part of their learning, giving them the opportunity to develop fresh perspectives on some of the tough challenges they are facing. There is also a major, supervised pro- ject at the end of programmes, which focuses on an area of organisationalchallenge, chosen together with the employer. This not only helps individ- uals deepen their understanding of the organisation they are working for, but also provides the employer with a valuable piece of internal consultancy it can build on. \"On one recent programme, for example, Ashridge actually worked directly with learners to co-create content for a particular module, resulting in a fresh, stimulating learning experience that was directly relevant to the organisation.\" Making sure the right foundations are in place is, however, fundamental to the success of any degree apprentice- ship programme. Ashridge's experi- ence in working with organisations going through the first tranche of apprenticeship programmes suggests the following issues are key: Senior level endorsement The employer is an important stake- holder in the degree apprenticeship process, championing participants through their studies and supporting them in applying their new-found knowledge and skills back in the work- place. This means that securing com- mitment to the programme at the highest level is critical. HR and L&D professionals will need to convince senior management of the potential for degree apprenticeships to help the organisation get future-fit - developingAlasdair Poole, Apprenticeships Manager at Ashridge Executive Education details the importance of laying the foundations for a successful degree apprenticeship programme 506PROFILE Laying the foundations for a successful degree apprenticeship programmethe skills it will need to thrive in a constantly changing, digitally-driven environment and helping to attract and retain the best talent. Clear communication Misconceptions about apprenticeships still abound and organisations may find they have a certain amount ofgroundwork to do in explaining how they work at a higher level. A planned internal communications campaign can help to generate enthusiasm andaddress any concerns that may exist among potential participants. Ideas might include briefings for managers, placing articles on internal communi- cation platforms or drawing up a list of FAQs. Ashridge has supported client organisations by running webinars for potential learners, explaining the degree apprenticeship process and giving participants the opportunity toask questions. Finding the right participants It's important not to assume thatdegree apprenticeships will work for everyone. For some individuals, anopen programme or being part of a customer group of senior executives can be a better solution. A clear'recruitment' process will help to ensure the right people are being directed to the right kind of learning. Some organisations have tackled this by inviting expressions of interest from employees, backed up by a short personal statement about why they feel this particular study route will work for them. Offering one-to-one consultations for learners who are undecided or want more information can also be helpful. Ashridge supports organisations with this process, helping them to sift applications if required and advising on alternative options where appropriate. Integrating degree apprenticeships Degree apprenticeships work best when they are seen as part of the bigger L&D picture, rather than a stand-alone development interven- tion. Organisations need to think strategically about what skills they will need in the future and how a higher level apprenticeship can help to buildthem. They need to consider what kind of leadership roles will emerge in the new world of work and how degree apprenticeships could prepare employees to fill them. Organisationswho take this wider, longer-term vieware more likely to reap the benefits of the programme and get a return on their investment. Working in partnership Finding a provider who fits with the company culture and approach and is willing to develop a close working relationship is critical to the success of a degree apprenticeship programme. A good provider will take a collaborative, consultative approach, working closely with the organisation to design learn- ing that is job specific and immediately transferrable back in the workplace. On one recent programme, for exam- ple, Ashridge actually worked directly with learners to co-create content for a particular module, resulting in a fresh, stimulating learning experience that was directly relevant to the organ- isation. Finding a provider who is able to be flexible on delivery method is also key, to ensure that managers are able to successfully integrate their studies with demanding day jobs. Alasdair Poole Apprenticeships Manager & TRAINING and mentoring: A style of management Coaching and mentoring as a management style has become more prevalent in the last few years and not without reason. Companies and leaders are realising the benets of adopting this style not just for the organisation but for the individualsbeing coached as well. The growing appreciation for professional coaching has turned this resource into an industry with an estimated worth of $2 billion globally. It is reportedthat there are over 60,000 professional coaches practising around the world today. However, you do not necessarily need the services of a professional coach in order to incorporate coaching techniques intoyour leadership style. Basic coaching techniques used on a daily basis have a profound eect on individual performance and a company's nancial results. The International Coaching Federation reports that 80% of people coached at work reported increased self-condence. 70% recordedimproved performance which is why it is no wonder companies are encouraging coaching as a leadership practice. To understand this, it is important to clarify the dierence between coaching and mentoring. The rst dierence is in time scale; coaching tends to be short- term whilst mentoring is a longer-term process. Coaching tends to focus on specic skills and is more operational and task-oriented. By contrast, mentoring tends to focus on relationship building and is more development driven. In addition, the immediate manager of the person being coached plays a crucial part in the coaching process while in mentoring they tend to be involved but in a more indirect way. Coaching takes time, requiring more input than justgiving instructions to your team. Time must be dedi- cated to the coaching activity, whether it is done through a dedicated coaching session or incorporated into the management style and permeated through day-to-day activities. Time must then be set aside for team members to go through the thought-process to absorb the new points of view and conclusionsreached. Finally, time must be taken away from leaders attending to other strategic priorities and their own responsibilities. The cost could be another issue if external coaches are used for this activity. \"Basic coaching techniques used on a daily basis have a profound effect on individual performance and a company's financial results. The International Coaching Federation reports that 80% of people coached at work reported increased self-confidence. 70% recorded improved performance which is why it is no wonder companies are encouraging coaching as a leadership practice.\" Despite these short-term disadvantages, the long-term benets could vastly outweigh the sacrices. The benets of coaching begin with the individual being coached. As the objective of coaching is to guide people to reach their own conclusions and nd their own solutions, each employee will gradually build theirself-condence to the point of independence. Employ- ees will depend less on their managers, thus freeingup the manager's time to deal with their other duties. Coaching not only helps improve the quality of learning but the employees gain skills for life that contributeDessy Ohanians, Managing Director of Corporate and Certificate Programmes at the London School of Business and Finance - Executive Education argues that coaching and mentoring are a style of management that has become more prevalent during the last few yearsHR & TRAINING 509towards their overall personal and professional development. The benets for the organisation are even more measurable and tangible. The modern organisation has realised that the real value of their operations is not solely obtained through their tangible assets, but the people employed and the knowledge, ideas and inspiration that can be garnered from them. A com-pany's success is measured not just through revenue and prot, but also through factors such as customer satisfaction which can only be achieved when employees possess the right skills and motivations. Coached employees have demonstrated greater creativity as they are able to produce their own solutions, whilst greater employee engagement results in lower sta turnover and improved productivity. Companies, where leaders use coaching-style engagement, have also reported lower development and training costs alongside a greater skilled workforce and better use of people, skills and resources. Leadership skills are typically associated with grand strategic decisions but, in reality, building relationships is a core skill of great leaders. If you want to start implementing some coaching techniques, here are some practical steps to get you started: Start a coaching conversation Put on your 'coaching hat' and make clear you are not talking to them as a leader from whom they should expect directions and instructions but that you are entering a coaching mode. That will set the right expectations and the learning can begin. Allow for self-evaluation The opportunity to identify and correct one's own errors is valuable as it presents the employee withtheir own learning curve. Self-evaluation thus enables them to see how they've developed and this skill is vital over time. Give feedback A primary aspect of good coaching is providing feedback. Well-delivered and timely feedback (allowing for self-evaluation) provides people with apersonable summary of ways to improve, praising positives when achieved and advising on how to correct errors. The famous \"sandwich technique\" of giving positive-negative-positive feedback is proven to not work particularly well, so avoid this. Build rapport Coaching and knowing what questions to ask to create a personal connection can allow for a rapport to build quicker and more eectively. It will helpemployees improve their own rapport building skills. Adapt All employees are dierent and their requirements for coaching will vary accordingly. Be ready to adaptyour techniques in all the above areas to best connect with them. Dessy Ohanians Managing Director of Corporate and Certificate Programmes London School of Business and Finance - Executive Education www.lsbf.org.uk/programmes/executive www.twitter.com/LSBF Dessy Ohanians, Managing Director of Corporate and Certificate ProgrammesWe love a good chat. The opportunity to blow off about someone, the chance to get something off our chest, the freedom to speak our mind. These conversations happen between part- ners, friends, family and colleagues. We may have a preferred individual to chat with. We may find ourselves telling the story of what happened over and over again, seeking under- standing and validation from anyone who will listen. During a chat, it is common for the listener to try andshow empathy, by quickly sharing what similarly happened to them. This can feel like a hijack and be frustrating. On the other hand, it can feel comforting that \"I am not the only one going through this.\" There is always a place for a good chat. Chatting enables us to make a con- nection with another human being. Finding a bond with others helps us thrive, not just survive. Talking combats loneliness and we feel valued and included. Neurochemistry is presenting evidence of the hormones which are stimulated when we can talk in a trusting, transparent way. A coaching conversation is very different from a chat in particular ways. There are conditions which need to be met to demonstrate coaching competencies. These are now speci- fied by credentialing bodies, such as the International Coach Federation(ICF) or European Coaching and Mentoring Council (EMCC). There are hundreds of definitions of coaching. One which has endured is offered by Miles Downey. One of the early influencers of professional coaching, he defines coaching as the \"art of facilitating the performance, learning and development of another.\" Paying attention to each of the words will expand the meaning and intention, illustrating the essence of a coaching conversation. Art -Coaching is an art in that although there is likely to be a process being followed, there is something uniquely co-created by both parties in the moment as they bring their ways of being into the mix. Facilitating -Is important as the coach is there to support and challenge the client to think in new ways, finding their own solutions. Deep listening is key. In Nancy Klein's book, Time to Think, she describes how to create a safe environment enabling access to high-quality thinking by being fully present for, and listening fully to, the client. In a coaching conversation, much time is spent discussing and agreeing on what permissions exist in the coaching relationship. These per- missions would typically cover things like confidentiality, levels of challenge and feedback to others. In exploring permissions, the coach and clientbegin to build trust which is vital for achieving outcomes. In a chat, there is no such agreement or permission; the conversation will arrive unannounced and without agency. \"The coach might be asked to keep the client- focused, could be invited to challenge, may be asked to give them time to reflect or to ensure they maintain momentum. The coach needs to be open to their client guiding them to be the best coach they can be.\" Performance - This comes as a consequence of coaching, performance is enhanced in its delivery, speed, quality, skill, or by easing a transition. Performance necessitates a goal to be set. Chats are often aimless, mean- dering until the subject matter surfaces. Whilst a good outcome may result from a chat, it is rarely planned. Learning -This is stimulated by the coach offering feedback andobservations. This expands the client's awareness, enabling a deeper understanding of their patterns andpreferences. Insight results in choices being made which have not previously been apparent or available. Development - In coaching, this is about growing and integrating new knowledge and taking fresh courses of action, deepening the sense of autonomy and individuality. We can challenge our beliefs, define ourKaren Dean from Diabolo Limited and me:mycoach and Sam Humphrey from Grit Limited explore the all-important difference between chatting and coachingWhat's the difference between chatting and coaching? 510PROFILEvalues and craft our sense of self. Coaching accelerates development. Another -The whole conversation is about the other, the client. Coaching tends not to be a space where the coach shares their stories. The coach acknowledges what the client seems to be experiencing, such as frustration, anger, sadness or challenge. Coaching is all about the client and the goals or outcomes they have chosen. Coaching is different from mentoring. Mentoring embodies the notion that \"I've walked this path before and I'm giving you the benefit of my knowledge and experience\". Ideas are offered and suggestions made. The role of the coach and the manner in which this plays out is defined bythe client. The coach might be asked to keep the client-focused, could be invited to challenge, may be asked to give them time to reflect or to ensure they maintain momentum. The coach needs to be open to their client guiding them to be the best coach they can be. In a chat, there are few such 'rules of engagement', both parties operate in silent assumption as to their role and purpose in a chat.A coaching conversation focuses on the future. Having an objective makes measurement possible. Coaching conversations should add value to the client, create change or movement which has a tangible or visceral result. As many coaching conversations are a funded service, they demand a return on investment or a return on expecta- tion. The funding may take the form of an external coach's fees or an inter- nal coach's time, either way, there is a cost attached. This is not so for a chat. We can shoot the breeze for free with anyone we want and for as long as we want - there is no expectation that a chat should fundamentally change anything, long term. When moving forward really matters, a coach or manager using a coaching style will offer a more impactful intervention. The conditions written here will guide and refresh the ground rules for effective coaching and help keep them separate from juicy chats.

It is a salary sacrice scheme in which employees can usually save between 32%-42% on the cost of a cycle and associ- ated accessories, such as a helmet or mudguard. Many employers oer the Cycle to Work Scheme and it's quite a simple set up: you pay for the cycle and the accessories directly from your gross salary prior to tax and national insurance being deducted. As tax and national insurance are based on your gross salary, which is now reduced by the cost of the cycle, theamount you pay in national insurance and tax is reduced and a saving is made. It is, therefore, a very popular and appealing concept. Employees 'hire' the cycle for a year, paying the cost of the cycle back over twelve monthly instalments. At the end of the year, you can choose to own the bike imme- diately or continue to hire it for an additional three years at no extra cost but with additional savings, bypaying a refundable 3-7% deposit of the money youspent on the cycle and accessories. It doesn't matter if you change employer in this period - the cycle comes with you. Making cycling more accessible for everyone The best bit is that the government has just made thescheme better and more accessible to more people byclarifying guidance which makes it easier for employers to provide cycles and equipment to a value greater than \u00a31,000 with a top value removed altogether.Having a top value of \u00a31,000 was always problematic if the government is serious about encouraging more people to cycle to work instead of commuting by car and hitting their doubling cycling target by 2025. Many disabled people nd it easier to cycle than walk but an adapted cycle rarely costs under \u00a31,000 - often it costs signicantly more, meaning up until now, anyone requiring an adapted cycle could not use the scheme. E-bikes are also more expensive and are better for older or less t people who want to start cycling. E-bikes prevent two of the big reasons people give for not cycling: 'it's too hilly' or 'I don't want to get too sweaty as my work doesn't have showers.' The motors kick in to give you an extra hand up those hills preventing that extra perspiration. \"Glasgow University also found that regularly cycling the commute to work reduced your chances of cancer by 45% and your chances of getting heart disease by 46%. In addition, Sustrans has found that people who cycle regularly take half as many sick days than those that don't which saves employers and the wider economy a huge amount of money in efficiency gains.\" It's not a complete panacea. By its very nature, the scheme is only available to people who work, which cuts out a huge number of society who would benet from owning a bike and is something the governmentshould look at further. Why it has never been more important to get more people cycling to work A cycling and walking charity would say that it is vital to get more people cycling to work but the truth is that this has never been more important than it is now. For the rst time, we are seeing life expectancy decreasing through inactive lifestyles and poor diet. Physical inactivity is costing the NHS an estimated \u00a31billion every year. Sustrans' Bike Life reports, surveyed 7,700 people across seven major cities in the UK. TheyRachel White, Head of Public Affairs, Sustrans shares her views on how the Cycle to Work Scheme is promoting health for people and our environmentHR & TRAINING 513showed that in 2017 across these UK cities, 123 million bike trips occurred. This contributed to savings to the NHS of \u00a38 million annually, equivalent to the average salary of 343 nurses. With cycling to work physical activity is incorporated into your daily routine ratherthan forcing yourself down the gym each day which means you are far more likely to keep it up in the long term. Glasgow University also found that regularly cycling the commute to work reduced your chances of cancer by 45% and your chances of getting heart disease by 46%. In addition, Sustrans has found that people who cycleregularly take half as many sick days than those that don't which saves employers and the wider economy a huge amount of money in eciency gains. We also face a climate crisis and poor air quality of which motorised transport is a huge contributor sogetting more people out of cars and cycling to work has untapped environmental benets. For example, con-gestion cost the UK nearly \u00a38 billion in 2018 from delayed productivity and costs to the environment.Cycling reduces congestion. A typical road-lane cancarry seven times as many cycles per hour as cars. Less congestion means better air quality but it also helps out those who have no alternative but to drive. Therefore, the 'Cycle to Work Scheme' is a win for everyone whether you choose to use it or not. \"Physical inactivity is costing the NHS an estimated \u00a31 billion every year.

Now is the time to use it and employers need to make it as appealing as possible by lifting the \u00a31,000 cap and providing proper cycle facili- ties, such as safe bike storage and showers. We also need to make the wider environment safer and more appealing so that more people chose to cycle and forthis, governments at all levels must invest in a protected network of cycling infrastructure that gets people from their doors to the oce. Rachel White Head of Public Affairs 8893 the Transport Com- mittee issued a report which showed that increasing levels of walking and cycling will cut traffic congestion, air pollution and improve health. However, the report criticised the Government's current Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy as \"not ambitious enough\" and called for a strategy to enable people to get out of their cars and walk or cycle for short journeys, or part of a longer journey.Government investment in active travel at just 1.5% is tiny when compared with spending in other areas of transport. Road transport is the single biggest contributor to poor air quality and is responsible for 80% of roadside nitrogen dioxide concentration. Poor air quality is a killer, causing diseases such as stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory infections. The UK has one of the worst asthma death rates in Europe and there were a record number of deaths from the condition in 2017. Children are particularly vulnerable from air pollution with dirty air stunting their lung development and leading to poor health later in life. A new study by King's College London will monitor air quality exposure of 250 children on their way to school. The study will use backpacks which will measure particu- late matter and nitrogen dioxide levels. The study aims to achieve better understanding of which pollutants arethe most harmful and where they are coming from, helping to support effec- tive improvements in public health. Under plans to cut congestion and reduce pollution, a Workplace Parking Levy is being considered by at least 10 councils and is already in effect in Nottingham city centre. The charges affect businesses with more than 10 parking spaces. Since 2012, Nottingham City Council has raised \u00a353.7 million from the levy which has been used to improve Nottingham's tram network. Nationally, over 30% of all emissions comes from transport; it needs to be just 12% by 2030. However, the number of vehicles on the road increases every year. Surprisingly, alarge percentage of short car journeysare less than two miles. Two miles isapproximately a 40-minute walk and considerably less on a bicycle. On an E-bike, it's even less at under 10 minutes. It's time to ditch the car and switch to sustainable alternatives, such as E-bikes. It's become clear that cycling has an important role to play in the health of the nation and your organisation canencourage its employees to use active travel for their commute to work. Cycle to work will make a difference The Government introduced the Cycle to Work Scheme in 1999 with the aim to get more people cycling to work. Scheme objectives include cheaper travel, better health, increased pro- ductivity, lower congestion and better air quality.Joanna Flint, from Green Commute Initiative, illustrates how introducing a cycle to work scheme will help your organisation's efforts to improve its sustainability in the workplaceTurning employee commutes green 514PROFILE Green Commute Initiative (GCI) is a pioneer in the cycle to work industry and was the first to offer a scheme with no limits plus no exit fees. Whereas traditional schemes were limited to \u00a31,000, GCI developed an FCA & HMRC compliant model with- out a spending cap. No limit means every type of bicycle is available; traditional pedal, electric bike, cargo bike and specialist cycles and trikes for those with mobility issues. Employees can make savings of up to 47% with employers saving 13.8% on reduced NICs. GCI has a Framework agreement in place which has been used by other public sector organisations. Current clients include councils, NHS trusts, universities and police forces. GCI also has a very important safe- guard which other providers don't offer. With the GCI model, the C2W provider owns the bikes from theoutset. In the event of the provider failing financially, a liquidator could recover the bikes for the benefit of creditors. However, as a not-for-profit social enterprise whose constitution prevents it from taking on debt, GCI will never have any creditors or become insol- vent. So unlike other C2W providers, the bikes supplied will always end up with the employee. GCI is the only cycle-to-work provider to offer this vital and important safeguard. Originally, GCI was set-up to enable more people to get expensive electric bikes (E-bikes) on the Government'sCycle to Work scheme. GCI is passion- ate about E-bikes, seeing them as the future of commuter travel. E-bikes - enabling active travel E-bikes are perfect for people new or returning to cycling and for those who want to have a quicker and easier commute to work. The bikes bypass many commuter issues whilst helping to improve individual health and fitness, as well as the quality of airthat surrounds us all. \"It is clear that cycling has an important role to play in the health of the nation and your organisation can encourage its employees to use active travel for their commute to work.\" The battery assistance kicks in when required which means hills and dis- tances are no longer sweat-inducing obstacles. Employees arrive at work on time, feeling happier and healthier. They can wear their business attire without the need to shower. They'll probably become more effective in their workplace. In short, everyone wins with an E-bike. Contrary to popular belief, E-biking is not cheating. Recent research has shown that even on E-bikes, physical exertion is needed 95% of the time. The study recorded oxygen consumption and revealed that E-bike use placed users at 8.5 times more active over resting, while pedal power alone regis- tered at 10.9 times more active, a closer margin than previously assumed. It was also found that pedal cycle users utilised 58% of lung capacity, with 51% for e-assistance. NICE guidelines for workplaces In addition to the Transport Commit- tee's call for action, NICE recently released guidelines on encouraging activity in the general population. Theguidelines were issued following multiple studies which have shown that obesity and some chronic condi- tions can be managed by increasing levels of physical activity. One specific area targeted by the draft guidelines is the recommendation that employers should have physical activ- ity programmes in place to encourage employees to move more when travel- ling to/from work. Increasing physical activity levels should lead to a reduc- tion in the prevalence of some illnesses and medical conditions, as well asimproving staff morale. One easy step that employers can take to meet these new requirements is to encourage employees to actively travel to/from the workplace, which includes using a cycle-to-work scheme. Joanna Flint Marketing Manager Green for the European transport sector The analogy may have been over-used, but never has it been truer. Transport is today at a cross- roads. Transport activity has never been so high and it continues to rise. By 2050, passenger transportis expected to grow by 42% and freight transport by 60%. At the same time, our transport network hasnever experienced so much pressure. A capacity crunch is already evident for certain transport modes andunless we act, the squeeze will get tighter. For instance,if capacity remains as it is, it is estimated that by 2040, annual demand for flights in Europe will outnumber the number of possible flights by 1.5 million. This would mean 160 million passengers being unable to fly. Alongside limited capacity, the challenge posed by climate change has become a key challenge for the transport sector. We need to step up our eorts toensure sustainable, energy-ecient and safe mobility. At the same time, we need to take advantage of the opportunities oered by a changing transport land- scape, in which digitalisation, big data and the collab- orative economy are all playing a far greater role.These changes are profoundly aecting the waypeople move, but also the way we, stakeholders and policymakers, are making sure that our regulatory environment is t for purpose. To make the most of these evolutions, it is clear that we need research and innovation. It makes good sense to have the Commission's research policy inextricably linked with its transport policy. Whether we are seeking to make transport more sustainable, more ecient, safer or more automated - progress towards all of these objectives is possible through European Union (EU)-funded research. The European Commission cannot be the only source of transport research nance, as industry and theMember States have equally signicant roles to play. Nevertheless, the Commission can and does add value by helping to fund projects that might otherwise be too costly, or too wide in scope for an individual country or industry to nance or organise. \"Research spending also helps to keep the EU's transport industry at the forefront of global technological development. The current seven-year research programme - Horizon 2020 - expires next year. The new programme - Horizon Europe - covering the period 2021-2027, is intended to take a more holistic approach. This is achieved through an integrated approach targeting climate, energy and mobility.\" I would like to highlight two partnerships with industry of which I am particularly proud - the Single European Sky Joint Undertaking (SESAR) in aviation and Shift2Rail in rail transport. SESAR is helping to modernise Euro- pean air trac management through projects thatdene, develop and deliver new or improved technolo- gies and procedures. The research links directly to the EU aviation policy objectives of reducing congestion in European airspace and, in so doing, cutting emissions from aircraft. Shift2Rail, for its part, is the rst European rail initiative to seek focused research, innovation and market-driven solutions and to accelerate the integration of new and advanced technologies into innovative rail product solutions. Transport research should not be considered in isolation. It is in everyone's interests to link transport research with other EU programmes, in order to ensure that practical results can be deployed. We are delivering this through the Connecting Europe Facility, which is, for example, currently co-funding the development of a network of hydrogen fuelling stations for cars, buildingDirector-General of DG Move of the European Commission, Henrik Hololei, outlines the challenges and opportunities for the European transport sector, including climate change, as well as research and innovationTRANSPORT 517on the considerable EU research work conducted on hydrogen fuel cells. Research spending also helps to keep the EU's trans- port industry at the forefront of global technological development. The current seven-year research programme - Horizon 2020 - expires next year. The new programme - Horizon Europe - covering the period 2021-2027, is intended to take a more holistic approach. This is achieved through an integrated approach targeting climate, energy and mobility. The three areas share considerable research and innovation needs and working together on a common research programme will lead to signicant benets. As an example, using and developing new technologies to improve the management and eciency of the urban environment - so-called 'smart cities' - will address not only mobility in urban areas but also energy and climate issues. When reflecting on research, thoughts inevitably drift towards exciting new inventions. However, we must not forget that innovation - whether designed to encourage a modal shift, understand users' views on automated vehicles, or make transport logistics more ecient - isalso about understanding user behaviour. It is my rmbelief that investment in behavioural science is neces- sary if we want to be able to put in place the technical solutions developed by our world-class researchers.As the EU moves on from the crossroads at which it nds itself today, embracing the challenges and oppor-tunities ahead, we must never forget that transportand mobility are central to the lives of all EU citizens - those living large cities or in the countryside, whether young or old. This dependency is two-fold: not only do we all have our own mobility needs; transport is also the lifeblood of the economy. By extension, research into transport has the potential to benet a huge number, if not every single EU citizen. The start of a new Commission provides an opportunity to review political priorities and to adjust them to an ever-changing world. Investing in research and innova- tion is the best guarantee that solutions will always be found to our greatest challenges.

EU transport policy of the 21st century must address the challenges the sector is facing, by proposing solutions that minimise negative effects, as well as revealing and promoting all avail- able potentials for transport to further enhance its contribution to growth and jobs in the EU. \"The European Transportation sector is at a crossroads. We need to ensure that it remains competitive and provides innovative and sustainable transport solutions.\" TRA VISIONS Competitions have in recent years, become an institution aiming at precisely this; to enhance the competitiveness of the EU Transporta- tion sector by achieving the develop- ment and wider dissemination of a wealth of innovative ideas, essential for the competitiveness of the European transport industry and also necessary for addressing current and future mobility challenges related to energy,connected and automated vehicles, safety and security, human capital and other key trends and issues. The concept of the TRA VISIONS projects, which are being successfully implemented since 2014 in close relation to the respective TRA Confer- ences, is to organise two competitions for Transport Research Awards that are announced during a dedicated ceremony at the TRA Conferences, with the participation of representatives of the whole transport community, namely: A competition for young researchers with the goal to stimulate the interest among young researchers/students in the field of sustainable transport. A competition for senior researchers based on results from EU-funded projects. The competitions of TRA VISIONS 2020 have five modes of transport;road, rail, waterborne, air and also cross-modality. The main objective is to continue and enhance the success of the previous TRA VISIONS competi- tions by achieving the following: For the young researchers: To nurture the best transport researchers in Europe; To promote the alignment of their interests with those of transport industry stakeholders. For the senior researchers: To promote and acknowledge the leaders in generating impactful research in transport in the EU.Alistair Greig and Matina Loukea, Project Partners at TRA VISIONS 2020 explain the importance of strengthening the European transport researchTRA VISIONS 2020: Strengthening European transport research 518PROFILE TRA VISIONS 2018 Senior Researcher Competition winners with competition organisersSenior Researchers Competition The Transport Research Arena (TRA) 2020 Conference will be the fourth time that the Senior Researcher Competition is run. The TRA VISIONS Senior Researcher Competition acts as a showcase for the very best EU- funded research and aims to recognise the current and future leaders in the field, as it recognises and celebrates leading researchers who are or have recently been, contributing to trans- port-related EU-funded projects. The Senior Researchers Competition concept is to have an excellence award for leading transport researchers engaged with EU-funded projects, who can demonstrate proven impacts in their field. This competition provides a platform that facilitates:Efficient dissemination of knowledge and results from innovation and/or research projects in the transport sector; The promotion of future synergies and; Further development of pioneering ideas in line with the strategic objec- tives of the TRA stakeholders. Both TRA VISIONS competitions and project final results increase European competitive advantage, while it has been proved that they inspire the research community to propose innovative projects and the industry to adopt these.

This project has received funding from the Euro- pean Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation pro- gramme under grant agreement no. 824293.The H2020 TInnGO ( Transport Innovation Gender Observatory) project, funded by the European Commission, aims to promote a sustainable game change in European transport by creating a new observa- tory, conceived as a one-stop-shop for analysis and solutions on the inequal- ities women face in the transport sector. It takes a three-pronged approach looking at gender and diver- sity issues in transport usage, employ- ment and education. Why is this needed? It has long been recognised that women (and other groups) are signif- icantly marginalised in transport. Without research in this area, the transport revolution produced by smart mobility will continue to exclude women and 'disadvantaged' groups (e.g. the elderly, those from lower-income backgrounds, with mobility, cognitive, sensory and com- munication difficulties). Commuting journeys are privileged by transport systems, over those related to home and social and healthcare. The com- plex, multilegged journeys by women and those in lower socio-economic groups are not modelled; therefore, future systems will perpetuate the same inequalities. Recent analysis conducted by TInnGO shows that around 70% of the transport work-force are male and since 1945, only 7% of the transport ministers in TInnGO countries have been female.Gendered and non-inclusive discourses are already being used to promote smart mobility solutions, despite the fact that women most use and support sustainable transport. Clearly, this situation needs to be urgently addressed if the smart city agenda is to fulfil its promises of improving the quality of life for all people. TInnGO will address this through: 1. The creation of a Pan European observatory for gender smart transport innovation in the smart mobilitysector. This will provide a nexus for data collection, analysis and dissemi nation of gender main- streaming tools and open innova- tion. The observatory will collect existing resources to become the reference portal for those wishing to address gender and diversity- sensitive smart mobility. It will freely provide best practices, case studies, guide lines, tools, method- ologies, training, policy documents and videos. Specific sections will allow users to participate in open innovation and share content, insights and data for collaboration. 2. The central observatory will be fed by 10 national hubs and laboratories (Baltic States, Italy, Greece, Norway/ Sweden, UK, France, Romania, Germany, Spain and Portugal), each specialising in a local issue relating to gender and inclusivity(e.g. safety, minority groups andentrepreneurship). The hubs will: a. Use project outputs (such as gender action plans and gender mainstreaming tools) to address local issues in Transport Business Ecosystems (TBE) (such as gendered workplaces, inclusive consultation, entrepreneurshipand education). b. Provide national data relating to the TBE, for example, through standardised surveys on women's mobility. c. Act as a beacon for women's engagement in the smart mobility sector. d. Provide 'living labs' drawing on citizen science and participatory design to create gender and diversity-sensitive smart mobility solutions. 3. The development of an Open Data Repository - a one-stop-shop for sharing transport-related gender datasets with standardised tem- plates, tools and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)-com- pliant data management processes.

TInnGO is initially funded for three years. Over the next two years, we will set up 10 TInnGO labs, as pilots, to support local groups and activities, encourage and train women and other groups in achieving equality in the fields of mobility, education and employment in the TBE. To be more effective and sustainable in the long- term, we need support from readers of this article to: Follow, like and link to us; Start a conversation with us about your experiences of gender anddiversity inequalities; Use gender mainstreaming and gender action plans in your organi- sations; Challenge inequality in transport decision making, services and dis- courses and; Contribute and share gender data in our Open Data Repository.

Its aim is to increase the capacity of Small- Medium (SM) local authorities (LAs) to develop and implement sustainable, inclusive, integrated and accessible transport strategies, policies, tech- nologies, practices, procedures, tools,measures and intelligent transportsystems (ITS) that recognise the end-to-end travel experiences of all users and freight. It is perceived that SM cities are unlikely to have sufficient resources to develop, support and finance integrated urban mobility plans without a broad range of targeted capacity-building measures. SUITS argues that rather than importing or adapting existing sustainable transport measures or buying in expertise, cities should be supported in building up local capacity (in their governmental institutions, businesses and citizens) to grow, fund and implement bespoke and context- sensitive sustainability strategies, appropriate to their needs. Playing an active role in the CIVITAS2020 family, SUITS contributes towards the CIVITAS initiative and adoption of SUMPs across the European Union (EU), as a Member of the Co-ordinating Group of the European Platform on Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP), especially concerning innova- tive financing and procurement and inclusivity. Although integrating with SUMP vsn 2.0, having a SUMP is not a prerequisite for using SUITS' outputs. In relation to sustainable transport, SUITSargues that capacity-building should embrace change, at the indiv - idual, organisational and institutional levels. This includes providing the knowledge and know-how of the latest transport innovations, mobility data usage, rules, regulations and citizen engagement processes. These directly impact how a transport department goes about its business, enabling them to make better, more informed plans. The following sections outline the two main outputs of the project. Crowdsourcing data As an RIA project, SUITS has success- fully piloted the use of real-time traffic data collection through crowdsourcing in urban traffic management to address issues of both passenger and freight mobility as a low-cost means of gathering, visualising and analysingsuch data. This method is especially attractive to SM cities. Trials in Kala- maria and Torino indicate not only the suitability of the method but also, the steps which local authorities need to take to guarantee sufficient, reliable and General Data Protection Regula- tion (GDPR)-compliant data collection. All cities are free to use our Data Repository to access traffic datasets and share their open data with others. SUITS toolset enables the selection and visualisation of large, crowdsourced traffic datasets with the ability to scale efficiently to handle big data. Citizen privacy is ensured by data anonymisa- tion or pseudonymisation techniques, tools and application of strongly secure crypto technologies for data communication and storage. The use of real-time data also features in SUITS CBP, discussed below. SUITS Capacity Building Programme (CBP) To understand the needs of the trans- port departments, SUITS has worked extensively with partner cities (Alba Iulia, Transport for West Midlands, Kalamaria, Turin, Rome and Valencia and follower cities of Dachau, Stuttgart and Palanga) to determine first of all, the existing gaps in knowl- edge and secondly what changes need to be made within the organisation forAndree Woodcock, a Professor from Coventry University, tells us all we need to know about a four-year research and innovation action project that aims to develop and implement sustainable, inclusive, integrated and accessible transport strategies, amongst many other areasDeveloping and implementing sustainable, inclusive, integrated and accessible transport strategies 522PROFILEit to work more effectively, apply, use and measure the impact of capacity- building measures. SUITS work has confirmed that local authorities (LASs) face many chal- lenges in developing sustainable urban planning measures and deploying innovative mobility solutions and technologies. Despite comprehensive EU Guidelines for developing and implementing such projects, LAs may struggle to perform exhaustive pre- liminary analyses, develop SMART goals coupled with long-term vision and impact assessment. Furthermore, substantial drawbacks occur in the implementation phase of urban mobility projects, particularly in terms of improving conceptual planning processes and establishing sustainable financing schemes. This derives fromthe lack of appropriate expertise and organisational structures which impede innovation and barriers to interde- partmental working needed for smart city development. Requirements analysis of the SUITS cities and reviews of existing guide- lines has led to the development and implementation of six tailorable modules, specially designed for SM LAs which aim to: Increase the capacity to develop and implement sustainable, inclusive,integrated and accessible transport; Support development of SUMPs by transforming them into learning organisations and; Increase resilience and responsive- ness of transport departments to new challenges and changes. Six modules (see figure 1) have been developed, acknowledging gaps in existing training material and the needs of SM LAs. These include a Facilitator Guide, appropriate training material delivered either as classroom courses (modules 1-4) or e-learning modules (5-6). The courses have been structured to clarify the value of mea- sures for small-medium cities, analyse a successful case, present innovative financing and procurement proce-dures tailored to topic requirements, as well as tools and guidelines for the enhancement of measures' imple- mentation and user engagement. The CBP has been assessed piloted with SUITS cities. Overall evaluation has shown that participants were fully satisfied with the learning ambience and more than 50% gave the highest rate regarding the content accuracy, exercises structure, course structure and achievement of workshop objec- tives. During the next 12 months, allmaterial will be released (in Italian,Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, Lithuanian, German and Romanian) as the SUITS Capacity Building Manual and Toolbox (freely available to the Open Research Data Portal and the CIVITAS Urban Mobility Tool Inventory). Specifically, the Toolbox will consist of: A step by step guide for LAs assisting them in the decision-making process when developing SUMPs; An Integrated Decision Support Tool to assist LAs in setting innovative financing, public procurement and project development processes; Links to resources such as databases and models that are particularly relevant to transport planning and sustainable mobility planning for Las and; Relevant examples and case studies. The SUITS consortium consists of twenty-two partners from eleven EU countries, among them nine cities in seven EU countries. It is coordinated by the Future Transport and Cities Research Institute, Coventry University, UK.

The AVENUE H2020 project (1) is designing and operating world-first trials of public transport services with small fleets of autonomous electric buses that collect users on-demand, provide door-to-door transportation and are integrated with existing public transportation services. The use of autonomous vehicles in public transportation provides a less costly, greener solution for suburban areas, where conventional public transport - ation services are not viable and, therefore, not offered. The European Union (EU)-funded AVENUE, a four year project which started in May 2018 and coordinated by the University of Geneva, is operat- ing small fleets of autonomous buses in low- to medium-demand areas of four European cities, in Copenhagen, operated by Holo, in Geneva operated by TPG and in Luxembourg operated by Sales-Lentz and in Lyon operated by Keolis. The project's objectives are, first, to demonstrate that autonomous buses are a promising solution for public transportation in urban and suburban environments, second, to identify the barriers and obstacles in thedeployment of autonomous vehiclesin shared public transportation, third, to propose and validate new, innova- tive and disruptive transport services and finally, to provide recommend - ations and guidelines to all actors, from government to manufactures for future large-scale adoption and deployment of autonomous buses in public transportation. From the first day of the project in May 2018, all sites were operating anautonomous vehicle service with oneor more mini-buses. After a year, all four demonstrators were up and running and new services are now under development to bring them up to the next level. Today, the vehiclesinvolved cover fixed routes, but by the end of 2019, on-demand services will be offered in selected routes. However, the road to the deployment of autonomous vehicles for public transportation is filled with obstacles and barriers. On one hand, the technology still needs to improve and provide solutions to many issues related to autonomous driving in complex road situations. On the other hand, regulatory restrictions do not allow the full exploitation of autonomous vehicle capabilities on the road and in some cases, block thefurther research and development of efficient solutions.The AVENUE H2020 project aims to design future public transportation services with autonomous vehicles, a less costly, greener solution for suburban areas, as we discover hereAVENUE: Designing future public transportation services with autonomous vehicles 524PROFILE On the road and passenger safety first! The absence of a human driver puts a heavy burden on the autonomous bus in terms of the safety and security of passengers and other road users. Not only must the autonomous driver negotiate different types of traffic on the road, but also protect the bus passengers from sudden breaks and provide assistance when needed. In the AVENUE project, our partner NAVYA, is developing and testing under real traffic conditions, new driving methods that can adapt the autonomous driver behaviour to road conditions, becoming, for example, more assertive when entering a roundabout, while remaining reserved in the presence of pedestrians. Otherpartners, CEESAR and AVL, are evalu- ating risks for passengers and road users to propose improvements and measures for increasing the safety of the vehicles, while Siemens is studying the issues related to the safety and usage of services for passengers and road users with special needs. Door to door, on-demand, personalised services AVENUE is preparing to test a world-first on-demand, door-to-door commercial service of autonomous, shared public transportation, extend- ing the existing public transport service. Via a set of mobile services, developed by our partner Mobile- Thinking, users will be able to call a bus at a specific time and place to reach the nearest stop of the backbone system or move around their own neighbourhood, making use of other innovative in- and out-of-vehicles services, ranging from ticketing, to \"follow my kid\". The intelligent planner and fleet coordinator system, developed by Bestmile, will allow trip optimisa- tion and coordination of the vehicle fleet, guaranteeing a high-quality level of service with minimal delays. Social and business development Of major importance for the deploy- ment of autonomous vehicles for public transportation are the ques- tions related to business development and social impact, studied by HSPF and ECP. The cost of operating an autonomous bus is just a fraction of that operated by a human-driven bus (most of the cost relates to the driver).The ease of use, minimal cost and high availability of transport means has the potential to drastically change the passenger behaviour, pushing them to use the service for travelling short distances for which up to now,were not even considering taking a bus. On the other hand, traditional ticketing methods are no longer suitable for on- demand services. Therefore, AVENUE targets to propose new models and recommendations in response to these new challenges. Barriers and obstacles Deploying autonomous vehicles on public roads is not a simple task. We have a large number of regulatorybarriers to overcome (under strict law, no vehicle can operate without a driver in any European country!), while we need to convince the regula- tors and citizens when it comes to security for autonomous vehicles. While the State of Geneva is looking at the legal framework that needs to bechanged and how to push changes with the political authorities, CERTH, VIF and UniGe are exploring the cyber- security issues that can compromise the deployment of the autonomous vehicles. The road ahead We strongly believe public transporta- tion will be the first business where autonomous vehicles will be mass deployed. The advantages, business opportunities and potential are tremendous. AVENUE aims to open the way; change how we travel in the city and make the use of public trans- portation a new experience for the passengers.

Electric cars and other Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) are often cheaper to run, produce no toxic fumes directly and have a lower impact on the environ-ment over their lifetime, including manufacture. Whilst government policy is to end the sale of non-zero emission cars by 2040, the decision to legislate for a net-zero carbon target by 2050 has accelerated the need for change. Infrastructure and funding will need to evolve to allow a fully electric and ULEV fleet as the days of internalcombustion engines come to an end. Addressing the range anxiety barrier From an engineering perspective, a signicant barrier to enabling an electric future is the lack of electrication on our roads. The vast majority of roads outside of populated areas are geared towards being a relatively simple road surface for traditionally fuelled cars and lorries. Where roads are linked to the grid, it is for relatively low capacity connec- tions for lights, signs and trac signals. This means that high capacity, roadside charging points need adapted infrastructure. For anyone buying an electric car for the rst time, a key concern will be a fear of running out of power on a long journey and not having anywhere to charge up. According to Zap-Map, there are 9,236 charging locations across the UK. However, many of these are concentrated in towns and cities where network coverage remainssparse. The eort needed to service millions, rather than the hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles currentlyon the road, is enormous and would require signicant investment. \"A crucial part of this equation is an investment in storage. Increased battery and other storage capacity, like dams and pumping systems, as well as the development of a smart grid system - which could use plugged-in electric vehicles as temporary storage - will need engineering solutions and government support.\" To meet tomorrow's challenge, we will either have to re-engineer our roads to allow charging on the move, as being trialled in Sweden and the Netherlands or install millions of high-capacity rapid charging points in homes, on streets and at service stops on motorways. A thirst for energy There is little point in decarbonising our vehicle fleet unless the energy used to power tomorrow's cars andlorries is also clean. With a growing population, predicted to be 75 million by 2050, ICE predicts that energy generation will needto increase by 34.2GW - or ten and a half Hinkley Point C power plants - by 2050. The good news is that renewable technologies, like oshore wind, are now competitive, with the strike price for oshore wind falling from \u00a3114 to \u00a357.50 per MWh in the last two years. Electric Avenue, in Brixton, was one of the first streets to be electrified in the 1880s. By 2030, 150 years on, we will need to have achieved a similar feat for all British roads, and the vehicles using them, argues Chris Richards, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE)TRANSPORT 527Generating additional capacity will need investment not only to expand production but replace ageing oil, gas and nuclear plants. A crucial part of this equation is an investment in storage. Increased battery and other storage capacity,like dams and pumping systems, as well as the devel- opment of a smart grid system - which could use plugged-in electric vehicles as temporary storage - will need engineering solutions and government support. The carbon fuel crunch The major policy challenge is how to pay for renovatedroads or a greater expansion in electric charging points and the energy networks needed to power them. Fuel duty is a large source of revenue for the govern- ment, raising \u00a328.4 billion in 2019-20 - almost as much as the government spends on all infrastructure. As petrol and diesel decline as a fuel source, this revenue stream will reduce in the coming decades. ICE released a paper in March this year on how sus- tainable roads funding for the strategic road network in England could be met by a pay as you go model. Such a system should be in place by 2030. Lighting up a nation Just like those Victorian engineers who rst connected Electric Avenue to the grid, doing away with gas lamps,the future for road transport is one illuminated by electricity. \"Whilst government policy is to end the sale of non-zero emission cars by 2040, the decision to legislate for a net-zero carbon target by 2050 has accelerated the need for change.\" Establishing a nationwide grid for every street andhome at the turn of the last century was as big a challenge as ensuring a rapid charging network for our nation's cars, busses and lorries today. As then, the move from combustion to electricity will be a historic and immense challenge, but it must be met, for our health and for future generations. Chris Richards Head of Policy and Public Affairs Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) policy@ice.org.ukwww.ice.org.uk www.twitter.com/ice_engineers Chris RichardsAt Geesinknorba we recognise the urgent need to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality across the UK and the European Union (EU). According to UK Govern- ment figures, the transport sector is the biggest contributor to GHG emis- sions in the UK. Moreover, despite a drop of more than 40% in overall emissions since 1990, emissions from the transport sector have only fallen by 2% over the same period. Transport is also responsible for a third of all the UK's NOx emissions, which have been linked to adverse health effects including reduced life expectancy.Putting cleaner vehicles on the road is vital to reducing the impact of thissector on the environment and public health. Geesinknorba have been pioneering the development of electric solutions for the waste management industry since 2003. Based on lead acid batter- ies, our first hybrid refuse collection vehicle body won Vehicle of the Year at the CIWM (Chartered Institution of Waste Management) Awards for Envi- ronmental Excellence in 2009. Since then we have continued to develop the technology, and our first Li-On Power hybrid was launched in 2013. Truly a next-generation hybrid, the Li-On Power RCV runs on lithium-ionbatteries that power the body and the lifts. Offering a high payload, reducedfuel consumption, and near-noiseless collection and compaction of waste, the vehicle can run 24/7 as the battery is recharged automatically while driving, only needing a 'plugged-in' charge once a week. But our goal was and still is to make waste collection totally emissions free. An RCV uses on average one litre of diesel per kilometre travelled. Accord- ing to the EU's VECTO tool, one litre of diesel produces 3.13kg of CO 2. If an RCV averages 100km a day, it is pro- ducing 313kg of CO2every single day it is in use. Assuming an RCV operates approximately 260 days a year, the potential emissions savings of con- verting just one vehicle to full-electric operation are equivalent to 81.4tonnes of CO 2annually. The opportunity to make a real difference to both air quality and GHG emission is why, in 2017, we launched the first-ever full-electric RCV, the Li-On Power Pro. This ground-break- ing technology for the first time offers public and private waste fleet opera- tors the option of a zero-emissions waste collection vehicle. With the introduction of the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) in London and manyother towns and cities in the UK expected to follow suit, the need for vehicles that meet the stringentrequirements of these zones is only going to increase.Of course, the source of the electricity must also be taken into account when considering total well-to-wheel emis- sions. With an increasing number of local authorities in the UK investigating renewable energy generation at their depots, and with 50% of the UK's electricity now from low-carbon sources, the possibility of powering these vehicles entirely using 'clean' energy is becoming more realistic. That's not the only benefit of our Li-On Power Pro technology. Unlike electric cars, where many buyers are put off by range anxiety and lack of charging infrastructure, waste and recycling collection, particularly urban collection, is the ideal scenario for electric vehicles. Our Li-On Power Pro RCV is extremely energy efficient, easy to handle with no compromise in performance, and can easily achieve the required shifts. Thanks to its low-noise operation, it can also operate in the early mornings and at night, contributing to an all-round better living and working environment. A major advantage is that the Li-OnPower Pro is a chassis-independent system that only requires a high-volt- age connection and CAN bus connection from and to the chassis. The single power source for both chassis and body means there is no need to carry additional battery packs. Combined with the compact and lightweight Electric solutions for waste collection fleets are no longer pie-in-the-sky, writes Stuart Cudden from RCV manufacturer GeesinknorbaWaste collection fleets: The future is electric 528PROFILEbatteries and the weight reductions achieved through the removal of the diesel engine and fuel tanks, this results in a high payload capacity. The intelligent LPP module connects with any electric chassis, available from manufacturers such as Emoss, DAF, Man, Mercedes-Benz, and Iveco, and it controls the body dynamically for highly economic energy consump- tion. In combination with the energy- saving design of the GPMIV waste collection body, our electric RCV uses approximately 1.4kWh per tonne of collected, compacted, and dumped waste - a figure that has been verified by trials across the UK in locationsincluding London, Leeds, Stockton-on- Tees, and Sheffield. In fact, there are currently 12 vehicles out in the field with customers, and general feedback is that both the chassis and body are exceeding expectations. This means it is significantly cheaper to operate than a diesel, helping to offset the higher cost of acquisition. Results from trials indicate an average daily running cost of between \u00a314 and \u00a318.50 (~\u20ac15.50 to ~\u20ac20.50), depending on location, with average daily dis- tances travelled between 88km and 175km. At current UK diesel prices,that's a daily cost saving of between \u00a3113 and \u00a3216 (~\u20ac125 and ~\u20ac240) per vehicle and up to \u00a356,000 (~\u20ac62,000) per vehicle, per year. Then there are maintenance costs to consider. An electric vehicle has fewer moving parts; there's a lot less that can go wrong. Particularly with a direct drive, maintenance is significantly reduced. In short, the sums add up. The total cost of ownership of a full-electric RCV is lower than a diesel, the perfor-mance is the same or better, and the environmental benefits speak for themselves. These vehicles are not only a good investment financially; they are an investment in the future. Stuart Cudden Corporate Account Manager Geesinknorba 530Emissions-based parking: Delivering cleaner, healthier cities There are currently lots of discussion about the environmental impact that society is making and how this will aect future generations. Local councils are trying to play their part by ramping uprecycling eorts, protecting and improving open space and wildlife, and promoting sustainable building and travel. Working towards large environmental policy shifts can seem an insurmountable challenge, but working at the local level can make a big dierence. Every little helps. So, as a council, where else can you make an impact? Parking. Ultra-low emissions zones - great in theory, but hard to implement In 2019, London was the rst city to implement anultra-low emissions zone (ULEZ) across the city. At the time it was hailed as a \"world-leading\" vehicle pollution restriction and since enforcement, it has been deemed a success. Drivers who are in cars and vans that do not meet the ULEZ emissions standards are being charged a daily rate. However, the headlines covering how successful London's ULEZ has been, encouraging other cities to follow suit, often leave out some key points. As many cities have recently experienced, introducing a ULEZ can be a costly and time-consuming undertak-ing, to the extent that many cities have had to push back launch dates because of delays with the emissions tracking technology and the supporting infrastructure. Not only this, the technology can be dicult to imple- ment and at the speed technology moves, it is likely to be obsolete within the next 10 to 20 years, rendering the millions that local councils have spent on it a waste. Additionally, ULEZs have not been shown to fundamen- tally discourage drivers from using higher pollutingvehicles as drivers may be inclined to drive more within these zones to justify the charge they have to pay. Emissions-based parking - an eective alternative On top of implementing a ULEZ, some London Councils have also invested in some easier to implement, cheaper alternatives that also help to encourage envi- ronmentally-friendly driving. An example of this is emis - sions-based parking (EBP), which was rst implemented by Westminster City Council in June 2017. \"EBP parking schemes are already making an impact. Within a year of trailing the solution, Westminster City Council saw a 16% reduction in the most polluting vehicles driving and parking in the city, without any obvious displacement to nearby parking zones.\" In a similar vein to ULEZ, EBP uses technology to track and target higher polluting vehicles but specicallywhen they park, instead of as they are driving around. Low emissions vehicles - such as electric or hybrid vehicles - can pay less to park whilst the most polluting diesel vehicles pay more. Although both ULEZs andEBP ultimately impose a higher charge on drivers with less environmentally-friendly vehicles, each solutiontackles driver habits from a dierent standpoint. Whilethe ULEZ works to discourage driving within a city, EBP instead incentivises motorists to make more environmentally-friendly choices around the vehicle they drive. EBP falls in line with the European Commission's Euro 6 standard which directs that environmentally-friendly cars should pay less; newer, cleaner petrol and diesel vehicles should pay a standard rate; and the most polluting vehicles paying the highest price. Peter O'Driscoll, Managing Director of RingGo argues that emissions-based parking delivers cleaner and healthier citiesTRANSPORT 531As most local councils have already migrated the majority of their parking payment systems to cashless app-based systems, EBP can be an easy and cost-eec- tive implementation process. The application that enables parkers to pay for parking can be provisioned to also automatically assess the car, based on real-timedata, the vehicle CO 2fuel emissions and the year of manufacture. Taris can then be automatically applied, based on the level of emissions within pre-dened brackets set by the council. \"In 2019, London was the first city to implement an ultra-low emissions zone (ULEZ) across the city. At the time it was hailed as a \"world-leading\" vehicle pollution restriction and since enforcement, it has been deemed a success. Drivers who are in cars and vans that do not meet the ULEZ emissions standards are being charged a daily rate\" This technology can also be used to target specic sitesor areas under the purview of a local government without any additional infrastructure implementation. EBP technology is also agile, so it can constantly be adapted and improved to meet the needs of the local area. Additionally, as it is implemented as part of a phone parking solution the technology will constantlyevolve to take advantage of the latest developmentswithout costing local councils large sums of money. EBP parking schemes are already making an impact. Within a year of trailing the solution, Westminster City Council saw a 16% reduction in the most polluting vehicles driving and parking in the city, without any obvious displacement to nearby parking zones. Helping councils and saving the environment Parking may not always be the rst thought people have when it comes to how local councils can implement environmentally conscious policies and may not be a key consideration when listing technology-infused industries. But think again. The parking industry is working toward helping local councils to provide cleaner, healthier and more liveable cities through technology solutions such as EBP . Emissions-based parking can specically help local gov- ernments and councils manage the pressure from large governing bodies to improve air quality, demonstrate environmental benets and ultimately make towns and cities better places to live. Peter O'Driscoll Managing many chal- lenges: an increasing demand in capacity, new digital technology, new customer requirements and an ageing workforce. This while the rail industry is one of the industries who have the highest adoption rate of the ISO 55 standard. How to cope with this? The rail industry is one of the indus- tries with the highest investments in the market. In Western Europe alone in the next 10 years, the rail industry will invest over \u20ac600 billion in mainte- nance, renewal and expansion of their assets. These must be managed, in particular, to comply with the increas- ing demand of the regulators, who not only demand good service but also transparency of investment decisionsand cost. To cope with this, many rail organisa- tions have adopted asset manage- ment as a practice to streamline their activities and get a good insight into the demands and the performance of their assets. Maintaining this is a challenge, especially given the ageing population of the workforce. Several rail organisations have indicated that between 20-25% of their staff will retire in the next five to 10 years. This is an incredible loss of knowledge and experience, which compensates for the often still limited documentationof the assets in the organisation.The Amosa team, formerly ZNAPZ, has been working in the rail industry since the mid-1990s, starting with infrastructure in the Netherlands and growing into many other regions in Europe. We first supported companies like Volker Rail and Bam Rail who took over maintenance activities from Prorail, with the right information system. This has been expanded overthe last 20 years to become a robust asset management information system, with best practices. Today, we are working with our rail customers to apply the latest digitisa- tion technology, to make better use of information technology to support their business processes. What are the key challenges? With an ageing workforce, it is paramount that the knowledge and experience of the staff, many of whom have 30-40 years been working in the company, been kept. The Equipment Maintenance Assistant from IBM,based on Watson technology, is a tool that enables all kinds of information tobe kept and managed. It goes even further, when the data, structured and unstructured is stored, the system categorises the knowledge and starts creating useful information. When patterns, like required maintenance, are planned, the system will advise the staff what to do based on the analysisof the previous years of work. The responsible people can validate the recommendations, add or alter the information, which is then stored as the new best practice. \"...many rail organisations have adopted asset management as a practice to streamline their activities and get a good insight into the demands and the performance of their assets. Maintaining this is a challenge, especially given the ageing population of the workforce.\" With machine learning (ML), the system gets wiser by the day and follows the organisation with the new processes, measurements and maintenance practices. It enables all digital data being kept today to run a real-time RCM analysis based on these latest findings. IBM's Equipment Maintenance Assis- tant is proof that digitisation can work and support the organisation in their day-to-day operations and take away some headache from the ageing workforce. How is this supporting the maturity of the organisation? With the departure of older staff, the organisation matures negatively. The team gets younger, the experience is reduced and risk increases. However, with the right tooling in place, theMarcel van Velthoven, CEO of AMOSA, argues that the rail industry has many challenges and in response to this, he explains how asset management and an increase in the maturity of the organisation can assistAsset management & maturity in the rail industry 532PROFILEorganisation is supported with best practices. Now, this knowledge is no longer dependent on one individual, but is available to all staff, at all times and places. Making this information available on mobile devices creates a knowledge base at hand for all people in the office and the field, doing their maintenance work. How can we make this work? Like most modern projects today, it is wise to start small. Taking a subset of tasks in a small area with a small team. Registering the day-to-day activ- ities and processes and storing the data that is available and the data that is required. Developing an electronic work package, which will inform the staff when this task is required what and how they should do this. It will also recommend what data must be gathered at the location and for the task to be executed. When electronic data is available, this will immediately be taken into account by the Equipment Maintenance Assis- tant, not only during the job but at any moment in time. Developing a 24/7 operations room for the rail organisa- tions maintenance department. With the right dashboard, all the risks become visible and the required investment in time and cost. Rail infra and rail operators are using the Internet of Things (IoT) today to gather data, however, the data gath- ered is hardly as valuable as it can be. It requires an increase in the maturity of the organisation to cope with the new processes, educate your staff based on these practices and develop a self-learning organisation from a people and systems point of view. This will support your ageing organisa- tion and the challenges rail companies have to cope with. We have started this process together with SBB and created a road map on how this change can be adopted and successfully applied. This will support SBB in their aim to cope with the cost cuts that they are facing, their ageing workforce and the demands on them from a technology and an increased customer expectations perspective.

Kate Hutchinson Head of Sales ECR France, Germany and Poland proposed a modernised European competition policy. A meeting in Poland with the Ministers of Economy of Poland, Germany and France highlighted the importance of an industrial policy ambitious for the European Union(EU). At this meeting, the three ministers of these countries presented a joint proposal that concerns modernising European competition policy and adapting it to the increasing digitisation of the economy and global competition. This follows on from France and Germany jointly publishing a Manifesto for a European Policy on European industrial development adapted to the 21st century, back in February 2019. On this occasion, Bruno Le Maire stated his thoughts on a modernised European competition policy: \"We know full well how much France and Europe owe to competition and to European competition rules. But competition is an ever-moving eld. In order to retain their relevance and eciency, rules must adapt to thenew economic realities, in particular to the digital revolution and to the increasing concentration observed in the economies of our main partners. Modernising our competition rules is one of the main challengesthat the EU will need to address in the coming months. \"A shared European industrial policy cannot work if we do not have a coherent competition policy and a coherent trade policy. The times when these policies could evolve in separate ways is are past us. We must think these three policies globally in order to preserve our industry.\"1 The development of sustainable nance In other news, the development of sustainable nance was discussed, in that France will make strong proposals at the European level to develop a high-quality non-nancial reporting framework. Bruno Le Maire put the development of sustainable nance on the agenda of the meeting of the G7 Finance Ministers in July 2019. Here, we take a look at the financial priorities for France, including comment on a modernised European competition policy and the development of sustainable finance Image: \u00a9 Plej92 | Dreamstime.comFINANCE The financial priorities for FranceFINANCE 537Bruno Le Maire provided detailed comments on the development of sustainable nance: \"After the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and the One Planet Summit in 2017, this meeting marks a new stage in the mobilisation of the nancial centre of Paris in favour of green nance. By announcing that the players onthe Paris nancial centre will acquire by mid-2020 of a coal strategy and an observatory dedicated to green nance, the place is making a far-reaching, fully collective commitment for the rst time. The climate commit- ments will be independently monitored by supervisors. The market players will work on a global timetable for the exit of activity funding emissions from coal. \"This mobilisation must be carried to the international level. At the meeting of the Ministers of the Finance of the G7 of Chantilly, I will invite all my counterparts towork on the reorientation nancial flows towards a resilient and low-carbon economy. The President of the Republic will present the progress of nance for cli- mate at the Action Summit United Nations climate change conference next September\". (2) The nancial priorities for France Following on from the above comment, we know that a Meeting of Finance Ministers and Bank Governors took place at the G7 of Chantilly. Here, four priorities forFrance during this G7 Finance meeting were underlines: 1. Building taxation for the 21st century: A call by France for a new international tax system adapted to the new economic model created by the revolution of the data economy and secondly, introducing a tax on companies at the international level to tackle evasion. 2. Towards sustainable capitalism: As discussed earlier in the article, the country wishes to develop green nance that vitally supports the huge investments required to ensure a successful ecological transition. 3. Build stable capitalism and better combat specula- tion risks, cyber-risk and excessive concentrations: Measures to address cyberattacks on the nancial sector and the role of (virtual money units) in the nancial system, including Facebook's Libra project,are examined.4. Building equitable capitalism: This can be, for example, carried out by strengthening transparency on gapswhen it comes to improving sustainable nancing ofinvestments in developing countries. In particular, there is a desire here to improve the nancial inclusion of women in Africa. A good place to end this article on is precisely on the thoughts of Bruno Le Maire, Minister of the Economy and Finance, who concisely summarises the nancial priorities for the country, which includes a call to sustainability. \"France has an ambition for this G7 Finance: rebuilding capitalism. Capitalism as it exists today, the one that rests on resource depletion, increasing inequalities and tax dierences between digital companies and other companies, and that revolts our fellow citizens is doomed to ruin. We want to rebuild capitalism so that it is more just, more responsible and more sustainable.\" 3 References https://mine.hosting.augure.com/Augure_Mine/r/ContenuEnLign- e/Download?id=64AC3C5F-85CA-409C-8E9E-89AD5619B709&le- n a m e = 1 3 1 3 % 2 0 - % 2 0 U n e % 2 0 n o u v e l l e % 2 0 % C 3 % A 9 tape%20pour%20verdir%20le%20syst%C3%A8me%20nancier.pdf 3. https://mine.hosting.augure.com/Augure_Mine/r/ContenuEnLign- e/Download?id=E6076CEB-2173-400C-8826-58C1C37E4541&le- name=1344-%20CP%20G7Finance%20%C3%A0%20Chantilly.pdf Open Access Government editorial@openaccessgovernment.org www.openaccessgovernment.org www.twitter.com/OpenAccessGovThe importance of institutional investors in financial markets has increased considerably over the last decades. For example, while financial institutions, such as mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, banks and insurance companies, owned only 7% of all U.S. equity in 1950, today they account for about 80% of equity ownership. Moreover, they are responsible for a majority of the transactions in today's financial markets. Notably, the objectives of these institutional investors differ from those of traditional households. While both try to manage their funds to maximise portfolio returns, institu-tional investors are usually also concerned about their performance relative to a benchmark (often a stock- market index). Such benchmarking concerns arise from the observation that financial institutions who beat their benchmark attract considerably more capital from clients in the future. This, in turn, increases future manage- ment fees and, hence, future profits. Benchmarking concerns also arise from explicit performance fees.Specifically, to align the incentives of fund managers and their clients, asset-management contracts often specify that managers get paid higher fees if they outperform their benchmark. This practice of benchmarking can have a substantial impact on financial- market equilibrium because - due to their sheer size - institutional investors often act as the \"marginal investor.\" However, while the impact of bench- marking on asset prices has been studied before (see, e.g., Cuoco and Kaniel (2011) and Basak and Pavlova (2013)), benchmarking might also affect the informational role of finan- cial markets, that is, their ability to aggregate and disseminate informa- tion. Intuitively, investors continuously try to obtain \"private information\" (i.e., information not available to others) by studying financial statements or uncovering information about consumers' tastes or macro-economic trends; with the goal of generating trading profits and, hence, high portfolio returns. Whenever an investor uses such pri- vate information in his or her trading, part of the information gets incorpo- rated into stock prices. For example, if an investor - following positive (negative) firm-specific news - buys (sells) shares of a company, the firm's stock price goes up (down) which, in turn,reveals part of the investor's information to other investors. Thus, by tracking stock-price movements in financial markets, investors can infer private information that other investors possess. The degree towhich prices incorporate and reveal information is called informational efficiency and is of foremost impor- tance because it determines the efficient allocation of capital in the economy. Consequently, the main objective of a recent research project of Matthijs Breugem (Collegio Carlo Alberto) and myself, published in The Review of Financial Studies, is to explore how the growth in assets-under-manage- ment by benchmarked financial insti- tutions affects informational efficiency and, in turn, asset prices and investors' portfolio returns. For that purpose, we develop a novel theoretical frame- work that explicitly accounts for the information choices of institutional investors that are concerned about their performance relative to a bench-mark. In the model, investors not only decide on their optimal portfolio butalso decide how much capital they want to allocate to the acquisition of private information. We document two distinct economicmechanisms through which bench- marking affects the information con- tent of financial markets. First, due to benchmarking concerns, institutional investors use a part of their portfolio to replicate the benchmark which, consequently, does not benefit from (more precise) private information. Adrian Buss, Associate Professor of Finance at INSEAD explains the impact of institutional investors on informational efficiency here in detail, an aspect relevant to all participants in today's financial markets Financial markets: The impact of institutional investors on informational efficiency 538PROFILEAs a result, private information can only be applied to a smaller fraction of the portfolio which reduces its value. Hence, benchmarked financial institutions invest less in informationacquisition. Second, benchmarked institutional investors are less \"aggres- sive\" in their use of private information. That is, they trade fewer shares for a given piece of information so that - with each trade - less of the available private information gets incorporated into prices. Both effects imply a reduction in infor- mational efficiency as the assets- under-management of benchmarked institutional investors increase, as illustrated in the Figure. In particular, while the first effect implies that less private information is available in theeconomy, the second effect impliesthat less of the available informationgets incorporated into stock prices. Ultimately, all investors can infer less about fundamentals from stock prices; a prediction that is consistent with empirical evidence on the impact of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on stock-price informativeness (Israeli, Lee, and Sridharan, 2017). This reduction in informational effi- ciency has important implications for asset prices and the performance of fund managers. For example, because stock prices track fundamentals less closely, stock-price fluctuations aremore pronounced, that is, stock- return volatility goes up. Moreover, because institutional investors thatare more concerned about their benchmark acquire less information,they earn lower average portfolio returns than their less-benchmarked(i.e., more active) peers.In summary, our work demonstrates that the growth in assets-under-man- agement by benchmarked financial institutions reduces informational efficiency. As such, it highlights a novel tension between benchmarking as a tool to align the incentives between fund managers and their clients and its adverse effects on individual man-agers' portfolio returns and informa- tional efficiency.

Also, CJEU settles legal disputes between national governments and EU institutions and in some cases, organisations, companies and individuals can take action against an EU institution, perhaps if they feel their rights have been infringed. It's worth noting here that the CJEU is divided into two courts: Court of Justice is concerned with requests for prelim- inary rulings from national courts, certain actions for appeals and annulment. General Court deals with rules on actions for annul- ment brought by individuals, companies and, in some cases, EU governments. Essentially, this court deals mainly with competition law, trade, agriculture, stateaid and trademarks. (1) The Court of Justice of the European Union This article will briefly focus on the work of the Court of Justice. 28 Judges and 11 Advocates General work in the Court of Justice, appointed by Member State governments following consultation of a panel who provide an opinion on the suitability of prospective candidates' to perform the required duties. Appointed in oce for six years, which is renewable, we know that such eminent people are selected from \"individuals whose independence is beyond doubt and who possess the qualications required for appointment, in their respective countries, to the highest judicial oces, or who are of recognised competence.\"On the website of the CJEU, we learn about the important roles of the President, Vice-President, the AdvocatesGeneral and many more. \"The Judges of the Court of Justice elect from amongst themselves a President and a Vice-President for a renewable term of three years. The President directs the work of the Court and presides at hearings and deliberations of the full Court or the Grand Chamber. The Vice-President assists the President in the exercise of his duties and takes his place when necessary. \"The Advocates General assist the Court. They are responsible for presenting, with complete impartiality and independence, an 'opinion' in the cases assigned to them. \"The Registrar is the institution's secretary-general and manages its departments under the authority of the President of the Court.\"The Court may sit as a full court, in a Grand Chamber of 15 Judges or in Chambers of three or ve Judges.\" Language in the CJEU One interesting example of the CJEU's work concerns language arrangements. For example, when it comes to direct actions, one of the 24 ocial languages of the EU will be used in the application or in other words, the 'language of the case' in which the proceedings are conducted. The website of the CJEU details more information about their language arrangements. \"In appeals, the language of the case is that of the judgment or order of the General Court which is under appeal. With references for preliminary rulings, the language of the case is that of the national court The important work of the Court of Justice of the European Union is introduced here, including details of language arrangements in place and how their work impacts the lives of EU citizensLEGAL AFFAIRS 541which made the reference to the Court of Justice. Oral proceedings at hearings are interpreted simultaneously, as required, into various ocial languages of the European Union. The Judges deliberate, without inter-preters, in a common language which, traditionally, is French.\" Impacting the lives of EU citizens Finally, it is worth outlining that the CJEU clearly has much impact on the daily life of EU citizens in light of the fact that thousands of judgments are given by the Court, especially preliminary rulings. One example of a judgment given in an important area of EU law is the principle of free movement of goods. Following the Cassis de Dijon judgment in 1979, traders are able to import into their own country any product from another EU country, as long as it is lawfully marketed and manufactured. Another example concerns the respect for fundamental rights; indeed, the Court has contributed greatly to improving the standards of the protection of such rights. One more example concerns European Union citizenship, something that eachperson is entitled to if they hold the nationality of a Member State, as part of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

With the support of a generous grant from the European Research Council (ERC), we are conducting a five-year comparative study in three jurisdictions - Israel, England & Wales, and Italy - to clarify their current and potential roles and to thus help litigants navigate their way through the legal system. The goals of this wide-ranging research project, the Judicial Conflict Resolution (JCR) Collaboratory, are threefold. First, it seeks to empirically describe the role of judges in promoting settlements, the nature of this involvement, and the various alternative dispute resolution tools employed by judges in this process. Second, the research seeks to advance theory concerning the new roles performed by judges in the courtroom, which will lead to the con- ceptualisation of a new jurisprudence of Judicial Conflict Resolution. Finally, the research seeks to develop policy recommendations and training schemes for judges, and to establish normsand regulations for the process of reaching settlements. We have found that in the three systems roles of judges have changed as the legal systems strive to minimise the cost and time of legal proceedings. The aspiration for efficiency has led toan emphasis on the pre-trial stage (where sides are encouraged to settle), abbreviated trials, conciliation hearings, and referral to mediation and other alternative dispute resolution processes to reduce the caseload. In the common lawsystems (Israel, England & Wales), the large majority of cases are dis- posed of without trial. In Italy, which has a civil law system, we found that this process is beginning, and creating an interesting model of jurisprudence - in which there is a sharp distinction between justice achieved through adjudication and mediation. While judicial roles have changed dramatically due to the vanishing trial phenomenon , they have not been explicitly formulated in legislation, and are not documented in official public legal records. We found that relevant state-provided data are sorely lacking. We filled these gaps in data through courtroom observations and interviews, as well as a meticulous statistical docket analysis. In the pre-trial stage - which is often the closest that sides embarking on a legal procedure will ever get to trial in adversarial systems (e.g., case man- agement conferences in England and Wales and pre-trial conferences in Israel), judges use a mix of tools that can be proactive and are mostly char- acterised by a narrow focus on costs and time. In Israel, these practices also include risk assessment and prediction. In Italy, following reforms to reduce a severe backlog of cases, judges are issuing judicial conciliation proposals and mediation orders during trial. In most cases, in the three systems, judges will not use a broad spectrum of relevant and available conflict resolution methods. This state of affairs raises the question as to the place of efficiency (in terms of time and cost) in legal systems. While efficiency is important and justice deferred is actually justice denied, it does notseem sufficient as an overarching goal of a legal system. In Israel and Italy, no articulation of a concrete perspective of justice exists while constant reforms have focused on effective case man- agement and pre-mediation manda- tory meetings. In England such an attempt to clarify the goals of the legalsystem has been made - with a focus on \"access to justice\" together with the designation of adjudication as a \"last resort\" for civil law cases. Prof Michal Alberstein, PI of the European Research Council funded project 'Judicial Conflict Resolution', discusses her view on the future of the judicial roleThe future of the judiciary: Rising above efficiency 542PROFILE Prof Michal Alberstein, Principal InvestigatorHowever, this formulation was made in the shadow of severe budgetary cuts to the civil justice system, and many litigants, including the disadvan- taged, are at times barred from entering the court due to high costs. Mediation, too, falls short of its promise, and is largely influenced by the institutional drive for efficiency and settlement rather than the inter- ests and needs of the parties. Within the two adversarial cultures examined, neither adjudication nor substantialADR are common - the public loses both ideals. Interestingly, we found that in Italy, inwhich the judiciary is inspired by the inquisitorial tradition, the dichotomy between mediation and adjudication is more preserved and judges main- tain their roles as legal truth seekers, while acknowledging the other dimen- sions of conflict that mediation can address. Following our research findings thus far, our recommendations as to the future of the judiciary are as follows: Coherent dispute system design of the court system. The desired goalsof the legal system, including the role of judges, should be discussed and explicitly framed and implemented through theory building and articula- tion of values. Theorists and policy- makers may experiment with conflict resolution as the dominant goal, making adjudication an alternative door, and considering whether judges are active leaders in the system or have a different, supplementary role. Following this theory-building, judges should be trained accordingly. Increased transparency and data collection . Accurate data should be collected and made available so that parties (whether they be consumers or tort claimants) can make informed choices and have a real perspective on what happens when settlements are the norm. This follows our finding that data on rates of settlements and outcomes of legal verdicts are mostly inaccurate and inaccessible to litigants as they try to process their disputes. Full records of court settlement hear- ings and all forms of abbreviated trials should also be made available. The electronic legal file should become a universal framework to collect data in ways that will enable parties to learnabout the reality of legal settlements, and for scholars to compare among legal systems. This will also have an effect on the judicial role by reducing the caseload. Ultimately the determination of judicial roles should be a result of a thorough deliberation among the various stakeholders in the legal system. A conscious decision and a push for transparency is much better than the currently abstruse reality.

Law and Language: Understanding multilingual EU Law Linguistic cultural compromise in EU law 'Linguistic Precedent' in European Union Law This article focuses on the LLECJ Project's third sub-project: The impact of language and multilingualism on the role of Advocate General (AG) at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).1 The role of the AG is to deliver an independent reasoned opinion in certain cases before the CJEU, as to the response s/he considers should be given to the problems raised in such cases. Although AGs' opinions are not legally binding, they play an important role in the development of European Union (EU) law. The opinion provides a type of 'dissenting judg- ment' and AGs can act as the CJEU's 'sparring partner' by challenging the Court to tackle issues in a manner that allows EU law to grow and develop. Since the opinion is not limited to answering legal questions raised by the parties to a case, AGs can be specula- tive in a way that the CJEU cannot be in its collegiate judgments. AGs' opinions resemble academic texts to a largedegree, drawing on various sources oflaw, earlier CJEU decisions, national jurisprudence and other sources. As such, they go well beyond providing a commentary on the question(s) in a particular case: identifying trends, testing for potential inconsistencies in the case law and highlighting possible future developments. AGs are thus seen as drivers of EU law, and their opinions inject creativity in the development of EU jurisprudence in a way that CJEU judgments simply do not. Prior to 2004, AGs drafted their opin- ions in their own mother tongues. This, together with other factors, meant that issues of multilingualism and trans-lation rarely constrained the text of opinions. In 2004, with the mega-enlargement of the EU, which intro- duced a further 10 official languages to the list of then 11 (with three more added in the interim), a convention wasintroduced at the CJEU whereby AGs are expected to draft their opinions in oneof the Court's pivot languages (at the time of writing: French, English, German, Spanish and Italian). 2This convention, which does not affect most of the permanent AGs, means that since 2004 some AGs have been writing their opinions in languages other than their mother tongue (usually English or French). This sub- project sought to examine changes in the linguistic aspect of the AG's role since 2004, and to determine whatimplications (if any) those changes might have for the construction and consolidation of CJEU jurisprudence. The research questions investigated in this sub-project included: 1. To what extent has language use had an impact on the usefulness of AG opinions? 2. Are AGs' opinions becoming more constrained by language/translation? 3. Do opinions of AGs drafting in their mother tongues differ linguistically from those drafting in the CJEU's pivot languages? To investigate those research questions, an interdisciplinary mixed-methods approach was taken. A systematic literature review demonstrated that the literature tends to link 'influence' and 'usefulness' of opinions with persuasion, and the general consensus is that language plays a fundamental part in one's ability to persuade.Dr Karen McAuliffe, PI on the European Research Council funded project 'Law and Language at the European Court of Justice', discusses the impact of language and multilingualism on the role of Advocate General at the Court of Justice of the European UnionThe Advocate General at the Court of Justice of the European Union: The linguistic aspect 544PROFILEEmpirical observational and interview data demonstrated: (a) that AGs' opin- ions are a collective endeavour; (b) the change in drafting convention in 2004 heralded a shift in roles not only within certain AGs' cabinets (cham-bers), but also for lawyer-linguists who have taken on a new role of 'linguistic assistance'; (c) all of those involved in producing AGs' opinions acknowledge the importance of using language to craft 'persuasive' opinions. Finally, corpus linguistic analysis demonstrated that post-2004 opinions drafted in non-mother tongue lang - uages are stylistically simpler, and include more markers for translation variables, than pre-2004 opinions drafted in mother-tongue languages. Interestingly, however, we see very similar shifts in stylistics in post-2004 opinions drafted in mother-tongue languages. This may be due to many factors, including the composition of an AG's cabinet, but may also highlight an interesting example of the CJEU'sinstitutional language influencing its jurisprudence, regardless of drafting language. Further research is planned to investigate the new questions raised in this regard. Ultimately this research has demon- strated that language has a measurable impact on the style, and arguably the substance, of AGs' opinions. Such findings must be further investigated to determine their significance in legal scholarship. Only through such inter- disciplinary research can a holistic understanding of the development of EU jurisprudence be achieved.
