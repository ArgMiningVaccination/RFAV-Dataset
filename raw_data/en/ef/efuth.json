This search for truth permeates between faith and science, but basically defines that reality is essentially spiritual: the individual is helped to overcome the material world in order to then understand the spiritual world. This understanding is of utmost importance because, according to Anthroposophy, there is an independent type of perception, not tied to your body, which escapes our physical understanding. In this file you can learn more about this science and its benefits for health. Anthroposophic medicine, medicine and anthroposophy Anthroposophic medicines are obtained from nature, made exclusively from mineral, vegetable and animal substances. There are no synthetic components, unlike the common allopathic remedies you usually find in pharmacies. Anthroposophic medicines Anthroposophic treatments are various and using medicines is also involved in this method. The medicines of this specialty are produced by means of substances 100% extracted from nature, such as ores, various plants and some animals like bees or corals. By means of homeopathic techniques such as dilution and dynamization of the elements and by means of procedures from the pharmacy which is extended by anthroposophy, in medicines from metals and herbal medicines. When using anthroposophic medicines, it can also be important to use medicines from conventional pharmacies together. But it is not only specific remedies that anthroposophic medicine uses, it also makes suggestions for better eating habits, health as a whole and lifestyle, thus creating the possibility of working in harmony with the therapies that involve anthroposophy. Anthroposophic medicine Around the world, the training of anthroposophical doctors is considered a continuation of conventional medical training. In general, anthroposophical medicine can be described as a practice of doctors alone, valued for collective effort, and is considered an interdisciplinary branch, for example, when it is necessary for the patient to seek out specialties such as psychologists,therapists, rhythmic massage therapists, eurythmists and other specialties. Specifically in Brazil, there are professionals with master's and doctoral degrees, with a strong connection to medicine in the academic field. There are also pediatricians and general practitioners in the country who expand their practices with anthroposophical knowledge, as well as other specialties, such as rheumatology, oncology, cardiology, pulmonology, psychiatry, and gynecology. All these specializations of doctors, are in a constant renewal of methods, thus enabling a constant improvement in the quality of treatments that are available to their patients. The attitudes which differentiate and characterize the approaches to health problems through anthroposophic medicine are varied. Their starting point is a view of each patient, their health, illnesses and the way of life they lead. In the case of an illness, the professional who uses anthroposophy will take into account the patient's entire clinical picture, taking into account factors such as symptoms, laboratory tests, physical or imaging tests that have been performed, as well as another doctor. Another point that doctors of this area will also research, through an illness, is how the vitality of the patient is, the cognitive and emotional development and how the patient has lived life over the years, that is, his or her life history. With such approaches, the common diagnosis can and should be more intense and individualized. The principle of imbalances can be located more precisely and treated such as therapy. Natural medicines can also be involved in the treatments. The anthroposophical conception of the human being Anthroposophy, from the Greek \"knowledge of the human being\", introduced at the beginning of the 20th century by the Austrian Rudolf Steiner, can be characterized as a method of knowledge of the nature of the human being and the universe, which expands the knowledge obtained by the conventional scientific method, as well as its application in practically all areas of human life. How anthroposophical medicine came about It can be said that this medicine began in Europe in the early twentieth century, based on the image of man brought by anthroposophy, spiritual science and Rudolf Steiner an Austrian philosopher. The precursor of this study was Ita Wegman, physician, who, based on conversations with Rudolf Steiner, developed the theory of an innovative branch of medicine, recommending remedies and therapies for various diseases. Nowadays this medicine is present all over the world, being active in approximately 40 countries and the regulatory institution worldwide of this branch of medicine is the Medical Section of the Goetheanum to which the ABMA belongs. Various other areas of knowledge have been strongly influenced by anthroposophy, for example Waldorf education, biodynamic agriculture, architecture inspired by anthroposophy, pharmaceuticals, curative education and even areas such as economics and business management. Anthroposophical medicine in Brazil Brazil is the second country in the world with the largest number of anthroposophical doctors, after Germany. There are more than 300 professionals certified by the Brazilian Association of Anthroposophical Medicine (ABMA) in the country. Anthroposophic medicine can be found in the Unified Health System, in the city of Belo Horizonte, as part of public health clinics and in the didactic outpatient clinic of ABMA in the Minas Gerais region. In the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, it is present in some units of the PSF - Family Health Program, in the Social Clinic of the Monte Azul Community Association and in the Didactic and Social Clinic of ABMA. There is also the didactic and social ambulatory of Florian\u00f3polis that provides services to the needy. Anthroposophy It is a human-oriented philosophy that reflects and speaks about the deep spiritual questions of humanity, about the need to relate to the world through a conscious attitude, about the need to develop a relationship with the world in total freedom and on the basis of completely individual judgments and decisions. Administration of medicines, action and differences between the others Taking care of your health is something very important, especially in times when the way of living is highly conducive to the emergence of various diseases. However, not everyone accepts only traditional forms of treatment anymore, and that is exactly why people need to know what anthroposophic medicines are. For many people, this alternative ends up being the most advantageous, because it provides a more complete and lasting well-being and still has the absence of the so feared side effects. Forms of administration of medication For the administration of anthroposophic medicine, there is a special care of procedure and administration, for example, silver, which is a mineral widely used in this branch of medicine, being dynamized in accordance with the lunar phase, because it has a strong influence of the moon and this has already been evidenced in several scientific experiments. The most common forms of administration of anthroposophic medicines are oral, injectable, subcutaneous and topical (external compresses of creams, ointments or oils). Anthroposophic drugs are regulated as dynamised drugs by the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa), through RDC n\u00ba 26 of 30 March 2007. Anthroposophic Pharmacy is supported by the Federal Council of Pharmacy, being recognized by the CFF through Resolution CFF 465/2007. The action of anthroposophic medicine Anthroposophic medicines are dynamised, that is, they undergo processes which dilute and agitate them several times, reaching very discrete concentrations of the substance which possesses the active principle. The intention is to awaken the healing potential, which is naturally numb in the person. There are also versions made with the basis with tinctures of plants, dry extracts and teas. Nowadays, the anthroposophic pharmacy already has the recognition of the Federal Pharmacy Council and is officially validated by ANVISA (National Health Surveillance Agency), with its own identity for its category. Differences between anthroposophic and other medicines Anthroposophic medicines are dynamised, that is, they go through processes that dilute and agitate them several times, reaching very discrete concentrations of the substance that possesses the active principle. The intention is to awaken the healing potential, which is naturally numb in the person. There are also versions made from tinctures of plants, dry extracts and teas. Nowadays, the anthroposophic pharmacy already has the recognition of the Federal Pharmacy Council and is officially validated by ANVISA (National Health Surveillance Agency), with its own identity for its category. Chronic disease prevention Anthropology has developed an important conceptual and methodological apparatus for the systematic study of cultural ways of thinking and acting associated with health. It enables the examination of relationships (interactions and contradictions) between models of practice, which support the organization of services, prevention programs and therapeutic interventions, and users' cultural models. From there, it provides parameters for reframing the issue of sociocultural appropriateness of different health programs. It uses resources that stimulate the natural mechanisms of disease prevention and health recovery, with emphasis on welcoming listening, development of therapeutic bond and integration of the patient with the environment and society. Non-pharmacological measures of anthroposophic medicine This branch of medicine presents itself as a complementary medical-therapeutic approach, of vitalist basis, whose model of attention is organized in a transdisciplinary way, seeking the integrality of health care. Among the therapeutic resources used by anthroposophy, the following stand out: the use of external applications (baths and compresses), massages, rhythmic movements, therapyartistic and the ingestion of natural remedies (herbal or dynamised). Multiprofessional approach Ghelman and Benevides still explain that the expression \"Anthroposophic Medicine\" is used, in the strict sense, as a reference to the performance of medical professionals who exercise this approach in their clinical practice, whether general practitioners or specialists. One of the eligibility criteria for graduation in this branch of medicine, worldwide, is graduation in medicine and obtaining registration as a physician with the country's medical board. The training of anthroposophical physicians consists of a postgraduate program with a thousand hours of theory and practice. Nationally, the Brazilian Association of Anthroposophical Medicine is responsible for the training of anthroposophical physicians. But this complex medical system, whose basic characteristics are transdisciplinary and multiprofessional organization, in the nearly 60 countries where it is present, is surrounded by other health professions and specific therapeutic modalities. Among the health professions that stand out in this context are Pharmacy, Nursing, Psychology and Dentistry. Specific therapeutic modalities include rhythmic massage, anthroposophical body therapy, anthroposophical art therapy, singing therapy, music therapy and eurythmy therapy. Ghelman and Benevides state that biographical counselling is an area of anthroposophical organisational development which is being applied to the health field as a complementary resourcefor self-knowledge. Demystifying anthroposophy One of anthroposophy's great expectations is that there will be a renewal of scientific research, still assuming anthropocentrism (man at the centre of everything), but also admitting the interference of nature. Bringing this kind of sensitivity to more complex studies can be very advantageous for the expansion of theories, above all in the production of new medicines. Even with this concept anthroposophy cannot be confused with dogmas, religions or theosophy, as can be seen below. Anthroposophy is not a mystical movement of ideas This science cannot be considered a movement that involves the mysticism of ideas. One can define mysticism as something that is based on feelings and actions that are not a continuation of rational thought, thus being concepts transmitted in the form of images and metaphors. Anthroposophy, on the other hand, is derived from constant observations by a flow of thought in which the person is conscious, and is passed on in concept form, guiding his search for understanding of events, ideas and phenomena that characterize the contemporary patient. Anthroposophy is not dogmatic Anthroposophy does not fit into the concept of dogma. For its creator Rudolf preached that people should not believe in what he presented, it was necessary to have it as a hypothesis to be worked out in order to achieve a personal proof. Thus everything that he exposes of knowledge is necessary that is always verified with the events that are observed in nature, with insto form a whole that has coherence and does not contradict scientific facts. Steiner also stated that anthroposophy had to be dynamic and always follow the development of the human being, who by his nature is not stable, so his theory was appropriate for the time in which he lived and for the present day. Anthroposophy is not moralistic Another important point to note is that anthroposophy cannot be considered moralistic. For professionals and patients who adopt anthroposophy, there are no pre-established rules or standards of conduct, such as a living principle. The individual needs to determine his own rules of conduct, being conscious of his actions, so as to have knowledge as a basis and not be carried away by unconscious impulses or having traditions as a reference. Anthroposophy is not a religion or mediumism Anthroposophy cannot be defined as a religion, as seen earlier, it has no cults, it is performed individually or in structured study groups that are open and in facilities that induce the practice. Neither can it be affirmed that this science uses mediumship. The outcropping through the senses, being called suprasensible must be practiced through a state of full consciousness, respecting the state of self-awareness and the particularities of each one. Anthroposophy is not a sect or closed society No student of this science receives secret instructions, all the studies are published and the various groups which unite to study it, especially the branch of the Anthroposophical Society in Brazil, can be attended by any number of people at any time. Thus it is not considered to be a restricted society, making it possible for all people to become members of the General Anthroposophical Society, either directly or through one of the branches of the Anthroposophical Society in Brazil. A person's inclusion in this kind of society is not dependent on ethnicity, religious belief, education or socio-economic level. Anthroposophy is not theosophy Rudolf Steiner began his career by giving lectures on the results of his empirical methods and observations of the spiritual realm to groups of the Theosophical Society at the beginning of the 20th century. In his autobiography Steiner describes that at that time the only people who were interested in a transmissionconceptual of esoteric reality. With this, he became General Secretary of that society, where he remained until the year 1912, but because the group had divergent ideas from his, Rudolf decided to found mid 1913 the Anthroposophical Society, completely disassociating itself from the previous society. It is just to read some of his books to notice that his contribution was never based on the theosophical writings, when he started giving lectures about esoteric subjects Rudolf used some theosophical terminology, but soon he developed his own nomenclature, more adequate to that time and with the focus of having a western concept. Can anthroposophic medicine treat all illnesses? Being an extension of traditional medicine, anthroposophy provides a wide range in the treatment of various diseases, even being called only as a therapy that complements other treatments and being linked to other forms of therapies. However, a person can seek an anthroposophical doctor even without being sick. This specialty provides guidance and remedies thathelp in the fight against various diseases, improving the quality of life and well-being of patients. "}
