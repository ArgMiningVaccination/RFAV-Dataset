The Instruction also establishes safety and health programs, as identified in subsequent chapters, for Directorate/Regional implementation. The SHMS and its p rograms establish baseline requirements and within established guidelines, may be supplemented or augmented to ensure the safety and health of all OSHA employees as well as temporary and contract employees. Changes related to the implementation of SHMS may be made with local SHMS committee approval. Changes to the SHMS or programs that alter SHMS or program policies require National Labor -Management Steering Committee review and approval. The SHMS and its programs will be implemented in phases per the timetable that will be provided by Directorate of Technical Support and Emergency Management (DTSEM). Nothing in the instruction eliminates the Regional Administrator or Directorate's obligations to comply with OSHA or other Federal Regulations and Executi ve Orders. Significant Changes Appendix B from Chapter 22: Electrical Safety was removed because the equipment listed was not meeting the desired intent, which was to list equipment that requires advanced training (i.e. Qualified Persons). The need for on -the-job training, approval, and potentially Qualified Persons training before using electrical testing equipment was clarified in a way that allows flexibility in the Regions and as equipment changes.

TESTS AND RECORDS 1. INTRODUCTION I. Purpose The purpose of this Instruction is to define and implement a Field Safety and Health Management System (SHMS) and appropriate safety and health programs, as identified in the subsequent chapters, for OSHA. OSHA is responsible for ensuring that employees o f the Agency have a safe and healthful workplace that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Act and with OSHA standards. Establishing an effective SHMS appropriate to employees' varied work responsibilities and workplace conditions is also an es sential strategy to eliminate/control hazards before they lead to fatalities, injuries and illnesses. II. Scope This Instruction applies OSHA -wide. Due to the unique technical support the Health Response Team (HRT) provides to the field, it may develop polic ies and procedures, not covered by this Instruction, to protect HRT employees from specific hazards during work activities only the HRT is expected to conduct. These policies and procedures will comply with OSHA standards while allowing the HRT to provide support to the field during emergent or critical situations. The HRT is a branch of the Salt Lake Technical Center, Directorate of Technical Support and Emergency Management. III.

Federal Program Cha nge This instruction describes a Federal Program Change for which State adoption is not required. VI. Changes to Existing MOUs Regions that have preexisting Memorandums Of Understanding (MOU) and/or safety and health management programs need to review them against this Safety and Health Management System to ensure consistency. The MOUs and any program po rtions that are not consistent need to be sent to the Directorate of Technical Support and Emergency Management with justification for why the deviation is necessary. A final determination will be made by the joint labor - management steering committee. 2-3 CHAPTER 2. SAFETY AND HEALTH MA NAGEMENT SYSTEM The basic tenets of an effective SHMS are Management Commitment and Leadership , Employee Participation, Worksite Analysis, Hazard Prevention and Control and Safety and Health Training. I. Management Commitment and Leaders hip Policy Statement It is the policy of the Agency to provide a safe and healthful work environment for all permanent, temporary, and contract employees. It is also our policy to provide the same safe and healthful environment for our visitors. OSHA is not only committed to ensuring a safe and healthful work environment for others, but is equally committed to the safety and health of its employees. The development, implementation, and evaluation of this Safety and Health Management System (SHMS) shall be a cooperative effort between labor and management in order to prevent injuries, illnesses, and death from work -related causes and minimize losses of material resources. The information contained in this SHMS shall be used to assist employees and superviso rs in carrying out their responsibilities of ensuring a safe and healthful working environment. This SHMS establishes the framework of a continuing process for providing occupational safety and health guidelines and information to all personnel. OSHA's co mmitment is to ensure continuous improvement by establishing procedures for annual self -evaluation and follow -up. The safety, health, and well - being of OSHA's Federal employees, contractors, and members of the visiting public are a shared responsibility. Management will provide training and the time necessary for successful implementation of all aspects of this program. Roles and Responsibilities 1. National Office a. The Assistant Secretary bears responsibility for the health and safety of OSHA employees as well as temporary, contract and visiting employees and will demonstrate leadership and commitment for employee safety and health. The Assistant Secretary will hold Regional Administrators accountable for the SHMS and programs within their respective offic es. b. The National Field Safety and Health Steering Committee consists of three executive field management representatives and three NCFLL representatives. 2-4 2. DTSEM will be organizationally responsible for the implementation and management of the program. DTSEM will: a. Support the Regions in the implementation of the SHMS, e.g. provide guidance and assistance . b. Maintain oversight of SHMS . c. Review and submit, to National Field Safety and Health Steering Committee, all changes to the SHMS submitted by the Regions other than those that describe site specific roles and responsibilities. d. Review Annual SHMS Self -Evaluations submitted by the Regions and provide guidance as needed. e. Compile and maintain injury/illness/incident reports and analyze trends and share recommen dations and success stories as appropriate. f. Provide safety and healt h performance updates on a semi -annual basis to the National Field Safety & Health Steering Committee which includes the status of: i. Regional progress towards safety and health goals; ii. Regi onal percent completion of mandatory training; iii. Regional percent completion of annual physicals; iv. Regional percent completion of respirator fit tests; v. Regional percent completion of required annual exercises (e.g. Continuity Of Operations Plan, Shelter In Pl ace Plan, Occupant Emergency Plan, Local Contingency Plan); vi. Regional percent completion of required inspections (e. g. office inspections, vehicle inspections, SCBA inspections ) vii. Regional number of incidents investigated and percentage of timely reporting (w ithin 5 days); 3. Regional Offices The Regional Administrator s bear responsibility for the health and safety of all Regional employees as well as temporary, contract and visiting employees . The Regional Administrat or will demonstrate leadership and commitment to employee safety and health. See Chapter 4 for roles and responsibilities specific to the Regions. 2-5 4. Area and District Offices The Area Director s bear responsibility for the health and safety of the staff as well as temporary, contract and visiting emplo yees within the Area and District Offices. The Area Director will demonstrate leadership and commitment to employee safety and health. See Chapter 5 for roles and responsibilities specific to the Area and District Offices. II. Employee Participation Each employee covered by this instruction is responsible for: 1. Following all of the safety and health rules and practices of the SHMS and safety and health programs; 2. Monitoring and reporting to their supervisor (or designee) any unsafe conditions for prompt corr ection; 3. Correcting any hazard that they have the ability to correct and report that event to the applicable supervisor (or designee), e.g. their Regional Administrator/Area Director/Unit Manager and/or Assistant Area Director (AAD)/ appropriate OSHA manager ; 4. Providing feedback to their applicable supervisor (or designee) regarding the need for additional controls to ensure safety and health standards are met; 5. Setting the example as a leader in occupational safety and health to others in the course of their p rofessional duties ; 6. Avoiding exposure to any recognized uncontrolled hazard ; and 7. Participating meaningfully in SHMS activities, for example; preparing Job Hazard Analyses (JHA), conducting accident investigations, and serving on safety and health committ ees. All employees shall be provided access to: training materials; safety data sheets; results of inspections; evaluations of their own SHMS; results of accident investigations except for portions deemed confidential for personnel or medical reasons; haza rd assessments and such other materials produced by the SHMS that may be helpful to employees in improving safety and health in their workplace. Union and employee participation in the field are to be undertaken consistent with the National Council of Fiel d Labor Locals (NCFLL) bargaining agreement. Each Region shall establish a joint labor management committee referred to as the Regional Safety and Health Committee (RSHC) to promote occupational safety and health benefits to all employees, including tem porary, contract, and visiting 2-6 employees. The requirements for formation and election of the RSHC and chairperson will be consistent with 29 CFR 1960.37. The size of the RSHC will be determined jointly by the local labor -management representatives. 1. The R SHC will consist of at least as many bargaining unit representatives as management representatives. The NCFLL will appoint the union representatives and the Regional Administrator will appoint the management representatives. 2. Each committee member will ser ve terms of one to three years. The terms should be staggered so that no more than half of the management or union members will be rotated off the committee's membership during the year. 3. A Regional Safety and Health Manager (RSHM), identified by the Regio nal Administrator, serves as facilitator and technical advisor and is a permanent support position in the committee. This position is in addition to the members of the RSHC. 4. The RSHC may designate ad hoc work groups as appropriate (with up to four members) to address specific safety and health issues and work assignments. III. Worksite Analysis Inspections Safety and health inspections will be conducted at each OSHA office quarterly at a minimum with at least one union and one management representative participating. Corrective actions will be documented on the Corrective Action List (Appendix A) communicated to all affected employees, and retained at the office where the inspection was conducted for at least two years. Consideration should be given to conducting limited scope monthly inspections (e. g. fire extinguisher, eyewash, or emergency lighting inspections). Hazard Analysis of Routine Tasks 2-7 1. Hazards and risks to employees' safety and health should be identified and assessed on an ongoing basis at b oth the office and field locations, such as at enforcement inspection and VPP onsite evaluation locations. Implementation of preventive and protective measures should: eliminate the hazard/risk; control the hazard/risk at the source through the use of engi neering controls or organizational measures; minimize the hazard/risk by the design of safe work systems or use of administrative control measures; or where residual hazards/risks cannot be controlled by collective measures, effected by the use of appropri ate personal protective equipment 2. Hazard Analyses are effective in uncovering hazards to employees and shall be done to the fullest extent possible for all tasks assigned to employees. Based on a general assessment of work sites, at a minimum, employees ar e required to utilize safety glasses, safety shoes, and hard hats on construction sites and safety glasses and safety shoes on all general industry, maritime and long shoring sites. All employees shall abide by the requirements of the employer under inspec tion, if more protective than the general assessment. 3. The SHMS program serves as the basic hazard analysis and control for routine tasks. 4. To evaluate potential health hazards, employees will abide by OSHA's Policies and Procedures in Chapter 27 entitled, P olicies and Procedures for Field Staff Exposure Monitoring. Hazard Analysis of Non Routine Tasks 1. When known special hazards are identified prior to the OSHA inspection and or evaluation, safe job instructions will be given by the unit manager in these cases. 2. When OSHA employees discover hazards that limit their ability to access an area for inspection and or evaluation, they will contact their unit manager immediately. 3. When OSHA employees encounters a hazard that is not addressed in the SHMS program they will notify their supervisor who will discuss with the local safety and health committee whether a JSA should be developed. 4. When it is determined by the safety and health committee that a JSA be developed Appendix C will be utilized. Any JSAs developed wi ll be forwarded to the Regional Safety and Health Committee for review and upon approval forwarded to DTSEM for posting. Employee Reporting of Hazards 2-8 1. The recognition and control of all types of hazards encountered in the performance of official duties is critical to the safety and health of employees. 2. Employees including temporary, contract and visiting employees have the right, and are encouraged, to report all working conditions perceived to be potential safety or health hazards to their supervisor (or designee) without fear of reprisal. 3. In order to capture such incidents as chemical overexposures, near misses, vehicle accidents, and office hazards, employees shall report workplace hazards and provide the information necessary to complete the Incident Investigation and Hazard Reporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet) as soon as possible to his or her supervisor (or designee). Once submitted, investigations of these incidents are initiated as soon as possible, but within three working days. 4. Reported hazar d(s) are documented on the Incident Investigation and Hazard Reporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet) and submitted to the RSHM and union official within 24 hours. Corrective action(s) dates shall be tracked on the Corrective Action List (Corrective Acti on List). The supervisor (or designee) shall ensure that employees and the union official are notified in writing within 15 work days of the corrective actions taken or are pending and the reason why. 5. Reports of unsafe conditions may also be submitted to any local management or the Department of Labor on line using DL 1 -1097 Form, Reporting Unsafe and Unhealthful Conditions located at https://shimshosting.dol.gov/login/ShimsLogin.aspx ). Rep orts may be submitted anonymously. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management (OASAM) Safety and Health Manager will investigate and respond appropriately to the hazard(s) identified, within required timeframes. IV. Incident Repor ting/Investigation Procedures Prompt and accurate reporting and investigation of work -related \"incidents,\" which include all work -related injuries, illnesses and near misses, or accidents that could have caused serious injuries, is a necessary component of effective accident prevention programs. This information can be used in evaluating and preventing hazards, fulfilling mandatory recordkeeping requirements and filing for workers' compensation benefits. Incidents resulting in personal injury and/or illne ss require that the appropriate Office of Worker's Compensation Programs (OWCP) and DOL procedures are followed and forms completed. The supervisor (or designee) will notify the Regional Administrator within one workday of all incidents involving recorda ble injuries and illnesses. Th e Incident 2-9 Investigation and Hazard Reporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet ) will be completed by the manager or designated coordinator. The supervisor (or designee) will notify the Regional Administrator within one workday of all incidents involving recordable injuries and illnesses. The Incident Investigation and Hazard Reporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet) will be completed by the m anager or designated coordinator. For Regions, the Worksheet is sent to the RSHM within five days of the incident correction due date. The Worksheet shall include the action plan to correct the incident. Copies are kept at the office for employees to review. Incidents involving property damage shall be reported as soon as possible to the manager (or designee). The manager (or designee) will complete the Incident Investigation and Hazard Reporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet) and will be involved in the investigation process. 1. In the Regions, all incidents involving property damage must be reported to the RSHM within one workday. An Incident Investigation and Hazard Reporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet) and supporting information shall be sent imm ediately to the RSHM. 2. In addition to the reporting requirements outlined in this directive and in the Department of Labor Management Series (DLMS) 4, Chapter 800, DOL Safety and Health Program, employees and supervisors must fully adhere to DOL accident r eporting requirements in DLMS 2, Chapter 1500, Motor Vehicle Management. These requirements are in addition to the Motor Vehicle Accident Report (SF 91) that must be completed and submitted to DTSEM in the National Office and the RSHM in the Regions. Each office must maintain their own recordkeeping forms in accordance with 29 CFR Part 1904 for injuries/illnesses occurring at their facilities or work areas. In addition, each office will follow DOL requirements in regards to the use of SHIMS. The RSHM will maintain the recordkeeping forms in accordance with 1904 for the Regional Office. Completed Incident Investigation and Hazard Reporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet) are sent to the RSHM within five days of the incident correction due date. Copies are kept at the office for employees to review. V. Hazard Prevention and Control Hazard prevention and control procedures must be reviewed and modified as necessary on a regular basis to follow the most current laws and regulations and to ensure that the fullest level of protection is provided . Supervisors (or designees) are responsible for ensuring that employees comply with all safety and health rules, policies, and programs and are required to take appropriate 2-10 action to prevent injury or illness to employees. S pecific actions to be taken will be in accordance with existing personnel practices and regulations. Employees including temporary, contract and visiting employees are required to wear required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as outlined below and in the PPE Program. 1. At the start of any inspection/audit or other field activity, the employees will assess the need for PPE, which will include the employer's PPE assessment. 2. Employees including temporary, contract and visiting employees will abide by OSHA's PPE Program (Chapter 8) or the program of the employer under inspection or other field activity, whichever requires greater protection. 3. If during the course of an inspection/audit or other field activity the employee encounters a hazardous condition requi ring the use of PPE not addressed by the employer's PPE hazard assessment, the employee will promptly address the hazardous condition with the employer. The employee will also don the appropriate PPE before proceeding, unless other appropriate action eliminates the hazard. 4. Supervisors will periodically evaluate the employee use of PPE to ensure that employees are adequately protected. VI. Safety and Health Training The following procedures apply to supervisors (or designees) in the Regions: The supervisor (or designee) will ensure that all employees are trained initially and given refresher training as appropriate on an annual basis thereafter. 1. Employee training will include all relevant Chapters of the SHMS and specific safety and health programs. 2. Speciali zed technical training will be provided for employees who may encounter unique hazards associated with a particular industry or hazard. 3. Supervisors and employees who are engaged in safety and health activities for the agency will be trained to conduct thos e duties. The supervisor (or designee) will ensure that new employees are provided training on this Instruction as part of a DOL new employee orientation process. Training will be accomplished within 30 days after a new or updated chapter is released. Emp loyees will be trained on the emergency action plan when first hired, and notified, and trained as necessary, whenever the plan has changed or whenever any person's responsibilities under the plan have changed. 2-11 Records of training will be maintained for th ree years at the Regional or Office level to ensure that all employees have been appropriately trained. Supervisors (or designees) will make available records of the training conducted to the Regional Administrator, and DTSEM when requested. Supervisors (o r designees) will ensure that appropriate training is provided to temporary, contract, and visiting employees to ensure their safety. VII. Specific Safety and Health Programs Safety and health programs for the specific topics identified in the subsequent chapte rs must be adopted and implemented. These may be supplemented or augmented to enhance employee safety and health. Safety and health on additional topics may also be adopted and implemented to address unique safety and health topics. All safety and health programs shall ensure the highest level of protection for employees, temporary employees, contractors, and the visiting public consistent with existing rules, standards and guidance. All changes to the SHMS or programs other than those that describe site specific roles and responsibilities must be submitted to the DTSEM for review and approval using the following procedures. DTSEM in conjunction with the joint Labor -Management Committee is to review and respond to the Region within 60 days of receipt of c hanges to policies and procedures. The SHMS and programs provide baseline guidance to OSHA in order to implement an effective SHMS to prevent employee injuries, illnesses and fatalities. Within established guidelines, Regional Administrators may suppleme nt or augment the SHMS and programs to address the unique needs within the National Office or their respective Regions and ensure the health and safety of their employees. Changes to the SHMS or programs to make them site specific, (e.g. identify areas of responsibility), may be made without National Office approval. Changes to the SHMS or programs that alter the SHMS or program policies require National Office approval. 2-12 APPENDIX A : CORRECTIVE ACTIONS L IST Item Number Hazard Corrective Method /Interim Controls Target Date Name of Responsible Party Date of Correction Name: Date: 2-13 APPENDIX B: HAZARD REPORTING AND INCIDENT INVESTIGAT WORKSHEET Hazard Reporting and Incident Investigation Worksheet Area Office: Incident Number: Reporting Date (date the form was completed): Event Type: Event Summary: Injury Illness Near -Miss Property Damage Report of Hazard Occurrence Date: Affected Employee: Investigation Start Date: Hazard Type: Struck -by Electrical Repetitive Motion Caught i n Chemical Noise Fall (from height) Fire Slip/Trip Other (identify) Hazard Location: Field Office Off-site/Travel Severit y (if injury or illness) : Fatality Serious (medical aid w/temporary disability - return to work) Major (lost work day(s) or restricted work required) Minor (first -aid only) Injury Type: Laceration Burns Strain/Sprain Fracture Contusion Amputation Other (identify) Body Part Affected: Hand/Wrist Head Hip Arm Internal Eye(s) Shoulder Foot/Ankle Back Neck Leg Other (identify) 2-14 Investigation Complete Date: Investigation was Completed by Whom?

EMERGENCY CONTINGENC Y PLAN I. Purpose The purpose of this plan is to ensure each employee of OSHA is provided a safe working environment. The emergency contingency plan has been developed to provide an organized plan of action to prepare and respond to major natural and human -caused emergencies that threaten OSHA offices. OSHA employees responding to emergencies outside the local office will f ollow the procedures and plans specified in the Regional Emergency Management Plan (REMP) . II. Scope The program applies to all OSHA employees and addresses emergencies affecting the continued operation of the OSHA office. This Chapter includes the f ollowin g emergency action plans. Shelter in Place Plan (SIPP). The SIPP protects occupants in the event of a hazardous materials release in the community or for other scenarios when it would be safer to remain in the building. Local Contingency Plans for the Admi nistrative Closing of Offices During Emergency Situations. This emergency action plan authorizes the administrative closing of OSHA offices for brief periods of time because of emergency conditions. Occupant Emergency Plan (OEP). T he OEP contains procedure s to keep OSHA employees and visitors safe at the office. The plan covers medical emergencies, fire, bomb threats and the handling of suspicious packages. III. Definitions Emergency. Any incident, human -caused or natural , that requires responsive action to protect life and property . Event . A planned, non -emergency activity. Natural Emergencies. Major fires, hurricanes, earthquake, tornadoes, snow and severe weather . Human -Caused Emergencies. Hazardous chemical releases, civil disorders, riots, bombs, and hostage situations . IV. Responsibilities The responsible OSHA Manager(s) will ensure: 7-43 1. Development and implementation of office specific emergency programs ; 2. Employees are trained on emergency proc edures; 3. Exercises are conducted to evaluate the effectivenes s of the emergency action plans; and 4. Maintenance of training records and documentation rel ated to incidents and exercises. Employees are responsible for: 1. Attending emergency training; 2. Reporting po tential emergency situations to their responsible OSHA Manager(s) ; and 3. Following emergency action plans as directed. V. Procedures Each office will develop emergency plans applicable to their needs using the following templates contained in the Appendices at the end of this chapter . The templates are intended to serve as guides and may work well in some office settings, but not in all. Emergencies will be assessed by the responsible OSHA Manager(s) and/or emergency personnel for size and the potential to caus e injury or illness to OSHA employees . The appropriate emergency plan will be implemented based upon the nature and seriousness of the emergency. Exercises will be conducted annually to evaluate the effectiveness of the plans. Any time an emergency plan is implemented, whether it is for an actual emergency or an exercise, the response will be documented. The documentation will include the date, description of the scenario, actions taken or parts of the plan implemented, participants, and critique. The cri tique will identify what went well and what areas need improvement. Plans will be modified as necessary to correct deficiencies. VI. Training Records of all post -incident evaluations (actual emergencies or exercises) will be retained by the responsible OSHA M anager(s). 7-44 Written records will include the source of the training, the OSHA representatives trained, a description of training provided, and the dates when training occurred. All training records will be maintained by the responsible OSHA Manager(s) . 7-45 APPENDIX A Shelter In Place Plan (SIPP) Initiation of Shelter -in-Place Procedures This Shelter -in-Place Plan is established for the Department of Labor - OSHA facility located at __________________ primarily to minimize danger arising from a hazardous mate rials release within or in the immediate area outside of the building. This plan addresses all such types of emergencies whether they are the result of an accidental release or a national security incident. This plan has been developed by the Department of Labor - OSHA. The ___________________ Shelter -in-Place emergency procedures will be initiated based upon information from local police and fire department officials indicating it is safer for occupants to remain in the building than to evacuate to the outside. Although this Shelter -in-Place Plan is aimed primarily at protecting occupants in the event of a hazardous materials release, the procedures may also be invoked under other scenarios when it would be safer to remain in the building, such as gunf ire in the immediate vicinity of the building or an imminent tornado. Shelter -in-place may not be appropriate for all incidents. Every shelter -in-place situation must be assessed on a case -by-case basis to determine the applicable course of action. Shelt er-in-Place Announcements In the event that it is necessary to initiate shelter -in-place procedures, the responsible OSHA Manager(s) will notify all OSHA employees. Management will contact OSHA staff members working remotely, advising them not to return t o the Office until further notice. All OSHA employees, contractors, and visitors should follow instructions from designated managers, and be alert to periodic updates broadcast via the public address system. During the shelter -in-place emergency, managemen t staff will be working to enhance building safety. This will include implementing emergency ventilation shutdown procedures and, where appropriate, securing all doors. During the duration of the emergency monitoring for carbon dioxide shall be conducted to insure air quality in the facility. 7-46 Relocating to Designated Shelter Areas Within the Building All OSHA employees, contractors, and visitors should: Relocate to designated shelter areas in the building . Visitors should accompany the employee they are visiting to the employee's designated shelter area. Close doors to vacated offices (do not lock them) . Account for all office staff expected in the shelter area (e.g. responsible OSHA Manager(s) may use sign -in sheets to assess who is at work and their location) . Listen carefully for instructions from authorized personnel, such as responsible OSHA Manager(s) Remain in the shelter area until an \"all clear\" message has been announced or an evacuation is ordered. Critical Information for Employees The pri mary focus of this Shelter -in-Place Plan is to minimize damage from a hazardous materials release outside the building. Typically, shelter -in-place conditions will last from a few minutes to a few hours. It is not anticipated that employees would remain in the building overnight. Shelter -in-place cannot be mandated by your agency. However, building management or local emergency response personnel can require shelter -in-place to be put into effect. For everyone's safety, employees must proceed directly to a designated shelter area. Opening an outside door could put you in contact with a harmful contaminant, or allow dangerous air to enter the building and put others at risk. Information available to you about conditions outside the building and the thr eats posed by those conditions may be limited and incomplete. Should you leave the building , you very likely will not be allowed re -entry. You may also find that the location you travel to may not allow you access to that facility, since they may be she ltering -in-place. If you have children in a nearby childcare facility, ask them to describe their shelter -in-place procedures and whether it will be possible to contact them while they are in a sheltering mode . You should also be aware that conditions are likely to get uncomfortable, as the maintenance staff will immediately shut down the ventilation system to reduce the chance of contamination entering the building. The close quarters, heat, and stuffiness will add to your discomfort. Please remain calm and assist those around you to cope with the situation. 7-47 Responsibilities of Emergency Response Team Members Members of management will assist in the quick and orderly movement of building occupants into designated shelter areas, using prescribed evacuat ion routes or immediately establishing a new evacuation route if a prescribed route is endangered or inaccessible. They will ensure that other rooms on the floor are clear of any personnel, and will keep security staff apprised of the status on each floor . Issuance of \"All Clear\" Message When it is safe to resume normal operations, an \"all clear\" message will be transmitted ____________________________ . Designated Shelter Areas All OSHA employees should become familiar with the location of the designated shelter areas for their offices. Typically, a shelter area will be on the same floor in the vicinity of the employees' workstations, and will be away from all exterior windows. Designated shelte r areas are _________________________________ . Essential Supplies _________________________ will provide all OSHA employees , contractors, and visitors with basic essential supplies during a shelter -in-place incident. The responsible OSHA Manager(s) will be responsible for distribution of supplies in the shelter area, if appropriate. Generally, water and nutritional supplements will not be distributed unless it appears the incident will last an hour or longer. The provisions in the shelter area will inclu de: Water; Nutritional supplement; Flashlights and/or chemical light sticks; First aid supplies; and Self-powered radio. 7-48 Medical and Personal Preparedness OSHA employees should evaluate their personal medical and dietary needs and plan accordingly. Thi s includes a sking your doctor about appropriate storage for prescription medications, such as heart and high blood pressure medication, insulin, or other prescription drugs. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security advises that you also consider any other special needs, such as wearing prescribed alert tags and bracelets to help identify any disability or medical condition, as well as other comfort items.

Winter Driving During winter months, particular attention to driving conditions will be considered when employees are required to travel. 1. Travel will be under the discretion of the responsible OSHA Manager(s), and the driver. 2. If an employee encounters driving conditions that may be hazardous, they will contact the office and advise the supervisor of the hazardous condition. If contact cannot be made with the office, the employee will make every effort not to put him or herself in a hazardous situation. Each office will develop a winter driving kit to fit the needs of that particular office. 1. Prior to each winter driving season, kits will be inspected and employees trained on the equipment in the kit. 2. Winter driving kits may i nclude: space blanket, candles, matches, and spike mats. VI. Driving in Remote Areas Procedures will be developed for employees required to travel to remote areas (e.g. mountain roads, logging inspections, oil and gas operations, and desolate highways. If possible, direct communication utilizing radios or cell phone will be used. If dire ct communication is not possible, a check -in/check -out system will be used. 9-13 APPENDIX Inspection Log Date First Aid Kit Fire Extinguisher Ice Scraper Headlights Turn Signal Lights Brake lights operational Horn Flashlight General Condition (Damage) 9-14 APPENDIX B VEHICLE Inspection Log ITEMS TO BE CHECKED STATUS DATE ITEM(S) WERE REPLACED /SERVICED Oil (Check Level) Windshield Wipers and Washer Fluid Radiator Coolant Level Tires (Pressure, Excessive Wear) ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________ 10-15 CHAPTER 10.

WALKING WORKING SURF ACES I. Purpose This program is intended to protect employees from potential health and safety hazards encountered with walking/working surfaces in the office and in the field. II. Scope All OSHA employees will comply with the requirements of this chapter. Only trained and authorized emp loyees will be allowed to access ladders and scaffolds. Employees will exercise professional judgment and limit their exposures to the absolute minimum. However, unless they have specialized training and qualifications, prior to OSHA employees accessing a scaffold system they must contact area office management for concurrence. III. Definitions See 20 CFR 1910.21 . IV. Responsibilities Responsible OSHA Manager(s) are responsib le for: 1. Training for all office, administrative, and field employees on the procedures outlined in this Chapter. 2. Providing proper tools and equipment to ensure that the procedures are followed. 3. Ensuring reported unsafe conditions are corrected. Employ ees are responsible for: 1. Reporting all safety problems immediately to their supervisor. 2. Maintaining a neat and sanitary office environment. 3. Following all office safety and health policies. V. Procedures Keep all worker areas, aisles, and passageways, including stairs, doorways, electrical panels and exits, free and clear of obstructions, and maintain them in a clean, orderly, and sanitary fashion. 11-22 Maintain floors and stairs in a clean and dry condition (so far as possible ). If a spill occurs, clean it up immediately or warn others and report it so that it can be cleaned up. All trip hazards must be eliminated. Common hazards include damaged carpeting, cords in walking areas, and projecting floor electrical outlet boxes. Step stools, if equipped with wheels, should have an automatically locking base or wheel locks. Inspect to ensure all parts are secure and safety features, such as wheel locks and anti -slip treads, are intact and properly functioning. Ladders . 11-23 1. Ladders will be selected for the work in tended. 2. Make sure the ladder is the proper height for the job. Extension ladders will be at least 3 feet taller than the point of support and stepladders will be selected so that the worker is never required to use the top two steps. 3. Inspect ladders befo re use. Defective ladders will not be used. Some signs of defects include: broken rungs, split side rails, worn or broken safety feet, broken hinges an d spreaders, loose nuts, bolt s and/or rivets. If defective, remove ladder from service and place a war ning tag reading on it \"DO NOT USE.\" 4. When using a straight ladder, place feet on a firm surface and secure it at the top so that it cannot slide sideways. 5. Always face the ladder when climbing or descending. Use both hands - never carry anything in your hands. You have climbed too high if your knees are above the top of the ladder or if you cannot maintain a handhold on the ladder. 6. There should only be one person on a ladder at any time unless designed for multiple users. 7. Do not use metal ladders if the re is the possibility of contact with electrical conductors. 8. Never use a stepladder as a straight ladder. 9. Do not use stepladders as a brace or support for a work platform or plank. 10. Never lean from the side of a ladder. If necessary, the task will be ev aluated for potential fall hazards. Other alternative solutions will be used to allow a safe approach to the task. Stairs, ramps and walkways will be clear and in good condition. Always us e the handrail provided when ascending or descending stairs. Employees will be cautioned to watch for holes, concrete dividers, curbs, discarded items, paper and other tripping hazards. During cold weather, employees will be cautioned about icy conditions on walkways and parking lots. Floor holes and openings will be protected by a cover or standard railing. Should the cover or railing need to be removed, the floor opening or hole will be constantly attended by an attendant assigned to warn others of the hazard. 11-24 Open -sided floors or platforms that are four or mo re feet above ground level will be provided with proper standard railing. When there is equipment that could fall from these elevations, the installation of a standard toe board is required. Scaffolds. There are several different types of scaffolds. Access to elevated locations or work at heights requires guardrails, fall protection, or a personal fall arrest systems device. Employees will be cautioned that if the work cannot be performed from the ground or by other available means, the following gen eral requirements for scaffolding will be met: 1. Scaffolds will be used only when work cannot be performed from the ground or from solid construction. 2. Footing or anchorage for scaffolds will be sound, rigid, and capable of carrying the intended load withou t settling or displacement. Unstable objects, including barrels, boxes, loose bricks or concrete blocks, will not be used to support scaffolds or planks. The use of base plates and mudsills is acceptable. 3. Access to the scaffold must be provided by a lad der, ramp, or other safe means. Never use the side frames to access the scaffold. 4. Scaffolds must be fully planked. The planks will not extend less than six inches and not more than 18 inches from the end. 5. Scaffolds will not be used during storms, high wind, or when covered by ice or snow. 6. Scaffolds over 10 feet from ground level must have standard guardrails, toeboards, and will be properly cross -braced. 7. Mobile ladder stands and scaffolds will have positive wheel and/or swivel lock casters to prevent movement. 12-25 CHAPTER 12. HAZARD COMMUNICATION I. Purpose It is OSHA's policy to comply with the requirements of OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HCS), 29 CFR 1910.1200. II. Scope This program applies to all work operations where there is exposure to hazardous chemical s that are known to be present in the workplace in such a manner that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency. The mere presence of a hazardous chemical in the workplace does not trigger coverage under the HCS . There must be actual or potential exposure to an employee. Consumer products are not covered by this program to the extent that the use of the products results in a duration and frequency of exposure that is not greater tha n that which could be reasona bly be experienced by consumers. III. Responsibilities Area Offices - responsible OSHA Manager(s) is the coordinator of the Hazard Communication Program (HCP) in his or her office, acting as the representative of the Regional Administrator. 1. He or she may delegate the day -to-day responsibility for the HCP to one of the Assistant Area Directors or a senior industrial hygienist. 2. Ultimate responsibility for the development and implementation of the program in each Area Office remains with the responsible OSHA Manager(s). Regional Offices - the Regional Hazard Communication Coordinator (RHCC), acting as the representative of the Regional Administrator, will have responsibility for the development and implementation of the program in the Regional Office, as we ll as act as overall coordinator for the program. For purposes of this program, the responsible OSHA Manager(s) and RHCC have the same responsibilities. IV. Procedure List of Hazardous Chemicals 12-26 1. A list will be maintained of all hazardous chemicals used in t he office and updated as necessary. This list will be developed by each office and become a part of this program as an attachment. 2. The list will identify the corresponding Safety Data Sheet ( SDS) for each chemical. Safety Data Sheet 1. A copy of a n SDS for every substance on the list of hazardous chemicals in the Regional/Area office will be maintained. 2. SDSs for all hazardous chemicals used in the Regional/Area Office will be readily accessible to employees at all times. 3. Requisitions for hazardous chemi cals are to include a request for the SDS. All SDSs will be reviewed for content and completeness. Additional research will be done if necessary. 4. SDSs of new material to be purchased must be reviewed and the chemical approved for use by the responsible OS HA Manager(s) /RHCC or his or her designee. Whenever possible, the least hazardous substance will be obtained. Warning Labels 1. All containers of hazardous chemicals in the office will be properly labeled. 2. All labels will include the identity of the haz ardous chemical and the appropriate hazard warning, including the target organ effects. 3. Each label will be checked with the corresponding SDS to verify the information. 4. Alternate labeling provisions, such as tags or markings, may be made for containers that are of unusual shape or size and do not easily accommodate a legible label. 5. Chemicals that are transferred from a properly labeled container to a portable container, and that are intended only for the immediate use of the person who performs the tr ansfer are not required to be labeled. Immediate use is defined in 29 CFR 1910.1200. Training 12-27 1. Each employee who is potentially exposed to hazardous chemicals will receive training as outlined in this Chapter. 2. New employees will receive training on the contents of this program and specific training on the chemicals that the individuals will be directly working with during orientation and prior to performing work where exposure may occur. 3. Additional training wil l be provided for employees whenever a new chemical is introduced into their work area. 4. As warranted, training may be provided based on the uniqueness of the hazards to be encountered at an inspection worksite. 5. The training program will emphasize the f ollowing elements: a. A summary of the HCS and the written program; b. Hazardous chemical properties, including visual appearance and odor, and methods that can be used to detect the presence or release of hazardous chemicals; c. Physical and health hazards associ ated with potential exposure to hazardous chemicals; d. Procedures to protect against hazards, such as personal protective equipment, work practices, and emergency procedures; e. Hazardous chemical spill and leak procedures; and f. Location of SDSs, how to unders tand their content, and how employees may obtain and use appropriate hazard information. Hazardous Chemicals Encountered on Work Sites Recognizing that the greatest potential for exposure to hazardous chemicals involves field exposures during the course of on -site activities, the following issues will be considered: 1. Field employees will identify potential hazards using the employer's list of hazardous chemicals and associated SDSs and labeling system. a. Ensure that appropriate protective measures, including personal protective equipment, are available and utilized. b. Where protective measures are not adequate, OSHA employees must avoid exposure and contact their responsible OSHA Manager(s) /RHCC. 13-28 2. Samples collected during any on -site activity that may prese nt a potential hazard to OSHA employees will be handled in accordance with procedures outlined by OSHA's Salt Lake City Technical Center. Contract Employees 1. Outside contractors will be advised of any chemical hazards that may be encountered in the normal course of their work in OSHA offices. 2. Outside contractors will be notified of the location and availability of SDSs. 3. Each contractor bringing chemicals on -site must provide OSHA with the appropriate hazard information, including SDSs. All containers of hazardous chemicals brought on -site by an outside contractor must be appropriately labeled. Non-Routine Tasks If a non -routine task is planned in an OSHA office, affected employees must be informed of any chemical hazards associated with the performanc e of the task(s) and appropriate protective measures before such work is initiated. CHAPTER 13. CONTROL OF HAZARDOUS ENERGY SOURCES I. Purpose This chapter establishes the OSHA Field Safety and Health Management System (SHMS) National Lockout/Tagout (LO/TO) Program. The policies and procedures in this Program are intended to set broad expectations for preventing OSHA employee injury or death from uncontrolled hazardous energy sources when there are no alternatives to conducting work activities where energy isolation i s required. OSHA expects Regions, DTSEM and DTE to develop specific procedures that align with this program as needed. This Program is designed to protect OSHA employees from the inadvertent or unintended release of energy, movement, or flow in electrica l potential, mechanical, or material systems, which could result in an injury or fatality to outside personnel as defined in 29 CFR 1910.147(f)(2). Locally developed OSHA procedures that align with this LO/TO Program will ensure that all potentially hazar dous energy from machines or equipment is isolated using lockout devices before OSHA employees perform any activities (e.g., inspections) where unexpected energizing, start up, or release of stored energy could cause an injury or a fatality. 13-29 All OSHA empl oyees are considered affected employees because their jobs required them to likely work in an area in which machine or equipment servicing and maintenance is being performed. For the rare occasion when lockout devices are determined necessary, management w ill determine if and when a limited number of OSHA employees are considered authorized employees. If Directorate Directors, Regional Administrators (RA), and Area Directors (AD) decide employees under their supervision will never be considered authorized employees, only the annual training requirements for affected employees in this program apply to that Region/Directorate. This Program assumes that OSHA is the outside employer and authorized OSHA employees may conduct work activities as outside personne l. Normally, OSHA employees are not expected to put themselves in a position that would require isolating hazardous energy sources. However, work activities that require taking measurements or visually inspecting equipment at an on -site employer's worksit e is considered maintenance or servicing. LO/TO program requirements apply if there is a potential for the unexpected energizing, start up or release of stored energy that could cause injury. Only authorized employees will use this Program to lock out haza rdous energy. This will include providing information to the on -site employer about OSHA's LO/TO procedures as required in 29 CFR 1910.147 (f)(2)(i) (see section V.C.1) . This Program relies on an effective on -site employer LO/TO Program and OSHA employee's ability to assess its effectiveness during the required information sharing about LO/TO procedures. OSHA employees will not conduct work activities that require contr olling hazardous energy as outside personnel if there is not an effective on -site employer LO/TO Program. II. Scope This LO/TO Program is intended to apply specifically to OSHA employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual \u2014specifically OSHA empl oyees conducting work activities at another employer's facility (e. g. inspecting or otherwise visiting another employer's facility), hereinafter referred to as the on-site employer as established in 29 CFR 1910.147 (f)(2)(i). The procedures in this program do not provide OSHA -owned equipment -specific LO/TO procedures required by 29 CFR 1910.147 for equipment at OSHA facilities . Regions/Directorates that require employees to isolate hazardous energy at OSHA facilities will develop specific LO/TO procedures for applicable OSHA -owned equipment that is consistent with, and at least as protective as, 29 CFR 1910.147. The RA/Directorate Director will provide information about LO/TO procedures to personnel servicing OSHA equipment as the on-site employer and will ensure that they are informed about the servicing personnel's LO/TO procedure s. This Program also does not apply to hazardous energy in OSHA offices covered in Chapter 6, Office Safety and Health. When there is a potential for exposure to energized parts, Chapter 22, Electrical Safety provides necessary procedures for electrical h azard recognition and avoidance . 13-30 III. References 29 Code of Federal Regulations Section 1910.147, The Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout) 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910, Subpart S, Electrical 29 CFR 1926, Subpart V, Electrical Power Transmission and Distribution CPL 02 -00-147, The Control of Hazardous Energy, Enforcement Policy and Inspection Procedures, dated February 11, 2008 OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual, Chapter 6, Office Safety and Health OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual, Chapter 22 , Electrical Safety IV. Definitions Affected OSHA Employee is an OSHA employee that may conduct activities in an area in which LO/TO procedures are being used. All OSHA employees are potentially affected employees since they may encounter LO/TO devices at an OSHA facility or at another employer's worksite. Authorized OSHA Employee is an OSHA employee authorized by an RA, Directorate Director, Area Office Director or a designee to use a lockout device. Authorized OSHA Employees will use a lock only in a group lockout that includes the on -site employer's primary authorized employee in order to perform inspection activity on a machine or piece of equipment. Energy Isolation Device is a mechanical device that physically prevents the transmission or release of e nergy, including but not limited to manually operated circuit breakers, disconnect switches, line valves, a block and any similar devices. Push buttons, selector switches and other control circuits are not acceptable as energy isolating devices. Lockout D evice is a device that utilizes a positive means, such as a key or combination lock, to hold an energy isolating device in a safe position and prevent the energizing of a machine or equipment (e.g. blank flanges and bolted slip blinds). Each lockout devic e will be supplied with a tag that meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.147, is intended for use in group lockout, and includes a tag that identifies the lock user and the application date. Tagout Device is a prominent warning device, such as a tag, and a means of attachment, that can be securely fastened to an energy isolating device in accordance with an established procedure to indicate that the energy isolating device and the equipment being controlled may not be operated until the tagout device is rem oved. 13-31 For this Program, only lockout devices are authorized to control hazardous energy and tags are used only to label locks. V. Responsibilities RAs/Directorate Directors and Area Office Directors/equivalents or designees will: 1. Decide if employees are aut horized to conduct work activities that require LO/TO procedures on rare occasions when no alternatives are available. 2. Provide training to affected and authorized OSHA employees as described in this LO/TO Program. 3. Request assistance from SLTC's Health Response Team (HRT) when investigations and inspections require hazardous energy isolation and the Region or Directorate does not have the resources to safely implement LO/TO procedures. 4. Develop local procedures that meet requirements in 29 CFR 1910.147 fo r OSHA -owned machines and equipment in which the unexpected energization or startup of the machines or equipment, or release of stored energy could harm OSHA employees or outside servicing personnel. Determine if authorized OSHA employees are expected to isolate hazardous energy sources at their respective OSHA facilities. Develop and provide site specific information about LO/TO procedures to outside personnel servicing OSHA equipment and share information about the servicing personnel's LO/TO procedures before work begins (29 CFR 1910.147(f)(2)). If RAs, Directorate Directors, Area Office Directors or designees determine that authorized OSHA employees are authorized to use lockout devices as outside personnel, they must: 1. Develop local procedures for LO /TO program implementation to supplement this Program. 2. Select employees who are authorized to implement LO/TO procedures in this Program and that have the knowledge and skills required for the safe application, use, and removal of hazardous energy control devices. Ensure that selected authorized OSHA employees understand the purpose of the LO/TO program and, at a minimum: a. Can recognize hazardous energy sources; b. Will represent this chapter and local procedures as OSHA's LO/TO Program to the on -site employ er as the outside personnel, as required by 29 CFR 1910.147(f)(2)(i); 13-32 c. Can verify the on -site employers LO/TO program and procedures are effective (e.g. interviews and contacting equipment manufacturers); d. Know the importance of considering alternative metho ds and how to identify them for measuring or visually inspecting equipment; e. Know and follow the specific LO/TO procedures described in this Program; and f. Voluntarily accept assigned tasks and is willing to perform authorized OSHA employees responsibilities. Should safety concerns arise when locking out equipment or machines, the OSHA employee may choose to end the task, and will discuss safety concerns with the on -site employer and OSHA management from a safe location. 3. Issue each Authorized OSHA Employee a lockout device with a key. The lockout device type should be standardized within each Office and in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.147(c)(5) for use in group lockout with at least an on -site employer authorized employee. 4. Determine if authorized OSHA employee s will maintain their lockout devices or if all lockout devices will be maintained in a central location until they are needed for approved LO/TO procedures. Include specifics in the local LO/TO procedures. 5. Maintain a spare key for all issued lockout dev ices in a secured area. This key will be only used with the Area Office Director/designee's approval. The spare key may be provided to the authorized OSHA employee if they misplace their key or may be used to remove the lock from an energy isolated devic e in accordance with the procedures in this Program. 6. When approving an employee's request to use LO/TO procedures, consider the following: a. Are alternative methods a better option to obtain necessary information? b. Is the information critical to the inspection? c. Is the on-site employer LO/TO program effective? 13-33 7. Conduct post -use evaluations with the authorized OSHA employee who used LO/TO procedures following each approved lock application. OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.147(c)(6) requires periodic inspect ions of the LO/TO procedure(s) at least annually. Post -use evaluations, conducted following each application, are intended to meet the periodic inspection intent (see Appendix A, Control of Hazardous Energy Sources Pre -Request for Approval Checklist and P ost-Application Evaluation). OSHA employees are responsible for following this Program and Region or Directorate specific procedures. OSHA employees designated as authorized by their direct supervisors with approval from the applicable RA, Directorate Director or Area Office Director or designee to lock out hazardous energy will: 1. Obtain information about the on -site employer's LO/TO program and provide the on -site employer with the following OSHA LO/TO Program description orally or in writing to meet requirements in 29 CFR 1910.147(f )(2)(i) when considering implementing LO/TO procedures at their workplace. a. All OSHA employees are considered affected employees. b. A limited number of OSHA employees are authorized employees and allowed, only under specific scenarios, to use a lockout devi ce as outside personnel conducting equipment inspection activities in coordination with an on -site employer. c. Authorized OSHA employees will verify that the on -site employer LO/TO program is effective before proceeding with local OSHA management approval p rocesses. d. Authorized OSHA employees will never have the only lockout device on a controlled hazardous energy source and will only participate in a group lockout that includes at least one on -site authorized employee. e. At any time, the on -site employer, OS HA employee or their management may cancel any activity if it is determined unsafe. 13-34 2. Perform LO/TO procedures in accordance with this Program (e.g. request approval, verify host employer program, and notify supervisor when complete). 3. Participat e in post -evaluatio ns conducted by OSHA RA, Directorate Director and/or Area Office Director, or designees each time LO/TO procedures are implemented. VI. Safe Alternatives The following lists some options for alternative methods to obtain information without requiring haz ardous energy isolation: Camera positioned from a safe location (e.g. a camera connected to a n engineering rod, camera equipped with zoom lens or video equipment) ; Electronic measurement devices used from a safe distance/location (e.g. laser measurement d evice) ; Employer provided diagrams, drawings, hazard assessments and/or inventories of energy sources ; Interviews with authorized personnel, maintenance personnel and machine or equipment operators ; and Seek assistance from employer -authorized personnel in obtaining measurements and evidence . VII. Procedures All OSHA employees, when working near equipment that is locked or tagged out , but not inspecting equipment that requires hazardous energy controls: 1. Do not alter the locks or tags that are in place ; and 2. Do not conduct activities that could lead to an exposure to the hazardous energy if released . In the rare occasion when an authorized employee needs to use a LO/TO device, the authorized OSHA employee will first consider all other alternatives and ensure that locking out the machine or equipment is absolutely necessary. As outside personnel, the authorized OSHA employee will share information with the on -site employer about equipment -specific LO/TO procedures. The authorized OSHA employee must verify that the on-site employer's procedures are effective in identifying and isolating all applicable hazardous energy sources, and must obtain approval from management before applying locks to a group lockout in accordance with this OSHA Program. 13-35 When inspecting a ma chine or equipment that uses an electrical cord for power and the OSHA employee is required to place any part of his or her body into the point of operation or danger zone, the OSHA employee should ask the on -site employer representative to unplug it. The OSHA employee must maintain exclusive control of the cord and plug during inspection activities (e.g. lock a plug cap). When an OSHA employee makes an initial determination that an inspection activity (e.g. taking measurements, conducting a visual inspect ion) may require controlling hazardous energy sources, either before or during an inspection, the employee must follow these procedures: 1. Consider alternative methods for obtaining the information . 2. If no alternatives are identified: a. Thoroughly review the o n-site employer's LO/TO program, including any machine -specific procedures, and determine the program's effectiveness. The OSHA employee must interview the on -site employer's authorized employee(s) to verify that the on -site employee(s) are thoroughly fam iliar with the equipment, its hazardous energy sources, and any procedures in place for isolating and controlling hazardous energy. b. Obtain and review any manufacturer's information on LO/TO procedures for the equipment or machine. 3. Notify their OSHA manage ment that they are requesting to lock out hazardous energy to conduct inspection activities . 4. OSHA management and the OSHA employee requesting the approval will discuss and consider all alternatives . If no alternatives are identified the applicable OSHA m anagement representative will decide whether to approve using LO/TO procedures and also whether: 1. The requesting employee will continue with the inspection activities as an authorized OSHA employee ; or 2. Another authorized OSHA employee will proceed with the inspection activities. Prior to using LO/TO device(s) to control hazardous energy approved by management, the authorized OSHA employee will: 13-36 1. Inform the on -site employer about OSHA's LO/TO Program including the procedure for the host employer to follow if a lock is left in place after the OSHA employee leaves the facility. 2. Comply with OSHA requirements under 29 CFR 1910.147 and follow the on-site employer's effective LO/TO procedures. 3. Verify that the on -site employer's authorized employee(s) fully de -energized the equipment/machine and utilized an appropriate and effective energy isolating device(s) for the equipment/machine. 4. Place his or her lock(s) on each isolating device for the equipment as part of a group lockout. OSHA employees will only enter in to group lockout that includes a lock placed by the on -site employer's authorized employee. 5. Ensure that the on -site employer's authorized employee verifies that the hazardous energy source is controlled after ensuring that personnel are not potentially exposed to the hazardous energy if released. 6. Not attempt to activate/operate the on -site employer's equipment. 7. Authorized OSHA employees applying LO/TO procedures will: a. Limit the time for conducting work activities that require hazardous energy LO/TO to the absolute minimum needed to complete tasks. b. Remove only their energy -isolating device. c. Notify their responsible OSHA Manager(s) that the LO/TO procedure is complete when lockout devices are removed. 8. If the lockout device is unintentionally left on t he equipment after leaving the worksite, the on -site employer will contact the appropriate OSHA Office before removing the device. OSHA management will contact the OSHA employee to verify their location and the OSHA employee will return to the site to rem ove the lock. Where the OSHA employee cannot return to the site, the OSHA employee's responsible OSHA Manager(s) may authorize removing the lockout device(s) only after the OSHA employee's location is verified and the OSHA employee agrees with removing th e lockout device. VIII. Training Required training is based on expected work activities as described below: 13-37 All OSHA employees, including affected and authorized employees, will receive training annually about this LO/TO Program and the Directorate/Area Office procedures, purpose, function, and use. Authorized OSHA employees must receive specific training in addition to LO/TO Program training annually or when conditions change that includes: 1. How to identify hazardous energy sources they might encounter during inspections at another employer's worksite ; 2. Energy types and magnitudes they may encounter at another employer's workplace ; 3. The importance of considering alternative methods for obtaining the required inspection information ; 4. Methods and means necessary fo r energy isolation and control ; 5. The local procedures for requesting approval for using LO/TO procedures ; and 6. How to verify specific on -site employer LO/TO procedures when the use of a lockout device is required Retraining will be conducted whenever a post -evaluation reveals, or the responsible OSHA Manager(s) has reason to believe, that LO/TO procedures are not being used properly or that the appropriate skills need refreshed . IX. Recordkeeping The applicable OSHA RA/Directorate Director or Area Office Director/equivalent or designee will: 1. Maintain training records. 2. Maintain documentation for lockout device issuance. A suggested format for pre -application checklist and post -application evaluation is enclosed in Chapter 13, Appendix A. 13-38 APPENDIX A: CONTROL OF HAZARDOUS ENERGY SOURCES PRE -REQUEST FOR APPROVAL CHECKLI ST AND POST -APPLICATION EVALUATIO N Pre-request Checkl ist for authorized OSHA employees to consider before requesting approval to implement lockout/tagout (LO/TO) procedures: Have you explored all alternative methods for obtaining the information without needing to lock out hazardous energy?

PERMIT REQUIRED CONF INED SPACES I. Purpose The objective of the Permit -Required Confined Space chapter is to protect employees from confined space hazards during the performance of inspection activity. II. Scope This program applies to all OSHA employees who conduct inspections that include determining an employer's compliance with confined space standards. OSHA prohibits employees from entering into permit spaces without the written approval of the Area Director/Unit Manager. Normally, OSHA employees will not be working in such a position so as to necessitate entering permit -required confined spaces and will only do so rarely . If such entries are not absolutely required or OSHA employees are not absolutely certain regarding the safe entry into the sp ace, then those entries are not to be conducted under any circumstance. III. Definitions Authorized entrant. An OSHA employee who has received written authorization to enter a permit confined space from their responsible OSHA Manager(s) . Attendant . An indivi dual stationed outside one or more permit spaces that monitors the authorized entrants and who performs all attendants' duties as described in 29 CFR 1910.146. Confined Space . A space that: 1. Is large enough and so configured that an employee can bodily en ter and perform assigned work; and 2. Has limited or restricted means for entry or exit ( e.g. tanks, vessels, silos, storage bins, hoppers, vaults, and pits are spaces that may have li mited means of entry); and 3. Is not designed for continuous employee occupanc y. Permit -Required Confined Space (permit space) . A confined space that has one or more of the following characteristics: 14-41 1. Contains or has a potential to contain a hazardous atmosphere (as defined in 29 CFR 1910.146(b)); or 2. Contains a material that has the potential for engulfing an entrant; or 3. Has an internal configuration such that an entrant could be trapped or asphyxiated by inwardly converging walls or by a floor which slopes downward and tapers to a smaller cross -section; or 4. Contains any other recogni zed serious safety or health hazard. IV. Responsibilities Responsible OSHA Manager(s) is responsible for: 1. Ensuring that employees understand the requirements of OSHA's Permit - Required Confined Space Entry Program and that they have the knowledge and skills required for the safe entry, if necessary, into permit -required confined spaces . 2. Complying with all requirements of the OSHA's Permit -required Confined Space Entry Program . Employees are responsible for complying with all requirements of the OSHA's Permit -required Confined Space Entry Program . V. Procedures OSHA prohibits employees from entering into permit spaces without the written approval of the Area Director/Unit Manager. This includes permit spaces that have been reclassified or are being entered by th e employer under alternative procedures as specified in 1910.146(c)(5)(ii) and (c)(7). The final determination of whether a confined space is a permit -required confined space shall be made by the OSHA employee who will be the entrant with the concurrence of their responsible OSHA Manager(s). If entry must take place, the guidelines below shall be employed. Entry policy for OSHA employees. No entry will be permitted unless all the provisions of the 1910.146 standard have been met. Only OSHA employees who are trained in confined space entry and are medically fit to wear the necessary personal protective equipment may enter permit -required confined spaces. OSHA employees, in coordination with their responsible OSHA Manager(s), will evaluate the hazards iden tified by the employer which are present in the permit - required confined space. In addition, the space will be independently evaluated by the employee for any other hazards which may be present. In addition to personal protective equipment typically issu ed to OSHA employees, an employee who is conducting inspections involving entry into a permit -required 14-42 confined space will be provided with and use all personal protective equipment necessary for safe entry. A self -contained escape respirator shall be wo rn where confined spaces have the potential to develop hazardous atmospheres. A second trained OSHA employee will act as an attendant when the first employee enters the permit space. Both employees will be cross -trained in each other's duties as an entrant and an attendant. The attendant will not enter the confined space under any circumstance. The attendant will monitor the activities in the confined space and order the entrant to evacuate if there are changes that could present a hazard. A safe means of rescue will be readily available onsite. The OSHA attendant will not perform rescue. The OSHA attendant will confirm that personnel designated to perform rescue have been trained in accordance with 1910.146(k). If lockout is necessary to control haz ards within the confined space, the OSHA entrant will follow OSHA's lockout/tagout procedures (Chapter 13). The employee who will enter the confined space may use the permit entry procedures established by the employer only if all of the following conditio ns are met: 1. The employer has a permit required confined space entry program that complies with 1910.146. 2. All hazards and potential hazards have been identified There are no discrepancies or potential discrepancies between the employer's assessment of the hazards and the assessment conducted by OSHA. 3. The entrant verifies all entries on the permit and assures that all hazards or potential hazards have been eliminated or controlled. 4. The entrant will not rely on the employer's atmospheric monitoring results. The entrant will also conduct atmospheric monitoring to confirm the space is safe to enter. A copy of the entry permit or certification will be faxed to the responsible OSHA Manager(s) for signature. Entry will not begin until a signed copy has been retur ned to the entrant. The permit must also be signed by the employer's entry supervisor. The entry permit will be terminated by the responsible OSHA Manager(s) if entry conditions change or when the entry has been completed. A review of the confined space e ntry program will be conducted after every confined space entry. Entry permits and certifications will be considered exposure records and will be maintained in accordance with 1910.1020 by the TL in the local office. 14-43 VI. Training Annual training will be conduc ted on the requirements of this chapter to assure that all employees are aware of the policy and procedures necessary for confined space entry. Minimum training for employees who will be entering a permit space and the attendant is: 1. The Confined Space entry course offered by OSHA's Training Institute or equivalen t. 2. Respiratory Protection course offered by OSHA's Training Institute or equivalent. 3. Training in the use of any personal protective equipment required for confined space entry. 4. Introduction to Industrial Hygiene for Safety Personnel course offered by OSHA's Training Institute or eq uivalent training and/or experience . 15-44 CHAPTER 15. FIRST AID AND CARDIO PULMONARY RESUSCITAT ION I. Purpose To provide prompt and properly administered first aid, cardiopulmonary resu scitation (CPR), and Automated External Defibrillation (AED) to minimize the severity of injuries and illnesses that may occur in the workplace. II. Scope This chapter applies to all OSHA employees. Any reference to AEDs is reserved until further notice. III. Definitions Automated External Defibrillator (AED) . A medical device that analyzes the heart rhythm and can deliver an electric shock to victims of ventricular fibrillation to restore the heart's normal rhythm. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) . The comb ination of artificial respiration and manual artificial circulation. First Aid . Immediate assistance, emergency care, or treatment given to an ill or injured person before regular medical aid can be obtained. IV. Responsibilities The responsible OSHA Ma nager(s) or his or her designee is responsible for the development and implementation of this program in OSHA Offices. Only designated first aid responders are expected to provide first aid as part of their job duties. In those offices where emergency services cannot respond within fifteen minutes, the responsible OSHA Manager(s) or his or her designee will solicit a sufficient number of volunteers to administer first aid. 1. Where a sufficient number have not volunteered, the responsible OSHA Manager(s) or designee will designate individuals as first aid responders as a collateral job duty. 2. Designees will include members outside the bargaining unit and others within the bargaining unit subject to the collective bargaining agreement. The responsible OS HA Manager(s) will assure the following: 15-45 1. All employees are offered first aid and CPR training; 2. Training certificates remain current; and 3. The contents of first aid kits are replenished and maintained in a serviceable condition. Employees exposed to blood will follow the Bloodborne Pathogen Standard and procedures outlined in Chapter 19 . V. Procedures In the event of an injury to an employee, an assessment of the injuries will be made by a designated first aid responder as to whether the injury requires treatment beyond first aid. If further treatment is needed, the employee will be transported to an appropriate facility. Call 911 for all transports deemed unsafe other than by emergency response services. In the event of an injury to a contract worker, first aid supplies will be made available to the individual. If the extent of an injury requires t reatment beyond first aid, emergency response services (911) will be contacted. In the event first aid is required, it will be provided by a designated first aid responder. Incidents in which employees provide first aid and/or CPR in the course of thei r duties must be reported to the unit manager for review and follow -up, which may be necessary to protect the health of the employee. VI. Training Training will include the means of accessing emergency response services. All employees will be offered first aid, CPR and AED training. Training will be provided to maintain certifications. Certificates of training will be issued to those employees who successfully complete training. Training records will be retained at the office level. Contents of the train ing will include those subjects listed in OSHA's publication \"Best Practices Guide: Fundamentals of a Workplace First Aid Program.\" Training must include practice with one -way masks and special emphasis must be given to treatment of heart attack and strok e victims. 15-46 VII. First Aid Equipment In the absence of an infirmary, first aid kits will be provided for each office. Kits will also be provided for each GSA vehicle. First aid kits will be readily accessible and stored in a convenient area. The size of the kit will be determined by the number of employees in the office, based on supplier's recommendations. The first aid kit for the office and the GSA vehicle will comply with current ANSI standards and at a minimum must contain: Gauze compress (32 square in ches); Adhesive bandage (1x3); Adhesive tape (5 yards); Antiseptic swabs, wipes, and towelettes effective against HIV and HBV; Burn ointment; Sterile pad; Triangular bandage; and Medical exam gloves. Office first aid kits will contain the following additional items: Roller bandages (4\"x 6 yards and 2\" x 6 yards); CPR Barrier and biohazard bag; ointment; Bandage compresses; and Burn dressing. 15-47 First aid kits will be inspect ed at least quarterly and replenished as necessary. Medical exam gloves will be replaced in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Any item beyond its marked expiration date will be removed from the kit and replaced. All offices with labs where employees are potentially exposed to corrosive liquids will have eyewash facilities that comply with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z358.1. 16-48 CHAPTER 16. HEARING CONSERVATION PROGRAM I. Purpose This chapter initiates and establishes a hearing conservation program (HCP) that complies with 29 CFR 1910.95 to protect OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 from the effects of occupational noise exposure. The Hearing Conservation Amendment to the OSHA Occupational noise exposure standard, 29 CFR 1910.95, requires that employers establish a hearing conservation program for employees whose noise exposures equal or exceed an 8 -hour time-weighted average (TWA) of 85 dBA. II. Scope This chapter establishes HCP for OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 who are assigned to field duties where noise exposures are anticipated to be at or above 85 decibels (dBA) as an 8 -hour time -weighted ave rage (TWA). See OSHA Instruction, PER 04 -00-005 for information on scope of coverage of OSHA personnel for the Agency's Medical Examination Program. III.

Cancellations None. V. Action Offices All Federal OSHA offices. VI. Federal Program Change This chapter initiates and establishes a HCP. Although this chapter does not apply to State Plan States, State Plans may consider implementing a similar HCP for their field employees. VII. Significant Changes The program was established by OSHA Instruction PER 04 -00-005. This chapter reiterate s the policies established by the Instruction, introducing no changes to the program. VIII. Background The Agency's Medical Program established in 1989 included audiometric testing as a determinant of eligibility for duty. At that time, it was not anticipated that OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 would experience noise exposures that warranted the implementation of an HCP. However, noise survey measurements have since demonstrated that OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 periodically work in environments that warrant enrollment in a HCP in accordance with the hearing conservation amendment to 29 CFR 1910.95 , Occupational noise exposure. A HCP includes noise monitoring, audiometric testing, employee notification, use of appropriate hearing protection, administration of pertinent training and education, and associated recordkeeping. Specific imp lementation protocols are delineated below in Section X. Procedures. 16-50 IX. Policy This chapter establishes an OSHA HCP that is consistent with the hearing conservation amendment to 29 CFR 1910.95 , Occupational noise exposure. Whenever feasible, OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 are encouraged to avoid exposure to hazards, including noise. The personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 are to limit their exposure to noise to the minimum duration necessary, and to wear hearing protection as required for the safe completion of their duties. In addition, whil e OSHA personnel covered by PER 04-00-005 are at facilities in which employees are required by their employers to wear hearing protection, OSHA personnel are to wear hearing protectors that provide equivalent hearing protection to that which the facility employees are wearing. X. Procedures Noise Monitoring Due to the wide variety of worksites encountered and the variability of wo rking conditions in each site, OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 may encounter periods of noise exposure in excess of 85 dBA, as an 8 -hour TWA. Newly hired OSHA personnel receive orientation training that prepares them to evaluate and protect themsel ves from potentially harmful noise exposures. OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 are to follow procedures in the OSHA Technical Manual TED 01 -00-015, Chapter 5, in order to determine the indications of potentially harmful workplace noise levels and the need to conduct screening noise monitoring using a sound level meter (SLM). The res ults of screening measurements will be used by OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 to select appropriate hearing protectors. Intensity and duration of the noise exposure, in addition to professional judgment, must be used in determining how best to me asure the exposure of the affected employee. (OSHA Technical Manual TED 01 -00-015: https://www.osha.gov/enforcement/directives/ted -01-00-015-5). Also, see Section E. Records Prog ram for procedures for recording and reporting noise exposure measurements. Audiometric Testing program Audiometric testing will be conducted in concert with the Agency's Medical Examination Program. All audiometric exams performed as part of the Agency's Medical Examination Program must take place in an appropriate test environment that does not interfere with the accuracy of the audiometric test thresholds. Audiometric test frequencies shall include: Hz, 2,000 Hz, 3,000 Hz, 4,000 Hz, 6,000 H z, and 8,000 Hz. Requirements for test equipment and calibration must conform, at a minimum, to the calibration and audiometric test requirements set 16-51 forth in the hearing conservation amendment 29 CFR1910.95(g) to the occupational noise exposure standard. Prior to receiving audiometric testing, OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 will complete an audiometric history form in order to document pertinent medical history, noise exposure, and use of hearin g protection. (See Appendix A). 1. Scheduling . Baseline and annual audiometric exams will be scheduled concurrently with pre -placement and annual medical examinations respectively. Retest audiograms will be conducted within 30 days of the time that a Standard Threshold Shift (STS) is identified. 2. Baseline Audi ogram . The baseline audiogram must be preceded by a minimum period of 14 hours of quiet without exposure to workplace noise. The use of hearing protection is an acceptable alternative to the 14 -hour quiet period before the baseline audiogram is taken. The baseline audiogram for covered OSHA personnel is defined as follows: a. OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 hired prior to the establishment of the 1989 Medical Examination Program will have their 1989 audiogram or their oldest qualifying audiogram on fi le identified as their baseline audiogram. b. OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 hired after 1989 will have their pre -placement audiogram identified as their baseline audiogram. Valid baseline audiograms are obtained prior to field assignment as require d by the pre -employment medical requirements program (See OSHA Instruction, PER 04 -00-005). 16-52 3. Annual audiogram . Audiometric testing will be conducted annually. Each annual audiogram shall be compared to the baseline audiogram to validate its accuracy, and d etect significant changes in hearing. The 14 -hour quiet period is not necessary for annual audiograms. 4. Notification of Audiogram Results . Immediately following audiometric testing, covered OSHA personnel will receive preliminary verbal feedback on their te st results by an individual qualified to administer the audiometric exam. A preliminary determination of an STS will result in covered OSHA personnel automatically receiving an appointment for a retest audiogram. A definitive interpretation of all audiogra ms will take place following audiogram review by the physician acting as the HCP Director (see Section XI. E.). Formal written notification letters will be sent to each employee in the program from the HCP Director regarding: findings of annual audiograms that do not warrant retesting, findings of retest audiograms including STS, indications of possible otological pathology, and recommendations for audiological or otological follow -up. If covered OSHA personnel receive a retest audiogram, he/she will receiv e a single notification letter that explains the findings of both the annual and retest audiograms. (See Sample Notification Letter, Appendix B). The OSHA Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing (OOM N) will contact covered OSHA personnel with specific information in order for them to obtain follow -up testing and treatment as needed (see section B.7.e. below). 5. Retest audiogram . OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 with annual audiograms that meet the STS criteria will be retested within 30 days of the annual audiogram to determine whether the threshold shift is temporary or persistent. Retest audiograms should be conducted after a 14 -hour quiet period. However, hearing protection may be used as an alternative to the 14 - hour quiet period. A retest audio gram conducted within 30 days of the annual audiogram may be substituted for the annual audiogram. The retest audiogram may confirm a newly identified STS, or it may reveal an improvement in hearing threshold. In both of these cases, the results of the retest audiogram can be substituted for the annual audiogram. 6. Revised Baseline Audiogram . An annual audiogram may be substituted for the baseline audiogram when: (a) the STS is persistent; or (b) the hearing threshold shown in the annual audiogram indicates s ignificant improvement over the baseline audiogram. The audiometric findings from each ear are evaluated independently for improvement or worsening of the auditory threshold of the person on whom the audiogram was performed. If only one ear meets the crite ria for an STS, the baseline may be revised for that ear only. Thus, future audiometric tracking will be based on separate left and right ear baseline revisions. 16-53 7. Standard Threshold Shift . The criterion for STS is a change in hearing threshold relative to t he baseline audiogram of an average of 10 dB or more at 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz in either ear. Age corrections will be applied in determining STS. If an STS has occurred, the employee will be informed of this fact in writing, within 21 days of the final determination. When the HCP Director (Section Xl.E.) has determined that an STS has occurred, the following actions will take place: a. The HCP Director will send a notification letter to the affected employee. The HCP Director will send a separate notification letter to the OSHA Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing (OOM N) as the employer representative. The HCP Director will provide both notification letters within 21 days of determining that an STS has occurred. If the STS did not persist on the retest audiogram, or if there is an improvement in hearing thresholds, the notification letter will indicate these findings. b. OOM N will notify the Regional Administrator, his/her designee, or Directorate Head as appropriate, of the presence of an STS, and of the required follow -up actions, including the need for an OSHA 300 log entry per paragraph X.E.4. Recording Criteria for Cases Involving Occupational Hearing Loss. c. The designated Hearing Conservation Coordinator (HCC) (see Section XI. C.) will ens ure proper evaluation of the adequacy of hearing protectors. If the affected employee is not using hearing protectors, that employee shall be fitted with hearing protectors, trained in their use and care, and be required to use them. If the affected employ ee is already wearing hearing protectors, he/she will be refitted and retrained in the use of hearing protectors and be required to use them. Alternative hearing protectors will be provided as appropriate. d. The HCP Director will advise OOM N of recommendati ons for additional audiological or otological evaluations (See Appendix C). OOM N will make final determinations on appropriate referrals as necessary. e. OOM N will inform the affected employee of the purpose for additional testing, the logistics for obtainin g additional testing, and of the implications of test results. Hearing Protection 16-54 Hearing protectors shall be provided at no cost to all OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005. They shall be fitted with hearing protectors and trained in their use and care . Covered OSHA personnel shall wear hearing protectors when exposed to 90 dBA or greater as an 8 -hour TWA. Covered personnel who have experienced an STS shall wear hearing protectors when exposed to sound levels of 85 dBA or greater as an 8-hour TWA. Dual hearing protection shall be worn if exposures exceed 105 dBA as an 8 -hour TWA. In addition, when OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 are at facilities in which employees are required by their employers to wear hearing protection, OSHA personnel are req uired to wear hearing protection equivalent to that worn by employees at the facility. See OSHA Field Operations Manual (FOM) CPL 02-00- 163, Chapter 3. Inspection Procedures, 3. which states: \" Section 1903.7(c) requires CSHOs to comply with all employer safety and health rules and practices at the establishment being inspected; CSHOs shall wear and use appropriate protective clothing and equipment.\" 1. OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 will be provided the opportunity to choose their hearing protectors from a variety of types, with suitable attenuation characteristics. Factors to consider include comfort, communication, hearing ability, compatibility wi th other personal protective equipment, and the environment in which they will be worn. 2. Training in the use and care of hearing protectors is required. Hearing protectors must be properly fitted and their correct use must be demonstrated. 3. Hearing protector s must provide appropriate attenuation. (See 29 CFR 1910.95 Appendix B.) a. Hearing protectors must attenuate noise exposure to at least 90 dBA as an 8-hour TWA. b. For OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 who have experienced an STS, hearing protectors must attenuate noise exposure to at least 85 dBA as an 8 -hour TWA. c. 29 CFR 1910.95 Appendix B, should be referred to for assistance on how to determine appropriate hearing protector attenuation. Additional information is available in the OSHA Technical Manual, Section III, Chapter 5. Also refer to NIOSH for additional methods to evaluate hearing protector performance and for updated and emerging information on individual fit testing at 1 -800-CDC -INFO (1 -800-232- 4636). See http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/ Training Program 16-55 OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 shall be trained prior to beginning work in noisy environments and annually thereafter with updated information. Training must be conducted by a qualified individual, designated by the Regional Administrator, or Directorate Head, who is capable of answering questions on the Hearing Conservation Program. (Refer to section XI.Roles and Responsibilities.) Training shall include, at a minimum, the fo llowing: 1. The effects of noise on hearing; 2. The purpose of hearing protectors, the advantages, disadvantages, and attenuation of various types, and instructions on selection, fitting, use, and care of hearing protectors. (The NIOSH website has demonstrations for the correct fitting of different type s of hearing protectors. This is available at 1 - 800-CDC -INFO (1 -800-232-4636); See http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/ 3. The purpose of audiometric testing and an explanation of the test procedures; and 4. A description of the HCP including a description of roles and responsibilities under the HCP. Records Program 16-56 1. Noise Exposure Measurements . Noise exposure measurements including self-monitoring data shall be recorded on the OSHA -92 Noise Survey Report . The form is to be completed in the same way as for any sample taken during the inspection. The name of person being sampled is to be entered on line item 7 \"Person Performing Sampling\". The form should be entered into the Integrated Management Informatio n System (IMIS) for tracking. The Area Director, or Directorate Head as appropriate shall create and keep a hard copy file that contains the covered employees' noise exposure records. Additionally, all covered OSHA personnel shall store and maintain their own exposure monitoring records in an individual exposure file. Noise exposure measurement records shall be retained for 2 years in accordance with 1910.95(m)(3)(i). (See standard interpretation letter dated 8/17/2000 - which states: \"The two year retenti on time for employee noise exposure measurements takes precedence over the general record retention requirement for employee exposure records in 1910.1020.\") 2. Audiograms . Audiometric test results and medical records related to this program will be maintain ed by OSHA's Medical Program Administrator in the Directorate of Science, Technology and Medicine in accordance with: The Privacy Act of 1974, 29 CFR Part 71; Occupational noise exposure, 29 CFR 1910.95(m); and Recording criteria for cases involving occupa tional hearing loss, 29 CFR 1904.10. Audiometric test results shall be maintained in OOM N for the duration of the employee's employment, along with the employee's Medical Program records, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1020, Access to employee exposure and medical records. Audiometric test results of former employees will be archived in the Federal Records Center and are available through Human Resources. 3. Access to Records . OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 or former OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 may request a copy of his/her own exposure, audiological, and medical records required by this HCP or may request that a copy be sent to his/her designated representative. All activities involved in complying with the access to medical records provi sions can be carried out on behalf of OSHA by the physician or other health care professional in charge of employee records (29 CFR 1910.1020, Access to employee exposure and medical records). 16-57 4. Recording Criteria for Cases Involving Occupational Hearing Lo ss. (Refer to section XI. for Roles and Responsibilities.) An STS must be recorded on the OSHA 300 log and the hearing loss column must be checked on the log when the following conditions are met: an audiogram for a covered OSHA employee reveals a work -related STS in hearing in one or both ears and the person's total hearing level is 25 dB or more, averaged at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz in the same ear(s) as the STS. The audiometric results will be age - adjusted (Appendix F, 29 CFR 1910.95 ). Age adjustment will not be used when determining whether the person's total hearing level is 25 dB or more above audiometric zero. The OSHA Intranet provides a hearing loss \"decision tree\" to assist in determining whether the results of an audiometric exam, given on or after January 1, 2003, reveal a recordable STS. If the retest audiogram, conducted within 30 days of the annual audiogram, does not confirm a recordable STS, the hearing loss case does not need to be recorded on the OSHA 300 log. If the retest audiogram confirms a recordable STS, the hearing loss case must be recorded on the OSHA 300 log within 7 calendar days of the retest. OOM N will notify the Regional Administrator, his/her designee, or Directorate Head, as appropriate, of the need to record an STS within sufficient time to satisfy this recording requirement. If the STS does not persist, the recorded entry on the log may be erased or lined -out. See Recording criteria for case s involving occupationa l hearing loss, 29 CFR 1904.10 . XI.

FALL PROTECTION I. Purpose This chapter establishes the OSHA Field Safety and Health Man agement System (SHMS) Fall Prevention and Protection Program. OSHA employees need to recognize fall hazards and know how to avoid them. If tasked to work at heights, OSHA employees should understand safe procedures to work at heights and have the appropri ate level of training. The policies and procedures in this Program are intended to set broad expectations for preventing OSHA employee injury or death from falling. OSHA expects Regions, DTSEM, and DTE to develop specific procedures that align with this Program as needed. This Program emphasizes using accepta ble alternatives that meet the work requirement without working at heights , establishes roles and responsibilities, and describes training requirements . Chapter 11, Walking Working Surfaces provides additional information applicable to surfaces at heights. II. Scope This Program applies to all OSHA employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual. All employees will take necessary precautions while conducting work activities, including coll ecting information to document fall hazards in workplaces. The majority of policies in this chapter are for activities that require Basic or Advanced Climber Training. OSHA employees that do not need Basic or Advanced Climber Training to conduct work activ ities will receive awareness training and may use ladders at their discretion when fall protection equipment is not required. III. References 29 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1926 Subpart M, Fall Protection OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual, Chapter 13, Control of Hazardous Energy Sources OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual, Chapter 11, Walking and Working Surfaces American Natio nal Standards Institute (ANSI)/American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) Z -359, Fall Protection Code Personal Fall Protection Used in Construction and Demolition Operations, ANSI/ASSE A10.32 -2012 IV. Definitions Responsible OSHA Managers are trained and competent supervisors appointed by Regional Administrators/Directorate Directors (RAs/Directors) to perform duties specified in this Program for overseeing local implementation. 17-65 Authorized OSHA Employees (Authorized Employees) are designated by the Responsible OSHA Manager based on the need to conduct work activities at heights requiring fall protection (e.g. investigation and inspections). Authorized Employees complete appropriate training and have the knowledge and expertise to safely conduct work activities with fall protection at anticipated heights. Authorized Employees will use ladders at their discretion and follow Regional policy for notification to their supervisor when conducting work activities that require Basic or Advanced Climber training. Authorized Employees designation may include OSHA trainers who teach fall protection courses and conduct hands -on exercises at heights. Authorized Employees are grouped into two categories: 1. Basic Climbers: This authorization level is for employees who are trained and equipped with the knowledge and expertise to safely work at limited locations at heights (see Activities Requiring Basic Fall Prevention and Protection Training, Section VII.A) . Basic Climbers are not authorized t o use fall arrest systems. 2. Advanced Climbers: Employees who volunteer and are selected, receive medical clearance, and are trained and equipped with advanced knowledge and expertise to safely work at heights with complexities, including towers (see Activ ities Requiring Advanced Climber Training Level, Section VII.A). Personal Fall Protection Systems include Personal Fall Arrest Systems (PFAS), Personal Fall Restraint Systems (PFRS), positioning devices, and ladder safety devices or systems. 1. PFAS: A PFAS protects an Authorized OSHA Employee if a fall occurs by arresting or stopping the fall. It must function to ensure that the worker neither free falls more than 6 feet nor contacts any lower level (see 29 CFR 1926.502(d)(16)(iii)). The anchor point must s upport at least 5,000 pounds as per attached Authorized Employee (see 29 CFR 1926.502(d)(15)). 2. PFRS: A PFRS will prevent an Authorized OSHA Employee from falling any distance. Restraint systems used by Authorized OSHA Employees must have the capacity to withstand at least twice the maximum expected force that is needed to restrain a person from exposure to the fall hazard. In determining this force, consideration should be given to site -specific factors such as the force generated by a person walking, l eaning, or sliding down a working surface. The OSHA Technical Manual Fall Protection in Construction Chapter provides further information and PFRS examples. NOTE: Fall restrai nt is preferred over fall arrest. 17-66 3. Positioning devices: Body belts serve as positioning devices. They can position a worker so that he or she can safely perform a job in a vertical work position at a height as per requirements in 29 CFR 1926.502(e), 29 CFR 1926 Subpart M, Appendix D . 4. A ladder safety device or system is used to climb fixed ladders and includes a carabiner, carrier rail, safety sleeve and body harness. It is available as a cable (i.e., vertical lifeline) or fixed rail system per requirements in 29 CFR 1926.1053(a)(18),(22) , and (23) and 29 CFR 1910.27(d). V. Responsibilities RAs/Directors will: 1. Establish fall prevention and protection procedu res specific to the Region/SLTC/CTC/DTE and implement them in accordance with this Program. These site specific procedures will include: a. Means for ensuring that all employees are appropriately trained. b. An established process for employees to notify the Responsible OSHA Manager about fall hazards when work activities require basic and advanced training. c. A mechanism for properly inspecting, maintaining, storing, and removing fall protection equipment from service when it is no longer in good condition. 17-67 2. Appoint Responsible OSHA Managers to implement this Program locally. 3. Provide training in local procedures in addition to the specific requirements in this Program for employees as deemed necessary. 4. Assess hazards in collaboration with Authorized Employees (i.e., Basic and Advanced Climbers) before giving permission when a request is made to conduct work activities at heights requiring fall protection systems, or use personnel lifting devices (e. g. aerial lifts, scissor lifts); or assign the Responsible OSHA Manager to perform this function. 5. Develop and implement appropriate procedures in accordance with policy specified in this Program for using equipment owned by an employer other than OSHA at an investigation, inspection or fall protection training locati on. Give permission to Authorized Employees to use such equipment if appropriate or assign the Responsible OSHA Manager to give permission. 6. Decide if a fall hazard response team is needed to conduct complex inspections or investigations within the Region/ SLTC/CTC/DTE. If needed, establish a fall hazard response team including Authorized Employees with advanced training, knowledge, expertise, and experience to provide technical support for inspections or investigations involving fall hazards. The team may also provide other support as necessary. 7. Request assistance from SLTC's Health Response Team for investigations and inspections that present fall hazards when the Region/Directorate does not have the resources to safely conduct work activities. 8. Ensure t hat resources are made available to implement this Program. Responsible OSHA Managers will: 17-68 1. Complete the Annual SHMS Fall Prevention Awareness training. 2. Complete the Basic Fall Prevention and Protection training if any employees are Authorized Employees . 3. Select proficient training sources. Training sources must have knowledge, expertise, and experience to provide proper training to employees who meet the objectives described in this Program. 4. Ensure that OSHA employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety a nd Health Manual receive appropriate training (e.g. awareness, Basic Climber, or Advanced Climber) as described in this Program. 5. Maintain training records per 29 CFR 19 26.503(b) or designate an employee to perform this function. 6. Designate Authorized Employees and the appropriate authorization level their job requires (e. g. Basic or Advanced Climbers), in writing. 7. Assess hazards in collaboration with Authorized Employees before giving permission when a request is made to cond uct work activities at heights requiring fall protection systems, or personnel lifting devices (e.g. aerial lifts and scissor lifts), or if assigned by the RA/Dire ctor to perform this function. 8. Ensur e that only Authorized Employees use personal fall protection and that they are fully authorized by the Area Office before they climb. If the hazard warrants more than one authorized employee, that employee should be present on site before the authorized employee is allowed to climb. 9. Follow established procedures for the Region/SLTC/CTC/DTE to give permission to Authorized Employees to use equipment owned by an employer other than OSHA at an investigation, inspection or fall protection training location i f appropriate and assigned by the RA/Director to do so. Submit the request to the RA/Director if not assigned to perform this function. 10. Develop and implement appropriate inspection, maintenance, storage, and disposal system for fall protection equipment i n accordance with applicable guidance, manufacturer's instructions, and procedures established for the Region/SLTC/CTC/DTE. Authorized Employees will: 17-69 1. Complete training required for the authorization level (e.g. Basic Fall Prevention and Protection Training or Advanced Climber Training) as specified in this Program and always use proper safety measures. 2. Follow specific Region/SLTC/CTC/DTE fall preventio n and protection procedures. 3. Select the right equipment for the task as specified by the manufacturer and inspect and verify that it is in good working condition before using it. Authorized Employees will not use defective equipment, incompatible componen ts or personal fall protection equipment provided by an employer other than OSHA. 4. Follow this Program's policy for using another employer's equipment, with the exception that Authorized Employees will only use personal fall protection equipment provided b y OSHA. OSHA Employees that are not Authorized Employees, those not trained as Basic or Advanced Climbers , will complete annual SHMS fall protection awareness training and are allowed to use ladders at their discretion. VI. Training This Program's effectiveness relies on OSHA's commitment to training including initial training and continued education that is, at a minimum, in compliance with 29 CFR 1926.503 , Fall Protection Training Requirements and 29 CFR 1926.1060 Stairways and Ladders. Training requirements for OSHA employees are based on approved work activ ities. RAs/Directors can provide training in local procedures, in addition to training specified in this Program for employees. Training sources must have the knowledge, expertise and experience to provide proper training to employees that meet the object ives described in this Program. Training sources may include the OSHA Training Institute, equipment manufacturers, unions, OSHA cooperative programs (e.g. Wind and Communication Tower Training), third -party and in -house sources such as trained, experience d and competent managers, or Compliance Safety and Health Officers that is, at a minimum, in compliance with 29 CFR 1926.503(a)(2) . Responsible OSHA Managers/designee s will maintain Annual SHMS Fall Prevention Awareness Training records and prepare a training certification record for Authorized Employees (e. g. Basic Climbers and Advanced Climbers) upon successfully completing initial training, annual refresher, and bie nnial recertification as applicable, including any additional fall prevention and protection training mandated by RAs/Directors per 29 CFR 1926.503(b) . The training documentation will include the means used to verify that the employee understood the training. Annual SHMS Fall Prevention Awareness Training All OSHA employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual must complete Annual SHMS Fall Prevention Awa reness Training. This includes 17-70 employees who may encounter worksites at heights , but are not authorized to gain access to work at heights to the extent that authorized employees are permitted to do and/or OSHA employees who may encounter fall hazards in t heir workplaces. Authorized Employees will also complete Annual SHMS Fa ll Prevention Awareness Training in addition to required advanced training . Minimum training requirements include how to identify fall hazards in the workplace, fall hazard avoidance and fall prevention measures, the requirements specified in this Program and any specific fall prevention and protection procedures implemented by the Region/SLTC/CTC/DTE. Current OSHA employees are approved to give training if they have completed Basic Fall Prevention and Protection Training or Advanced Climber Training, have experience with fall prevention and protection mechanisms, and have knowledge about this Program. Authorized Employee Training Authorized Employees (i.e., Basic Climbers and Advanc ed Climbers) will receive fall prevention and protection training that includes classroom and hands -on activities. Fall prevention and protection training will emphasize the importance of considering alternatives to working at heights, fall prevention and protection options, and self - rescue methods that minimize risk. Training on fall protection and self -rescue mechanisms will involve various field applications and exercises designed to introduce and reinforce how to safely use equipment and system compon ents for fall protection and self -rescue. All Authorized Employees will demonstrate via practical examination to subject matter experts during training proper selection, usage, storage, maintenance, inspection, assembly, and dismantling procedures for fal l protection and self-rescue equipment and systems currently in use. Additional training is necessary if conditions change, such as, the work type or practice, workplace, or fall protection methods. Retraining will occur when the Responsible OSHA Mana ger determines that an Authorized Employee does not have an adequate understanding and skill to work safely at heights. 1. Basic fall Protection and Protection Training Initial Training: Before working at heights, Basic Climber Authorized Employees will compl ete Basic Fall Prevention and Protection Training from a proficient training source that meets objectives described below. This may require combining the OSHA Training Institute's fall protection course with training from other sources as necessary. Refr esher Training: Basic Climber Authorized Employees will complete Annual SHMS Fall Prevention Awareness Training. Basic Fall Prevention and Protection Training objectives must include at least the following: 17-71 a. OSHA's Fall Protection standards and other applicable guidance, this Program, local fall prevention and protection procedures, as well as manufacturer's instructions, warnings, cautions, and equipment limitations for the specific equipment that Authorized Employees will use, with emphasis on the im portance of following equipment manufacturers' instructions. b. Safe alternatives to working at heights when feasible. c. Worksite assessment, recognizing fall hazards and other site specific hazards such as electricity, radio frequency, noise, hazardous chemica ls, water and environmental hazards. d. Fall hazards elimination, avoidance, and control. e. Fall prevention measures and evaluation. f. Fall arrest system components: anchorage, body support or harness, and connection mechanisms such as lanyards (e.g. shock abso rbing, retractable and Y lanyards). g. How to properly assess anchorages and engineering consultation that may be required to satisfy dynamic loading capability, especially where multiple individuals may be involved in simultaneously using the same anchor p oint. h.

Pre-determined task -specific fall protection and rescue plan, including appropriate rescue options and demonstrated self -rescue techniques p. Procedures to locate first aid supplies and contact Emergency Medical Services q. Other applicable procedures specific to the worksite such as lockout/tagout procedures (see Chapter 13, Control of Hazardous Energy Sources) r. Proper documentation of fall hazards and abatement methods s. Use of alternative technology to document hazards t. Contact methods for OSHA fall protection su bject matter experts. 2. Advanced Climber Training Advanced Climber Authorized Employees undergo highly specialized and rigorous fall protection training such as the Wind and Communication Tower Training. Advanced Climbers will obtain medical clearance with a biennial expiration date through the OSHA Medical Examination Program (OMEP) before completing initial training and performing associated duties, and biennially thereafter. The medical clearance is labeled as Wind Tower Clearance in the Compliance Safet y and Health Officer Health Information System (CHIS). OSHA employees not in the OMEP may obtain assistance from the Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing to make arrangements with Federal Occupational Health (FOH) for medical clearance. However, employees' RAs/Directors are responsible for securing funding for FOH's services. Advanced Climbers will not participate in training or perform associated duties if the medical clearance has expired. The OSHA Training Institute will provide guidance upon request on how to register for and complete specialized training for Advanced Climbers and the biennial recertification (e.g. Wind and Communication Tower Training). 17-73 Initial Training Requirements: Advanced Climbers will complete the Basic Fall Prevention and Protection Training. This will be followed by specialized training such as the Wind and Communication Tower Training that meet the objectives listed in this Program for Advanced Climber Training. Advanced climbers must receive training from a proficie nt training source before working at heights. Recertification Training: Advanced Climbers will complete specialized training recertification biennially from a proficient training source such as Wind and Communication Tower Training recertification. Refre sher Training: Advanced Climbers will complete Annual SHMS Fall Prevention Awareness training. Advanced Climber Training objectives include: a. Fall hazard recognition, assessment, and avoidance b. Tower climbing and self -rescue equipment selection, inspection, use, and storage, application limitations, proper anchoring, tie -off techniques, proper rigging practices, elongation, deceleration distance determination, free -fall distance, and total fall distance determination c. Climbing proficiency demonstration. Expla nation and demonstration for equipment used for climbing and positioning. Personal preparedness, climbing, resting, and proper positioning d. Equipment installation/assembly, stresses and resultant effects, and safety margins e. Methods to recognize energized po wer lines, auxiliary equipment, and other apparatus f. Emergency procedures, proper self -rescue technique for the situation, and suspension trauma management g. Basic first aid and methods to contact Emergency Medical Services h. Personnel lifting devices VII. Procedu res for Working at Heights Hazard Assessment 17-74 When OSHA employees need to conduct inspection and investigation work activities at heights as in described section IV.B., t he RA/Director or Responsible OSHA Manager will conduct a hazard assessment in collaboration with Authorized Employee s (i.e., Basic Climbers and Advanced Climbers). A sample hazard assessment form can be found here. Some safety considerations for completing a Hazard Assessment are described below: 1. Recognize activities and areas where Authorized Employees (e.g. Basic and Advanced Climbers) may require fall protection, including: Activities Requi ring Basic Fall Prevention and Protection Training Level at a minimum: a. Commercial/Residential construction sites with fall hazards b. Excavations, wells and pits, holes c. Floor openings (e.g. in walking surfaces) d. Grain silos -equipped with guardrails e. Maritime c ranes -equipped with guardrails f. Personnel lifting devices (e. g. aerial lifts, scissor lifts) g. Ramps, runways and other walkways h. Tanks and containments (e.g. water tanks) -equipped with caged ladders and work platforms with guardrails i. Tower cranes - equipped with guardrails j. Unprotected edges in hoist areas k. Walking and working surfaces unprotected sides and edges l. Wall openings Activities Requiring Advanced Climber Training Level: a. Grain Silos -not equipped with guardrails b. Maritime Cranes -not equipped with guardrails c. Tanks and containments (e.g. water tanks) - without caged ladders or work platforms with guardrails d. Towers (e.g. water towers, communication towers) 17-75 e. Wind Turbines 2. Determine if there is a safe alternative to working at a height to perform duties (e.g. using a camera connected to a trench rod). Implement safe alternatives if feasible. 3. Determine if it is necessary to work at heights, for example, to conduct safety evaluations or training exercises. 4. If it is deemed necessary to work at a height requiring fall protection, ensure that an effective task -specific fall protection and rescue plan is developed, reviewed, approved, and implemented before giving permission to Authorized Employees. This includ es the following: a. Ensure that only Authorized Employees with appropriate training, knowledge, expertise and experience with the specific fall hazard(s) are permitted to gain access to work at heights. b. Complete a site -specific hazard assessment. c. Evaluate e ach situation, planning in advance how to protect the Authorized Employee from falling, appropriate mitigation, avoidance, and control measures, as well as rescue procedures. d. Identify other site -specific hazards and how to protect Authorized Employees (e .g. noise, electricity). Determine if employees with specialized expertise to mitigate specific hazards are needed, for example, to verify proper lockout/tagout of hazardous energy sources and proper Radio Frequency (RF) monitoring. e. Evaluate if there is a safe means to reach the worksite and if the worksite is safe to access. The assessment will include any ladders or personnel lifting devices Authorized Employees will use. f. Determine if fall prevention measures are adequate. For example, carefully inspec t guardrails to check if they are properly installed, in good condition and in compliance with specifications in applicable OSHA standards. Implement necessary measures to protect Authorized Employees if existing fall protection measures are inadequate. g. Identify, select, and provide Authorized Employees with the appropriate equipment in optimal working condition for the specific task, including fall protection and self -rescue equipment, and personnel lifting devices if necessary. h. Determine whether a Perso nal Fall Restraint System (PFRS) or a Personal Fall Arrest System (PFAS) is needed. 17-76 NOTE: Fall restraint is preferred over fall arrest. i. Determine the appropriate emergency response personnel and rescue procedures needed to ensure that, if necessary, a rescue proceeds quickly and efficiently. j. Notify the necessary emergency response team or trained Fire Department with the capability and equipment to support the planned rescue in the area (e.g. ladder truck high enough to gain access to rescue an employe e). k. Brief all personnel on methods to contact Emergency Medical Services. 5. Review the fall protection and rescue plan with Authorized Employees and make any necessary adjustments before starting work. Equipment Selection Selected components will be compatible with the fall protection systems in use in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations (e.g. components for PFAS/PFRS, ladder safety devices/systems). 1.

For example, equipment removal from service if activated in a fall, or involved in any incident that could cause damage or when defects or damages are identified during inspection. Policy on Using Other Employers' Equipment 17-79 1. OSHA employees will avoid using equipment pro vided by an employer other than OSHA, such as personnel lifting devices, at an inspection, investigation, or training location. 2. In rare instances when there are no alternatives and it is essential to use equipment, except ladders, owned by an employer oth er than OSHA, Authorized Employees must follow specific procedures for the Region/SLTC/CTC/DTE and verify that the equipment is safe to use before using it. Specific procedures for the Region/SLTC/CTC/DTE will include how to obtain permission from the RA /Director or the Responsible OSHA Manager before using equipment, except ladders, provided by an employer other than OSHA. An OSHA employee with training, knowledge, expertise, and experience about the specific piece of equipment will verify that it is i n optimal working condition; ensure that the proposed use is in accordance with manufacturer's specifications; components are compatible; and a qualified operator is available to run the equipment, if applicable. 3. OSHA employees may use ladders at their di scretion. Safety evaluation and determination before using a ladder will include inspecting the ladder to ensure that it is in good condition, properly installed or positioned, and the load rating is sufficient to withstand equipment/tools and the OSHA Emp loyee's weight. Authorized Employees may attach to an existing anchor point upon inspection and verification that it is adequate for the specific task (see 29 CFR 1926 Subpart M, Appendix C to (d)(15)(ii), (e)(2)) Authorized Employees may seek assistance from their supe rvisors or other knowledgeable persons, such as engineers, to properly assess anchor points. 18-80 CHAPTER 18. RESPIRATORY PROTECTI ON I. Purpose During their regular course of duty OSHA employees may be required to enter environments where airborne contaminants are present. As such, a comprehensive respiratory program is mandatory. This Program sets forth accepted practices for respirator users and provides information and guidance on the proper selection, use, and care of respirators in accordance with CPL 2 -2.54A. II. Scope This chapter applies to all OSHA employees who need to wear a respirator to perform his or her job duties. III. Definitions Air Purifying Respirator. A respirator with an air purifying filter, cartridge, or canister that removes specific air contaminants by passing ambient air through the air purifying element. Atmosphere -supplying Respirator.

Responsibilities The responsible OSHA Manager(s), acting as the representative of the Regional Administrator, is the coordinator of the Respiratory Protection Program in the Area Office. The responsible OSHA Manager(s) may delegate the day -to-day responsibility for the respiratory protectio n program to one of the AAD/appropriate OSHA manager , or a senior industrial hygienist; however, the ultimate responsibility for the program within the Area Office remains with the responsible OSHA Manager(s). The Regional Administrator will appoint a Regional Program Administrator, the Regional Respiratory Protection Program Coordinator (RRPPC), who as a representative of the Regional Administrator wil l have responsibility for the program in the Regional Office, as well as act as overall regional coordinator for the program. As administrator for the program, the RRPPC has the authority to make decisions and implement changes to the respiratory protecti on program as necessary. The respirator water will: 1. Use respirator in accordance with instruction and training received; 2. Store, clean, maintain, and guard against damage to respirator equipment; 3. Inspect the respirator before each use and after cleaning and disinfecting. If the respirator is found to be defective, report any deficiencies or malfunctions of a respirator to the AAD/ appropriate OSHA manager ; 4. Notify the responsible OSHA Manager(s) or the Program Administrator when: a. The assigned respirator no longer fits well or is defective; b. Respiratory hazards not properly addressed by the respirators in use are encountered; and c. Where there are any concerns about the program. 18-83 V. Procedure Respirator Selection The following standard operating procedures have been developed to assist employees in the proper selection of respiratory protection. 1. Proper selection of respirators will be made in accordance with the OSHA Respiratory protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134), CPL 02 -02-054A, guidance from other pertinent OSHA standards, as well as proper design logic, such as that developed jointly by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and OSHA. 2. All respirators and cartridges will be selected based on the nature and extent of the hazard, the work requirements and conditions, and the characteristics and limitations of the respirators available. Specific guidance can be found in the Exposure Guide (Appendix A). 3. All respiratory protection must have NIOSH approval for their intended use. 4. Use of disposable respirators will be permitted only where users have been successfully fit tested and other criteria, including training and medical, have been met. 5. Properly approved respirators must contain the following: a. A NIOSH approval number on each unit, such as TC -21C-101. b. A label identifying the Manufacturer and Model number of the respirator. c. Any information related to the limitations of the respirator. d. In addition to the manufacturer's name, model number, NIOSH approval number, and use limitations, respirator cartridges must contain the identity of the contaminant(s) that will be filtered by the cartridge. e. Where practicable, the Program Administrator will assign respirators to individual employees for their exclusive use. f. Modifications will not be made to respiratory protective equipment unless required by NIOSH or the equipment manufacturer to maintain governmental approval. Medical Evaluations of Employees Required to Wear Respirators 18-84 1. Prior to being fit tested or being required to wear a respira tor, all employees who will wear a respirator will be required to be evaluated by the Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing (OOM N) designated physicians to determine the employee's ability to safely wear a respirator. 2. The medical protocol for determ ining employee fitness for wearing respiratory protection is to be administered by the OOM N with contracted support from Federal Occupational Health in accordance with OSHA Instruction PER 04 -00-005. 3. A local clinic will be used to implement OOM N procedures , which include means of documenting and recording information pertaining to the employee evaluation. The clinic will comply with the requirements of OSHA's standard 29 CFR 1910.134, including the medical evaluation questionnaire. 4. A physician must revie w the medical evaluation findings. Based on the findings, follow -up medical evaluations may be required. At this time, additional information may be requested by the reviewing physician e.g. details of actual or expected respirator use in the workplace. 5. The examining or reviewing physician must forward the results of the medical examination to the OOM N for agency evaluation and final determination of fitness for respirator use. Documentation of each employee evaluation must be provided by the physician in the form of a written recommendation regarding the employee's ability to wear a respirator, and will also including all restrictions limiting use. 6. Limitations on respirator use documented by the physician must be communicated to the Regional Administr ator or designee, the responsible OSHA Manager(s), and the employee. Permanent limitations on respirator use must be addressed by an Accommodation Plan, approved by the Accommodations Committee and implemented by DAP. 7. When medical conditions prohibit an e mployee from wearing a negative pressure respirator, but the employee is medically cleared to wear a PAPR or SAR, the Agency must provide a PAPR or SAR for employee use. 8. Employees will be re -evaluated by the physician whenever: a. An employee reports to the responsible OSHA Manager(s) any signs or symptoms that may impact safe use of the respirator; b. It is recommended by a physician or the responsible OSHA Manager(s) that an employee be re -evaluated; c. An employee is due for periodic evaluation in accordance wi th PER 04 -00-005. 18-85 d. Changes in workplace conditions place an added physical burden on the employee, e.g. the need to wear SCBA. 9. The responsible OSHA Manager will coordinate the administration of the applicable sections of the Respiratory Protection Program with the Director, OOM N. Fit Testing Procedures Refer to fit test procedures listed in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.134 and additional information listed in CPL 02 -02-054, Respiratory Protection Program Guidelines. Respirator Use/Limitations Respirator usage will be in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations for use, recognizing the limitations of use and training given the user. The respirators available, their application and l imitations will be listed as part of the unit's respirator program. An example of this listing appears in Appendix A. 18-86 1. No facial hair that can potentially interfere with the face -to-face piece seal will be permitted. Other conditions that may interfere wit h the seal must be recognized and evaluated on a case -by-case basis to assure that the seal is not compromised. 2. All other work wear and/or PPE must be worn in a manner that does not affect the face -to-face piece seal. 3. Each user of tight -fitting respirat ors will perform both the positive and negative pressure seal checks described in Appendix B prior to each use. 4. Canisters and cartridges will be changed out in accordance with a NIOSH approved end of service life indicator (ESLI). If there is no ESLI app ropriate for the conditions encountered at a worksite, the employee will follow a sorbent change schedule for canisters and cartridges based on reliable information or data ensuring that canisters and cartridges are changed before the end of their service life. 5. No respirator will be used if it has been impaired in any way, including broken strap, deformation of shape, or damaged valve. 6. SCBA usage is limited to those medically certified to wear them. The Health Response Team should be contacted for assis tance. Compressed breathing air must meet, at a minimum, the requirements for Grade D breathing air described in ANSI/Compressed Gas Association Commodity Specification for Air, G -7.1-1989. Any use of a SCBA must be coordinated with the Regional Administ rator. 7. OSHA employees are not permitted to enter known Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) atmosphere for inspection purposes. No OSHA employees with the exception of the HRT/SRT will be permitted to enter any environment requiring level A protection. Escape -only respirators must be carried where there is a potential for exposure to IDLH atmospheres. Procedures and Schedules for Care and Maintenance of Respirators 18-87 1. A maintenance program will be established in accordance with manufacturer's instructions for inspection, cleaning, and maintenance of respirators. Appendix B is an example of such procedures for respirator inspection, care, and maintenance. 2. OSHA employees must clean and inspect respirators to which they are assigned or use. Cleaning and inspection procedures recommende d in Appendix B -2 of 29 CFR 1910.134 or those recommended by the manufacturer (if equivalent to OSHA's procedures) must be followed. The Program Administrator will ensure adequate supple of the appropriate cleaning agents to be used. 3. Respirators will be stored so that they are protected against damage, contamination, dust, sunlight, extreme temperatures, excessive moisture, and damaging chemicals. Filtering cartridges will be stored separately from the facepieces. 4. SCBAs must be inspected monthly, mainta ined fully charged, and recharged when the tank pressure falls below 90% of the manufacturer's recommended fully charged pressure level. Repairs to regulators or warning devices must only be done by the manufacturer of the SCBA or an authorized representa tive. 5. Any respirator maintained for emergency use must be inspected monthly and records maintained of the inspection by the Program Administrator. The record must contain the information specified in CPL 02 -02-054, IX.M. Breathing Air Supply, Quality, a nd Use 1.

Cartridge color -coding and banding are not to be changed, removed or painted over. Only MSA cartridges can be used with the MSA respirator issued. Cartridge selection a s listed below is based on airborne chemical and particulate hazards. Note cartridge change out protocol at the end of this chapter. Hazard Cartridge Type Color Organic Vapors, Dust, and Mists: NOTE: Protection extended to include dusts and mists by adding Type F filters and filter covers. GMA Cartridge Type F Filters Black Cover and Side Band Organic Vapors and Acid Gases: Organic Vapors, Chlorine, Chlorine Dioxide, Hydrogen Chloride, Sulfur Dioxide GMC Cartridge Yellow Cover and Side Band Mists and Dusts: Protection extended to include dusts and mists by adding Type F filters and filter covers Type F Filter Organic Vapors: Pesticides, Chlorine, Chlorine Dioxide, Hydrogen Chloride, Sulfur Dioxide, dusts, fumes, mists, Radionuclides and Asbestos GMC -H Combination Filter/Cartridge Pink and Gold Band User will not rely on break -through properties of site chemical as an indication as to when to change out chemical cartridges. Since the cart ridges provided did not have an End of Service Life Indicator (ESLI), users will follow the protocol below for replacing cartridges. 18-91 APPENDIX B EXAMPLE, MAINTENANCE AND CARE PROCEDURES Fit Testing Procedures A. General Requirements 1. Respirator Selection For purposes of fit testing, employees will select a respirator from the following types offered. MSA Comfo Classic Half Mask APR o Small o Medium o Large MSA Ultra -Twin Full Face APR o Small o Medium o Large 2. Selection Alternative If a proper fit cannot be achieved using the selection offered, another make will be obtained. 3M Particulate Mask Air-supplying respiratory equipment 3. Practical Demonstration For the benefit of the employee(s) to be tested the following will be demonstrated prior to the selection and fit test. If needed, mirrors can be used to assist the employee in visually observing the various steps. How to put on a respirator Positioning the respirator one one's face How to set/adjust strap tension How to determine an acceptable fit Selecting the proper size is key to proper protection 4. Determining Adequacy of Respirator Fit If the employee finds the fit unacceptable, the individual will select a different respirator and be re -tested. Additional testing will be performed when changes in an employee's physical condition occur that could affect respirator fit. Chin properly placed in chin cup Adequate strap placement/tension, not overly tight Fit across nose bridge Properly sized respirator spans distance from nose to chin Tendency of respirators to slip Self-observation in mirror to evaluate fit and position 5. User Seal Checks For purposes of donning a respirator for fit testin g, each user must conduct the respirator use procedures, consisting of both the positive and negative pressure seal checks. Seal the mask on the face by moving the head from side to side and up and down slowly while taking in a few slow deep breaths. 18-92 A. Positive pressure check B. Negative Pressure Check Close off the exhalation valve with your hand while exhaling gently into the facepiece. A good fit will result in a slight positive pressure building up without leakage A poor fit results in outward leakage at one or more points along the face -to- facepiece seal. Close off both cartridge inlets with the palm of the hands. Inhale gently so the facepiece collapses slightly. Hold breath for 10 seconds. If the respirator remains in the slightly collapsed position and no inward leakage of air is detected, the tightness of the respirator is satisfactory. 6. Interference with Facepiece Seal Facial hair must not interfere wit h the face - to-face seal. Beards and beard stubble are not permitted. Sideburns and mustaches that interfere with face -to-facepiece seal must be shaved or trimmed. 7. Fit Test Exercise Regimen For Qualitative and Quantitative Fit Test: A. Prior to e ntering the test chamber, the test subject shall be given complete instruction as to his/her part in the test procedures. The regimen will be performed in its entirety for each test conducted. The respirator must be worn for a least 5 minutes prior to te sting/ B. Each test exercise will be performed for one minute with the exception of the grimace, which is 15 seconds. C. If the fit or comfort becomes unacceptable during the test, the test is voided if respirator adjustments are done during the test. Normal breathing in a standing position without talking. Deep breathing, slowly and deeply while standing. Turning head slowly side to side, hesitating at each extreme position for at least 5 seconds to inhale. Stand in place Standing in place, the subject will slowly move his or her head up and down. The head will be held at each extreme position for at least 5 seconds. Read a select passage slowly and loud enough to be heard. Grimace by smiling or frowning. (Perform only for Quantitative Test.) Bend over at the waist. If a hood is used, jogging in place can be substituted. Normal breathing. 18-93 Fit Testing Procedu res B. Qualitative Fit Test Protocol 1. General The Program Administrator will assign a qualified individual to perform fit tests and maintain the fit test equipment. Individuals performing fit tests will be knowledgeable in: Maintaining and preparing fit test equipment and solutions. Proper administration of the test protocols. Be able to recognize an invalid test. 2. Saccharine Solution Aerosol Protocol A. Taste Threshold Screening The taste threshold screening is performed without a respirator for purposes of determining the individual's ability to detect the taste of saccharine. Note: Eating or drinking something sweet before the screening may affect the ability to detect saccha rine. Individuals must wear a #M or equivalent hood during screening. The individual will breathe through their slightly open mouth exposing the tongue to the air during inhalation. A 3M nebulizer or equivalent will be used to produce the aerosol. Thres hold check Solution A must be used for this screening. Do not use Solution B. Firmly squeezes the nebulizer bulb 10 times with the nozzle inserted into the hold in the front of the hood. If the individual indicates that they have detected the sweet sacc harine taste, the screening test is completed. If the individual does not detect the sweet taste, introduce an additional 10 squeezes of aerosol into the hood. Repeat this in increments of 10 squeezes until the individual can detect the saccharine. Document on the fit test report the number of squeezes introduced into the hood. If after 30 squeezes the individual has not detected the saccharine taste, the individual is considered unable to detect saccharine and cannot be fit tested using this metho d. 2. Saccharin Solution Aerosol Protocol B. Saccharine Solution Aerosol Fit Test Procedures Individuals to be tested may not eat, drink (except water), smoke, or chew gum for 15 minutes before the test. The 3M hood enclosure is used for this test. 18-94 For use in fit testing the 3M Dust/Particulate Mask The individual to be tested will properly don the respirator. Place the hood over the individual's head. A separate nebulizer identified for fit testing, other that the one used for the screening test, will be used. The nebulizer is filled with fit test Solution B. Instruct the individual to breathe through the slightly opened mouth and report if the sweet taste of saccharine is detected. With the individual fitted in their respirator, in the hood, introduce aerosol by squeezing the nebulizer bulb 10 times. Perform the fit test exercise regimen (Section A -8) above. Replenish the aerosol concentration every 30 seconds during the exercise by squeezing the nebulizer 5 times. The individual being teste d must report any time during the test if saccharine is detected. If the taste of saccharine is detected, the test is voided and must be repeated using a different respirator. The entire protocol must be repeated. 3. Irritant Smoke (Stannic Chloride) Protocol Use for fit testing the following respirators: Half-mask respirators Full-face cartridge respirators A. General Requirement and Precautions During the test, the respirator will be equipped with high efficiency particulate (HEPA) or P100 series filters. Only stannic chloride smoke tubes will be used. Exercise caution when using an irritant. Perform tests in a well ventilated area. 18-95 B. Irritant Smoke Sensitivity Screening Check The person being tested must demonstrate their ability to detect a weak concentration of irritant smoke. The individual performing the test will advise the individual being tested that the smoke can be mildly irritating to eyes and respiratory tract. Using an aspirator bulb attached to a smoke tube, introduce a weak concentration of smoke in the direction of the individual being tested. Document on the Fit Test Report the individual's ability to detect the smoke. C. Irritant Smoke Fit Test Procedure The individual to be tested will don the respirator without assistance. Each individual will perform the required user seal tests (Reference A -6). As a precaution, individuals are to keep eyes closed. Beginning at 12 inches and then at 6 inches, the test will make 3 passes around the entire seal area, directing the smoke toward the face -seal area. At a distance of 6 inches, direct smoke around the face -seal and initiate the fit test exercise regiment ( Reference A -8). During the fit test, any detection of smoke by the individual being tested constitutes a failed test. Re-tests require that the entire protocol be repeated. Passing the fit tests without evidence of a response to the irritant smoke will require the individual to complete a second sensitivity s creening check. Fit Testing Procedures C. Quantitative Fit Test Protocol See Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.134 18-96 APPENDIX CE AND CARE A. Cleaning and Disinfecting The objective of this section is to establish procedures for effectively cleaning and disinfecting respirators in a manner that prevents damage to the respirator while protecting the user from harm. 1. Personal respirators should be cleaned with a disinfecting moist towlette after each use. 2. Routine use where heavy contamination occurs requires the respirator be cleaned according to the procedures in the right column after each use. 3. Respirators used for emergency response must be cleaned after each use, and consider use of chemical decontamination procedur es if needed. 4. Sharing of half mask and full face chemical cartridges is prohibited. 5. During respirator breakdown and reassembly, any damaged equipment must be exchanged for an entirely new device. Remove filters and cartridges. Disassemble the facepiece by disconnecting speaking diaphragms, valve assemblies and breathing hose. Make a cleaning solution by mixing water with any detergent that contains effective disinfectants (such as quaternary ammonium compounds). Head the solution to 140 -160\u00b0 F . Immerse the facepiece in the cleaning solution. Use a non -metal still bristle brush on surfaces if heaving soiled. Rinse surfaces in clean warm water and air or hand dry. Use of a towel to dry the facepiece is not recommended unless a clean, lint -free t owel is used. If only minor cleaning is required, or no water is present, use a non -alcohol based disinfecting towlette, wiping all surfaces. Reassemble the respirator, replacing all components and installing new cartridges. Perform a quick check of opera tions of the inhalation and exhalation valves. b. Respirator Storage Respirators will be stored following the manufactures' recommended guidelines, and in such a manner to protect them from the factors to the right. 1. Employees will use the drawstring storage bags issued for proper respirator storage. 2. Respirators will be stored in a such a manner to prevent deformation of the facepiece and exhalation valve. Conditions resulting in damage to the respirator: Contamination Dust Effects of sunlight (U/V rays) Temperature extremes Excessive moisture Damaging chemicals 18-97 3. Respirators must be accessible in the work area. 4. Emergency respirators must be stored in cases or cabinets and be clearly marked as to the contents and purpose. C. Respirator Inspections Regular Inspections of respiratory equipment will be conducted according to the following procedures to ensure continued reliability. 1. Routine Respirator Use MSA Half -Mask Air Purifying Respirator MSA Full Face Air Purifying Respirator NOTE: Respirators found with defective parts must not be used. Employees must immediately obtain a replacement for their defective respirator with a new device of the same make and size. 2.

Purpose This program establishes a uniform policy and guidelines for protecting OSHA employees from bloodborne pathogens and other potentially infectious materials (OPIM). II. Scope This program applies to all staff of the OSHA's Field offices. OSHA does not anticipate its employees will have occupational exp osure to blood or OPIM. III. References CPL 02 -02-077, Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan and Guidance on Post-Exposure Evaluations for Federal OSHA Personnel, dated 09/27/2010. Memorandum of Understanding Between The U.S. DOL and NCFLL, dated 10/21/2010 . IV. Exposure Control Plan Exposure Determination. OSHA does not anticipate that its employees will have occupational exposure to blood or other potential infectious materials (OPIM). OPIM is defined as: (1) The following human body fluids: semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental procedures, any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids; (2) Any unfixed tissue or organ (other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead); and (3) HIV -containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV - or HBV -containing culture medium or other solutions; and blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV. The standard defines occupational exposure as \"reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous, membrane or parental contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result from performance of the employee's duties.\" CSHOs and other field personnel conduct investigations at sites where blood and OPIM are present. However, OSHA does not reasonably anticipate that these employees' routine tasks will result in contact with blood or OPIM. Hazard Assessment CSHOs and other personnel with field duties (hereafter referred to collectively as \"field personnel\") shall take necessary precautions to avoid contact with blood and 19-101 OPIM and shall not participate in activities, nor enter areas that will require them to come into contact with blood or OPIM or with needles, instruments or surfaces that are contaminated with blood or OPIM. If field personnel believe that the investigation may result in a potential exposure to blood or OPIM, they must contact their supervisor immediately upon making this determination. The supervisor will contact the Area Dir ector who, in turn, will contact the Regional Administrator (or designee) to discuss the situation. Field personnel will not enter an area where potential exposure to blood or OPIM could occur without prior approval from the Regional Administrator (or desi gnee). In those exceptional circumstances where an exposure incident does occur as part of an investigation (e.g. a CSHO inadvertently handles items that have become contaminated with blood or OPIM), the employee shall immediately decontaminate the affecte d area following the procedures in section V.A.1., and then contact a supervisor to discuss the situation and how to obtain the post-exposure evaluation. Methods of Implementation and Control 19-102 1. Universal Precautions and Work Practices. Field personnel should consider all blood and OPIM to be infectious for HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens. Under circumstances where differentiation of body fluid types is difficult or impossible, all body fluids should be considered to be potentially infectious material s. Field personnel are not to handle or touch objects that are contaminated, as defined by 29 CFR 1910.1030(b). They shall not reach into or otherwise place any parts of their bodies into the trash can or laundry bag where regulated waste or contaminated laundry as defined by 29 CFR 1910.1030(b) may be present. 2. Bloodborne Pathogen Training. OSHA field personnel will be given bloodborne pathogen training at the time of initial assignment to field duties and annually on the elements included on 29 CFR 1910. 1030(g)(2) except for 1910.1030(g)(2)(vii)(I). The training required by 1910.1030(g)(2)(vii)(I) on the hepatitis B vaccine need only include information on its efficacy, safety, method of administration and the benefits of being vaccinated. The trainer must be familiar with the Bloodborne pathogens standard. The Regional Administrator and Area Directors who supervise employees with field duties are responsible for ensuring that this training is provided. 3. Voluntary Hepatitis B Vaccination. Firm management co mmitment to avoid contact with blood and other potentially infectious materials is the primary control method to prevent exposing field personnel to Hepatitis B and other bloodborne pathogens. In addition, Hepatitis B immunization is a safe and effective way to prevent Hepatitis B infection and its serious consequences. OSHA will provide interested field personnel with Hepatitis B immunization, on a voluntary basis, for health promotion and preventive care in accordance with the Memorandum of Understandin g between OSHA and NCFLL dated October 21, 2010. Hepatitis B vaccination is available to Department of Labor (DOL) employees through the DOL national health services agreement with Federal Occupational Health (FOH). Employees are encouraged to seek thei r physician or other qualified health care provider's advice for any questions regarding their medical condition(s) and also review the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Hepatitis B Vaccination Information Statement before requesting the vaccination. 19-103 Employ ees interested in receiving Hepatitis B vaccination should contact their local FOH unit. It is important to make arrangements before arriving for an appointment since most FOH units do not keep Hepatitis B vaccine in stock. To get the Hepatitis B vaccina tion, employees must present their valid DOL Identification Badge at the FOH unit. After the first Hepatitis B vaccination is given, the FOH unit will inform employees when to schedule appointments for the second and third injections to complete the vacci ne series. Alternatively, interested OSHA personnel that are covered by OSHA's Field SHMS (e. g. in the NCFLL bargaining unit) but do not have an FOH unit in their local area may contact their Regional Office of Administrative Programs to learn how to obtai n the vaccine from a local private healthcare provider. Not all healthcare providers offer Hepatitis B vaccinations and accept credit card payments. The Regional Office of Administrative Programs can arrange with the private healthcare provider's office t o pay for the three injections necessary to complete the Hepatitis B vaccination using the Regional Office's credit card. For additional information about the Hepatitis B Vaccination please see the Center for Disease Control Guidance at: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis -statements/hep -b.html 4. Post-exposure Evaluation and Follow -up. OSHA shall provide post -exposure evaluation and follow -up, and post -exposure prophylaxis whe n medically indicated to any employee who suffers an exposure incident as defined by 29 CFR 1910.1030(b), while performing work assignments. All medical evaluations and procedures are to be made available at no cost to OSHA personnel at a reasonable time a nd place, and under the other conditions set forth in 29 CFR 1910.1030(f). Post -exposure evaluation and follow -up will be offered by OSHA to employees who experience an exposure to blood or OPIM (as defined in 29 CFR 1910.1030) while on duty when acting as a Good Samaritan to others who have sustained a laceration, a nosebleed, or similar incidents. 5. Recordkeeping: Training Records. Training records are to contain all information specified on 29 CFR 1910.1030(h)(2) and will be maintained for 3 years from the date on which the training occurred. Training records will be held by the office at which training took place. V. Procedures for Unforeseen Contact with Blood or Other Potentially Infectious Material (OPIM) Work Practice Controls 19-104 1. Intact skin contact with b lood or OPIM Employees are to wash their hands and any other affected skin with soap and water immediately or as soon as feasible if there has been skin contact with blood or OPIM. As soon as possible, the employee must notify his/her supervisor regardi ng the exposure. If the OSHA employee and supervisor are not able to determine the exposure was definitely not an exposure incident (e.g. the employee has an open wound, chapped hands), the supervisor should immediately contact the Regional Administrator o r their designee. The Regional Administrator or their designee will then contact the Director of the Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing (OOM N) within 30 minutes to determine if post -exposure evaluation is warranted. Each Region and Office will de velop procedures for notification and payment during and after business hours. Antiseptic towelettes will be provided by the Regional Offices to field personnel. These towelettes are to be carried on all inspections, in the event soap and running water may not be immediately available, and used in the unlikely event that contact of a ny skin surface with blood or other potentially infectious material occurs. Whenever antiseptic towelettes are used, hands or other skin surfaces are to be washed as soon as feasible with soap and running water. Used antiseptic towelettes should be dispo sed of as non -regulated trash except in a very rare circumstance where they become contaminated to the extent (see 1910.1030(b)) that they would be considered regulated waste. 2. Contaminated equipment In the event that equipment becomes contaminated with blo od or OPIM, the employee shall immediately contact a supervisor to review how to proceed in this situation. Gloves and/or other appropriate barriers shall be used if contaminated equipment must be handled or transported to the nearest Regional/Area Office or other OSHA facility. Prior to transport, a biohazard label is to be attached to any contaminated equipment and is to state which parts are or remain contaminated. If the biohazard label on the equipment is not visible through the bag (e.g. bag is not tr ansparent), another biohazard label should be attached to the bag's exterior. The equipment shall be examined at the nearest Regional/Area Office or other OSHA facility (e.g. Salt Lake Technical Center) prior to servicing or shipping and decontaminated (e .g. wiped with a bleach solution or other disinfectant, as determined by the Office Director) as necessary. The ARA for Enforcement Programs or the on -site Area Director will determine how and if the equipment can be decontaminated at the Office level. Contaminated items are not to be placed or stored in areas where food is kept, and decontamination should be accomplished as soon as possible 19-105 following the inspection or incident where contamination occurred. Decontamination is not to take place in any area w here food or drink is consumed. Cloths used to wipe contaminated equipment can be discarded as non-regulated refuse unless they somehow become contaminated to the extent that they would be considered regulated waste as defined in 29 CFR 1910.1030(b). The employee who is shipping equipment that remains contaminated shall notify the receiving servicing center or manufacturer that contaminated equipment is being sent so that the receiving facility can take proper precautions. In addition, this employee should contact the package delivery company regarding appropriate packaging of the item(s). Personal Protective Equipment Field personnel are expected to avoid contact with blood and OPIM as well as contact with surfaces and items contaminated with such material s. In the unlikely event that equipment becomes contaminated, OSHA will provide appropriate gloves of proper size (see Appendix B). Field personnel will carry these gloves on inspections. Gloves are to be replaced as soon as practical if they become contam inated or as soon as feasible if they are torn, punctured or whenever their ability to function as a barrier appears to be compromised. These gloves are not to be washed or decontaminated for reuse. Field personnel are to determine the extent of contamina tion of gloves prior to their removal. It is unlikely that gloves worn by field personnel would be contaminated to the extent that they would be considered regulated waste, but if this should occur, the gloves are to be discarded in a regulated waste conta iner at the inspection site. In a facility not in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.1030 regarding regulated waste, see section 4.0.C. It is anticipated that field personnel will not need personal protective equipment (PPE) other than gloves. It is expected that field personnel will avoid situations in which any other PPE would be needed. Regulated Waste OSHA does not anticipate that the duties of OSHA employees will generate regulated waste. Post-exposure Evaluation and Follow -up OSHA shall provide post -exposure evaluation, follow -up and post -exposure prophylaxis, when medically indicated, to any employee who suffers an exposure incident while performing their work assignments. All medical evaluations and procedures are to be made available at no cost to OSHA per sonnel, at a reasonable time and place, and under the other conditions set forth in 29 CFR 1910.1030(f). 19-106 1. Handling an Exposure Incident In the unlikely event of an exposure incident (as defined in 29 CFR 1910.1030(b)), the OSHA employee is to immediately, o r as soon as feasible, wash the affected skin with soap and water and flush any affected mucous membranes with water. The employee should then seek medical attention. A bloodborne pathogens exposure incident is an event for which immediate attention must b e sought because the effectiveness of post -exposure prophylaxis is dependent on prompt administration (i.e., within hours of the exposure incident). An employee who has had an exposure incident is to report the incident to his or her supervisor as soon as possible. The Area Director/Office Director or designee shall instruct the employee to seek medical attention from a healthcare provider capable of performing a post-exposure evaluation, and, if indicated, able to provide the hepatitis B vaccination series , baseline testing for hepatitis B and C and HIV, prophylaxis for hepatitis and HIV, and any future testing or prophylaxis as recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service. Ideally, this evaluation will be performed by a healthcare provider with whom an ar rangement has been pre-established. If the employee is in the field and far from a pre -established healthcare provider, the supervisor shall instruct the employee to go to the nearest emergency room in the area. Another healthcare provider, such as an occu pational medicine clinic, may be used if it can be determined that the provider is capable of giving the necessary evaluation, treatment and prophylaxis without undue delay. Not all healthcare providers are familiar with the U.S. Public Health Service Guid elines or keep hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) or medications for HIV post -exposure prophylaxis onsite. Hospital emergency rooms are more likely than other healthcare providers to be capable of providing a post -exposure evaluation and are more likely to have Hepatitis B vaccine, Hepatitis B Immune globulin and HIV post -exposure prophylaxis medications readily available. Please note that the Federal Occupational Health centers do not offer post - exposure evaluation. The supervisor wi ll inform the Area Director/Office Director or designee who will contact the facility where the exposure incident occurred. The area Director/Office Director or designee is to work together with the facility, with the assistance of the director of OOM N if needed, to ascertain the source individual, and communicate that information to the healthcare facility evaluating the OSHA employee. The Area Director must also contact the ARA -AP and the Regional Administrator to inform them of the incident. 19-107 Following a n exposure incident, an Exposure Incident Report (see Appendix A) will be completed by the OSHA employee in consultation with the supervisor without delay. The report is to be given by the employee to the evaluating healthcare provider. Report information will include (a) a description of the exposed employee's duties as related to the exposure incident; and (b) documentation of route(s) of exposure and circumstances under which exposure occurred. (The supervisor may need to complete and send this form by f acsimile to the evaluating healthcare facility if the employee does not have the form with him or her in the field. This will help to assure timely sharing of information and allows the employee to travel directly from the field to the healthcare facility, avoiding a delay in obtaining the post -exposure evaluation. 2. Information Provided to the Evaluating Healthcare Provider In accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1030, the supervisor will see that the health care facility that is performing the employee's post -exposu re evaluation is provided with a copy of 29 CFR 1910.1030 and the other materials for the Evaluating Healthcare Provider included in Appendix A of this program. These materials may be hand -carried by the employee and/or supervisor or sent by facsimile. Alt ernately, supervisors may require employees to carry these materials with them when they are in the field. The instructions for the healthcare provider describe the applicable requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1030(f) and instruct the healthcare provider to give a written opinion to the employee. The supervisor must obtain the written opinion from the employee when the employee returns to the duty station. The written opinion will be maintained at the employee's assigned duty station. While at the evaluating healthcare facility, the employee should ask to sign a medical records release form requesting that the healthcare provider send a copy of the medical record of the evaluation to the OSHA's Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing . This medical document ation will become a part of the employee's confidential employee medical record maintained in the Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing . Communication of Hazard to Employees Labels and Bags OSHA will provide biohazard labels to be affixed to bags con taining any contaminated equipment until they can be returned to an OSHA office or shipped to another facility. Biohazard labels are to be carried by all field personnel. OSHA will provide appropriate bags for containment of any regulated waste or contamin ated equipment. Bags are to be carried by all field personnel. In addition, a bag and biohazard labels will be provided in any First -Aid kit. Bags will be disposed of as 19-108 ordinary refuse except in the rare instance in which they are contaminated to the extent that they are considered regulated waste as defined by the standard. In such case, see Section 4.0.C. of this program. Recordkeeping: Post -Exposure Records 1. Employee Medical Records Employee medical records are to be maintained by the Office of Occupati onal Medicine as part of the medical files of the CSHO Medical Examination Program. Such records are maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1020 . 2. Transfer of Record s OSHA will comply with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1020(h) involving any transfer of records. Exposure incident records will remain at the office where the employee was assigned when the incident occurred, with a copy sent to the Office of Occupationa l Medicine. The employee may request and receive a copy of such records when transferring to another assignment. VI. Procedures for Evaluating an Exposure Incident The Area Director, or a designee from the Area Office or the Office Director to whom the affecte d employee is assigned, will evaluate the circumstances surrounding any exposure incident. The evaluation should consist of at least: A review of the Exposure Incident Report completed by the OSHA employee; Documentation regarding a plan to reduce the like lihood of a future similar exposure incident; and Notification of the Office of Occupational Medicine and discussion of any similar incidents and planned precautions. Management will ensure that employee medical records and all other personally identifiabl e information is afforded all safeguards in accordance with the applicable provisions of DLMS -5 Chapter 200 \"The Privacy Act of 1974 and Invasion of Privacy\" and DLMS -9 Chapter 1200 Safeguarding Sensitive Data Including Personally identifiable Information. Such reports will be maintained at the employee's assigned duty station, and copies are to be sent to the Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing (OOM N) and to the Regional Administrator. OOM N will review these reports on a periodic basis so that this information can be considered when reviewing and updating this Plan. 19-109 VII. Responsibilities Offices Office directors will: 1. Ensure that employees are trained and that training records are maintained in accordance with section III, paragraph A.4.5. 2. Determine how and if contaminated equipment can be decontaminated at the office level. 3. Provide gloves and other supplies (e.g. bags) to field personnel. 4. Arrange for appropriate disposal of regulated waste if an employee is unable to properly dispose of it on-site and is therefore obligated to bring it back to the office for disposal. 5. Instruct employees to obtain post -exposure evaluation and locate an appropriate healthcare facility for the evaluation in the event that an exposure incident occurs. 6. Work with the employee to complete an exposure incident report in the event of an exposure incident. 7. Ensure that the healthcare provider for any exposure incident is provided with a copy of 29 CFR 1910.1030 and the other materials in Appendix A of this Instruction. 8. Obtain a written report completed by the healthcare provider who performs a post-exposure evaluation on an employee. 9. Evaluate the Exposure Incident Report and other reports and send copies of these reports to OOM N and the Regional Administrator. 10. Immediate ly notify the Regional Administrator, or designee, and the ARA - AP of any exposure incident that occurs to an employee. 11. Immediately notify the Regional Administrator when an employee reports that an on -site investigation could result in a potential exposure to blood or OPIM. Employees Employees will: 19-110 1. Notify their supervisor immediately if they believe that an investigation could result in potential exposure to blood or OPIM, and wait for approval prior to entering any area where an exposure could occur. 2. Not handle or touch contaminated objects. 3. Take appropriate action if an occupational exposure occurs or if equipment becomes contaminated. 4. Contact the supervisor immediately if an exposure incident occurs. 5. Work with the supervisor as soon as possible, if an e xposure incident occurs, to complete an Exposure Incident Report. 6. Bring a copy of the healthcare provider's written report back to the supervisor after any post -exposure evaluation for an exposure incident. 19-111 APPENDIX A MATERIALS FOR THE EV ALUATING HEALTHCARE PROVIDER This OSHA employee may have suffered an exposure incident as defined in the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens standard and has presented to your facility for a post -exposure evaluation in accordance with the standard.

Purpose The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance on the protection of OSHA employees from the effect of occupational exposure to ionizing and non -ionizing radiation. 21-120 II. Scope To the extent feasible, OSHA employees must avoid exposure to radiation hazards. In situations where exposure cannot be avoided, the guidelines described herein must be followed. Potential exposures will be eval uated by actual monitoring or through the use of other data such as employer -provided measurements. III. Definitions Ionizing Radiation. Electromagnetic radiation and/or electrically charged or neutral particles which will interact with gases, liquids, or soli ds to produce ions. Examples include x -rays, gamma rays, protons, neutrons, and alpha particles. Non-ionizing Radiation. Electromagnetic radiation with insufficient energy to produce ionization of atoms. Non -ionizing radiation energy usually is transfor med into heat. Examples include microwaves, television and radio waves, visible light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, and laser radiation. IV. Responsibilities The responsible OSHA Manager(s) is responsible for: 1. Ensuring that OSHA employees under their s upervision follow the radiation safety guidelines included in this chapter in their respective offices. 2. Ensuring that appropriate protective devices, practices and personal protective equipment are provided and used. 3. Ensuring that the appropriate measuring devices (such as badges) are provided and used. 4. Ensuring that their employees are trained per paragraph V.B. of this chapter. All OSHA employees are responsible for: 21-121 1. Using appropriate protective methods and equipment while working in areas where potential exposure to harmful ionizing and non -ionizing radiation may occur. 2. Using prudent investigative practices to identify and determine levels of radiation at the work site in conjunction with following the site's safety procedures for minimizing exposure to r adiation. 3. Identifying site -specific safety and health procedures for protection against, or minimizing exposure to radiation, and follow those procedures. 4. Participating in required training. V. Procedures Radiation safety guidelines. The following radiation safety guidelines will be adhered to by OSHA employees when the potential for exposure to ionizing and/or non - ionizing radiation exists. 1. On site procedures a. Review the work site radiation safety program, if available, and Emergency Action or Preparedness Pl an, where applicable. b. Identify all known potential sources of radiation and assess the hazards using site -supplied data as well as measurements obtained by OSHA employees. c. If it has been determined that there are potentially harmful radiation sources, con tact the Salt Lake City Laboratory or the Cincinnati Technical Center for sampling procedures and appropriate self -monitoring equipment ( e.g. TLD badges, neutron badges, other surveying instrumentation) for determining the personal exposure levels of OSHA employees. d. Evaluate work site hazard controls for effectiveness. e. Determine the best means of minimizing exposure to the radiation hazard using source shielding and distance as the primary methods of protection. Limiting the duration of exposure will only be employed as a last resort for controlling a radiation hazard to which OSHA employees may be exposed, and even then, only with the consent of the responsible OSHA Manager(s). OSHA employees will avoid direct exposure to the \"beam\" of radiation emitted by a source. f. As Class 3b and 4 lasers can pose a serious hazard to the eyes, determine the type of eye protection to use wherever engineering 21-122 controls are not feasible or where there is a likelihood of exposure to the beam. g. Consult the Health Response Team , through the responsible OSHA Manager(s), for additional technical assistance. 2. Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) use determination a. Review the employer's radiation safety program and PPE requirements, including the PPE hazard assessment. b. Dete rmine appropriate PPE and personal monitoring needed, based on the source and type of radiation. c. Select and use appropriate PPE (shielding, equipment, work clothing) to minimize radiation exposure. If such equipment is not available at the work site or at the OSHA office, then the responsible OSHA Manager(s) will be immediately consulted before taking any action that may present further exposure to radiation. Training program. OSHA employees will be trained annually in the following. 1. The effects of radiati on exposure. 2. Types of ionizing and non -ionizing radiation. 3. Types of workers occupationally exposed to radiation. 4. Appropriate monitoring devices, control measures and PPE for radiation exposure. 5. Methods of minimizing exposure to ionizing and non -ionizing radiation. 6. Recommended safety procedures to be implemented during walkaround. Recordkeeping 1. All results of testing related to radiation exposure will be maintained by the Office of Occupational Medicine and will be available to employees upon request. 2. All training records will be maintained at the field office . 22-123 CHAPTER 22. ELECTRICAL SAFETY I. Purpose This chapter establishes the OSHA Field Safety and Health Management System (SHMS) Electrical Safety Program. The policies and procedures in this Program are intended t o set broad expectations for preventing employee injury or death from electrical hazards. OSHA expects Regions, DTSEM, and DTE to develop specific procedures that align with this Program as needed. OSHA employees may encounter equipment and circuits tha t are energized or have the potential for energization while performing expected work activities. Safe work practice guidance in this Program is based on OSHA employees' work activities and the potential for exposure to electrical hazards. This Program provides specific guidance to OSHA employees who may perform work on or near energized and deenergized electrical equipment operating at 50 or more volts. It is supplemented by Chapter 13, Control of Hazardous Energy Sources (Lockout/Tagout) and pertinent electrical safety work practices required by 29 CFR 1910.333(b ). It also describes electrical safety training requirements for all OSHA employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual. II. Scope This Electrical Safety Program applies to all OSHA employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual. III.

Definitions Arc Flash Risk Assessment (e. g. Arc Flash Hazard Analysis): An assessment that investigates a worker's potential exposure to arc flash energy. This information is used to determine appropriate safe work practices, boundaries, and personal protective equipment (PPE). Boundaries: 1. Arc Flash Boundary: When the potential for an arc flash hazard exists, an arc flash boundary is an approach limit at a distance from a prospective arc source within which a person could receive a second degree burn if an electrical arc flash were to occur. A second degree burn is possible if unprotected skin is exposed to an electric arc flash with an incident energy level above 5 J/cm2 (1.2 cal/cm2). 2. Limited Approach Boundary: An approach limit at a distance from an exposed energized electrical conductor or circuit part within which a shock hazard exists. 3. Restricted Approach Boundary: An approach limit at a distance from an exposed energized electrical conductor or circuit part within which there is an increased likelihood for electric shock, due to electrical arc -over combined with inadverten t movement. Electrical Hazard: Contact or equipment failure that could result in electric shock, flash burn, thermal burn, or arc blast injury. OSHA Qualified Person: An OSHA employee who has received the electrical safety training specified in this progra m to identify and control electrical hazards. An OSHA Qualified Person is also familiar with electrical equipment hazards and configurations. Unqualified Person: An OSHA employee who is not an OSHA Qualified Person, but who may perform work near energiz ed and deenergized electrical equipment 22-125 operating or typically operated at 50 or more volts. At a minimum, an Unqualified Person must receive training that prepares him/her to work safely, which includes being able to identify electrical hazards and maint ain appropriate safe distances. Responsible OSHA Manager: This is the Regional Administrator (RA)/Directorate Director (Director) or appointed designee (e.g., Area Director or an employee's direct supervisor) responsible for performing duties specified in this Program. V. Responsibilities Responsible OSHA Managers will: 22-126 1. Designate OSHA Qualified Person(s) that voluntarily accept and are comfortable performing assigned electrical inspection duties. The OSHA Qualified Person may withdraw from performing a speci fic electrical inspection task at any time. 2. Ensure that all employees receive appropriate training and OSHA Qualified Persons remain proficient in recognizing and avoiding electrical hazards, proper inspection methodology for electrical issues, safe field testing equipment practices, and PPE use, care and cleaning. 3. Review qualifying electrical work experience documentation that is submitted in lieu of meeting minimum training requirements for OSHA Qualified Persons and ensure that they complete courses requ ired by applicable compliance directives. 4. Maintain training records, as well as electrical field testing equipment and PPE records. 5. Provide appropriate PPE and make it available to employees (see Appendix A). 6. Provide appropriate and approved electrical testing equipment for employee use. 7. Ensure that PPE and electrical testing equipment are properly tested, calibrated, and maintained per manufacturer specifications. 8. Immediately remove defective or damaged equipment from service. 9. Provide appropriate assist ance to employees and answer any questions regarding assigned task conditions, qualifications, or proper equipment needed. 10. Ensure employee safety by requiring adherence to this Program and by performing periodic reviews. 11. Ensure that an adequate number of appropriately trained and/or experienced OSHA Qualified Persons are available for tasks at electric power generation, transmission, and distribution installations, as well as at other installations covered by 29 CFR 1910.269 . 12. Request assistance from SLTC's Health Response Team through the RA/Director for tasks that present electrical hazards, when the Region/Directorate does not have the resources to safely conduct work activities. 22-127 OSHA employees will: 1. Follow this Program's requirements, procedures, and restrictions. 2. Attend task -appropriate electrical safe work practices training. 3. Recognize and avoid electrical hazards. 4. Understand and perform assigned tasks or operation s and recognize the associated limitations and hazards. 5. Use task -appropriate PPE when necessary (see Appendix A). 6. Immediately communicate safety concerns and request appropriate assistance from the Responsible OSHA Manager(s) regarding inspection condition s, qualifications, or proper equipment required for an inspection. Note: Qualified OSHA employees who have voluntarily accepted performing tasks may voluntarily withdraw from performing a specific task at any time by notifying their manager. If necessa ry, the manager will arrange for a safe transfer of duties. VI. Procedures Electrical Safety Procedures for All OSHA Employees 22-128 1. Assess areas for electrical hazards when conducting work activities at another employer's worksite. 2. Inspect locations where a disaste r has occurred for fallen or damaged energized lines and circuits (e.g. due to fires, explosions, natural causes). Lines and circuits are considered energized until lockout/tagout is applied, or equipment is deenergized and grounded, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.147, 1910. Subpart K, 29 CFR Part 1926 Subpart V (as applicable), and OSHA SHMS Manual Chapter 13, Control of Hazardous Energy Sources.. 3. Stop work and immediately contact the Responsible OSHA Manager for direction when electrical hazards are identified and proper controls are not in place. 4. Unqualified Persons will not approach uninsulated and/or unguarded sources or open electrical panels, covers, doors, etc., until lockout/tagout is applied, or equipment is deenergized and grounded, in accordance with 29 CFR CFR Part 1926 Subpart V 29 CFR 1926.960 (as applicable), and OSHA SHMS Manual Chapter 13, Control of Hazardous Energy Sources. Approach Determination Procedures for OSHA Qualified Persons at Inspection/Investigation Worksites 1. Where the employer has made a determination and established an arc flash boundary based on an arc flash hazard analysis, the OSHA Qualified Person will discuss the employer's determinations with the Responsible OSHA Manager prior to proceeding with an inspection involving exposed energized parts. 2. If the employer has not performed arc flash hazard analyses or established arc flash boundaries, p rior to proceeding, the OSHA Qualified Person and Responsible OSHA Manager will together: i. Consult a qualified engineer to help determine the appropriate protection level for relevant arc flash hazards. OR 22-129 ii. Consult the most current NFPA 70E tables to help determine the appropriate protection level for relevant arc flash hazards. iii. Consult 29 CFR 1910.269 , Appendix E or 29 CFR 1926 Subpart V , Appendix E tables (as applicable) to help determine the appropriate protection level for relevant arc flash hazards. 3. When an OSHA Qualified Person agrees to work within the arc flash boundary, he /she will wear protective clothing and other PPE as described in Appendix A to protect all body parts inside the arc flash boundary. Note: The prohibited approach boundary was deleted from NFPA 70E because the requirement for using shock protective equipme nt typically begins at the restricted approach boundary. See Figure C.1.2.3. in NFPA 70E for a helpful diagram on Limits of Approach. As the distance between a person and exposed energized conductors or circuit parts decreases, the potential for an elect rical incident increases. Appropriate Testing Equipment Determination 1. Unqualified Persons may not take direct contact measurements from uninsulated energized parts (e. g. multi -meter). 2. All electrical testing equipment requires some level of training (e.g. on the job training) and approval for use. Some equipment requires OSHA Qualified Persons training. Responsible OSHA Managers can determine requirements for the use of specific equipment. Procedures for Common Electrical Tasks, Table 1.

Only OSHA Qualified Persons are permitted to perform such tasks as authorized by the OSHA Responsible Manager. NOTE 1: P er CPL 2 -1.38, the RA must ensure that an adequate number of appropriately trained and/or experienced OSHA Qualified Persons, and other resources, as required, are available for inspections at electric power generation, transmission, and distribution insta llations and other installations covered by \u00a7 1910.269 or Part 1926 Subpart V, as applicable. NOTE 2: Per CPL 2 -1.38, OSHA Qualified Persons may approach equipment that is properly locked or tagged out, or deenergized and grounded, in accordance with \u00a7 1910.147, \u00a7 1910.269, Part 1926 Subpart 1926 Subpart V (as applicable), and OSHA SHMS Manual Chapter 13, Control of Hazardous Energy Sources. OSHA Qualified Persons must evaluate the adequacy of safe work practices, which include the ener gy control procedures, and must not approach any machines or equipment that the employer considers deenergized if any practices are not in compliance with the referenced OSHA standards. VII. PPE for OSHA Qualified Persons When an OSHA Qualified Person agrees to work within the arc flash boundary, he/she will wear protective clothing and other PPE in accordance with Appendix A. All body parts inside the arc flash boundary will be protected. 22-131 The Responsible OSHA Manager will provide PPE for use by employees wo rking in areas where they could be exposed to electrical hazards. OSHA Qualified Persons are required to observe the following procedures for PPE use: 1. PPE use is mandatory when contact with exposed electrical sources is possible. 2. Only use PPE that is designed for the specific task. 3. Inspect and test all PPE prior to use. 4. Use a protective outer cover (leather, for example) if the work performed might damage the PPE's insulation (Voltage -Rated gloves). 5. Wear non -conductive headgear if there is electrical b urn or shock hazards from contact with exposed, energized equipment. 6. Wear eye and/or face protection any time there are flying object, flash, or electrical arc hazards posed by the potential for an electrical explosion. Note: Unqualified persons will not b e involved in tasks that require electrical PPE they are not trained to use (e.g. arc -rated apparel, arc -rated face shields, voltage - rated gloves, hot sticks). VIII. Restrictions OSHA Qualified Persons and Unqualified Persons: 1. Will not install personal protectiv e grounds on electrical equipment; and 2. Will not wear conductive clothing, other apparel such as hard hat liners and hair nets made from conductive materials, and conductive articles such as jewelry while documenting electrical hazards. If clothing does no t meet these conditions, OSHA employees will not approach an electrical hazard. OSHA Qualified Persons: 22-132 1. Will not wear conductive jewelry and clothing within a restricted approach boundary or where they present a contact hazard with exposed energized elect rical conductors or circuit parts. These include: watchbands, bracelets, rings, key chains, necklaces, metalized aprons, cloth with conductive thread, metal headgear, or metal frame glasses. 2. Will not wear clothing and other apparel such as hard hat liners and hair nets made from materials that do not meet NFPA 70E section 130.7(C) requirements regarding melting or flammability, while documenting electrical hazards. The following electrical safety rules apply to all OSHA employees: 1. Report any potential for exposure to an electrical hazard to your supervisor immediately. 2. Do not conduct any electrical repairs. 3. Do not operate equipment if you believe there is an electrical hazard. 4. Do not allow electrical equipment or components to contact water. 5. Do not use cord s or plugs that are missing the 'ground' prong. 6. Do not overload electrical receptacles (e. g. daisy chaining). 7. Do not use any electrical equipment that is not free from recognized hazards. 8. Remember that even low -voltage electricity can be physically harmful . IX. Training Minimum Training for OSHA Qualified Persons 1. Complete OSHA Training Institute (OTI) course #3090, Electrical Standards, or its equivalent and documented electrical safety training received through utility or other private sector electrical experience. Electrical education and/or work experience may be used to meet the minimum training requirements. The Responsible OSHA Manager will review documentation of previous qualifying experience. AND 22-133 2. The Responsible OSHA Manager will ensure that the OSHA Qualified Person has completed courses required per ap plicable compliance directives to safely perform assigned tasks and address associated electrical hazards. Example: In the course of inspecting electrical hazards, OSHA Qualified Persons may encounter enclosed or confined spaces during an inspection. Enc losed spaces such as vaults or substations are by definition permit -required confined spaces, and OSHA Qualified Persons must treat them as such. OSHA Qualified Persons may not enter such spaces on a routine basis. When it is essential, they must adhere to OSHA CPL 02 -00-100, Application of the Permit Required Confined Spaces Standards, 29 CFR 1910.146. 3. Retraining will occur: (1) when tasks are performed less than once per year; or (2) when the Responsible OSHA Manager (a) determines the OSHA Qualified Pe rson does not possess adequate understanding and skill to perform work safely, or (b) identifies other needs for retraining. Minimum Training for Unqualified Persons: Unqualified Persons will receive Annual SHMS Electrical Safety Awareness training and tr aining on how to identify hazards and perform work near energized and deenergized electrical equipment operating or typically operated at 50 or more volts, for example, take photographs from a distance (see Table 1: Procedures for Common Electrical Tasks). On the job training is necessary before using basic electrical tools (e.g. low voltage non -contact testers, three light circuit analyzers). Annual SHMS Electrical Safety Awareness Training: This training will cover how to recognize and avoid electrical ha zards; the requirements, restrictions, and permissions in this Program; and any specific electrical safety procedures implemented by the Region/SLTC/CTC/DTE. All employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual will receive Annual SHMS Electri cal Safety Awareness Training. OSHA Qualified Persons and Unqualified Persons will complete the Annual SHMS Electrical Safety Awareness Training as a refresher. Retraining for Unqualified Persons and other OSHA employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety a nd Health Manual who are not OSHA Qualified Persons will occur whenever the Responsible OSHA Manager determines that an employee does not possess adequate understanding and skill to work safely or identifies other needs for retraining. Training Documentati on: Written records will include the training source, training description, trained OSHA employee names, and the training dates. All training records will be maintained in the applicable OSHA Office.

PROTECTION DURING IN CIDENT INVESTIGATION I. Purpose OSHA personnel are not first responders. Normally, OSHA provides only technical assistance and information during the active stages of response and mitigation. Chemical releases, fire, explosions, collapses, and other events have an immediate and potentially long-term affect not only to the workers involved, but also to those entities responding to or investigating the incident. This includes OSHA employees. No evidence or investigati on is of such importance that OSHA employees should endanger themselves or others in the course of OSHA's work. II. Scope This procedure serves as a guideline for protecting OSHA employees during incident/accident investigations. III. Definitions Hot zone. The i ncident area at a site where there is or may be the presence of hazardous materials that can or could pose a serious hazard to an employee if it is entered without appropriate personal protective devices. Mitigation. Using any device, method, or system to lessen the hazard to an employee at an incident. Special Hazard Investigation. Investigations that include the need to utilize SCBAs or other uniquely personal protective equipment. IV. Responsibilities Responsible OSHA Manager(s) will ensure that: 1. Emp loyees responding to incidents are trained and qualified in the necessary procedures and directives. 2. Employees are familiar with this procedure. 3. There is coordination with the Region, the Health Response Team, and the National Office. The investigating employee will make sure that appropriate personal protective equipment and monitoring equipment are brought to the scene and are in proper working order. 23-136 V. Procedures When investigating an incident or accident: 1. Report to the On Scene Incident Commander, when one exists, before entering the site; 2. Determine what site assessments, if any, have been made and if any mitigation has taken place; 3. In conjunction with the Incident Command System, identify \"hot\" zones th at may be present; 4. DO NOT enter any \"hot\" zone without appropriate personal protective equipment and monitors; 5. Establish evidence protocols and security with appropriate parties; 6. DO NOT under any circumstances enter or access any structure or equipment whose structural integrity or safety may have been compromised or is in question. A structural engineer must be consulted, and the area and/or equipment secured before entry or access is made; 7. Keep open communication with the Responsible OSHA Manager(s) a nd provide sufficient detail in keeping them appraised of developing situations; 8. Direct media inquiries to the Responsible OSHA Manager(s); and 9. Maintain sufficient safe distance until the \"All Clear\" is given. Assistance or Expertise 1. If assistance or ex pertise is needed, contact the Responsible OSHA Manager(s) and identify the necessity. 2. The Responsible OSHA Manager(s) will coordinate with the Assistant Regional Administrator for Enforcement Programs or equivalent unit for specific equipment and expertis e, such as the Health Response Team, structural engineers, and chemical engineers. Training All employees who could be involved in incident investigations will receive training on this chapter annually. 24-137 CHAPTER 24. EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE I. Purpose Through the Department of Labor, OSHA employees have access to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The EAP provides confidential counseling assessment and referral services. The EAP is designed to help employees deal with any personal or family problems that could interfer e with an employee's performance and/or conduct at work, including marriage, stress, finances, or job -related problems and concerns. The EAP is free, voluntary, and confidential. No penalty is imposed upon an employee for accepting or declining to parti cipate in the program. The fundamental purpose of the EAP is to enable employees to achieve their full individual potential, even when stress and problems present difficult challenges in their work environment or personal life. II. Scope This chapter applies to all federal OSHA employees. III. Definition The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provides counseling services to employees who may be experiencing personal problems that affect their job performance and well - being. The main goal of the EAP is to link a tro ubled employee with people in the community who can help that individual. The services provided by EAP are listed in the brochure describing the program and are available in each office. The EAP is confidential. If an employee refers him or herself, n o one knows but the employee and the EAP counselor. The EAP also offers consultation to supervisors to assist them in dealing with employees who may be experiencing problems. IV. Responsibilities Responsible OSHA Manager(s) 24-138 1. Maintain current knowledge and awar eness of the EAP and the process used for accessing EAP services. Seek consultation from the EAP, as appropriate, for assistance in identifying and approaching troubled employees, providing effective employee feedback, and/or referring employees to the pr ogram. 2. Encourage and support employee participation in the EAP when an employee may be experiencing personal problems and impacting the work environment. 3. Respect and safeguard the confidentiality of any information provided by the employee or counselor . 4. Recognize the potential need for EAP services where employees are involved with investigations wherein traumatic events or injuries are involved. As soon as possible after such an event, advise the affected employee(s) of the availability of EAP services . Administrative Programs or equivalent unit 1. Coordinate and provide EAP services for OSHA employees. 2. Promote awareness of EAP services among OSHA employees. 3. Disseminate information on the procedures to access EAP services to OSHA employees. Employee Voluntarily seek counseling, referral, and information from the EAP, regardless of current level of job performance, if he or she is experiencing a personal, emotional, drug abuse, or alcohol abuse problem. All information is confidential. V. Procedures For counseling assistance, any OSHA employee can contact the Employee Assistance Program at 1 -800-222-0364. An OSHA managers' concern for an employee's personal problem is relevant only if the problem causes difficulties in the work setting. 1. Individuals makin g referrals under the EAP must not attempt to delve into or diagnose an employee's problem. 2. Employees must not be coerced or forced to use the program. 3. Discussions should focus solely on job performance issues. Employees who coordinate visits to the EAP wi th Responsible OSHA Manager(s) will be considered to be on official duty while meeting with the EAP. 24-139 1. While employees must inform their supervisor and obtain permission to be away from their job assignment for an appointment, they do not have to disclose the nature of the problem for which they wish to see the counselor. 2. The Department allows an employee up to one hour (or more as necessitated by travel time) of excused absence for each counseling session during the assessment/referral phase of rehabilitat ion. 3. If the EAP makes a referral to an outside source, absences during duty hours for rehabilitation or treatment must be charged to the appropriate leave category Employees participating in the EAP through self -referral without the supervisor's knowledg e must use sick leave or annual leave for visits to the EAP during work hours. Any information or reports from the EAP counselor may only be released with written consent by the employee to individuals specifically identified by the employee, or released under a court order. In a case involving a traumatic incident, the EAP should be contacted as a resource because post -traumatic stress can be a serious problem. EAP can send a Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) Team to the office within 3 -5 days after a traumatic event occurs. The union representative can also refer an employee to the EAP. 25-140 CHAPTER 25. MEDICAL MANAGEMENT I. Purpose This chapter cancels the Compliance Safety and Health Officer (CSHO) Medical Examination Program (OSHA Instructions PER 04 -00-002 and PER 04 -00-003) and establishes the OSHA Medical Examination Program. It revises the inclusion criteria and the periodicity requirements for the mandatory Periodic Physical Examination and establishes a mandatory Interim Medical Evaluation in years i n which no Periodic Physical Examination is scheduled. II. Scope This instruction applies OSHA -wide. III. References Memorandum of Understanding between U.S. DOL and NCFLL, dated 08/21/2009. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

Federal Program C hange This chapter describes the OSHA Medical Examination Program. Although this chapter does not apply to State Plan States, State Plans are encouraged to implement a similar program for their covered employees. 25-141 VII. Significant Changes All personnel assigned to field duties in which there is reasonable anticipation of encountering physical, chemical and/or biological hazards are covered in the mandatory OSHA Medical Examination Program. Members of Regional Response Teams and Specialized Response Teams must mee t the medical qualifications of the OSHA Medical Examination Program prior to Response Team assignment and throughout the duration of that assignment. Based on the specific characteristics of the affected positions, and to be consistent with the practices of other federal agencies and accepted public health practices, medical history and physical examination will be performed during the Pre -placement Examination, then every three years until age 50, then every two years until age 65, at which time the Perio dic Physical Examination will be completed every year. Medical evaluations of covered employees will take place in the years in which the Periodic Physical Examination is not scheduled. The Interim Medical Evaluation will include audiometric testing, a r espirator questionnaire and a blood pressure determination. Additional testing, such as pulmonary function testing, may be conducted if indicated. Under this Program, chest X -rays are voluntary after the initial Pre -placement Examination unless the empl oyee has experienced an occupational exposure that triggered the medical surveillance requirements of an OSHA standard. If an exposure does trigger the requirements of a standard, the schedule for chest X -rays established by that standard will be followed . The responsibilities of the Regional Office and the covered employees are more clearly defined (see paragraph XVIII). VIII. Application Covered Positions 1. General Application. This instruction applies OSHA -wide to positions in which there is reasonable anticipation of encountering physical, chemical and/or biological hazards. This includes employees whose duties require on - site inspections, on -site evaluat ions and/or on -scene emergency response functions. The OSHA Medical Examination Program application includes, but is not limited to, the following positions: Student Trainee Safety Specialist Lead Safety & Occupational Health Specialist Safety & Occupati onal Health manager Industrial Hygienist Lead Industrial Hygienist 25-142 Safety Engineer Lead Safety Engineer Supervisory Safety Engineer Compliance Assistance Specialist Employees in these or similar job categories whose duties do NOT require on-site inspectio ns, on -site consultations and evaluations, and/or on -scene emergency response functions are NOT covered by this Medical Examination Program. 2. Response Team Members. Members of Regional Response Teams and the Specialized Response Teams must meet the minim um medical/physical requirements of this program prior to Response Team assignment and for the duration of that assignment. They are required to complete the Periodic Physical Examinations and Interim Medical Evaluations specified under this instruction. 3. Trainees. Student trainees are covered under this instruction if their tenure with the Agency is expected to exceed a one -year period from their Pre - placement Examination. Medical Evaluation 1. Mandatory Examinations. All covered employees are required to complete the Periodic Physical Examinations and Interim Medical Evaluations as specified under this instruction. 2. Voluntary Examinations. Employees whose past work assignments with the Agency required them to make regular or occasional visits to industrial establishments where they may have been exposed to potentially toxic chemicals and/or biologic or physical hazards and whose job descriptions do not now require them to go into the field are eligible for a Voluntary Physical Examination every three years. Purpose of Medical Evaluation 25-143 1. Fitness for Duty. Medical evaluations under this Program are required in order for the Agency to determine if covered employees are physically and medically capable of performing the essential duties of the position efficiently and without posing a hazard to themselves or others. 2. Complying with OSHA Standards. Multiple OSHA standards require routine medical tests in order to monitor the health of employees who are reasonably anticipated to experience exposures to potentially hazardous substances or phys ical hazards and who must be physically capable of safely utilizing personal protective equipment. Under this program, OSHA will comply with medical requirements of existing OSHA standards as they pertain to OSHA employees. IX. Background CSHO Medical Examina tion Program Prior to April 1987, OSHA did not have a standardized medical examination program for employees. Each Region developed and implemented a medical program for its respective employees and maintained authority over its operation. The contents a nd administration of these programs were subject to variation from one Region to another. In order to establish a standardized agency -wide medical examination program and to comply with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations and requirements, OSH A applied to OPM for a Single Agency Physical Examination Standard. This standard specified and justified the physical requirements that covered employees must meet as a condition of employment. The OSHA Single Agency Physical Examination Standard, appro ved by OPM in December 1985, was applicable to OSHA employees in certain job series and grades as well as to new employees hired for these positions. The CSHO Medical Examination Program began in April 1987. The program required that all employees hired to specific positions meet the physical qualification standards as determined by a Pre -placement Examination. On March 31, 1989, OSHA Instructions PER 8 -2.4 and PER 8 -2.5 were implemented for all covered employees. PER 8 -2.5 required that covered employ ees demonstrate requisite physical capabilities by participating annually in the CSHO Medical Examination Program. Since implementation of the CSHO Medical Examination Program in April 1987, OSHA has maintained an interagency agreement with the Federal Oc cupational Health (FOH) component of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) to provide the Pre - placement, Annual and Voluntary medical examinations. This arrangement has provided OSHA with a single, nationwide provider of the medical services necessary to implement this Program. Medical Evaluation Requirements of OSHA Standards 25-144 Multiple OSHA standards require periodic medical evaluations to monitor the health of employees who have reasonably anticipated exposures to physical, chemical or biological hazards. These standards apply to employees who experience an action level of exposure to the hazard addressed by the standard. The OSHA standards that require medical evaluations are summarized in Appendix B. Determination of Medical Evaluation Requirements This instruction establishes medical history and physical examination requirements based on specific characteristics of the affected positions. These requirements are consistent with the practices of other federal agencies and accepted public health practices. The medical evaluation requirements mandated by OSHA standards will continue to be applied to covered employees (Appendix B). This directive allows for flexibility and clinical judgment in determining the appropriate medical evaluation periodicity for e ach covered employee. Each employee will receive an annual examination and will receive a notification regarding the type of exam that will be performed the following year. Protecting Employee Health & Safety Though the OSHA Medical Examination Program do es change the frequency of the extensive medical questionnaire and physical examination, it provides a timely, annual occupational medicine evaluation for all covered employees. It is also aligned with current standards of occupational medicine and preven tive medicine practices that are updated from the CSHO Medical Program. Appendix C summarizes the supporting logic for changes in the program. X. Scheduling FOH Appointments Mandatory Periodic Physical Examinations are provided to all employees in covered positions (see section VIII). Physical examinations and medical evaluations will be scheduled with FOH after OOM N authorization. Examinations will be conducted during the employee's normal duty hours and will be provided free of charge to the employee. Whenever possible, appointments should be scheduled within 30 calendar days of OOM N authorization and completed within 60 calendar days. Employees shall notify their supervisors and applicable clinic personnel at least 24 hours in advance if they are unable to attend the examination at the scheduled time. XI. Definitions of Periodicity Pre-placement Examination 25-145 A medical history and physical examination is required once for all applicants prior to assignment to a covered position and for all employees prio r to transfer from a position not covered by this instruction into a covered position. Appendix D, Table 1 provides a list of the components of the Pre -placement Examination. Appendix E provides additional policy and procedural information related unique ly to Pre - placement Examinations. Periodic Physical Examination A mandatory medical history and physical examination for all covered employees (Appendix A). 1. Components. Appendix D, Table 1 provides a list of the components of the Periodic Physical Exam ination. 2. Frequency. The Periodic Physical Examination is required every three years until age 50, then every two years until age 65. After age 65 it is required annually. 3. Exceptions. The frequency of the Periodic Physical Examination, or parts of the examination, may be adjusted by the Office of Occupational Medicine based on the following factors: a. When the employee is determined to have medical conditions that warrant annual or biannual evaluations. b. When an employee exposure reaches an action level required in OSHA standards or another occupational exposure of concern. c. When a covered employee experiences a hospitalization, significant surgery, or period of medical restrictions exceeding one month since these situations may signal a need for more f requent or additional medical evaluations. d. When an employee's work assignments may require the use of a Self - Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA). In such cases, additional tests and more frequent medical evaluations may be required. e. When an employee h as incomplete past medical evaluations. All incomplete evaluations must be completed prior to eligibility for a subsequent Periodic Physical Examination. Interim Medical Evaluation A mandatory medical evaluation for covered employees. 25-146 1. Components Included. Appendix D, Table 1 provides a list of the components of the Interim Medical Evaluation. 2. Frequency. An Interim Medical Evaluation will be conducted for all covered employees in the years in which a Periodic Physical Examination is not performed. 3. Exceptions. Incomplete past medical evaluations must be completed prior to eligibility for a subsequent Interim Medical Evaluation. Voluntary Physical Examination An optional medical examination offered to employees whose past work assignments with the Agency would have required them to make visits to industrial sites where they may have been exposed to chemical, physical or biological hazards and whose current job descriptions no longer require them to perform field duties. These examinations provide continued medical surveillance for conditions with a long latency period. 1. Components Included. Appendix D, Table 1 provides a list of the components of the Voluntar y Physical Examination. 2. Frequency. A Voluntary Physical Examination can be obtained every 3 - years. 3. Scheduling. Voluntary Physical Examinations must be scheduled and completed during the fiscal year in which the exam was approved. Self-Contained Breath ing Apparatus (SCBA) Medical Clearance A mandatory medical evaluation, performed in addition to the periodic and interim evaluations, that determines an employee's ability to safely wear Self -Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA). 25-147 1. Components Included. Ap pendix D, Table 1 provides a list of the additional medical services associated with SCBA clearance. Most significantly, SCBA clearance requires a cardiac stress test for employees age 40 or older. A cardiac stress test may be required for employees age 35 or older based on cardiac risk factors. 2. Frequency. The appropriate frequency for SCBA medical clearance renewal is individualized for each employee and is determined by a reviewing physician each time the medical evaluation is performed. The frequen cy is determined by the opinion of the reviewing physician, based on the individual's health risks and the Elements of Physical Examination and Medical Evaluations listed in Table 1 for SCBA Clearance (Appendix D). Individuals over 40 years of age must hav e a physical examination at least every two years. The SCBA clearance can be performed as part of the Periodic Physical Examination or the Interim Medical Evaluation. XII. Additional Medical Information In response to a physician's report resulting from eithe r a Periodic Physical Examination or an Interim Medical Evaluation, OOM N may require additional medical information to assess an employee's medical condition(s) before determining medical fitness to perform required duties. In these situations, OOM N will notify, in writing, both the employee and the Regional Office that additional services are required. These additional tests and evaluations are considered a continuation of the scheduled examination/evaluation. Additional FOH Services Either while still at the FOH clinic or subsequently, additional tests that are part of the regular services provided by FOH may be authorized by OOM N. For example, a review of a respiratory protection questionnaire may reveal an issue that requires spirometry. Costs asso ciated with these FOH services will be covered by the National Office through the FOH agreement. Medical Specialist Opinions When a covered employee does not meet the established criteria for fitness for duty, but OOM N is unable to render a medical opinion as to detailed aspects of the employee's fitness to perform his or her job functions, the employee and the Regional Office will be informed, in writing, that a specialist's medical evaluation, limited to the area(s) of concern, is required. The employe e must comply with the written notification from OOM N in a timely manner, usually within thirty (30) calendar days of employee receipt of the notification. 25-148 1. Selection of Consulting Physician When the need for additional medical information requires the use of a medical specialist, after consultation with OOM N regarding the appropriate specialty of the physician, the employee selects a qualified physician. The consulting physician should be board certified in the area of the potentially disqualifying con dition (e.g., a cardiologist for cardiovascular conditions). The employee shall notify the Regional Office when an appointment has been scheduled. 2. Payment for Consulting Physician and/or Additional Tests Regional Offices are responsible for payment of t he cost of medical specialist opinions and associated medical tests specified by OOM N. Additional testing requested by a consulting physician must be approved by OOM N prior to authorization for payment by the Agency. OOM N will approve payment only for te sting that is necessary for determining fitness for duty. If additional tests are completed, but are NOT approved by OOM N, employees are responsible for payment. Employees should consult their administrative officers for guidance on how to arrange paymen t. 3. Medical Specialist Opinion The medical specialist's opinion will be used in reassessing the individual's medical qualifications for duty and in determining if specific tasks can be safely performed (e.g. using a negative pressure respirator, carrying 40 lbs. of equipment, driving). This medical information may be shared with FOH Reviewing Medical Officers (RMOs) or other contracted medical professionals, if needed, for future medical clearances. OOM N will notify the employee and Regional Administrat or (RA) or designee if there is any failure to meet medical requirements and will advise the RA regarding job restrictions as appropriate. Timelines When additional services are required, the employee must comply with the written notification from OOM N in a timely manner, usually within thirty (30) calendar days of employee receipt of the notification. Communication with OOM N is required to obtain an extension. If OOM N has not received pertinent additional medical information within the agreed upon tim e, notice will be sent to the RA or his/her designee so that appropriate administrative action may be taken. XIII. Incomplete Medical Examinations When components of a mandatory medical examination or any additional examination are not completed as requested, OO MN will notify the RA or designee that it is unable to render a medical opinion as to the fitness of the employee to perform his or her job 25-149 functions. The RA or his/her designee will take appropriate administrative action to ensure that OSHA medical evalu ations are completed. XIV. Accommodations NOTE: The use of the term \"accommodation\" in this directive does not refer to \"reasonable accommodation\" under the law. See DLMS -4 Chapter 306 Reasonable Accommodation for Employees and Applicants with Disabilities. Overview Upon notification that an employee does not meet one or more medical/physical requirements of his/her position, the Regional Administrator will consider an appropriate accommodation plan. The process of accommodating an employee involves job rea ssignment, job modification or job restriction. An employee's job accommodation is designed to avoid the aggravation of an existing medical condition and to avoid placing an employee in an occupational situation that is unsafe due to the presence of one o r more medical conditions. Only management may seek accommodation of employees under this program. Accommodation plans are proposed by RAs and are reviewed and concurred on by the National Office. Duty restrictions may be temporary, as in the case of a c orrectable condition, or they may be permanent. Accommodations for permanently restrictive conditions will be made on a case -by-case basis. Interim Work Restrictions In order to ensure that employees are not put at risk between the time they are found not to meet one or more medical/physical requirements of their positions and final accommodation, Regional Administrators shall consult with OOM N and put in place, within 10 working days of notification by OOM N, temporary working restriction(s) limiting work assignments and/or working conditions until accommodations are finalized. Regional/OO NM Consultation The affected employee's supervisor, Area Director, and/or RA shall confer with the OOM N physicians to determine what restrictions or limitations should be placed on an individual employee. This will ensure that restrictions and limitations are pertinent to currently assigned duties and potential future duties. Request for Accommodation The accommodation plan shall include the specific details describing how the employee will be accommodated (i.e., job restriction or job reassignment). The final terms of the accommodation plan proposals will be made by the RA. The RA shall forward the proposed accommodation plan to OOM N. Medical Review 25-150 A physician in OOM N shall review the request to ensure that the terms of the accommodation plan are medically appropriate. Coordination of Accommodation Plan OOM N will coordinate review and concurrence of the accommodation plan with OSHA's Human Resource Office, the Office of the Assistant Secretary, and the Director of Technical Support and Emergency Management. The purpose of the National Office review is to ens ure national consistency of application. Accommodation requests will generally be reviewed on a monthly or bimonthly basis. OOM N will notify Regional Administrators when their accommodation plans are scheduled for review. In order to expedite resolution of issues, Regional Administrators or their designees will be invited to join the meeting Limited Duty This program does not change procedures that Area Offices are presently using to provide limited duty for an employee with a temporary condition such as a broken leg or pregnancy. If an adverse medical condition is correctable (e. g. hernia or high blood pressure), OSHA may require medical attention for that condition and establish a reasonable deadline by which time the condition must be corrected or con trolled, in order to meet medical requirements. XV. Worker' Compensation and Other Employee Benefits None of the policies or procedures in this instruction affects existing employee options or benefits for disability retirement, Workers' Compensation, and/or a ny other employment benefit programs. XVI.

Directing requests for medical records to the appropriate organization as defined in paragraph XVI of this instruction. 25-158 APPENDIX A OSHA MEDICAL EXAMINA TION PROGRAM: SINGLE AGENCY QUALIFICATIO N STANDARD I. Purpose. OSHA personnel conduct on -site inspections, on -site evaluations and/or on -scene emergency response functions at industrial establishments to observe and evaluate conditions to which employees are exposed. During these inspections, OSHA employees may be exposed to potent ially hazardous situations and substances. The application of a single medical requirements standard to all affected employees ensures that the health of OSHA employees will be at a level that permits them to perform job -related assignments safely, effecti vely, and without hazard to themselves or others. II. Rationale for the Necessity of Physical Requirements. The following is a general description of the physical requirements of the positions affected by the OSHA Medical Examination Program. The duties o f these positions require employees to perform under conditions that vary from sedentary to maximum exertion. Normal working conditions also require the employee to perform in a reliable manner under adverse conditions. Employees examine and report on pote ntially hazardous worksite conditions. This may include working at heights, underground, in confined spaces, in poorly lighted facilities, in emergency situations, and work in environments with chemical, physical, and biological hazards which are regulated by the OSH Act. Many of the hazards that OSHA employees may face are regulated by established OSHA standards which require the use of personal protective equipment and/or routine medical monitoring. The proper use of personal protective equipment require s an evaluation of the wearer's ability to utilize the equipment safely and without adverse effect to the wearer's health. Adverse conditions sometimes occur unexpectedly, while others are anticipated and appropriate steps can be taken in an orderly and co ntrolled manner to protect oneself and safely leave the hazard area. III. Medical Examinations. Before assuming duty and routinely during employment, applicants and employees in affected positions must undergo a medical examination and be physically and medica lly capable of performing the essential duties of the position efficiently and without hazard to themselves or others. Routine medical evaluations serve to monitor the employee's health status to ensure that he or she maintains physical capabilities to me et the qualifications of his/her position. In addition, routine medical surveillance uncovers conditions which may 25-159 develop as a result of occupational exposures which have long latency periods for symptom development. Failure to meet the physical and medi cal requirements of Pre -placement Examinations will be considered to disqualify an employee for a covered position. Failure to meet the physical and medical requirements of Periodic Physical Examinations will be considered disqualifying, except when there is sufficient evidence that individuals can perform the essential functions of the job efficiently and without risk to themselves or others, with or without appropriate accommodation. IV. Medical Examination Parameters. Vision. 1. Physical Requirement. Dis tant visual acuity must be at least 20/40 in each eye separately, with or without corrective lenses. Distant binocular acuity must be at least 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. Near visual acuity must be at least 20/40 in each eye separately, with o r without corrective lenses. Near binocular acuity must be at least 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. Field of vision must be 85 degrees in the horizontal meridian in each eye. The ability to distinguish the colors red, amber, and green is required for the Pre -placement examination. 2. Work Activity. Routinely assigned to areas where: the reading of comprehensive literature is necessary; both near and far visual acuity are necessary for hazard recognition; potentially life - threatening environments exist (therefore, accurate reading of personal protective equipment labeling is required); color coded warning signs represent hazardous conditions; routine utilization of finely calibrated equipment. 3. Rationale. OSHA employees inspect workplaces where potential safety and health hazards exist or can spontaneously occur. Once these hazards occur, inspection personnel must be capable of determining what actions are appropriate in order to safeguard the sa fety and health of themselves and others. These actions will always require both near and far visual acuity. For example, employees may need to quickly ascertain the condition of a respirator for use in the case of an emergency egress situation. (This requ ires reading finely calibrated air gauges.) While making routine inspections, a compliance officer may encounter situations where full field of vision will be necessary in order to avoid a serious accident. For example, while working on high scaffolding, i t may be necessary to rapidly descend. Normal field of vision is necessary to perform this activity safely. Hearing. 25-160 1. Requirement. Average hearing loss in the better ear cannot be greater than 40 decibels at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz, with or without a hearing aid. 2. Work Activity. Covered employees are routinely assigned to areas where a broad spectrum of physical hazards exists, including environmental noise levels above 90 decibels. 3. Rationale. It is important that a covered employee maintain adequ ate auditory acuity to communicate and give instructions in a noisy environment. During the course of daily activities, it is important for employees to hear instructions and communications in order to ensure safety. A greater than 40 decibel loss of audit ory acuity in the speech frequencies in the better ear may interfere with the employee's ability to communicate under noisy conditions. Musculoskeletal. 1. Requirement. Employees must have: The functional use of both hands, arms, legs, and feet; No impair ment of the use of a leg, a foot, an arm, a hand, the fingers, back or neck which would most likely interfere with the functional requirements of this position; No established medical history or clinical diagnosis of rheumatic, arthritic, orthopedic, muscu lar, neuromuscular, or vascular disease which would interfere with the ability to perform the functional requirements of this position. 2. Work Activity. A covered employee is required to perform moderate lifting, carrying, walking and standing. A covered e mployee will routinely be required to ascend or descend heights in order to safely egress from a potentially hazardous area. During routine activities, a covered employee must carry portable scientific equipment. 3. Rationale. It is imperative that a covered employee have no impairment of the hands, arms, legs, feet, back or neck which would prevent performing the functional requirements of moderate lifting, carrying, reaching above the shoulder, standing, walking and climbing. An established medical history of arthritis or muscular pathology that would interfere with these functional requirements could cause a potentially hazardous situation in the workplace. Cardiopulmonary. 25-161 1. Requirement. No current clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction, angina pectori s, coronary insufficiency, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, or any other cardiovascular or cardiopulmonary disease that would likely cause syncope, dyspnea, collapse, or cardiac failure. No established medical history or clinical diagnosis of cardiac or respi ratory dysfunction likely to interfere with the ability to wear a respirator. 2. Work Activity. A covered employee will routinely be required to: perform moderate lifting, carrying, walking and standing; ascend or descend heights in order to safely egress f rom a potentially hazardous area; wear a negative pressure air -purifying respirator; operate a motor vehicle, including a 4 - wheel drive vehicle. 3. Rationale. Since covered employees may need to rapidly egress from heights or depths, it is imperative that no established medical history of significant cardiac or pulmonary disease exists. It is known that carrying heavy equipment while ascending or descending great heights places an excess burden on the cardio -pulmonary system. Therefore, it is imperative that the cardio -vascular system be without significant pathology. Since a covered employee is required to wear a negative pressure respirator, it is imperative and required by OSHA standard 1910.134 that a physician medically qualifies the employee to wear suc h a respirator. It is known that pre -existing cardiac or respiratory disease can prevent an individual from wearing such a respirator. General Medical. 25-162 1. Requirement. No diagnosis of a medical condition that is likely to cause significantly impaired perform ance or sudden incapacitation, e.g. uncontrolled seizures, use of prescription medication that causes significant sedation, or other significant impairment. When the consensus expert opinion in OOM N determines that, for a given individual, the sedative pro perties of that employee's required medication poses an unacceptable risk, the employee will not receive full medical clearance. Appropriate job restrictions will be considered. This does not apply to use of over -the-counter medications. 2. Work Activity. C overed employees work in locations with known physical, chemical and biological hazards. Covered employees often work alone in isolated locations, may be required to work at heights, and often drive for long periods of time in the course of their duties. 3. Rationale. Covered employees must work in an environment where sudden incapacitation might endanger themselves or others. Therefore, covered employees must be free of known medical conditions that are anticipated to cause significantly impaired performance or sudden incapacitation. 25-163 APPENDIX B MEDICAL EVALUATION R EQUIREMENTS OF OSHA STANDARDS Certain OSHA standards have medical surveillance requirements at prescribed intervals. For example, the Occupational Hearing Conservation standard (29 CFR 1010.95) requires an annual audiogram for employees who experience occupational noise exposure at or above the action level of an 8 -hour time -weighted average of 85 decibels. For most hazard exposures for which the standard requires periodic medical surveillance, medical surveillance is required on an annual basis and thus will exceed the standard frequency of the Periodic OSHA medical examinations which occurs at three -year intervals. Following are brief summaries of the medical surveillance/medical monitoring requirements for each standard, as they might pertain to the duties of OSHA covered employees. These summaries do not include specific details from the standards such as on which organ systems the physician or licensed healthcare provider must focus when o btaining the medical histories or performing the physical examinations. ________________________________________________________________________ Acrylonitrile 29 CFR 1910.1045: For exposures to acrylonitrile at or above the action level of 1 ppm as an 8 -hour time -weighted average, this standard mandates a medical and work history and a complete physical examination, a 14 x 17 inch postero -anterior chest radiograph and a fecal occult blood test for employees 40 years of age or older at the time of the work assignment and at least annually thereafter if the exposure continues. The standard denotes organ systems and non -specific symptoms to which particular attention is to be paid during the taking of the histories and performance of the physical examination. Asbestos (Construction and Shipyards) 29 CFR 1926.1101(m) and 29 CFR 1915.1101(m): These standards require a medical and work history, physical examination, pulmonary function test at least annually for exposures at or above the Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for 30 or more days a year or exposed above the Excursion Limit. Asbestos (General Industry) 29 CFR 1910.1001: When exposed at or above the PEL or above the Excursion Limit, the employee is required to complete a standardized questionnaire (from Appendix D of the standard) and have a physical examination annually. A postero - anterior view chest radiograph of 14 X 17 inches is to be done based on length of employment and age of the employee. This film is to be read by a B -reader. Benzene (General Ind ustry, Construction and Shipyards, respectively) 29 CFR 1910.1028, 29 CFR 1926.1129, 29 CFR 1015.1028: For employees exposed at or above the action level for 30 or more days per year or at or above the PEL for 10 or more days per year, these standards requ ire initial and annual medical and work histories and physical examinations and a complete blood count with differential and quantitative platelet count. Employees who must wear respirators 30 or more days per year are required to have a pulmonary functio n test at least every 3 years under these standards. 25-164 1,3-Butadiene 29 CFR 1910.1051: Employees exposed at or above the action level for 30 or more days per year or at or above the PEL on 10 or more days per year or at or above the Short -term Exposure Limit (STEL) on 10 or more days per year should have an annual health questionnaire (from Appendix C of the standard or its equivalent), an annual complete blood count with differential and platelet count, and a physical examination at least every 3 years. The physical examination should be done more often if advised by the physician or other licensed healthcare professional (PLHC) who reviews the questionnaire and the results from the blood test. Cadmium (General Industry, Construction, Shipyards and Agricultu re, respectively) 29 CFR 1910.1027, 1915.1027 and 29 CFR 1928.1027: Employees who experience exposure to Cadmium at or above the action level for 30 or more days during any 12 consecutive months should have medical surveillance pro vided at the intervals required under the standards. Surveillance includes initial and periodic medical and work histories and examinations, chest radiographs, pulmonary function tests, blood tests, urinalysis and biological monitoring tests which include urine test for cadmium and Beta-2 microglobulin and a blood test for cadmium. The first periodic medical surveillance shall be provided within one year after the initial examination and then , at a minimum, biennially. Carcinogens 29 CFR 1910.1003, 29 CFR 1926.1103, 1915.1003: This group of standards for general industry, construction and shipyards, respectively, require an annual medical and work history and physical examination for employees who must enter, as part of their assigned work, regulated areas at worksites where any of the 13 chemicals identified as carcinogens are manufactured, processed, repackaged, released, handled or stored. Chromium (VI) (General Industry, Construction and Shipyards, respectively): 29 CFR 1910.1026, 29 CFR 1926.1126, 29 C FR 1915.1026: These standards require initial and annual medical history and physical examination for employees with exposure at or above the action level for 30 or more days per year. Coke Oven Emissions 29 CFR 1910.1029: For employees who are in the regu lated area for at least 30 days per year, the employer shall provide initial and annual medical and work histories, a postero -anterior view chest radiograph, a pulmonary function test, weight, physical examination of the skin, a urinalysis and urine cytolo gy test. Compressed Air 29 CFR 1926.803: Medical surveillance requirements for this standard were not included in this summation because it is unlikely that OSHA covered employees will enter a compressed air environment. Cotton Dust 29 CFR 1910.1043: This standard requires annual medical surveillance for employees exposed above the action levels set for cotton dust. Biennial surveillance is required for those employees exposed below the action levels. The surveillance consists of a medical history plus a questionnaire from Appendix B of the standard and pulmonary function testing. Surveillance frequency is increased to every six months for employees with specific pulmonary function test findings described in the standard. 25-165 1,2-Dibromo -3-chloropropane (DBCP ) (General 29 CFR 1926.1144, 29 CFR 1915.1044: initial and annual medical and work histories, physical examination, blood serum test for FSH, LH, total serum estrogen (in female employees) and a sperm count (in male employees) are required for employees who work in regulated areas with occupational exposure to DBCP.

Lead (General Industry and Shipyards) 29 CFR 1910.1025, 29 CFR 1915.1025: These st andards require medical surveillance for employees exposed above the action level for more than 30 days per year. The minimum requirements, if the blood lead level is less than 40 \u00b5g/100 g, include: ZPP and blood lead levels every six months, initial and annual medical and work history, physical examination, the aforementioned blood tests plus a hemoglobin and hematocrit, red blood cell indices, a peripheral blood smear with analysis of morphology, BUN, creatinine, urinalysis with microscopic examination. Lead (Construction) 29 CFR 1926.62: This standard requires an initial ZPP and blood lead level for any employee who will be exposed on any day to lead at or above the action level. It also requires medical surveillance for employees exposed at or above the action level for more than 30 days in any consecutive 12 months. The minimum medical surveillance consists of an annual medical and work history; physical examination plus tests including the blood lead level and ZPP; a hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood c ell indices; analysis of a peripheral blood smear for morphology; BUN, creatinine, and urinalysis with microscopic examination. The blood lead level and ZPP are to be repeated every 2 25-166 months for the first six months and then every 6 months if the blood l ead level remains below 40 \u00b5g/dl. For employees whose blood lead levels are at or above 40 \u00b5g/dl, the frequency of required tests is stated in the standard. Methylene Chloride (General Industry and Construction) 29 CFR 1910.1052, 29 CFR 1926.1152: Periodic medical surveillance is required for employees with exposures at or above the action level on 30 or more days per year or above the PEL on 10 or more days per year or above t he STEL on 10 or more days per year or through employee request after a physician finds health conditions for which methylene chloride exposure puts the employee at increased risk.

Respiratory Protection (General Industry and Construction) 29 CFR 1910.134, 29 CFR 1926.103: These standards require administration and evaluation of a mandatory medical questionnaire prior to fit testing or respirator use. If any of the answers to questions 1 to 8 in Part A, Section 2 of the questionnaire are positive, a medical examination is required. There is no mandated periodicity for use of a respiratory questionnaire or medical examination. The standards state situat ions that trigger the requirement for repeat medical evaluations for respirator use. Vinyl Chloride (General Industry and Construction) 29 CFR 1910.1017, 29 CFR 1926.1117: According to these standards, employees exposed in excess of the action level are required to have a medical and work history, a physical examination, blood tests for total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, SGPT and GGT on an annual basis, and every six months if over 10 years of exposure. Each employee exposed in an emergency shall be afforded appropriate medical surveillance. 25-167 APPENDIX C PROTECTING EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY The primary goals of the OSHA Medical Examination Program are to determine fitness -for-duty and to provide medical surveillance for occupational exposures, as indicated. The intent of this Program is to assure that OSHA covered employees are physically ab le to safely perform assigned duties. In addition, the Program provides limited health promotion services that do not replace the need for personal health care. Employees are encouraged to share examination results with their personal physicians. Annual Evaluations. All covered employees will receive annual medical evaluations (either in the form of a Periodic Physical Examination or an Interim Medical Evaluation) that include, at a minimum, medical surveillance for noise and medical clearance for respir ator use. Employees' occupational exposures that may require additional medical procedures/evaluation, for example, prior silica or asbestos exposure warranting chest x -ray with B -reading, are evaluated as part of the Periodical Physical Examination and w henever management reports to OOM N a potential exposure that reaches an action level of an OSHA standard or another occupational exposure of concern. The periodicity of these examinations and evaluations aims to improve the timeliness of medical evaluatio ns and of any accompanying recommendations for alterations in duty, designed to protect employees. Periodicity. This Program also reduces unnecessary testing for employees who are not likely to benefit from annual, in -depth medical examinations, while m aintaining and updating recommended health safeguards. Unnecessarily frequent examinations may lead to false positive results, additional unnecessary testing, anxiety and cost. The age -based frequency for completing comprehensive physical examinations in this Program is consistent with current occupational medicine practices. No other federal agency is known to currently perform annual comprehensive physical examinations for all employees in medical programs. However, when clinically indicated for OSHA covered employees with significant health conditions, the frequency of medical screening will be adjusted, and some employees with continue with comprehensive annual physical examinations. See the Table, below, for frequencies of physical examinations con ducted on inspectors in other federal agencies. Regulatory Requirements: The implementation of an annual interim examination that includes a hearing conservation program in accordance with the Occupational Noise Exposure standard 29 CFR 1910.95, annual me dical clearance for respirator usage (29 CFR 1910.134), and interim tuberculosis screening according to need ensures that all covered employees receive appropriate occupational medical surveillance. Because OSHA employees are not reasonably anticipated to encounter other occupational hazards that meet action levels for medical surveillance, they are not required or recommended to receive additional annual medical surveillance. Preventive Medical Services: The schedule of physical examinations in the OSH A Medical Examination Program is also consistent with current public health standards of practice for preventive medical services. Public health guidelines that address periodicity recommendations for the general public no longer recommend an annual compr ehensive medical history and physical examination. In 1984, the US Public Health Service commissioned the United States 25-168 Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to develop recommendations for clinicians on the appropriate use of preventive services such as examinations, screening tests, counseling, chemoprophylaxis and immunizations ( http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm#pocket ). The latest USPSTF recommendations and a medical literature se arch were referenced to ensure that currently recommended preventive medicine services are included in the OSHA Medical Examination Program described in this directive. The updated periodicity recommendations for medical evaluations in this directive addr ess many, but not all, public health recommendations for preventive medical services. Recommended preventive services not covered by the OSHA Medical Examination Program should be obtained through each employee's personal health care provider. 25-169 1 OSHA.

Investigation Review All incident investigations will b e conducted in accordance with Chapter 2 of the OSHA SHMS Directive. IX. Recordkeeping Cases of contamination resulting in injuries or illnesses must be recorded on the OSHA 300 per the recordkeeping guidelines. All contaminations defined as incidents must be investigated and documented on an Incident Investigation and Hazard Reporting worksheet. (Chapter 2, Appendix B) 26-187 APPENDIX A DECONTAMINATION FOR BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS I. General In any situation, personnel should not needlessly place themselves in a situation where they may have exposure, or their equipment/clothing become contaminated. Avoidance of exposure to persons, clothing or equipment is critical for all compliance personnel, regardless of their designation under the exposure control plan. PP E should not be used as a substitute for the avoidance of exposure to blood or OPIM. In emergencies (providing first aid or Good Samaritan acts), or other situations where contact cannot be avoided, appropriate work practice controls, PPE, and other equipm ent must be used to prevent exposure. In cases where contact does occur, preventing the spread of contamination beyond areas of initial contact is of utmost importance and appropriate steps need to be taken to prevent this spread. Any known or suspected co ntact or contamination of persons, clothing, equipment or work areas with blood or another potentially infectious body material (OPIM) must be addressed through decontamination and appropriate follow -up procedures. II. Procedures Decontamination of body surf aces 26-188 1. When their hands or any other skin surface may have come in contact with blood or OPIM, employees shall immediately wash with soap and water. 2. Antiseptic hand cleansers and towels, or antiseptic towellettes may be used to wash with if access to soap or water is not immediately available. Employees must, however, immediately wash skin surfaces with soap and water as soon as it is available. 3. Employees must immediately flush their eyes or other mucous membrane surfaces with water when they have come in co ntact with blood or OPIM. 4. Employees shall wash their hands (or other appropriate skin surfaces) after removing or handling gloves, PPE or other coverings which were used to protect against contact with blood or OPIM. 5. If skin contact is suspected, the empl oyee must examine the affected area to determine if an exposure incident may have occurred. 6. In accordance with the Office Exposure Control Plan, report all exposures and exposure incidents to the responsible OSHA manager as soon as possible and enact appro priate follow -up steps as called for in the Office Exposure Control Plan. Equipment and Clothing 26-189 1. All PPE and clothing which has had blood/OPIM contact will be removed immediately or as soon as feasible. All PPE will be removed prior to leaving the work a rea. All disposable PPE will be sealed within a red disposable bag and discarded on -site if possible, or removed for disposition elsewhere by the responsible OSHA manager or the office designee. If the PPE can not be disposed of on -site, the employee wil l double bag it. 2. Where clothing has been penetrated through by blood/OPIM, the underlying skin should be considered to have had exposure, and be treated appropriately as described above in 2 (a). 3. Disposable protective equipment, including gloves, will ne ver be washed or decontaminated for reuse. 4. Gloves or other PPE shall be worn to prevent exposure when handling or disinfecting contaminated equipment, PPE or clothing. 5. Employees shall wash their hands, (or other skin surfaces) after removing or handling PP E, or other coverings which were used to protect against contact with blood or OPIM. 6. vi) Any equipment, sampling pumps and surfaces over which OSHA has control that may be contaminated will be promptly decontaminated by using a solution of bleach containi ng from 1:10 -1:100 bleach (prepared daily) and/or an appropriate EPA/FDA registered disinfectant. 7. vii) Any equipment that may be contaminated with blood will be placed in a leak-proof container. Where the equipment may cause puncturing, it will be placed in a puncture -resistant, leak -proof container. If the equipment is disposable, it may be left on -site, if the site will be disposing of other contaminated equipment. 8. viii) If regulated waste is generated, it will be placed in red bags and put in the appropriate waste containers for disposal in accordance with applicable regulations. For a definition of regulated waste see the Bloodborne Pathogens standard 29 CFR 1910.1030 (b). If waste is not regulated waste, it may be thrown out in the normal trash Work Surfaces Any work surface which has been contaminated by blood/OPIM will be promptly disinfected using a 1:10 - 1:100 solution of bleach (prepared daily) and/or an EPA/FDA registered sterilant. 26-190 1. Gloves or other PPE shall be worn to prevent exposure whe n handling or disinfecting contaminated areas. 2. All waste generated during decontamination of work surfaces which is not regulated waste may be thrown out in the normal trash. 3. Regulated waste will be placed in red bags and put in appropriate waste contain ers for disposal in accordance with applicable regulations. 4. Employees shall wash their hands (or other skin surfaces) after removing or handling PPE or other coverings which were used to protect against contact with blood or OPIM. Laundry 1. All contaminated articles of clothing that are not disposable will be laundered according to the Office designated laundry service. The responsible OSHA manager will be alerted any time laundering of contaminated clothing needs to be performed. Contaminated clothing will be handled on a case -by-case basis, in accordance with guidelines established by the Office. 2. The responsible OSHA manager and Bloodborne Pathogens Coordinator are responsible for contacting a laundry facility to ensure that they are able to handle this t ype of laundry. 3. Laundering of contaminated clothing/PPE will be performed in accordance with the Office guidelines. III. Post-Exposure Protocol Following occupational exposure, employees will notify their responsible OSHA manager and will then jointly contact the Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing (OOM N) immediately. If the OOM N Medical Officer, following discussion with the employee, determines that a likely percutaneous, mucous membrane, or non - intact skin exposure has occurred, the employee will report immediately to the nearest emergency medical facility to initiate appropria te post -exposure prophylaxis, which includes assessment of baseline HIV, HBC and HBV status, post -exposure chemoprophylaxis as determined by the physician and employee, hyperimmune globulin and full -series Hepatitis B immunization, as needed, and subsequen t medical follow -up with follow -up serologic testing at times and locations convenient to the employee, None of the cost will be borne by the employee. Hepatitis B vaccinations will be made available at no cost to OSHA employees, at a reasonable time and place. Post-exposure follow -up will be conducted for any employee who suffers an exposure incident while performing duties on the job at OSHA. 26-191 1. Report to the responsible OSHA manager as soon as possible following an exposure incident to enact the Office pr ocedures for post -exposure follow -up. 2. If the responsible OSHA manager is unavailable, seek medical treatment following an exposure incident, and enact appropriate provisions of the Office post -exposure follow -up procedures. Make contact with the respons ible OSHA manager as soon as possible. 26-192 APPENDIX B DECONTAMINATION PROC EDURES FOR TOXIC MET ALS AND PARTICULATE I. General: Employees may be required to enter environments containing heavy metals and particulates during their regular course of duty. This document is designed to provide guidance as to the proper decontamination of personnel, clothing and equipment if toxic metals or particulates are encountered or are known to be present. II. Definitions: Decontamination The removal and disposal of a hazardous substance from personnel, equipment and vehicles Clothing Shall apply to any street or work attire worn by OSHA employees on the job site including boots, hats, coveralls, and PPE Equipment Shall mean any tools or items needed in the performance of the OSHA employees's job duties Toxic Metals Toxic metals, including \"heavy metals,\" are individual metals and metal compounds that negatively affect people's health. Examples include, but are not limited to, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, hexavalent chromium , lead, and mercury. Particulate Tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas - They range in size from less than 10 nanometers to more than 100 micrometers in diameter. Examples include, but are not limited to, asbestos and dust. III. Procedures: If the site has adequate decontamination facilities, inquire as to the use of those facilities by the OSHA employee. 1. If the site has adequate decontamination facilities, the OSHA employee should make arrangements with the employer to utilize those faciliti es. If the site does not have adequate decontamination facilities, the OSHA employee should follow these procedures. 26-193 1. All equipment and outer personal protective equipment should have gross contamination removed by physical means involving dislodging/displa cement, rinsing, vacuuming with a HEPA vacuum or wiping off. 2. Bag all contaminated equipment and clothing in plastic bags. 3. Use disposable cleansing towels to clean hands, face, and all exposed skin surfaces. OSHA employee shall not use compressed air and/or heat shall not be used to remove contamination. OSHA employees routinely conduct lead inspections in general industry and on construction work sites. Often times, there are inadequate facilities available to the OSHA employee at the work site for p roper removal of lead and other heavy metals from skin and surfaces (e. g. sampling equipment), resulting in the potential for OSHA employee exposure by the ingestion route and cross -contamination in government vehicles, Area Offices and homes. To address this potential hazard, the Office shall put together a decontamination kit that OSHA employees can take with them in the field. The kit includes the following. LEAD / METAL D -CON KIT ITEM USE COST D-WIPE TOWELS\u00ae skin, equip. decontamination 48.00 (12 ca ns, 48 towels) FULL DISCLOSURE\u00ae skin, equip. decontamination verification 2 @ 29.95 (kit) Moisturizing Shower Gel\u00ae skin, hair 13.00/4pk -8oz.

Toral cost per kit: $120.00 (est) *Items need be purchased at retail store. 26-194 APPENDIX C DECONTAMINATION FOR BIOLOGICAL AGENTS I. General In the course of work activity, OSHA employees may be subject to contamination by biological agents. Although exposure to many of these biological agents is unlikely an d generally unanticipated, care should be taken to identify the wide variety of potential exposures that may be experienced. Unfortunately, a wide spectrum of biological contaminants exists, most of which are outside the hazards normally anticipated with compliance activities, but may be encountered in sites such as health care facilities and research labs. As listed on OSHA's Biological Agents - Safety and Health Topics, these can include such diverse hazards as: Anthrax Avian Flu Botulism Foodborne Dise ase Hantavirus Legionnaires Disease Mold and Fungi Plague Ricin SARS Smallpox Tuberculosis Tularemia Viral Hemorrhagic Fever. Q Fever This wide spectrum of biological agents poses several potential problems to OSHA employees, particularly because they represent: - Significantly different risks and symptoms, - Inhalation, ingestion and dermal routes of potential contamination, and - Hazards that may not be anticipated until engaged in on -site activity. Hazard Assessment: Of primary importance is early identi fication of the potential for exposure. Any indication that biological agents may be encountered during inspection activities must be taken seriously and research should be conducted on the specific agents, routes of transmission and symptoms of exposure. For example, a hazard bulletin in 1998 highlighted the potential for exposure to Legionnaire's disease in the plastic injection molding industry. Requirement for negative pressure isolation rooms may be the subject of health care facilities with active cases of Tuberculosis. General infection control procedures may be the subject at a hospital or other 26-195 health care facilities. Contact with surfaces contaminated with mold may transmit mold spores to equipment and ultimately to other (damp) surfaces that may promote their growth. Contact with contaminated water, sewage or decaying animal remains may expose an OSHA employee to a wide variety of bacteria and viruses. II. Procedures: Pre-Inspection If a biological agent is referenced in the complaint / referral, or there is any indication the inspection activity may involve biological agents, the responsible OSHA manager should be notified and research on the specific agents(s) conducted before initiating the inspection. Inspection Activities In health care setti ngs, appropriate infection control procedures, such as a negative pressure isolation room for TB control, should be evaluated as soon as possible and without exposure to areas currently holding patients with active cases of contagious disease. When feasibl e, contact with surfaces and liquids (waste water) with the potential of contamination with biological agents will be avoided. When contact with potentially contaminated surfaces is necessary for collection of samples or inspection related activities, appr opriate PPE, including rubber gloves, will be worn, decontaminated or discarded. Post Inspection If exposure to a biological agent is suspected, it shall be reported to the responsible OSHA manager who will refer for to a health professional for appropriat e medical treatment. Decontamination Unless research has identified specific decontamination procedure guidelines, OSHA \"General Decontamination\" - Quick Card should be followed for potential skin, clothing, equipment and surface decontamination. These guidelines include a qualitative assessment of the level of contamination and the use of solutions containing from \u00bc to 1 \u00bd cups of bleach per gallon of water (prepared daily) and/or an EPA/FDA registered sterilant. 26-196 APPENDIX D OSHA GENERAL DECONTA MIN ATION QUICK CARD General Decontamination Floodwaters may be contaminated with sewage and decaying animal and human remains. Disinfection of hands, clothing, tools/equipment, and surfaces in work areas is critical in disease prevention. Hand Decontamination Wash hands completely with soap and water. Rinse completely; dry with a clean towel or air dry. Clothing, Tool/Equipment Decontamination It is preferable to use soap and clean water when available. If only contaminated water is available, mix 1/4 cup bl each per gallon of water. Immerse objects in solution for 10 minutes; if clothing, gently agitate periodically. Transfer objects to hand wash solution for 10 minutes; if clothing, gently agitate periodically. Allow clothes and tools/equipment to thoroug hly air dry before re -use. Severe Surface Decontamination Use for decontaminating only the most seriously affected surfaces. Mix 1 and 1/2 cups bleach per gallon of water. Douse surfaces with heavy contamination and allow to sit for 3 minutes. Wipe the contamination from the surface with a paper towel and douse the surface again but use the hand wash solution. Wipe off residual contamination with a paper towel. Important Considerations Use gloves and eye protection. Prepare bleach solutions daily and allow to stand for at least 30 minutes before use. All containers should be labeled \"Bleach -disinfected water, DO NOT DRINK.\" CAUTION: Do not mix bleach with products containing ammonia. Do not immerse electrical or battery operated tools/equipment in so lutions; clean exterior with a soft cloth dampened with soap and water or disinfectant solution. Follow electrical or battery operated equipment manufacturer's instructions for cleaning. It may be necessary to remove equipment from service for decontamination. 26-197 27-198 CHAPTER 27. EXPOSURE MONITORING I. Purpose This chapter establishes the OSHA Field Safety and Health Management System (SHMS) Exposure Monitoring Program. The policies and procedures in this Program are intended to set broad expectations for \"self -monitoring\" to prevent employee illness, injury or death from exposure to chemical and physical health hazards. OSHA expects Regions, DTSEM, and DTE to develop specific procedures that align with this Program as needed. This Program is also intended to i dentify if OSHA employee exposures indicate a need for short or long term medical intervention to prevent or respond to hazardous exposures. These procedures describe when and how to collect exposure data from select participating employees. OSHA may als o use this self -monitoring data to make broad determinations about all covered employees' exposure history. II. Scope This chapter applies to all OSHA employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual , (i.e., Covered Employees) . III. References 29 Code of Federal Regulations Section 1910.1020 , Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records Register 54:3904 -3916 Safety and Health Program Management Guidelines; Issuance of Voluntary Guidelines, January 26, 1989 OSHA Instruction TED 01 -00-015, OSHA Technical Manual, January 20, 1999 OSHA Chemical Sampling Information on -line file OSHA Technical Manual, Section II, Chapter 1, Personal Sampling for Air Contaminants, Appendix M OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual, Chapter 2, Safety and Health Management System OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual, Chapter 12, Hazard Communication OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual, Chapter 16, Hearing Conservation Program OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual, Chapter 25, Medical Management Agency Loan Equipment Program (ALEP) catalog NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards 27-199 ACGIH: Threshold Limit Values (TLVs\u00ae) and Biological Exposure Indice s (BEIs\u00ae). IV. Responsibilities Regional Administrators/Directorate Directors (RAs/Directors) are responsible for each employee's work -related safety and health in the Region/Directorate and will: 1. Implement this Exposure Monitoring program in their Region/Directorate and develop specific procedures if necessary. 2. Support self -monitoring when setting performance expectations and developing policies and procedures. 3. Provide managers with the authority and resources necessary to carry out their responsib ilities in the OSHA Exposure Monitoring Program. 4. Develop formal procedures to ensure employees are trained and that exposure data is annually reviewed and disseminated to affected employees and the SHMS Executive Steering Committee (ESC). 5. Request assista nce from the SLTC's Health Response Team for investigations and inspections with the potential for exposure to chemical or physical hazards when the Region/Directorate does not have the resources to safely assess or conduct work activities. Safety and Heal th Committees (SHCs) and equivalent for SLTC, CTC, and DTE are responsible for tracking and evaluating field personnel exposures and will: 1. Evaluate over -exposure incidents to determine if appropriate protections were used and what follow -up may be needed. This evaluation is not for disciplinary purposes. 2. Consult DTSEM's Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing (OOMN) when medical expertise is needed. 3. Review at least annually Region/SLTC/CTC/DTE exposure data for trends and lessons learned. 4. Conduct an an nual program review and make appropriate recommendations. OOMN will provide consultation for OSHA field personnel in accordance with Chapter 25, Medical Management. Area Directors (AD) and equivalent for SLTC, CTC, and DTE are responsible for implementing this Program in each Area Office/SLTC/CTC/DTE and will: 27-200 1. Ensure exposure -monitoring data is collected and recorded by field staff and reviewed by supervisors. 2. Ensure sampling media and direct reading equipment is readily available. 3. Train employees on hazard ous chemicals, as directed by the Regional Hazard Communication Program and Chapter 12, Hazard Communication. 4. Ensure training is provided for all sampling equipment used. 5. Ensure the Regional SHC/equivalent for SLTC/CTC/DTE is notified of all overexposures. Employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual (Covered Employees) will participate in the OSHA Exposure Monitoring Program and will: 27-201 1. Exercise professional judgment to determine where potential exposures exist for themselves as well as for e mployees working on site. OSHA employees may decide to self -monitor even if not required by this Program See Section V.A.1 for required monitoring. 2. Contact their supervisor for guidance if they are unsure about performing monitoring prior to spending tim e in an area. 3. Perform necessary personal monitoring, wipe sampling, or bulk sampling of occupational health exposures. 4. Complete sampling documentation in the OSHA Information System (OIS), see Appendix B, OIS Data Entry. 5. Notify the Assistant Area Director or other appropriate supervisor when self - sampling exposure levels exceed a published Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL) or when experiencing signs and symptoms of exposure. 6. Review the establishment's Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) and/or chemical inventory in a ccordance with other provisions in the Regional/SLTC/CTC/DTE Safety and Health Program (e.g. Hazard Communication Program) during the opening conference to evaluate the potential exposures that may be encountered during the inspection. V. Exposure Data Collec tion Procedures Covered OSHA employees will monitor their exposures to hazardous chemicals, noise, radiation, and other physical hazards. Self -monitoring may include full shift monitoring, screen sampling, passive sampling, and direct reading sampling. Covered employees will use professional judgment to determine the appropriate sampling method. When conducting joint safety and health inspections, follow generally accepted industrial hygiene practices. Sample results are compared to the most protective Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL) among the following: OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL), the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limit (REL), or thespecific manufacturer's OEL. Based on exposure monitoring data reviews, OOMN may request additional exposure monitoring, in coordination with OSHA's Field SHMS National Labor -Management Steering Committee, to support a special chemical, noise, or other physical agent exposure study, using appropriate measures to prevent exposure. Self-Monitoring for Hazardous Chemicals Covered Employees will perform self -monitoring for hazardous chemical exposure where appropriate, ba sed on both professional judgment and the following conditions: 27-202 1. Self-monitoring is required when: a. A company's employees are potentially exposed to chemicals at hazardous levels that justify taking air samples for measurement. Covered Employees at the loc ation (e.g. in a joint safety and health inspection effort) may self -monitor, even if not taking samples from the company's employees. b. Covered Employees have potential for exposure, and c. At least one of the following is true: i. The chemical is covered by an e xpanded health standard. ii. The chemical is a carcinogen. iii. The chemical has poor warning properties. iv. The chemical has a high odor threshold (e. g. difficult to detect by smell). v. The chemical has an unusually low OEL, for example <1 ppm or the mg/m3 equivalent (see the OSHA Technical Manual, Section II, Chapter 1, Personal Sampling for Air Contaminants, Appendix M, to convert between ppm and mg/m3). vi. The chemical has a skin designation from an above OEL. Note: The above decision policy is also available in Append ix C as a flowchart. 2. Self-monitoring is not required under the previous conditions IF one or more of the following conditions are met: a. Covered Employees are not in the immediate area where work is being conducted. b. The chemical has a low volatility or is no t part of the process where it is easily aerosolized. Note: If it is determined that self -monitoring is not required due to the above, the Covered Employee needs to document the specific reason in a location designated by the RA/Director (e.g., case file). 3. Covered Employees may self -monitor any time they decide it is warranted. Self-Monitoring for Noise 27-203 In most situations, self -monitoring for noise is not required. Real time self - monitoring, e. g. a sound level meter, is required when noise levels may exce ed expected levels; it is used to determine when hearing protection is not adequate and the situation requires a change in location or proactive hearing protection. Noise exposure data will provide the Covered Employee with real time information to determ ine the need for additional hearing protection or distance from the source before causing hearing loss. Covered Employees may self -monitor for noise exposure any time they believe it is necessary. Covered Employees will enter all noise exposure monitoring data into OIS. The OSHA Hearing Conservation Program requires the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and Audiometric examinations. Audiometric examinations are conducted during routine medical evaluations. See OSHA SHMS Manual Chapter 16, Heari ng Conservation Program, for additional information. Self-Monitoring for Other Physical Hazards Covered employees will perform monitoring for physical agents (e.g. radiation, thermal stress). Covered employees will enter monitoring data results into OIS. 1. When Covered Employees encounter a situation where radiation or thermal stress is present, they will contact their supervisor to determine the need and appropriate method for self -monitoring. 2. Covered Employees may arrange for self -monitoring any time they believe it is necessary. VI. Exposure Records Exposure Records An \"employee exposure record\" is defined in 29 CFR 1910.1020 . For purposes of this Program, the information contained in the OIS self -sampling records constitutes an employee exposure record. The employee exposure record shall be recorded as outlined in Appendix B. Access to Exposure Records Covered Employees wil l have access to their own employee exposure records without the need for submitting a formal, written request for the records. Exposure Records Availability 27-204 1. Under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552, exposure monitoring records, regardles s of where they are stored or maintained, might be released in response to requests from various parties. In most cases, the Covered Employee's name and Compliance Safety and Health Officer (CSHO) ID number will be redacted, based on Exemption 6 (informat ion about specific individuals in \"personnel and medical files and similar files\" when the disclosure of such information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy) and/or Exemption 7(c) (records or information compiled for law en forcement purposes to the extent that such information could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy) of the Freedom of Information Act. 2. The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a, is not generally applicable to establ ishment case files. The Privacy Act permits an individual to seek access to only his/her own records and only if that record is maintained by the Agency within a system of records and retrieved by the individual requester's name or personal identifiers. 3. If an inspection case is contested, exposure monitoring information might be released during the discovery process. Exposure monitoring information would be made accessible to the parties involved in the litigation (the establishment inspected and, if they have elected party status, the union representing the employees at the establishment), their attorneys and the judge. Under discovery, it is unlikely that the covered employee's name or CSHO ID number could be redacted. VII. Exposure Follow -Up During a site visit, if covered employees recognize that they may be overexposed, they will take appropriate steps to remove themselves from risk and minimize further exposure. The primary action following such an exposure is to implement controls to reduce or prevent additional exposure. Covered Employees will notify their manager, who will notify the applicable OSHA Field SHMS SHC whenever there is a known or suspected overexposure, see Chapter 2, Safety and Health Management System, Section IV, Incide nt Reporting/Investigation Procedures. The applicable SHC will review any known or suspected exposure incident and determine if the case should be referred to the Director of OOMN, who will determine the need for further medical evaluation. Medical survei llance may be provided to employees exposed at levels greater than established occupational exposure limits or experiencing signs and symptoms of exposure as determined by OOMN. 27-205 The applicable SHC may make recommendations regarding current and future use o f appropriate personal protective equipment, administrative controls, and work practices to the appropriate OSHA management. VIII. Training All Covered Employees must receive training annually on: The requirements contained in this Program. Exposure data collect ion methods, data collection equipment. Trends and lessons learned from the applicable SHC annual review. The specific substances referenced in Appendix A, Chemical Exposure Hazards to ensure familiarity and provide references on where to obtain additional information. How to enter self -monitoring data into OIS. Additional training is necessary if conditions such as data collection methods change. Retraining will occur when the supervisor determines that a Covered Employee does not possess adequate unders tanding or skill to self -monitor and/or prevent exposure to hazardous chemicals. IX. Data Tracking and Retention Covered Employee exposure records are established and entered into OIS. Appendix B, Creating a CSHO Sampling Record - OIS Instructions, is detailed and includes screen shots for correctly completing the form and accessing records in OIS. A paper file nee d not be created because the electronic records are maintained in OIS for the required 30 years. See 29 CFR 1910.1020(d)(i)(ii) . CSHOs may create paper copies for the ir own records. 27-206 APPENDIX A CHEMICAL EXPOSURE HAZARDS I.

The Area Office establishment should have been previously created and all CSHO sampling records should use that establishment. Creating a CSHO Sampling Record Most CSHO sampling records are associated with an inspection. Enter the associated inspection first, and then enter the sampling record inspection (ATAR inspecti on). Generate a new inspection in OIS. Use the previously created establishment for your office. It is important that CSHO sampling records for each office be associated with the same area office establishment record. If you believe an establishment has not been created for your office, request the system admin or designated person create an establishment for your office using the guidelines in the section below \"Creating an Area Office Establishment in OIS\" Site Info Tab Select the \"Search\" button in th e \"Establishment Information\" section. In the \"Establishment Name/DBA Name\" field, enter USDOL%. (You may enter state, county, city or other criteria to narrow the search.). Alternatively, if you know the OIS Establishment ID for your area office, you may search for that ID number. Highlight your area office establishment and click the \"Select Establishment\" button. If there are duplicate establishments for your area office, notify your supervisor or system administrator so they can initiate an establishm ent clean -up according to established procedures.
