And paranoia. First comes the visit to your doctor, where you receive the (hopefully) happy news. Then comes the Talk, which goes something like: \"Remember to take it easy for the next nine months. Pamper yourself. Get lots of sleep. And don't eat any deli meats, or you could murder your baby.\" O.K., this might not be exactly what the doctor says, but it's what many women hear. Daily life takes on a frightening new dimension. Is there toxoplasmosis on the cat's butt? Is the hair salon full of poisonous fumes? Complicating things is the gap between the official recommendations and what people actually do. The handout says stick to \"one small cup\" of coffee and stay away from alcohol. But we all know that the coffee thing is B.S., and that it's perfectly fine to have a glass of wine, because . . . they do it in France, right? What about that trending Times article, \" [Eating Nuts During Pregnancy Tied to Brain Benefits in Baby](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/well/eat/eating-nuts-during-pregnancy-tied-to-brain-benefits-in-baby.html)\"? Or the fact that Kourtney Kardashian avoided microwaves after she had a baby? Navigating this gantlet, when I was pregnant, I called a friend who had recently given birth. She cut me off, saying, \"There's a book you need to read.\" The book was by Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University who studies health care. In her day job, she pores over medical journals and government data sets for insights into how we treat diseases such as Huntington's, diabetes, and H.I.V./AIDS. In 2010, Oster got pregnant. Confronted with the usual mixed messages\u2014her doctor told her that a glass of wine was \"probably O.K.\"\u2014she went home, logged in to PubMed, a database of medical literature, and downloaded every study on alcohol and caffeine going back to the nineteen-eighties. She then spent several days performing a personal meta-analysis: evaluating the merits of the studies, throwing out the weak ones, and making an assessment of the risks. (Her conclusion: a glass of wine a day in the second or third trimester wasn't a problem, and she could keep drinking coffee guilt-free.) Oster's research expanded into her 2013 book, \" [Expecting Better](https://www.amazon.com/Expecting-Better-Conventional-Pregnancy-Wrong/dp/0143125702),\" which became a hit among pregnant women\u2014at least among the subset of pregnant women with the time and resources to devote to issues like caffeine dosage and sushi intake. In the book, Oster recounts the choices that she faced during her pregnancy and tackles such topics as prohibited foods, weight gain, and C-sections, frequently dismantling the received wisdom. Flatteringly, she addresses her reader as a peer. She doesn't issue opaque decrees, with the implicit condescension of \"Trust me, I'm an expert.\" She doesn't slip into cutesy jargon, like the pun-prone authors of the latest edition of \" [What to Expect When You're Expecting](https://www.amazon.com/What-Expect-When-Youre-Expecting/dp/0761187480),\" who call pregnant women \"Mama\" and suggest that you \"start every morning with a bump selfie.\" Instead, she takes the reader on a tour of the scientific literature, even describing the methodology of specific studies to show how she made each decision. Lauren Kay, the executive editor of the pregnancy and parenting Web site [the Bump](https://www.thebump.com/), explained Oster's appeal to me in an e-mail: \"The whole tone of the book is very pro-Mom, putting the power back in the hands of the pregnant woman. I read it when I was pregnant with my first child, and it left me feeling empowered to ask my OB why or why not. It also reminded me that I was part of the equation, too.\" Despite the plaudits, the book didn't go over well with many public-health officials, who disagreed especially vehemently with Oster's conclusions about alcohol. The president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said, on Boston's NPR station, that Oster's advice was wrong: \"We need to err on the side of caution, and the side of caution says that we have not been able to identify any amount of alcohol that is absolutely safe in pregnancy.\" But Oster's fans were undeterred. Amy Schumer called Oster \"the non-judgmental girlfriend holding our hand and guiding us through pregnancy and motherhood.\" Last month, Oster published a sequel, \" [Cribsheet](https://www.amazon.com/Cribsheet-Data-Driven-Relaxed-Parenting-Preschool/dp/0525559256),\" subtitled \"A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool.\" It takes on subjects like cold season, nap schedules, and potty training. As the mother of a sixteen-month-old, I had a host of burning questions: Will she ever willingly wear clothes? Is it wrong to buy those little kids' leashes? Why does she put her finger in other babies' mouths and say, \"Bite\"? Parenting experts have been around for as long as there have been anxious parents. They have channelled the fears and the aspirations of their times. Eighteenth-century parents adopted Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ideas about \"natural\" parenting\u2014cold air is good for a child!\u2014even though he'd left all five of his children at a foundling hospital. Dr. Spock, who had trained in psychoanalysis, [gave parenting advice a Freudian spin](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/05/05/mothers-helpers), and his mantra\u2014 [\"Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do\"](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Spocks-Baby-Child-Care/dp/1439189293)\u2014soothed addled Cold War parents. It makes sense that our parenting expert du jour is a data wonk. In some ways, data are to today's parents what psychoanalysis was to the postwar generation: a hoped-for savior. We try to make sense of a chaotic world by reading Nate Silver's political forecasts and wearing devices that count our steps. At the same time, Big Data is increasingly sinister. If you've been pregnant lately, you've undoubtedly had the eerie experience of seeing baby-related ads popping up online before you've shared the news with anyone. The information age has turned out to be a breeding ground for misinformation, with \"Moneyball\" giving way to Twitter bots, viral pseudoscience, and dubious Facebook news feeds. Oster is here to help you navigate this glut. As a pop-economist, she follows in the tradition of Steven Levitt, of \" [Freakonomics](https://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0060731338)\" fame. Levitt, who has six children, including two who are younger than three, told me that Oster's first book \"is the bible of my circle.\" At a time when pregnancy and child rearing have become polarized and moralized\u2014natural births, water births, orgasmic births?\u2014it can be refreshing to hear from someone who sticks to the numbers. \"Economists focus on how the world is,\" Levitt told me. \"A lot of parenting advice is focussed on how the world should be in someone's mind.\" What did I want from Oster's books? Until recently, most of life's outcomes seemed within my control. If I exercised, I could get in shape. (Not that I ever did.) If I worked hard at school, and then at my job, I could earn good grades and promotions. But becoming a parent was different. No matter how many pregnancy apps I downloaded, I couldn't control when I would get pregnant, or if it would go well. And, after the baby arrived, I seemed to be stuck in crisis mode. The data seemed like a way to get back, if not power, then at least a sense of mastery. Oster now has two children, Penelope and Finn, who are eight and four. She spends most of her days in her office at Brown, where she is currently researching methodological problems with data on health trends (vitamins, superfoods). Given the subject matter of her books, I thought it best to see her in the domestic sphere. I arrived at her home, in Providence, Rhode Island, at 6:30 a.m. It was still dark outside. Oster was standing at her kitchen counter in working-mom attire: a black business skirt and stockings, with a zip-up hoodie over her blouse to protect it from grubby hands. The place was neat but minimally furnished\u2014an indication, to me, that she wasn't especially interested in interior decorating. But I knew from her books that she likes to sew, and there were two plates of attractive muffins on the counter. She'd gotten up at 5 a.m. to bake. Oster has striking blue eyes and short, straight brown hair. In person, as in her writing, she combines extreme practicality with a dry sense of humor. In a chapter in \"Cribsheet\" about staying at home versus working, she writes that, while she loves her children, \"the marginal value of time with my kids declines fast.\" In a section on milk oversupply during breast-feeding, she mentions gua-sha therapy, a skin-scraping treatment, and adds, \"Gwyneth Paltrow swears by this, so take what you will from that.\" From the books, I also knew a good deal about Oster's family. Her husband, Jesse Shapiro, is an economist at Brown as well, known for his work on political polarization, and her parents are both economists at Yale. As a child in the nineteen-eighties, Oster said, \"we were the only people who ordered groceries from the grocery store.\" When young Emily asked her mother, \"Why don't we ever go to the store, like regular people?,\" her mother told her, \"Because my time is very valuable. I have a high opportunity cost.\" Naturally, Oster recalled, \"I was, like, Oh, O.K. That makes sense.\" Oster was a precocious child. When she was not yet two, she often talked to herself before she fell asleep at night. One day, her mother mentioned this habit to a woman at a faculty gathering. The woman, a developmental psychologist named Katherine Nelson, was intrigued. She asked Emily's mother if she'd consider recording the toddler's monologues. For about a year, Emily's parents placed a tape recorder under the crib every night before putting her to bed. Nelson and a group of colleagues eventually published a book of essays about the tapes, called \" [Narratives from the Crib](https://www.amazon.com/Narratives-Crib-Foreword-Emily-Oster/dp/0674023633),\" which is still in print. Oster told me, \"There were friends of mine in college who read it as part of their psychology syllabus.\" \"Narratives from the Crib\" is not an easy read. The authors, linguists and psychoanalysts, investigate Emily's use of pronouns, and the contrast between her private speech and her social speech. But the monologues are fascinating for anyone who has ever wondered how toddlers think. Baby Emily discusses her favorite foods (including \"p-water,\" or Perrier), the family's sleeping arrangements, and a dream about an alligator. She recites the schedule of the buses that appear on the street outside her house: \"1 2 3 4 days we have yellow buses, but not 5 4 5 4 5 have blue buses. . . .\" And she spends hours going over her daily routine. Her childcare schedule is split between nursery school and day care at the home of a woman named Tanta. She carpools with a boy named Carl: It's tempting to judge \"Narratives from the Crib\" by Oster's methodological standards and find it lacking. Baby Emily isn't representative of most, or even many, two-year-olds. But that isn't the point: the authors are comparing Emily with herself in different contexts and at different stages of her development. And the monologues are highly representative of Oster today. Reading them, \"I see a lot of my adult processing in my two-year-old self, which is sort of creepy,\" she told me. \"This need to think about: What happened today? What is going to happen tomorrow? I don't do it out loud anymore, but I still do versions of this.\" Oster still keeps a precise schedule. After we'd talked for a while, I asked if she wanted to wake up the children. She shook her head. It was 6:45 a.m. \"No,\" she said. \"We still have five minutes.\" At exactly 6:50, Oster went upstairs and stuck her head through the doorway of Penelope's room, saying, \"Hi, love. Can you get dressed?\" Penelope rubbed her eyes. Oster proceeded to Finn's bedroom. \"Hi, Finn-o. What are you doing? I made muffins.\" Finn bolted upright. Oster ducked into his closet, swiftly selecting clothes. Addressing me, Finn asked, \"Would you like to listen to the book that Mom's going to read to me?\" \"What do you want me to read?\" Oster asked. \" 'Ralph Tells a Story'?\" Finn nodded. She sat on the bed and read the book at the pace of a podcast playing at 1.5 speed. Penelope crept in, wearing a long-sleeved T-shirt and pink leggings, with a red bow in her hair. At 7:05, Oster hustled the kids down to the kitchen for breakfast. She set out a plate of sliced strawberries alongside the muffins. \"I think it's important to have fruit,\" she said. Mother and children sat around the table, Finn wearing a T-shirt and Stormtrooper underpants. \"Guess what,\" he said. \"These are on backward.\" The Stormtrooper logo was on the rear, so he'd turned them around. \"It's a terrible underwear design,\" Oster said. We talked about their weekend plans, and about a Japanese restaurant where they'd recently eaten. \"You sit on a tatami mat,\" Penelope told me. \"It's a thing where you sit on the floor, and there's a really low table. I found out about it when I started studying Japan in school. I studied Japan for three months.\" With her quick, orderly thinking, she reminded me of Baby Emily. She went on, \"Now that I'm done with Japan, I'm studying family.\" Oster asked, \"Are you going to write about our family?\" Penelope was interrupted by Finn, who shouted, \"More fizzy water!\" \"Please,\" Oster said, and refilled his glass. \"Cribsheet\" is different from Oster's first book, in part because pregnancy and parenting are different. When you're pregnant, the choices you face are more discrete\u2014Should I agree to this procedure? Should I order this entr\u00e9e?\u2014and you generally have time to think things through. \"When you have a kid, it's like someone is shooting you in the face with a fire hose,\" Oster said. \"Particularly at the beginning. Every day there's another decision: Should I be swaddling her? Should he be circumcised? The breast-feeding isn't working! Should I use this breast-feeding supplement thing that gets taped on my boob? What kind of bottles should we buy? Should I use this formula or that formula? She's not sleeping! Where should she sleep?\" At first, Oster and her husband made decisions on the fly, like everyone else. They ricocheted between various sleep-training techniques and ordered too much gear from Amazon. When a night nanny advised, \"You have to get the Miracle Blanket\"\u2014a swaddling product\u2014Oster said, \"I was, like, 'Great, let's order ten of them!' \" With Finn, she was able to step back and take a more programmatic approach. She dug into the data on such topics as sleep and childcare, asking, \"What, ideally, should I have done?\" The answer wasn't always clear. For one thing, there isn't much data on the nonmedical aspects of child rearing, such as the effects of screen time on kids. Even where data exist, they're not very conclusive. \"Can you eat sushi when you're pregnant? Yes, it's fine,\" Oster said, by way of example. \"Should you sleep with your baby? There's a lot less of a right answer.\" That's not to say that people won't tell you there's a right answer. Exhibit A is breast-feeding. After I gave birth, I was surprised to discover that many people\u2014even men\u2014would ask, \"Are you breast-feeding?\" I soon realized that the question was an indicator of our collective anxiety about the subject. By the nineteen-seventies, after the baby-formula industry aggressively marketed its product to doctors, breast-feeding had declined precipitously in the U.S. It was revived in the nineteen-eighties, thanks to large-scale public-health campaigns, and later to studies showing such health benefits as improved metabolism and higher I.Q. If you've been pregnant in the past forty years, you've no doubt been on the receiving end of these campaigns\u2014from the poster in the doctor's office announcing \"Breast Is Best!\" to the Instagram influencer doing yoga while a baby suckles peacefully at her nipple. If you're a certain kind of person\u2014for example, me\u2014you've come away thinking, Message received! I am one hundred per cent, absolutely breast-feeding! But there's a hitch: there's a small, squalling person who also has a say in the matter. My daughter quickly developed a firm preference for the bottle over the breast. At first, I overruled her, but, as the lactation consultant informed me, \"She just likes the feeling of plastic.\" At around five months old, she began screaming with horror whenever she glimpsed my nipple. It was . . . insulting? When I called my mother to vent, she said that I'd rejected her nipple, too. \"I'm still very hurt,\" my mother added. Oster frequently gets e-mails from distraught mothers who are convinced that, because they've failed at breast-feeding, they've doomed their offspring to a life of dim-wittedness and obesity. \"The saddest are from the husbands, saying, 'Is there any information you can give me? I just want to be able to tell my wife it's not so terrible if this doesn't work,' \" Oster said. After reviewing the literature, Oster believes that the health benefits of breast-feeding are real, but that they have been oversold. She zeroes in on the issue at the center of so many debates about medical research: determining causality. It's tricky to study breast-feeding. In an ideal experiment, you'd take a large group of newborns and randomly assign half of them to be reared on formula and the other half to be breast-fed. But, for obvious ethical reasons, we don't experiment on infants. So researchers are left mainly with observational studies, which examine the babies whose mothers have chosen to breast-feed. In the U.S., these women tend to be wealthier and better educated than other moms\u2014a result of many factors, including the fact that breast-feeding is time-consuming and that, to do it comfortably, you need sufficient paid leave. Do breast-fed babies thrive because of breast-feeding, or because their parents have more money and higher academic degrees? In many areas, such as obesity and I.Q., Oster argues that it's the latter. Only a few studies meet her standards: sibling studies, in which one child is breast-fed and the other isn't, and a large randomized controlled trial in Belarus, in the nineteen-nineties. (Breast-feeding rates were low, and researchers encouraged half the mothers to take up the practice.) From these studies, she draws two firm conclusions: breast-feeding reduces gastrointestinal problems, like diarrhea, and rashes, like eczema, in a baby's first year. Important, but, as Oster told me, \"if it doesn't work, the parents should say, 'Well, maybe my kid will have more difficulty pooping for a few months.' Not 'There go five I.Q. points!' \" Another question that people often ask new mothers: \"Is your baby a good sleeper?\" Sleep is a fraught topic, in part because it's stalked by the world's scariest acronym: SIDS, or sudden infant-death syndrome. Over the years, official recommendations for avoiding SIDS have changed dramatically. When I was a child, my mother put me to sleep on my stomach, surrounded by bumpers and stuffed animals. Today, that would probably get you reported to Child Protective Services. Other practices, such as \"co-sleeping\"\u2014letting a baby sleep in your bed\u2014are, officially, against recommendations and, unofficially, something that people do all the time. Co-sleepers sometimes contend that the safety warnings are too stringent, and Oster provides them with some support. She argues that the increased risk of SIDS associated with co-sleeping has a lot to do with other parental behaviors. If you're drinking and smoking, it's dangerous. If you abstain from those activities, and take other precautions, like removing blankets from the bed, the risk of your baby's dying is .22 deaths per thousand births\u2014still elevated, but less than the risk of your baby's dying in a car accident. In other words, Oster said, \"a reasonable person could make that choice,\" especially if it's helping the entire family sleep. Economics is a science of decision-making. A major refrain of Oster's book is that a parent's preferences are important. What do you want? That seems an obvious consideration when you're selecting a new car, but less so when the decision involves your child. \"In the first book, there's a central tension between people and the medical establishment,\" Oster told me. In the second book, \"it's between you and society. Or you and your own parental guilt.\" Why is child rearing so touchy? Why does it cause us to engage in Facebook flame wars, and to think terrible thoughts about our dearest friends? Ann Hulbert, the author of \" [Raising America: Experts, Parents, and a Century of Advice About Children](https://www.amazon.com/Raising-America-Experts-Parents-Children/dp/0375701222),\" told me that, in recent years, parenthood has taken on an uneasy dual role in American life. \"It's become both the proving ground for our virtue and the deeply insecure ground on which we hope to create a life of greater economic security for our children,\" she said. The U.S., she added, hasn't had a single voice of authority on the subject in decades. After Dr. Spock, numerous experts popped up, often with conflicting advice. Then came the Internet. \"We're now in an era where mothers and parents can talk to one another, a throwback to this nostalgic time, pre-expert, when mothers gathered at the village well,\" Hulbert went on. That sounds nice. \"But, actually, it can be horrible! Mothers are perfectly free to be judgmental, dictatorial, and obsessive, and it multiplies anxieties.\" Oster believes that the Mommy Wars arise from a kind of loss aversion. \"People get the idea that what they do must be the right thing. Especially since some of these things are very hard,\" she said. \"Like, if you spent a year lugging your breast pump through airports and pumping in the bathroom at LaGuardia, just so you could keep breast-feeding, it's hard to later say, 'Oh, actually, that wasn't really so important for my kid. I just did it because I liked it.' \" In April, Oster participated in a lunchtime Q. & A. session with new mothers at a pillow-filled space on Brown's campus, over plates of Indian food. The audience was made up of graduate students and young professors\u2014all passionate Osterites. A woman from the professional-studies program said, \"I want to treat you like this oracle who can answer anything!\" She had a question about weaning. \"My son is twenty months old, and I can't figure out how to stop breast-feeding him,\" she said. \"There isn't much data on that,\" Oster replied, apologetically. (It's not a common enough problem to attract researchers, she explained.) She offered, \"I quit when my son bit me at eleven months. I was, like, 'Aaah!' And he never wanted to do it again.\" The conversation soon turned to mommy bloggers. What to do about them? And what, one woman asked, do you say to the \"parents and aunts and uncles and stuff who all have their own opinions?\" Oster gave the group a pep talk. \"That lady on the Internet is not living in your house,\" she said. \"She doesn't know what the right thing is for your son's penis. And so you shouldn't let her tell you whether circumcision is a good idea or not.\" Part of her goal, Oster explained, was for \"people to feel more confident in the choices that they make. And be able to appreciate that other people made different choices without feeling bad.\" By the time I finished \"Cribsheet,\" I was feeling very empowered. I knew my preferences, and I had obtained the relevant data. I was becoming a pro at data-driven parenting. Then I spoke to people in the medical establishment, and my sense of certainty fell apart. Dr. Lori Feldman-Winter, the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Section on Breastfeeding, told me that Oster is getting it all wrong. Public-health experts have specific ways of interpreting research, and Oster wasn't following those protocols. \"That's the really scary part of having a person like Oster, who is not an epidemiologist, distilling this information to the lay public,\" Feldman-Winter told me. \"It's basically as bad as the anti-vaxxers.\" Apparently, if I'd really wanted data, I should have downloaded [the U.S. government's recent summary review on breast-feeding](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/index.htm), which found evidence of long-term effects that Oster dismisses, including a reduction in asthma and in Type 1 diabetes. Feldman-Winter told me about how human milk raises the I.Q. of preterm babies, and how exclusive breast-feeding\u2014with no formula\u2014seeds the lower intestinal tract with good bacteria, protecting against inflammatory-bowel disease, Crohn's, and ulcerative colitis. Oh dear. Now I felt truly awful. Why had I given up so soon? Feldman-Winter tried to reassure me: \"You did the best you could.\" Unsurprisingly, Oster stood by her analysis. \"There are many ways to collate this literature,\" she told me. And economists are extremely skeptical of the methods that epidemiologists use. Whom, then, to believe? Such arguments come up all the time in discussions of medical research. They are a reminder that, far from being infallible, data can be slippery. Preferences, too. They're informed by all kinds of factors: sentiment, lived experience, religious beliefs. In reporting this story, I found that, the more I learned about breast-feeding, the more passionate I became about it. Like Oster, I was an unapologetic wine-sipper during pregnancy. But, after speaking to doctors who have treated fetal alcohol syndrome, I wished that I could take back even the tiniest drop. Is this rational? Perhaps not. But neither are a lot of things about parenting. \"Cribsheet\" hasn't been as controversial as Oster's first book, because her conclusions, for the most part, fall in line with what your pediatrician has been telling you. Vaccinations are safe. Sleep training\u2014otherwise known as the \"cry it out\" method\u2014will not scar your child for life. The one area where, Oster says, \"book research preceded behavior change\" in her own life was toddler discipline. Because her children are well behaved, she wasn't planning to do any research on the topic, but her editor, the mother of two young girls, begged her to look into so-called \"positive parenting interventions\"\u2014programs like 1-2-3 Magic, the Incredible Years, and Triple P, or the Positive Parenting Program. She was surprised to find that, as she writes in the book, \"they just work.\" A number of large randomized controlled trials have shown that, after parents are taught the techniques, they report that their children are more compliant, and that they themselves are less stressed\u2014even years after the program has ended. Oster has started using 1-2-3 Magic with her kids. The basic idea is that, when a child misbehaves, instead of getting angry you slowly count to three. If she hasn't taken the remote control out of the toilet by \"three,\" there's a consequence: a time-out, or a loss of privilege. \"You have to be consistent,\" Oster said. Thomas Phelan, the psychologist who created 1-2-3 Magic, recommends bringing a \"time-out mat\" to deal with tantrums in, say, the grocery store. I've ordered his book. It's hard to imagine becoming the kind of person who carries a time-out mat in her purse, but parenting can take you to weird places. Oster now finds herself brainstorming punishments that a four-year-old will find \"devastating.\" Lately, she said, she's been having success with \"If you don't stop doing that, I'm going to take away your lunch cookie.\" Talking about this subject, I was reminded of a recurring episode in \"Narratives from the Crib.\" It takes place at the beginning of each tape, before Baby Emily's dad puts her to bed. There's a push and pull between parent and child. He's trying to get her to go to sleep, and she's trying to keep him in the room. She experiments with different strategies: jumping on the bed, asking him to repeat the story that he just told her, and, of course, crying. \"Big kids don't cry,\" he tells her at one point, trying to sneak out of the room. After he leaves, she repeats the phrase over and over, through sobs. \"I'm glad my kids didn't do much of that,\" Oster told me. \"Listening to it, you'd be, like, What am I doing to my child?\" What are we doing to our children? We fret, we helicopter, we listen to the wrong people. We pore over transcripts of two-year-olds chattering and turn ourselves into amateur statisticians. But, ultimately, many of the outcomes aren't in our control. And that's a problem that all the data in the world won't fix. "}
