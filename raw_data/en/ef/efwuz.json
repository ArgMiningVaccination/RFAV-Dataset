Are you wondering what the benefits of acupuncture for dogs might be? Let us explain. Is acupuncture for dogs safe? Yes! Acupuncture has been used safely and successfully for years on people as well as a variety of animal species, including cats, dogs, rabbits, and horses.

Acupuncture sessions are not painful and do not require medications or sedation.

A qualified veterinary acupuncturist will assess your dog's specific needs, considering their medical history, breed, temperament, and current health status.

How can acupuncture benefit my dog? Wondering if acupuncture could help to treat your dog's health condition? Below are just a few of the beneficial effects that our team has seen when using acupuncture to treat pets: Pain Management & Relief Acupuncture has been demonstrated to trigger the body's own pain-relieving endorphins and anti-inflammatory chemicals, which can aid in the relief of chronic pain. Whether your dog suffers from arthritis, musculoskeletal issues, or chronic pain, acupuncture can be used to help alleviate discomfort by stimulating the release of endorphins, the body's natural painkillers. Cancer Treatment Support In cases where dogs are undergoing cancer treatment, acupuncture can be a valuable complementary therapy. While it does not cure cancer, it can help manage side effects of treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. Acupuncture can alleviate pain, improve appetite, reduce nausea, and boost overall well-being, providing comfort during a challenging time. Improved Digestive Function Acupuncture has shown positive effects on digestive health in dogs. If your furry friend suffers from gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, diarrhea, or constipation, acupuncture can be used to help stimulate the digestive system, regulate bowel movements, and improve overall gut health. This can lead to better nutrient absorption and a healthier digestive tract. Improved Respiratory Function Acupuncture can benefit pets suffering from respiratory issues such as asthma and allergies. Acupuncture has been demonstrated to offer relaxing and immune-system calming characteristics, as well as the ability to treat animals with breathing problems.
