Therapeutic Class Overview Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors INTRODUCTION Migraine is a common, recurrent, incapacitating disorder characterized by moderate to severe headaches and disablin g f eatures, including nausea, vomiting, neurologic symptoms, photophobia, and phonophobia. Cluster headache is less prevalent th an migraine and characterized by attacks of severe, unilateral pain with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms, which occur every other day to multiple times daily during a cluster period ( International Headache Society [IHS] 2018, Starling et al 2015). The goals for treatment of migraine are to reverse or stop the progression of a migraine attack. The goals for preventive treatment are to reduce the frequency, severity and duration of a migraine ( American Headache Society [AHS] 2019 , Katsarava 2012). The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) includes both cluster headache and migraine as part of a gr oup of primary head ache disorders ( IHS 2018): Chronic migraine is defined as 15 headache days per month for > 3 months with the features of migraine h eadache for at least 8 mean migraine days per month (MMD) . The most common cause of symptoms suggestive of chronic migraine is medication overuse. According to the ICHD, around 50% of patients apparently with chronic migrai ne r evert to an episodic migraine type after drug withdrawal; such patients are in a sense wrongly diagnosed with chronic migraine. In most clinical trials, migraine that is not chronic (ie, < 15 headache days per month) is considered to be epi sodic migraine, although the condition is not clearly defined in the ICHD . Cluster headache is defined as 5 attacks lasting 15 to 180 minutes every other day to 8 times a day with sever e uni lateral orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal pain. Episodic cluster headache attacks occur for a period of 7 days t o 1 y ear and are separated by pain- free periods lasting at least 3 months. Common symptoms include nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation, eyelid edema, sweating (forehead or face), miosis,ptosis, and/or a sense of restlessness or agitation. Cluster headache is more likely to occur in men, whereas migraines are more likely to occur in women. Migraines hav e a gl obal prevalence of 15 to 18% and are a leading cause of disability worldwide. Chronic migraine is estimated to occur in 2 to 8% of patients with migraine, whereas episodic migraine occurs in more than 90% of patients . Cluster headac he is rare compared to other primary headache disorders. It is estimated to have a prevalence of 0.1% within the general population ( Global Burden of Disease Study [GBD] 2016, Hoffman et al 2018, Lipton et al 2016, Ljubisavljevic et al 2019, Manack et al 2011). Treatment s for migraines and cluster headache are divided into acute and preventive therapies. Evidence and reputable guidelines clearly delineate appropriate therapies for episodic migraine treatment and prophylaxis; options stretc h ac ross a wide variety of therapeutic classes and are usually oral therapies. For the prevention of migraines, treatment options include oral prophylactic therapies, injectable prophylactic therapies, and neuromodulator devices. Ora l pr ophylactic migraine therapies have modest efficacy, and certain oral therapies may not be appropriate for individual patients due to intolerability or eventual lack of efficacy. For the treatment of acute migraine, options include triptans, ergots, (5- HT) 1F receptor agonist . cluster headache, subcutaneous sumatriptan, zolmitriptan nasal spray, and oxygen have the most positive evidence for acute therapy, and suboccipital steroi d i njections are most effective for prevention ( American Migraine Foundation [AMF] 2020, Marmura et al 2015, Robbins et al 2016, Silberstein et al 2012, Simpson et al 2016) . The calcitonin gene- related peptide ( CGRP ) pathway is important in pain modulation and the Food and Dr ug Administration (FDA) has approved 6 CGRP inhibitors for prevention or treatment of migraine/headache disorder(s) . E renumab- aooe is a fully antibody , which potently binds to the CGRP receptor in a competitive a nd reversibl e manner with greater selectivity than to other family to the CGRP ligand a nd block its binding to the receptor. Rimegepant and ubrogepant are small molecule oral CGRP receptor antagonists et al 2018[b], Edvinsson 2017, Goadsby et al 2017, et al 2016, Tepper et al 2017). Two CGRP inhibitors known as the \"gepants,\" telcagepant and olcegepant, were previously investigated. In 2009,Merck withdrew the FDA application for telcagepant because of elevated liver enzymes and potential liver toxicityData as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 33 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The manufacturer of olcegepant also ceased pursuing FDA approval; however, the manufacturer did not explicitly state the rationale. It has been widely speculated that olcegepant development ceased due to limitations associated with administration as an intravenous (IV)-only product ( Edvinsson et al 2017, Walker et al 2013). No substantial issues with liver toxicity have been observed in trials with the currently marketed CGRP inhibitors. Additional CGRP inhibitors early in their development include vazege pant, the first intranasally administered release 2019, Staines 2019). In April 2019, Teva announced that it would not pursue development of fremanezumab- vfrm for an episodic cluster headache indication due to results from the ENFORCE trial ( Teva Pharmaceuticals press release 2019). Erenumab- aooe and eptinezumab- jjmr are not currently under clinical investigation for the indication of cluster headache (Clinicaltrials.gov 20 20).

CLINICAL EFFICACY SU MMARY Rimegepant ODT has been studied as acute therapy in approximately 1466 patients in 1 Phase 3 trial of episodic migraine (with or without aura) patients and in 1 unpublished long- term safety trial. Three additional trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of rimegepant 75 mg in an oral tablet formulation were considered supportive for approval; 2 trialsData as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 34 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Ubrogepant has been studied as acute therapy in approximately 3360 patients across 2 trials in patients with 2 to 8 migraines/month with moderate to severe pain intensity either with or without aura and in 1 unpublished, open -label extension (O LE) trial. Eptinezumab- jjmr has been studied in approximately 2019 patients across 2 trials in patients with episodic or chronic migraine subtypes for prevention, with data available in published formats. Erenumab- aooe has been studied as preventive therapy in approximately 2500 patients across 4 trials in patients with episodic or chronic migraine subtypes and 1 OLE trial, with data available in published and unpublished formats. Fremanezumab- vfrm has been studied as preventive therapy in approximately 2005 patients across 3 trials in patients with episodic or chronic migraine subtypes, with data available in published formats. In fremanezumab- vfrm trials, the definition of a headache or migraine day for the primary endpoint required a consecutive 2 hour (episodic) or 4 hour (chronic) duration of pain, compared to other CGRP inhibitor trials that required a duration of 30 minutes. Galcanezumab- gnlm has been studied as preventive therapy in approximately 2886 patients across 3 trials in patients with episodic or chronic migraine subtypes and 1 long -term safety trial with unpublished data to 1 year. The efficacy and safety of galcanezumab- gnlm was evaluated for treatment in one 8- week study with 106 adults with episodic cluster headache (max imum of 8 at tacks/day). The definition of the primary and secondary endpoints differed in the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine trials. Additional differences included, but were not limited to , co-morbid conditions, concomitant medications, a requirement of stable doses of migraine prevention medication (if co- administered) for certain durations, and the definitions of headache, migraine headache, and migraine day. Some CGRP inhibitor trials allowed patients to receive concomitant preventive migraine medicat ion during treatment. Also, some chronic migraine trials allowed for the inclusion of patients with medication overuse headache. Prevention of episodic migraine Eptinezumab- jjmr PROMISE- 1 was (PC), multi -center (MC) , Phase 3 trial in which adults with a history of episodic migraine were randomized to receive placebo (n = 222), eptinezumab- jjmr 100 mg (n = 221), or eptinezumab- jjmr 300 mg (n = 222) every 3 months for 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in MMD from baseline to week 12. Eptinezumab- jjmr 100 mg and 300 mg significantly reduced MMDs across weeks 1 to 12 compared with placebo (placebo, 3.2; 100 mg, 3.9, p = 0.02 ; 300 mg, 4.3, p = 0.0001). The odds for a 50% reduc tion in MMD were approximately 1.7 to 2.2 times higher with eptinezumab- jjmr than placebo. Of note, the endpoints underwent a testing hierarchy and were not significant for 50% migraine responder rates in the 100 mg dose group ( Ashina et al 2020, Vyepti [dossier ] 2020). Erenumab- aooe The STRIVE trial was a 6- month, DB , PC, MC, Phase 3 trial in which 955 patients with episodic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 319), erenumab- aooe 70 mg (n = 317), or erenumab- aooe 140 mg (n = 319) once monthly . The primary endpoint was the change in mean MMD from baseline to months 4 to 6, which favored treatment with erenumabaooe 70 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9 to 0.9; p < 0.001) anderenumabaooe 140 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.3 to 1.4; p < 0.001). Erenumabaooesignificantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMD (difference for 70 mg vs placebo, 16.7%; odds ratio [OR], 2.13; difference for 140 mg vs placebo, 23.4%; OR, 2.81) . Erenumabaooe was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 70 mg vs placebo, 0.9; difference for 140 mg vs placebo, 1.4) (Goadsby et al 2017). The ARISE trial was a 12- week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial in which 577 patients with episodic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 291) or erenumab- aooe 70 mg (n = 286) once monthly. The primary endpoint was the change in MMD from baseline to weeks 9 to 12, which fav ored treatment with erenumabaooe 70 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.6 to 0.5; p < 0.001). Compared to placebo, erenumabaooe significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMD (difference, 10.2%; OR, 1.59) . Erenumabaooe was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days(difference, 0.6) (Dodick et al 2018[a] ).Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 35 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The LIBERTY trial was a 12- week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3b trial in which 246 patients with episodic migraine who failed 2 to 4 prior preventive migraine treatments were randomized to placebo (n = 125) or erenumab- aooe 140 mg (n = 121) once monthly. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with 50% reduction in MMD from baseline to the last 4 weeks of DB treatment (weeks 9 to 12) , which e renumabaooe significantly increased over placebo (difference, 16.6%; OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.43 to 5.19; p = 0.002). Compared to placebo, 5.9% more patients treated with erenumabaooe 140 mg reported a 100% reduction in MMD, or migraine cessation. Erenumab- aooe 140 mg/month compared with significantly the MMD (difference, 1.61; 95% CI, 2.70 to 0.52; p = 0.004). Erenumabaooe was also associated with a significant decr ease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference, 1.73) (Reuter et al 2018). Fremanezumab- vfrm The HALO -EM trial was a 12 -week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial in which 875 patients with episodic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 294), fremanezumab- vfrm 225 mg once monthly (n = 290), or fremanezumab- vfrm 675 mg once quarterly (n = 291). The primary endpoint was the change in mean MMD, which favored treatment with fremanezumab- vfrm 225 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.5; 95% CI, 2.0 to 0.9; p < 0.001) and fremanezumab- vfrm 675 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.8 to 0.7; p < 0.001). Of note, HALO -EM was powered to detect a 1.6-day difference in the MMD between the fremanezumab- vfrm and placebo groups, but effect sizes resulted in a 1.5- day reduction for the fremanezumab- vfrm monthly dosing group and a 1.3- day reduction for the fremanezumab- vfrm quarterly dosing group. Although the threshold was not reached, a minimal clinically important difference has not beenestablished for this particular outcome. Compared to placebo, greater MMD reductions were also observed in patients who were prescribed fremanezumab- vfrm 225 mg ( mean change vs placebo, 1.3) and 675 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.1) as monotherapy. Fremanezumab- vfrm significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMD (difference for 225 mg vs placebo, 19.8%; OR, 2.36; difference for 675 mg vs placebo, 16.5%; OR, 2.06) . Additionally, fremanezumab- vfrm was associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 225 mg vs placebo, 1.4; difference for 675 mg vs placebo,1.3) (Dodick et al 2018[b] ). F OCUS was a DB, PC, Phase 3b trial that evaluated 838 patients with episodic (39%) or chronic migraine (61%) who had previously not responded to 2 to 4 classes of migraine preventive medications . Of the patients enrolled, approximately 40% were classified as having episodic migraines and randomized to fremanezumab- vfrm 225 mg administered monthly with no loading dose (n = 110/283), fremanezumab- vfrm 675 mg administered quarterly (n = 107/276) , or placebo (n = 112/279) for 12 weeks. Failure was defined as no clinically meaningful improvement after at least 3 months of therapy at a stable dose, as per the treating physician's judgment, discontinuation because of adverse events that made treatment intolerable, or treatment contraindicated or unsuitable for the preventive treatment of migraine for the patient. At baseline, the MMD w as approximately 14.2 days and the MMHD (of at least moderate severity) was 12.6 days . For the overall population, the MMD reduction over 12 weeks was 0.6 (standard error [SE], 0.3) days for placebo, 4.1 (SE, 0.34) days for the monthly fremanezumab- vfrm group (least squares mean difference [LSMD] vs placebo , -3.5; 95% CI, - 4.2 to - 2.8 days; p < 0.0001) , and 3.7 (SE, 0.3) for days for the quarterly fremanezumab- vfrm group (LSMD vs placebo, - 3.1; 95% CI, - 3.8 to - 2.4 days; p < 0.0001) . For episodic migraine and compared to placebo, the LSMD in MMD reduction over 12 weeks was 3.1 days for both dose groups ( fremanezumab- vfrm monthly : to - 2.2 days; p < 0.0001 for both). In the overall population, the proportions of patients with a 50% response over 12 weeks were 34% in both the quarterly and monthly fremanezumab- vfrm groups vs 9% with placebo (p < 0.0001). Only the monthly fremanezumab- vfrm arm achieved a 75% sustained responder rate that was statistically different from placebo (OR, 8.6; 95% CI, 2.0 to 37.9; p = 0.0045). Adverse events were similar for placebo and fremanezumab- vfrm. Serious adverse events were reported in 4 (1%) of 277 patients with placebo, 4 (1%) of 285 with monthly fremanezumab- vfrm, and 2 (< 1%) of 276 with ( Ferrari et al 2019). Galcanezumab- gnlm The EVOLVE- 1 and EVOLVE -2 trials were 6- month, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trials in 858 and 915 patients with episodic migraine, respectively. Patients were randomized to placebo (EVOLVE -1, n = 433; EVOLVE -2, n = 461), galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg once monthly (EVOLVE- 1, n = 213; EVOLVE -2, n = 231), or galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg once monthly (EVOLVE- 1, n = 212; EVOLVE -2, n = 223). Patients in the galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg group received a loading dose of 240 mg at the first injection only. The EVOLVE -1 trial included a North American population and the EVOLVE -2 trial included a global population. The primary endpoint was the change in mean monthly migraine headache days (MMHD) (Stauffer et al 2018, Skljarevski et al 2018).Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 36 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In EVOLVE- 1, the primary endpoint outcome favored treatment with galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.5 to 1.4; p < 0.001) and galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.8; 95% CI, 2.3 to 1.2; p < 0.001). Galcanezumab- gnlm significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMHD (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 23.7%; OR, 2. 64; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 22.3%; OR, 2. 50). Compared to placebo, 9.4% more patients treated with galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg and 9.4% more treated with galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg reported a 100% reduction in MMHD, or migraine cessation. Galcanezumab- gnlm was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 1.8; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 1. 6) (Stauffer et al 2018). In EVOLVE- 2, the primary endpoint outcome favored treatment with galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg (mean change vs placebo, 2.0; 95% CI, 2.6 to 1.5; p < 0.001) and galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.4 to 1.4; p < 0.001). Galcanezumab- gnlm significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMHD (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 23.0%; OR, 2.54; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 21.0%; OR, 2.34) . Compared to placebo, 5.8% more patients treated with galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg and 8.1% more treated with galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg reported migraine cessation. Galcanezumab- gnlm was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 1.8; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 1.7) (Skljarevski et al 2018). In an analysis of persistence for patients with episodic migraine, 41.5 and 41.1% of galcanezumab -gnlm- treated patients (120mg and 240mg, respectively) had a 50% response for 3 months, which was greater than placebo (21.4%; p<0.001). Approximately 6% of galcanezumab- gnlm- treated patients maintained 75% response all 6 months vs 2% of placebo- treated patients. Few galcanezumab- gnlm- treated patients maintained 100% response for all 6 months (< 1.5%) (F\u00f6rderreuther et al 2018). Prevention of chronic migrai ne Eptinezumab- jjmr The PROMISE -2 trial was a 12- week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial in which 1121 patients with chronic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 366), eptinezumab- jjmr 100 mg (n = 356), or eptinezumab- jjmr 300 mg (n = 350) once every 12 weeks (or quarterly). The primary endpoint was the change in mean MMD . Treatment with eptinezumab 100 and 300 mg was associated with significant reductions in MMDs across weeks 1 to 12 compared with placebo (placebo 5.6; 100 mg 7.7, p < 0.0001; 300mg 8.2, p < 0.0001). The odds for a 50% reduction in MMD were approximately 2.1 to 2.4 times higher with eptinezumab- jjmr than placebo ( Lipton et al 2020). Erenumab- aooe Erenumab- aooe was studied in a 12 week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 2 trial in which 667 patients with chronic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 286), erenumab aooe 70 mg (n = 191), or erenumab aooe 140 mg (n = 190) once monthly. The primary endpoint was the change in MMD from baseline to weeks 9 to 12, which favored treatment with erenumab aooe 70 mg and erenumab aooe 140 mg (mean change for both doses vs placebo, 2.5; 95% CI, 3.5 to 1.4; p < 0.0001). Erenumab aooe significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMD (difference for 70 mg vs placebo, 17% ; OR, 2.2; difference for 140 mg vs placebo, 18% ; OR, 2.3). Both erenumab aooe 70 mg (difference, 1.9) and erenumab aooe 140 mg (difference, 2.6) significantly reduced the mean acute migraine specific medication days; however, the higher 140 mg dose had a greater reduction numerically over placebo and reductions may be dose dependent ( Tepper et al 2017). An analysis of patient reported outcomes found patients with chronic migraine had clinically relevant improvement s across a range of measures. Improvements were observed at month 3 for all endpoints regardless of erenumabaooe dose, and minimally important clinical differences were achieved for certain measures with the erenumabaooe 140 mg dose ( Lipton et al 2019[b] MC, Phase 3 trial, HALO -CM, in which 1130 patients with chronic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 375), fremanezumab- vfrm 225 mg once monthly (n = 379), or fremanezumab- vfrm 675 mg once quarterly (n = 376). Patients in the fremanezumab- vfrm 225 mg group received a loading dose of 675 mg at the first injection only. The primary endpoint was the change in mean headache days (MHD) , which favored treatment with fremanezumab- vfrm 225 mg (mean change vs placebo, 2.1; SE, \u00b1 0.3; p < 0.001) and fremanezumab- vfrm mg (mean change vs SE, \u00b1 0.3; p < 0.001). Fremanezumab- vfrm significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in M HD (difference for 225 mg vs placebo, 22.7%; OR,Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 37 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Additionally, fremanezumab- vfrm was associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 225 mg vs placebo, 2.3; difference for 675 mg vs placebo, 1. 8) (Silberstein et al 2017). FOCUS was previously described as including 838 patients overall who had not responded to 2 to 4 classes of migraine preventive medications. Of the patients enrolled, 61% were diagnosed with chronic migraine and were randomized tofremanezumab- vfrm 675 mg administered quarterly (n = 169/276), a fremanezumab- vfrm 675 mg loading dose followed by 225 mg administered monthly (n = 173/283) , or placebo (n = 167/279) . Among patients classified as having chronic migraine and compared to placebo, the LSMD in MMD reduction over 12 weeks was 3.8 days for the fremanezumab- vfrm monthly group and 3.2 days for the group (fremanezumab- vfrm days; p < both) (Ferrari et al gnlm was evaluated in a 12-week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial, REGAIN, in which 1113 patients with chronic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 558), galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg once monthly (n = 278), or galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg once monthly (n = 277). Patients in the galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg group received a loading dose of 240 mg at the first injection only. The primary endpoint was the change in MMHD, which favored treatment with galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg (mean change vs placebo, 2.1; 95% CI, 2.9 to 1.3; p < 0.001) and galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.7 to 1.1; p < 0.001). Galcanezumab- gnlm significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMHD (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 12.2%; OR, 2. 10; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 12 .1%; OR, 2. 10). Compared to placebo, 0.2% more patients treated with galcanezumab -gnlm 120 mg and 0.8% more treated with galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg reported migraine cessation; this w as not statistically different for either dose group. Galcanezumab- gnlm was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 2.5; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 2.1) ( Detke et al 2018). In an analysis of persistence for patients with chronic migraine, 29% of galcanezumab -gnlm- treated patients maintained 30% response all 3months compared to 16% of placebo- treated patients. A total of 16.8 and 14.6% of galcanezumab -gnlm -treated patients (120mg and 240mg, respectively) had a 50% response for 3 months, which was greater than placebo (6.3%; p<0.001). Few patients maintained 75% response (< 3%) (F\u00f6rderreuther et al 2018). Treatment of episodic cluster headache Galcanezumab- gnlm Galcanezumab- gnlm was evaluated in an 8- week, DB trial, in which 106 patients with episodic cluster headache were randomized to placebo (n = 57) or galcanezumab- gnlm 300 mg once monthly (n = 49). A total of 90 (85%) patients completed the DB phase. Patients were allowed to use certain specified acute/ abortive cluster headache treatments, including triptans, oxygen, acetaminophen (APAP) , and NSAIDs during the study. At baseline, patients had a mean of 17.5 headache attacks/week, maximum of 8 attacks/day, minimum of 1 attack every other day, and at least 4 attacks during the prospective 7- day baseline period. For the primary endpoint, galcanezumab- gnlm significantly decreased the mean change from baseline in weekly cluster headache attack frequency during weeks 1 to 3 vs placebo ( -8.7 vs - 5.2 attacks; p = 0.036). Galcanezumab- gnlm was also associated with a significantly greater proportion of responders ( 50% reduction in weekly cluster headache attack frequency) at week 3 (71.4 vs 52.6%; p = 0.046) . Adverse events did not differ between groups, except for a significant increase in the incidence of injection- site pain with galcanezumab- gnlm treated patients (8 vs [NCT02397473] 2020 , Emgality prescribing information 2019, Goadsby et al 2019). Treatment of acute migraine (with or without aura) Rimegepant ODT Rimegepant ODT was evaluated in a Phase 3, DB, MC, PC, randomized controlled trial ( RCT) in 1466 patients (modified intention to treat, n = 1351) with migraine with or without aura. Patients were randomized to placebo (n = 682) or rimegepant ODT 75 mg (n = 669) and were not allowed a second dose of study t reatment . Rescue medications allowed 2 hours post -dose included aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen (or any other type baclofen. Approximately 14% patients were takingData as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 38 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The co- primary endpoints were pain freedom and most bothersome symptom (MBS) freedom at 2 hours post -dose. Among patients randomized, 92.2% were included in the efficacy analysis and 93.8% in the safety analysis (Croop et al 2019 , Nurtec ODT [dossier] 2020, Nurtec ODT prescribing information 2020). The percentage of patients achieving headache pain freedom and MBS freedom 2 hours after a single dose was statistically significantly greater in patients who received rimegepant ODT compared to those who received placebo. Pain-free at 2 hour s: 21.2% for rimegepant ODT 75 mg vs 10.9% for placebo (p < 0.0001) MBS -free at 2 hours : 35.1 % for rimegepant ODT 75 mg vs 26.8% for placebo ( p = 0.0009) Out of the 21 secondary endpoints tested hierarchically, significant results were achieved for the first 19 endpoints. Those endpoints that were considered not significant included freedom from nausea at 2 hours post -dose, and pain relapse from 2 to 48 hours. The most common adverse events were nausea and urinary tract infection. No serious adverse events were reported. Three additional trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of rimegepant 75 mg in an oral tablet (non- ODT) formulation were considered supportive for approval. A MC, DB, dose- ranging trial using an adaptive design was conducted to determine an effective and tolerable dose range of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. A total of 885 adults with migraine with or without aura were randomized to 1 of 6 rimegepant dose groups (10, 25, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg), sumatriptan 100 mg, or placebo. It was found that the proportion of patients who were pain- free 2 hours after receiving a single dose of rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet was significantly higher compared with placebo (31.4% [n = 27/86] vs 15.3% [n = 31/203]; p = 0.002). The most common adverse events were nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. No treatment -related serious AEs were reported ( Marcus et al 2014). A MC, DB, PC, Phase 3 trial (n = 1072 in efficacy analysis) evaluating rimegepant vs placebo for acute migraine treatment found that the proportion of patients who were pain- free 2 hours after receiving a single dose of rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet was significantly higher compared with placebo (19.6 vs 12.0%; absolute difference, 7.6%; 95% CI, 3.3 to 11.9; p < 0.001). In addition, the proportion of patients who were free from their MBS 2 hours post -dose was significantly higher with rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet compared with placebo (37.6 vs 25.2%; absolute difference, 12.4%; 95% CI, 6.9 to 17.9; p < 0.001). Nausea and urinary tract infection were the only AEs reported in > 1% of the patients in the rimegepant and placebo groups . A serious adverse event associated with rimegepant was back pain (n = 1) ( Lipton et al 2019[c] , Nurtec ODT [dossier] 2020). A MC, DB, PC, Phase 3 trial (n = 1084 in efficacy analysis) evaluating rimegepant vs placebo for acute migraine treatment found that the proportion of patients who were pain- free 2 hours after receiving a single dose of rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet was significantly higher compared with placebo (19.2 vs 14.2%; p = 0.03). In addition, the proportion of patients who were free from their MBS 2 hours post -dose was significantly higher with rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet compared with placebo (36.6 vs 27.7%; p = 0.002). Nausea and dizziness were the most common adverse event s reported in the rimegepant and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in 2 patients treated with rimegepant and 1 patient treated with placebo ( Lipton et al 2018 [poster] , Nurtec ODT [dossier] 2020) . Ubrogepant Ubrogepant was evaluated in 2 Phase 3, PC, DB trials (ACHIEVE I and II) , in which 3358 patients (ACHIEVE I, n = 1672; ACHIEVE II, n =1686) were randomized to take 1 dose of placebo (n = 1122), ubrogepant 50 mg (n = 1118), or ubrogepant 100 mg (n = 557 ) (100 mg was evaluated in the ACHIEVE I trial only , and a 25 mg group was included in the ACHIEVE II trial only [n = 561]) . Patients had 2 to 8 migraines/month with moderate to severe pain i ntensity in the past 3 months either with or without aura and had a history of migraine for 1 year. A second dose of study treatment (placebo or ubrogepant), or the patient's usual acute treatment for migraine, was allowed between 2 to 48 hours after the initial treatment for a non- responding or recurrent migraine headache. At baseline, 23% of patients were taking preventive medications for migraine, and approximately 23 to 27% were insufficient triptan responders . In ACHIEVE I, 79% were included in the e fficacy analysis and 86% in the safety analysis, and in ACHIEVE II, 91.7% had a qualifying migraine event and 88% were included in the analysis ( Dodick et al 2019, Lipton et al 2019[a] , Ubrelvy prescribing information 2019). Compared to placebo, significant improvement s were demonstrated for the co- primary endpoints of pain freedom and the MBS freedom at 2 hours post -dose in the ubrogepant arms. MBS was a collection of selective, self -identified symptoms (ie, photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea). The following differences from placebo were demonstrated:Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 39 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Pain-free at 2 hours : 7.4% (p = 0.002) and 7.5% (p = 0.007) for the ubrogepant 50 mg dose in ACHIEVE I and II trials, respectively, and 9.4% (p < 0.001) for ubrogepant 100 mg dose in ACHIEVE I trial. MBS -free at 2 hours : 10.8% and 11.5% (p < 0.001 for both) for the ubrogepant 50 mg dose in ACHIEVE I and II trials, respectively, and 9.9% (p < 0.001) for ubrogepant 100 mg dose in ACHIEVE I trial . The incidence of photo- and phonophobia w as reduced following administration. Significantly more patients maintained pain freedom for 2 to 24 hours post -dose in the ubrogepant 100 mg arm (difference from placebo, 6.8%; p = 0.002) and the 50 mg arm for ACHI EVE II only (6.2%; p = 0.005). In ACHIEVE I, the most common adverse events included nausea (1.5 to 4.7%), somnolence (0.6 to 2.5%), and dry mouth (0.6 to 2.1%). In ACHIEVE II, the most common adverse events within 48 hours were nausea ( 2.5% for all arms) and dizziness ( 2.1% for all arms). No serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported 48 hours after the initial dose. In ACHIEVE II, the serious adverse events at 30 days included appendicitis, spontaneous abortion, pericardial effusion, and seizure. Open -label extensions (OLE) and long -term safety studies One published OLE with data to 1 year and 1 unpublished abstract with data to 3 years evaluated erenumab- aooe 70 mg (protocol amended to include 140 mg doses) in patients with episodic migraine. Of 472 patients in the parent study, 308 patients completed 1 year of open- label (OL) treatment. For the 3 year assessment, of the 383 patients enrolled in the OLE, 250 continued into the 140 mg once monthly dosing. At the time of interim analysis, 236 patients remained inthe OLE ( Amgen [data on file] 2018, Ashina et al 2017, Ashina et al 2018). There may be greater improvements with sustained therapy based on a 1- year OLE interim analysis of episodic migraine patients treated with erenumab- aooe 70 mg once monthly. Patients had a mean value of 8.8 MMDs at parent study baseline. After 3 months of treatment in the parent study, the number of MMDs was reduced to 6.3 days (mean change of 2.5 days). After a total of 16 months of treatment, the number of MMDs was reduced to 3.7 days (mean change of 5.1 days). After 64 weeks, 65% (n = 184) of episodic migraine patients achieved a 50% reductionin MMD s and 26% (n = 73) had achieved a migraine- free status . The most frequently reported adverse events ( 4.0 per 100 patient -years) were viral upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, influenza, and back pain. One unpublished OLE evaluated erenumab- aooe 70 mg (protocol amended to include 140 mg doses) with data to 1 year in patients with chronic migraine. A total of 609 patients with chronic migraine enrolled in the OLE. A total of 199 increased their dose from 70 mg to 140 mg by week 28 ( Amgen [data on file] 2018, Tepper et al 2018) . Patients with chronic migraine had a mean value of 18.8 MMDs at parent study baseline. After a total of 1 year of treatment, the number of MMDs was reduced to 8.5 in the erenumab- aooe 70 mg group and 10.5 in the erenumab- aooe 140 mg group. After 1 year of erenumab- aooe 70 mg and 140 mg monthly dosing, a total of 53% and 67% of chronic migraine patients achieved a 50% reduction in MMDs and 6% and 13% had achieved a migraine- free status, re spectively. The most frequently reported adverse events ( 2.0 per 100 patient -years) were viral upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, and arthralgia. Another unpublished safety study, the CGAJ study, evaluated galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg (plus 240 mg loading dose) and 240 mg monthly dosing to 1 year in patients with episodic or chronic migraine. At baseline, 80.7% of patients in the galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg arm and 77.0% in the galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg arm had episodic migraine. A total of 270 patients who had a history of 4 MMHDs and 1 headache- free day/month for the past 3 months continued galcanezumab- gnlm treatment ( Eli Lilly and Company [data on 2018, Emgality [dossier] 2018, Stauffer et al 2017) . At baseline, patients had a mean value of 9.7 to 11.4 (standard deviation [SD], 6.0 to 6.6) MMHDs. After a total of 1 year of treatment, the number of MMHDs was reduced to 5.6 days in the galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg group and 6.5 days in the galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg group. After 12 consecutive months of treatment, 24.2% of patients treated with galcanezumab- gnlm 120 mg and 34.8% of patients treated with galcanezumab- gnlm 240 mg maintained response. The most frequently reported adverse events (incidence 15.0%) were injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections. One patient discontinued due to suicidal ideation in the galcanezumab- gnlm 120mg group. There were no overall concerns regarding safety or tolerability. The l ong-term safety of ubrogepant was evaluated in 813 patients with intermittent dosing administered for up to 1 year in an OLE. Of the 813 patients, 421 patients were exposed to ubrogepant 50 mg or 100 mg for 6 months, and 364 patients were exposed for 1 year. All patients were treated for 2 migraine attacks/month, on average. In the OLE, 2.5% of patients withdrew from ubrogepant treatment because of an adverse reaction.

Rimegepant 75 mg was evaluated in an unpublished interim analysis of a long- term safety study which evaluated 1784 patients for up to 52 weeks. The most frequently reported adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection (8.5%) and nasopharyngitis (6.4%). There were no deaths, and the rates of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of rimegepant were low (2.5% and 2.7%, respectively). No clinically relevant trends in laboratory abnormalities were observed on- treatment or during follow up ( Nurtec ODT dossier 2020). Caution should be exercised in applying results from extension trials. The OL design may contribute to biased reports. Extension trials may have biased outcomes because those experiencing benefit are included in extension trials; results are useful for reporting trends in treatment. Additionally, there is no comparator to account for placebo effects. CLINICAL GUIDELINES Acute treatment of migraine The American Headache Society (AHS) published updated consensus statement guidelines for migraine in 2018. The AHS recommends the use NSAIDs , non- opioid analgesics, or or moderate attacks. The triptans or dihydroergotamine (DHE) are recommended for moderate or severe attacks as well asfor mild attacks that respond poorly to other analgesics. These guidelines do not differentiate the triptans, butrecommend that non- oral routes be used when severe nausea or vomiting is present. Overall, the AHS designated the following drugs as having efficacy (AHS 2019): Established although use i s not recommended) Combination medications Probably effective Ergotamine or other forms of DHE NSAIDs rimegepant and ubrogepant may have a role in patients who have contraindications to the use of triptans or who have failed to respond to or tolerate 2 oral triptans, as determined by either a validated acute treatment patient reported outcome questionnaire or healthcare provider attestation. Coverage should be pr ovided until 2 attacks are treated to determine efficacy and tolerability. Other agents have had more established efficacy and safety relative to the newly FDA -approved migraine agents. There are a number of older guidelines/treatment recommendations for the treatment of migraine but, similar to the 2018 guidelines, they do not state a preference for a particular triptan or therapy ( Evers et al 2009, Francis et al 2010, Marmura et al 2015, Silberstein 2000, Silberstein et al 2012 [guideline reaffirmed in 2015] ). In 2019, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the AHS published a guideline on the acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents. The guideline states that there is evidence to support the efficacy of ibuprofen, APAP (in children and adolescents), and triptans (mainly in adolescents) for migraine relief, although confidence in the evidence varies between agents (Oskoui et al 2019 [a]). Of note, the CGRP inhibitors have not been adequately studied in children or adolescent s and are not currently FDA- approved for use in these populations . Prevention of migraine According to the AAN/AHS e vidence based guideline update on the pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults , the following medications are effective preventive treatment options (see Appendix A for a definition of classifications) (Silberstein et al 2012 ): Level A (established efficacy and > 2 Class I trials): Antiepileptic drugs : divalproex sodium, sodium valproate, and topiramateData as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 41 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full presc ribing information and published resources when making medical Beta blockers : [MRM]): or short term prophylaxis, frovatriptan Level B (probably effecti ve and 1 Class I or 2 Class II trials): Antidepressants: a mitriptyline term prophylaxis, naratriptan and zolmitriptan Level C (possibly effective and 1 II trial): Angiotensin converting enzyme The AAN recommends onabotulinumtoxin A as an effective treatment option that should be offered for chronic migraine. However, onabotulinumtoxin A is considered ineffective for the treatment of episodic migraines and should not be offered. There is insufficient evidence to compare the effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxin A with that of oralprophylactic topiramate ( Simpson et al 2016) . In 2019, the AAN/AHS published a guideline on the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. The guideline states that the majority of preventive medications for pediatric migraine fail to demonstrate superiority to placebo. Theguidelines make the following statements and recommendations for initial therapy (see Appendix B for a definition ofclassifications) (Oskoui et al 2019[ b]): It is possible that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone is effective in migraine prevention. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effects of flunarizine, nimodipine, valproate, and onabotulinumtoxinA for use in migraine prevention in children and adolescents. Acknowledg ing the limitations of currently available evidence, use of short -term treatment trials (a minimum of 2 months) may be warranted in those who could benefit from preventive treatment (Level B) . Consider amitriptyline combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (inform of the potential adverse events, including risk of suicide) (Level B). Consider topiramate (Level B). Inform of side effects including decreased efficacy when combined with oral contraceptives and the teratogenic effect in patients of childbearing potential (Level A ). In patients of childbearing potential, daily folic acid is recommended (Level A). Consider propranolol (Level B ). Of note, the CGRP inhibitors have not been adequately studied in children or adolescent s and are not currently FDA-approved for use in these populations . Cluster headache According to the AHS evidence- based guidelines for the treatment of cluster head ache, there are a number of effective treatment options (AAN classifications were used for grading; see Appendix A for definitions) (Robbins et al 2016) . For acute therapy of cluster headache, the following therapy options have positive evidence: Level A (established efficacy and 2 Class I trials): Certain triptans: s umatriptan subcutaneous and zolmitriptan nasal spray Oxygen Level B (probably effective and 1 Class I or 2 Class II trials): Certain triptans: s umatriptan nasal spray and zolmitriptan oral Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation Level C (possibly effective and 1 Class II trial): Cocaine/lidocaine nasal spray Octreotide subcutaneous For preventive therapy of cluster headache, the following therapy options have positive evidence: Level A (established efficacy and 2 Class I trials): Suboccipital steroid injection Level B (probably effective and 1 Class I or 2 Class II trials): Civamide nasal spray (not marketed in the US)Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 42 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Level C (possibly effective and 1 Class II t rial): Lithium Verapamil Warfarin Melatonin SAFETY SUMMARY Ubrogepant is patients with serious hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the excipients. Mild to moderate hypersensitivity reactions ( eg, rash, dyspnea, pruritus, urticaria) were reported in trials. Cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema h ave been reported post -marketing. Delayed serious hypersensitivity has occurred with rimegepant. In cases of serious or severe reactions, treatment should be discontinued. Warnings and precautions associated with the CGRP inhibitors include hypersensitivit y reactions. Erenumab- aooe has additional warnings and precautions associated with the following: Constipation with serious complications: C onstipation with serious complications has been reported post-marketing. Some cases have required hospitalization, including surgery. Constipation was a common adverse event reported inup to 3% of patients. Concurrent use of medication associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may increase the risk for severe constipation. Hypertension: Post -marketing reports of the development or worsening of hypertension have emerged. Some cases required pharmacological treatment to manage or , in other cases, hospitalization. Incidences of hypertension were most frequently reported within 7 days of treatment, and most cases were reported after the first dose. The CGRP inhibitors generally have a similar incidence of adverse events as placebo. Very few severe adverse event s and treatment discontinuations due to adverse events were reported. Across studies, adverse events were generally mild and/or similar to placebo. The most common adverse events observed in studies of injectable CGRP inhibitors included injection site reactions (subcutaneous the oral CGRP inhibitors, ubrogepant was associated with somnolence, and both ubrogepant and rimegepant were associated with nausea. CGRP is a vasodilator and is found at higher concentrations during a migraine attack. In the 1- year interim analysis of an OLE study with erenumab- aooe, 2 patients had severe adverse events (a fatal arteriosclerosis event and a myocardial ischemia event confounded by sumatriptan administration) . No additional concerns were raised within the OLE at 3 years, including any CV events . In a long- term safety study of patients treated with galcanezumab- gnlm for 1 year, 1 patient discontinued due to suicidal ideation in the galcanezumab- gnlm 120mg group. In a safety study of eptinezumab-j jmr in which 90.2% of patients were exposed to the drug for 6 months and 47.7% were exposed for 12 months, the most common adverse events observed were nasopharyngitis and hypersensitivity. A total of 9 patients reported serious adverse events with ubrogepant 50 mg (sinus tachycardia, intestinal obstruction, gait disturbance, cholelithiasis, acute cholecystitis, allergy, pneumonia, pelvic inflammatory disease, post -procedure infection, hypertensive crisis, and a substance- induced mood disorder) and 12 w ith ubrogepant 100 mg (colitis, hiatus hernia, acute pancreatitis, non- cardiac ectopic pregnancy, suicidal ideation, and acute respiratory failure) ; however, not all events may be related to treatment. In an interim analysis of an OL, 52- week safety study of rimegepant, the most frequently reported adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. There were no deaths, and the rates of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of rimegepant were low. The long- term implications of prolonged CGRP inhibition are not fully established and safety has not been fully characterized (Amgen [data on file] 2018, Ashina et al 2017, Ashina et al 2018, Clinicaltri als.gov [NCT02873221] 2020, Eli and Company [data on file] 2018, Nurtec ODT [dossier] 2020, Stauffer et al 2017, Tepper et al 2018, Vyepti prescribing information 2020) .

A benefit/risk assessment should be taken into consideration prior to administering. CONCLUSION Migraine is a common, recurrent, incapacitating disorder characterized by moderate to severe headaches and disabling features, including nausea, vomiting, neurologic symptoms, photophobia, and phonophobia. Migraines have a spectrum of frequency and severity that can significantly affect the quality of life of patients . Cluster headache is less prevalent than migraine and characterized by attacks of severe, unilateral pain with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms, which occur every other day to multiple times daily during a cluster period. Cluster headache is more likely to occur in men , whereas migraines are more likely to occur in women. Rimegepant and ubrogepant are oral CGRP inhibitors indicated for acute treatment of migraine with or without aura . prevention of migraine. Galcanezumab- gnlm has an additional indication for the treatment of episodic cluster headache. No CGRP inhibitor is FDA -approved for use in patients aged < 18 years. Eptinezumab- jjmr is the only IV formulation and requires administration in a healthcare setting. Guidelines divide treatment recommendations according to age, prevention or treatment, and migraine type: Current evidence based prophylactic migraine treatment options and guidance are limited for chronic migraine, and oral prophylactic medications prescribed for episodic migraine are often used for the preventive treatment of chronicmigraine. Prophylactic migraine treatment options include oral agents (mainly anti seizure agents, antidepr essants, and beta blockers), injectable agents (onabotulinumtoxin A for chronic subtypes only), or neuromodulation devices formigraine or headache attacks. Certain oral therapies may not be appropriate for individual patients due to intolerability or eventual lack of efficacy. There is no optimal prophylactic migraine therapy and head- to-head trials are lacking. the treatment of cluster headache, subcutaneous sumatriptan, zolmitriptan nasal spray, and oxygen have the most positive evidence for acute therapy according to the AHS guidelines. To date, only subcutaneous sumatriptan is FDA-approved for the acute treatment of cluster headache. Additionally, sumatriptan nasal spray, zolmitriptan oral formulations, and sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation are probably effective for acute treatment per guidelines . For prevention of cluster headaches, suboccipital steroid injections are most effective according to the guidelines; however, there is no preventive medication currently FDA -approved for cluster headache .Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 45 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full presc ribing information and published resources when making medical decis ions. For acute treatment of migraine in adults, guidelines generally recommend the use of APAP, NSAIDs, non- opioid analgesics, or caffeinated analgesic combinations for mild or moderate attacks. The triptans or DHE are recommended for moderate or severe attacks as well as for mild attacks that respond poorly to other analgesics. Recent AHS guidelines state that rimegepant and ubrogepant may have a role in patients who have contraindications to the use of triptans or who have failed to respond to or tolerate 2 oral triptans. There are no head- to-head studies with the CGRP inhibitors and no agent is clearly superior to others. Evidence for the CGRP inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy for the respective indications: Like other preventive medications for migraine, the CGRP inhibitors are not likely to render patients migraine- free. Based on 3 to 6 month data, primary endpoint reductions are similar to many oral prophylactic therapies; however, comparisons are limited as endpoints have been inconsistently defined. There are limited analyses and trials examining efficacy in patients who failed 2 prior preventive therapies; however, available data suggest that these patients may achieve greater reductions in migraine/headache frequency. Further research is warranted. Compared to placebo, the CGRP inhibitors when prescribed for prophylactic migraine therapy consistently demonstrated modest but statistically significant reductions in primary endpoint measures (eg, MMD , MMH, or MMHD) ranging from 0.7 to 3 .5 days after 3 to 6 months of treatment . Overall, the odds for a 50% reduction in MM(H )D were approximately 1.6 to 5.8 times higher with the CGRP inhibitors than placebo with numbers -needed to treat (NNTs) ranging from 3 to 10. For the treatment of cluster headaches, galcanezumab -gnlm demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo in an 8- week trial, which allowed for acute/abortive treatments during therapy. Galcanezumab- gnlm significantly decreased the mean change from baseline in weekly cluster headache attack frequency by 3.5 during weeks 1 to 3 vs placebo. Additionally, 18.8% more patients were classified as responders ( 50% reduction in weekly cluster headache attack frequency) with galcanezumab- gnlm at week 3 vs placebo (p = 0.046). Ubrogepant and rimegepant are oral CGRP inhibitors FDA- approved for acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. One differing characteristic is that ubrogepant allow s for a second dose within 24 hours whereas rimegepant does not. Rimegepant ODT demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo in a Phase 3 , DB, RCT which evaluated acute response to migraine treatment after 2 hours. Patients were not allowed a second dose of study treatment (placebo or rimegepant). Rescue medications allowed 2 hours post -dose included aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen (or any other type mg/day, antiemetics (eg, metoclopramide or promethazine), or baclofen. Compared to placebo, significantly more patients treated with rimegepant 75 mg were pain- free at 2 hours (difference vs placebo, 10.3% ). For the co -primary endpoint of MBS, significantly more rimegepant -treated patients reported being MBS -free at 2 hours post -dose (difference vs placebo, 8.3% ). Three additional trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of rimegepant 75 mg in an oral tablet formulation were considered supportive for approval. Ubrogepant demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo in 2 DB, RCTs, which reported acute response to migraine treatment after 2 hours. A second dose of study treatment (placebo or ubrogepant), or the patient's usual acute treatment for migraine, was allowed between 2 to 48 hours after the initial treatment for a non- responding or recurrent migraine headache. Compared to placebo, significantly more patients treated with ubrogepant were pain- free at 2 hours when administered the 50 mg (difference vs placebo, 7.4 to 7.5%) or 100 mg (difference vs placebo, 9.4%) dose. For the co- primary endpoint of MBS, significantly more ubrogepant -treated patients reported being MBS -free at 2 hours post dose for the 50 mg (difference vs placebo, 10.8 to 11.5%) and 100 mg (difference vs placebo, 9.9%) dose. Lack of information during pregnancy and breastfeeding is a consideration as many migraine patients are women of childbearing potential. The unknown risks of monoclonal antibodies and the effects on certain conditions are not fully characterized. Furthermore, rimegepant and ubrogepant have a number of drug interactions, and may not be appropriate with other medications. Important co- morbid populations were excluded from trials (eg, anxiety, depression, hypertension, and fibromyalgia), which also limits the generalizability to broader groups. There are no data in adolescents and children. The safety profiles of the subcutaneous CGRP inhibitors are generally mild with the most common adverse event s observed being injection site reactions . Hypersensitivity and nasopharyngitis were the most commonly reported adverse event s for the IV -administered agent, eptinezumab- jjmr. Mild to moderate hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pruritus, drug hypersensitivity, and urticaria, were reported with all CGRP inhibitors. Post-marketing reports with erenumab- aooe have included hypertension and constipation with serious complications ; some cases of constipation have required hospitalization and surgery. The oral CGRP inhibitors, ubrogepant and rimegepant, were associated with nausea; ubrogepant was additionally associated with somnolence.Data as of May 1, 2020 AVD/AKS Page 46 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Overall, ubrogepant and rimegepant are alternatives to triptans and/or DHE in patients who are unable to tolerate or have an inadequate response or contraindication to established pharmacologic abortive migraine treatments. The injectable CGRP inhibitors represent another therapy option in the prevention of episodic or chronic migraine. Eptinezumab- jjmr and fremanezumab- vfrm are the only agent s in the class that may be administered quarterly, which may fulfill a niche in patients who are non- adherent with treatment. Galcanezumab- gnlm is the only CGRP inhibitor indicated for the treatment of episodic cluster headaches. Dosage and administration vary by product and indication . Further long- term study is warranted. APPENDICES Appendix A.

New Drug Overview Palforzia (peanut [ Arachis hypogaea ] allergen powder -dnfp) INTRODUCTION The United States (U.S.) National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) defines food allergy as an \" adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food\" (Boyce et al 2010). Food allergy reactions may include symptoms ranging from oral pruritus and gastrointestinal (GI), ocular, oropharynx, respiratory, and cardiovascular/neurological effects to acute urticaria/angioedema which can progress to more serioussequelae such as anaphylaxis, hypotension, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( Burks et al 2012, Food an d D rug Administration [FDA] Allergenic Products Advisory Committee [ APAC] bri efing document 2019, Pajno et el 2018). Peanut allergy is the most common food allergy in children in the U.S. It affects approximately 1.6 million children wit h an es timated prevalence of 2.2%; this has increased from 0.4% in 1997 ( FDA summary basis for regulatory action 2020, Gupta et al 2018, Sicherer and Sampson 201 4). Some food allergies (eg, milk, egg, wheat, soy) have a high rate of resolving with age, whereas others (eg, peanut, tree nut, seeds, shellfish) typically persist over time. It is estimated that only 20% of children with peanut allergy outgrow the condition ( FDA summary basis for regulatory action 2020, Muraro et al 2014, Sicherer and Samps on 2018 ). Peanut allergy is the leading cause of food- induced anaphylaxis; one study estimated an annual 12.4% incidence of accidental exposures in peanut -allergic children ( Cherkaoui et al 2015, FDA summary basis for regulatory acti on 2020 ). Peanut has been reported to be associated with food allergy death in 35 of 91 persons from 2010 to 2019 (Pepper et al 2020). The primary approach to managing food allergies is allergen avoidance ( Boyce et al 2010). However, despite avoidance, accidental exposure may occur and can potentially be serious and life- threatening due to anaphylaxis ( Cherkaoui et al 2015) . To manage symptoms after accidental exposure, epinephrine is used first -line for suspected or confirme d anap hylaxis, while antihistamines can be used for mild symptoms ( Boyce et al 2010) . Another approach for managing peanut allergy involves preventive measures. The Learning Early about Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial demonstrated that introduction of peanut -containing foods to infants at high risk for developing peanut allergy was safe and led to an 81% relative reduction in the subsequent development of peanut allergy (Du Toit et a l 2015 , Togias et al 2017). Immunotherapy, including oral immunotherapy ( OIT), has also been investigated for treatment of food allergy and i nvolves the delivery of increasing doses of a specific allergen to increase the threshold of reaction while on therapy (also known as desensitization) ( Chinthrajah et al 2019, Institute for Clinical and Economic Review [ ICER] 2019, Paj no et al 2018) . The goal of immunotherapy is to decrease the likelihood of life- threatening reactions to accidental exposures rather than induce full tolerance ( FDA APAC briefing document 2019). Clinical trials have found substantial benefit for patients with peanut allergy undergoing OIT with respect to efficacy during treatment , although advers e events have been frequently reported ( Pajno et al 2018, Pepper et al 2020). In general, guidelines do not indicate an established place in therapy for oral food allergen immunotherapy (FA -AIT) and emphasize the risk vs benefit with OIT. Of note, the majority of current guidelines were published before the FDA- approval of OIT for food allergy (Boyce et al 2010, Cox et al 2011, Jutel et al 2015, Muraro et al 2014, Pajno et al 2018, Pepper et al 2020, Sampson et al 2020, Togias et al 2017). Palforzia (peanut [Arachis hypogaea] allergen powder -dnfp) is the first standardized FDA -approved OIT for t he t reatment of peanut allergy in children; it was approved in January 2020. Palforzia is a peanut powder manufactur ed f rom defatted peanut flour and evaluated for quantities of specific allergenic peanut proteins ( Aimmune 2020, FDA summary basis for regulatory action 2020, FDA Vaccines, Blood & Biologics 2020).

INDICATIONS Palforzia is an OIT indicated for the mitigation of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to peanut. Palforzia is approved for use in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut allergy. Initial Dose Escalation may be administered to patients 4 through 17 years of age, and Up- Dosing and Maintenance may be continued in patients 4 years of age. Palforzia is to be used in conjunction with a peanut -avoidant diet. Limitation of use: Palforzia is not indicated for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Information on indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, dosing, and safety has been obtained from th e pr escribing information for the individual products, except where noted otherwise. CLINICAL EFFICACY SU MMARY The Peanut Allergy Oral Immunotherapy Study of AR101 for Desensitization (PALISADE), a Phase 3, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multi -center randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Palforzia for t he mi tigation of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis in 551 patients 4 to 55 years of age with peanut allergy ( FDA AP AC briefing document 2019, Vickery et al 2018). Palforzia was administered orally for 52 weeks through 3 dosing phases: a 1- day supervised Initial Dose Escalati on phas e, an Up- Dosing phase during which the dose was gradually increased every 2 weeks, and a 24- week Maintenance phase with a daily dose of Palforzia 300 mg. For the primary outcome in patients 4 to 17 years of age in the intention- to-treat population, 67.2% (250/372) of patients in the Palforzia group vs 4.0% (5/124) in the placebo group were able to ingest a single dose of 6 00 mg pean ut protein, the equivalent of approximately 2 peanut kernels, during the exit double- blind placebo- controlled food challenge (DBPCFC; which involves ingesting gradually increasing amounts of peanut protein to determine if t he pat ient has become desensitized or tolerant to peanuts) with no more than mild symptoms (see Table 1). This yiel ded a bet ween- group treatment difference of 63.2% (95% confidence interval, 53.0 to 73.3; p < 0.001). For secondary endpoints, significantly more patients 4 to 17 years of age in the Palforzia group tolerated peanut protein doses of 300 mg and 1000 mg during the exit DBPCFC vs placebo (76.6% vs 8.1% and 50.3% vs 2.4%, respectively; p < 0.001 for both comparisons), and less patients experienced moderate and severe symptoms (s ee T able 1) as the maximum severity of symptoms vs placebo (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients 18 to 55 years of age who tolerated 600 mg of peanut protein at the exit DBPCFC in theintention- to-treat population (n = 55) did not demonstrate a significant treatment difference with Palforzia vs placebo; data w ere limited due to the small sample size and the failure to meet the specified success criterion in adults.

GI: S evere abdominal pain/cramping/repetitive vomiting and/or diarrhea Neurological: Change in mental status Circulator y: Clinically significant hypotension An ICER final evidence report evaluated the effectiveness and value of Palforzia, Viaskin Peanut (not FDA -approved), and non- commercialized OIT to desensitize patients with peanut allergies ( ICER 2019). The substanti al increase in Palforzia- treated patients who tolerated peanut protein vs placebo was balanced by a significant increase in GI symptoms, systemic allergic reactions, and epinephrine use. The benefit of Palforzia was rated as Promising but Inconclusive (P/I), with only moderate certainty of a comparable, small, or substantial net health benefit and a small (but nonzero) likelihood of a negative net health benefit for Palforzia compared with strict avoidance and rapid use ofepinephrine. The primary benefit of desensitization to peanuts in patients with peanut allergy is likely to be improvements in qualityof life (QOL) for both the patient and caregivers. However, QoL outcomes from clinical trials have not been published (ICER 2019). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) 2019 Oral Immunotherapy for Food Allergy Summit. Consensus report ( Pepper et al 2020) OIT is an emerging option for the treatment of food allergy, but it is not appropriate for all patients with a history of allergic reactions to food. While the EAACI food allergy guidelines ( Pajno et el 2018) have recommended the use of OIT in \"highly specialized clinical centers with expertise and facilities to safely deliver this therapy\" for milk, egg or peanut , older U.S. practice guidelines recommend against its use and need to be updated, especially with the approval ofPalforzia. OIT is most beneficial for fully informed, motivated patients and families who desire enhanced normalcy and a reduce d i nfluence of food allergy in their lives, and who are willing to accept the added potential harms and burdens of t he t reatment. The impact of OIT on patient -centered outcomes such as QOL and enhanced normalcy in food- allergic patients ar e need ed in research studies. While studies have demonstrated significant improvement in QOL after OIT, more robust data are needed. OIT is a treatment for food allergy but it is not a cure. OIT induces desensitization and may, in a subset of patients, induce sustained unresponsiveness. There is limited evidence that OIT provides long- lasting unresponsiveness after discontinuation in only a subset of patients. N ational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)/(AAAAI). Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy in the U.S. (Boyce et al 2010) Allergen avoidance is recommended as the first -line treatment for patients with documented immunoglobulin E (IgE) - mediated food allergy. Allergen- specific immunotherapy to treat food allergies is not recommended. To treat anaphylaxis, epinephrine is the first -line treatment, which may be re- administered every 5 to 15 minutes. NI AID/AAAAI. Addendum guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergy in the U.S. (Togias et al 2017) The guidelines recommend early introduction of peanut -containing food at 4 to 6 months of age in infants with sever e ec zema, egg allergy, or both, based on the evidence of the single randomized, open- label LEAP trial ( Togias et al 2017) . I nternational Collaboration in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology (formed by the EAACI; AAAAI; the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology; and the World Allergy Organization). International consensus statement on allergen immunotherapy ( AIT) (Jutel et al 2015) Guidelines did not recommend food immunotherapy for clinical use due to the risk of a dverse events , includin g anap hylaxis. Studies using OIT for peanut, milk, and egg allergies have shown positive results.Data as of July 2, 2020 ALS/R LP Page 52 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

After 1 to 4 years of OIT of high maintenance doses (300 to 4000 mg) of food protein, a high proportion of patients were able to pass an oral food challenge. However, the rates of epinephrine use due to systemic reactions were up t o 25% of the patients, which is too high to recommend OIT for daily practice. Food immunotherapy can result in desensitization requiring continuous therapy; however, whether food immunotherapy can result in long- term tolerance in which therapy can be discontinued indefinitely is unknown. AAAAI . Food allergy: a practice parameter update ( Sampson et al 2014) The primary therapy for food allergy is strict avoidance of the causal food or foods. Epinephrine should be used as first -line management for the treatment of anaphylaxis Although immunotherapeutic approaches, such as OIT, have shown promise in treating food allergy, they are not ready for implementation in clinical practice at the present time due to inadequate evidence for therapeutic benefit over risks oftherapy. Experts recommend that introduction of solid foods, including potentially allergenic foods, should not be delayed bey ond 4 t o 6 months of age. AAAAI . Allergen immunotherapy practice parameter update ( Cox et al 2011) Several clinical trials with OIT and sublingual immunotherapy have demonstrated an increased tolerance to oral fo od c hallenge in patients with food hypersensitivity while receiving therapy. Allergen immunotherapy is recommended to be administered by trained staff with on- hand medical equipment for treating anaphylaxis . E AACI. Guidelines on AIT: IgE -mediated food allergy (Pajno et el 2018) AIT is potentially indicated for patients with evidence of an IgE -mediated food allergy and in whom avoidance measures are ineffective, undesirable, or cause severe limitations to a patient's Q OL. The downside of the adverse events associated with treatment, including risk of mild systemic reactions an d anap hylaxis, is outweighed by both the achievement of desensitization and reduced risk of a serious allergic reactio n by accidental exposure. FA-AIT is logistically demanding, time- consuming, and most patients are affected by a dverse events . Only patients and families who understand the aim of the intervention and its risks and are motivated and adherent should be c onsidered for treatment. E AACI. Food allergy and anaphylaxis guidelines: diagnosis and management of food allergy (Muraro et al 2014) Dietary avoidance is the key treatment in the management of food allergy, with the use of epinephrine for emergency management of anaphylaxis. Food allergen- specific immunotherapy for primary food allergy is a promising treatment approach, but it is associated with risk of a dverse events including anaphylaxis and is therefore not currently recommended for routine clinical use. SAFETY SUMMARY Key contraindications include use in patients with uncontrolled asthma, and those with a history of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) or other eosinophilic GI disease. Boxed warnings include the following: Anaphylaxis, which may be life -threatening and can occur at any time during therapy with Palfor zia. Injectable epinephrine should be prescribed, and patients should be trained on its appropriate use and instructed t o s eek immediate care upon its use. Dose modifications may be necessary following an anaphylactic reaction. Palforzia should not be administered in patients with uncontrolled asthma. Patients should be observed for 60 minutes during and after Initial Dose Escalation and the first dose of each Up- Dosing level with Palforzia administration. Other warnings and precautions include risk of EoE and GI reactions. Most common a dverse events (incidence 5% and 5% higher than placebo) were GI , respiratory, and skin symptoms commonly associated with allergic reaction, including abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, oral pruritus, oral paresthesia, throat irritation, cough, rhinorrhea, sneezing, throat tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, pruritus, urticaria, anaphylactic reaction, and ear pruritus. The highest proportion o f adverse events occurred during the Up- Dosing phase of therapy.Data as of July 2, 2020 ALS/R LP Page 53 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer t o the full prescribing i nformation and published resources w hen making m edical de cisions. Palforzia will only be available through health care providers, health care settings, pharmacies, and patients who are enrolled and certified in the Palforzia Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS ) program due to anaphylaxis risk. Health care providers and pharmacies must be educated on the risk of anaphylaxis, and health care settings must have on- site access to equipment and trained personnel to manage anaphylaxis and monitor patients during and after Initial Dose Escalation and Up- Dosing of Palforzia. Patients and/or caregivers must be counseled on the need to have injectable epinephrine available for immediate us e at all times, continued dietary peanut avoidance, and how to recognize anaphylaxis signs/symptoms. Palforzia may only be dispensed by certified pharmacies to certified health care settings or enrolled patients. DOSING AND ADMINISTR ATION Table 2 . Dosing and Administration Drug Available Formulations Route Usual Recommended Frequency Palforzia (peanut [Arachis hypogaea] allergen powder -dnfp) Powder administered (0.5 100 mg) Foil-laminate sachet (300 mg)Oral Once d aily See the current prescribing information for full details The po wder from the Palforzia capsule(s) or sachet should be emptied and mixed with a small amount to semisolid foo d ( eg, applesauce, yogurt, pudding) to be consumed by the patient. Treatment with Palforzia is administered in 3 sequential phases: Initial Dose Escalation (4 to 5 doses of 0.5 mg up to 6 mg administered at 20 to 30 minute intervals over 1 day), Up- Dosing (dose increases from 3 mg to 300 mg daily at 2 w eek intervals, over approximately 6 months), and Maintenance (300 mg daily). As part of the REMS program, Initial Dose Escalation and the first dose of each Up- Dosing level must b e adm inistered in a certified health care setting equipped to monitor patients and to identify and manage anaphylaxis. Dose modifications are not appropriate during Initial Dose Escalation; however, temporary dose modification o f P alforzia may be required for patients who experience allergic reactions during Up -Dosing or Maintenance, for patients who miss doses, or for practical reasons of patient management. Daily maintenance is required to maintain the effect of Palforzia. Patients who miss 3 consecutive days of P alforzia should consult their health care providers and resumption of Palforzia should be done under medical supervision. CONCLUSION Palforzia is only FDA -approved OIT indicated for the mitigation of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to peanut in patients with peanut allergy. Phase 3 data demonstrated a significant reduction of symptom severity due to peanut exposure vs placebo in children 4 to 17 years of age. However , treatment with Palforzia resulted in an increased risk of systemic allergic reactions and us e of epinephrine vs placebo. Palforzia may cause anaphylaxis, EoE, and GI reactions; it is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled asthma or a hi story of other eosinophilic GI disease. The most c ommon adverse events were associated with allergic reaction. Palforzia is only available through a REMS program due to anaphylaxis risk. Palforzia is administered in 3 sequential phases ; the Initial Dose Escalation and the first dose of each Up- Dosing level must be administered in a certified health care setting equipped to monitor patients and manage anaphylaxis. P atient adherence is critical to ensure the safety and efficacy of treatment with Palforzia. OIT with Palforzia is an option for the treatment of peanut allergy; it is efficacious in inducing desensitization but is not without potential harms and burdens, and it is not curative. Treatment with Palforzia does not preclude a peanut -avoidant diet and injectable epinephrine must be available for immediate use at all times due to the risk of anaphylaxis. Treatment with Palforzia may be logistically demanding and time- consuming, with most patients affected by advers e ev ents, inclu ding the risk of anaphylaxis. Use of Palforzia may be appropriate in patients and families who underst and t he goal of the intervention and its risks and are motivated and compliant to treatment; adherence is an important consideration to ensure both the efficacy and safety of Palforzia.Data as of July 2, 2020 ALS/R LP Page 54 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Therapeutic Class Overview Anticonvulsants INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following ( Fisher et al 2014 ): At least 2 unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring > 24 hours apart; 1 unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after 2 unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Types of seizures include generalized seizures , focal ( partial ) seizures , and status epilepticus for e C ontrol and Preventi on [CDC] 2018 , Epilepsy Foundation 2016). Generalized seizures affect both sides of the brain and include: Tonic-clonic (grand mal) : begin with stiffening of the limbs, followed by jerking of the limbs and face Myoclonic: characterized by rapid, brief contractions of body muscles, usually on both sides of the body at th e s ame time Atonic: characterized by abrupt loss of muscle tone; they are also called drop attacks or akinetic seizures and can result in injury due to falls Absence (petit mal) : characterized by brief lapses of awareness, sometimes with staring, that begin and e nd abr uptly; they are more common in children than adults and may be accompanied by brief myoclonic jerking of the eyelids or facial muscles, a loss of muscle tone, or automatisms. Focal seizures are located in just 1 area of the brain and include: Simple: affect a small part of the brain; can affect movement, sensations, and emotion, without a loss of consciousness Complex : affect a larger area of the brain than simple focal seizures and the patient loses awareness ; episodes typically be gin with a blank stare, followed by chewing movements, picking at or fumbling with clothing, mumbling, and performing repeated unorganized movements or wandering; they may also be called \" temporal lobe epilepsy\" or \"psychomotor epilepsy\" Secondar ily generalized seizures: begin in 1 part of the brain and spread to both sides Status epilepticus is characterized by prolonged, uninterrupted seizure activity . Seizure classifications from the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) were updated in 2017. The ILAE classification of seizure types is based on whether the seizure has a focal, generalized, or unknown onset; has a motoror non- motor onset; and whether the patient is aware or has impaired awareness during the event (for focal seizures). Additional classification details may also be used ( Fisher et al 2017A, Fisher et al 2017B). There is variation between the ILAE classifications and many of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approv ed i ndications for antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). For example, a \"focal aware\" seizure corresponds to the prior term \"simpl e par tial seizure,\" and a \"focal impaired awareness\" seizure corresponds to the prior term \"complex partial seizure.\" A number of epilepsy syndromes have also been described; these are defined by groups of features that tend to occur together such as having a similar seizure type, age of onset, part of the brain involved, and electroencephalogr am (E EG) pattern (Epilepsy Foundation 2013). An example is a childhood epilepsy syndrome called Lennox -Gastaut syndrome (LGS), which is characterized by several seizure types including tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. In LGS, there is a classic EEG pattern seen and intellectual development is usually impaired ( Epilepsy Foundatio n 2020) . Epilepsy management is focused on the goals of 1) controlling seizures, 2) avoiding treatment -related adverse effects (AEs), and 3) maintaining or restoring quality of life. Management options vary based on the seizure type. It is usually appropriate to refer patients to a neurologist to establish the epilepsy diagnosis and formulate the management strategy(Schachter 201 9). A correct diagnosis is essential to proper treatment selection. For example, absence seizures are commonly confus ed w ith complex partial seizures. However, drugs that reduce absence seizures are generally ineffective for complex partial seizures, and the most effective drugs for complex partial seizures may be ineffective against or even increas e t he frequency of absence seizures ( Epilepsy Foundation 2016).Data as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 56 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Combination therapy may be as sociated with decreased patient adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. Wh en c ombination therapy is needed, it is recommended to select products with different mechanisms of action and AE profiles. There is little comparative clinical data to support the use of specific combinations ( Schachter et al 2019) . S everal broad classes of AEDs are available, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, hydantoins, and miscellaneous agents (see Table 1). Cannibidiol (Epidiolex) was FDA -approved in June 2018 for use in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018). It is the first FDA -approved drug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and is the first approved drug that contains a purified substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. Cannabidiol is a schedule V controlled substance ( Epidiolex prescribing information 2018). Stiripentol (Diacomit) capsules and powder for oral suspension were FDA -approved in August 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older taking clobazam. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) received an expanded indication in April 2018 for use in partial - onset seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This product is a kinase inhibitor that also has several oncology indications. Midazol am nasal spray (Nayzilam) was approved in May 2019 for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age ( Nayzilam prescribing information 2019). In January 2020, diazepam nasal spray (Valtoco) was approve d for the same indication in patients as young as 6 years of age ( Valtoco prescribing information 2020). Several of the AEDs are used for additional indications beyond the management of epilepsy, including (but not limit ed t o) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and several types of neuropathic pain. These additional indications are list ed i n Table 2; however, this review primarily focuses on the use of AEDs for the management of epilepsy. Additionally, brands and formulations FDA -approved and marketed only for non- epilepsy indications are not included within this review; these include gabapentin tablets (Gralise), FDA -approved on the gabapentin enacarbil extended- release postherpetic neuralgi a and t reatment of moderate- to-severe restless leg syndrome, and pregabalin extended- release tablets (Lyrica CR), FDA - approved only for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral hypnotics T able 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SU MMARY Overall, the anticonvulsants have demonstrated efficacy for their FDA -approved uses. Clinical trial data demonstrati ng ef ficacy of the anticonvulsants for the treatment of epilepsy is described in the prescribing information for the individual products, particularly for anticonvulsants more recently approved by the FDA. However, the prescribing information for some older, products (eg, phenobarbital) do not contain efficacy data in their prescribing information. No single AED is clearly the most effective. Comparative efficacy data for the management of epilepsy are limited, a nd t rials have generally not shown significant differences among drugs in terms of efficacy. However, the quality of the dat a i s limited and generally derived from short -term trials ( Karceski 2019 ). When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Combination therapy may be as sociated with decreased patient adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. (Schachter et al 2019). Most patients with epilepsy are treated with anticonvulsant monotherapy ( Nevitt et al 2017). An evidence review summarized AED efficacy and effectiveness as initial monotherapy for epileptic seizures a nd s yndromes ( Glauser et al 2013). This publication provides conclusions based on a review of 64 randomized trials and 11 met a-analyses. Conclusions include the following: As initial monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset seizures: Carbamazepine, levetiracetam, phenytoin, are potentially efficacious/effective. A s initial monotherapy for children with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset are potentially efficacious/effective. As initial monotherapy for elderly adults with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset seizures: Gabapentin and lamotrigine are established as efficacious/effective .Data as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 64 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Topiramate and valproate are potentially efficacious/effective. As initial monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed or or aggravate gener alized- onset tonic -clonic seizures. For children with newly diagnosed or untreated generalized- tonic -clonic seizures: aggravate generalized- onset tonic -clonic seizures. As initial monotherapy for children with newly diagnosed or untreated absence seizures: Ethosuximide and valproate are vigabatrin may precipitate or aggravate absence seizures (based on scattered reports). As initial monotherapy for children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes Carbamazepine oxcarbazepine, and sulthiame (not available in the United States) are potentially efficacious/effective. For patients with newly diagnosed JME: ence, myoclonic, and in some cases generalized tonic -clonic seizures. There has also been a report that lamotrigine may exacerbate seizures in JME. There is a lack of well -designed randomized trials in epilepsy, particularly for generalized seizures and in the pediatric population. A Cochrane systematic review evaluated the efficacy of AED monotherapy for epilepsy ( Nevitt et al 2017). The treatment of partial -onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial or secondarily generalized) or generalized tonic -clonic seizures with or without other generalized seizure types. This network meta- analysis showed that for the primary outcome, the time to withdrawal of allocated treatment: For individuals with partial seizures , levetiracetam performed better than carbamazepine and lamotrigine ; lam otrigine performed better than all other treatments (aside from levetiracetam); and c arbamazepi ne per formed better than gabapentin and phenobarbital. For individuals with generalized onset seizures, valproate performed better than carbamazepine, topiramat e and phe nobarbital. For both partial and generalized onset seizures, phenobarbital seems to perform worse than all other treatments. For the secondary outcome, time to first seizure: For individuals with p artial seizures , phenobarbital performed better than both carbamazepine better than valproate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine; and phenytoin performed better than lamotrigine. For both partial and generalized seizure types, phenytoin and phenobarbital generally performed better than other t reatments . Few notable differences were shown for either partial or generalized seizure types for the secondary outcomes oftime to 6- month or 12- month remission of seizures. Overal l, direct evidence and network meta- analysis estimates were numerically similar, and effect sizes h ad ov erlapping confidence intervals. Data for individuals with generalized seizures are still limited and additional randomized trials are needed. The relative efficacy for generalized (n = 7 studies) or absence seizures (n = 3 studies) was evaluated inData as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 65 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The outcomes analyzed were seizure freedom and withdrawal due to inefficacy. Compared to valproate, phenytoin had a lower odds of seizure freedom (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% credible Interval [CrI] 0.27 to 0.87) in pat ients with generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Lamotrigine had the highest probability of seizure freedom and valproate had the highest probability of withdrawal due to inefficacy in these patients . For absence seizures, ethosuximide and valproate were found to have a higher probability of seizure freedom compared to lamotrigine. A meta- analysis estimated the comparative efficacy of achieving seizure freedom with 22 antiepileptic drugs and pl acebo in children and adolescents (Rosati et al 2018) . For the treatment of newly diagnosed focal epilepsy (n = 4 s tudies), point estimates suggested superiority of carbamazepine and lamotrigine; however, this was not statistically significant. For refractory focal epilepsy (n = 9 studies), levetiracetam and perampanel were more effective than placeb o i n mixed comparisons. Ethosuximide and valproic acid were more effective than lamotrigine for absence seizures. The aut hors concluded that better designed comparative studies with appropriate length of follow -up, well-defined outcomes, and reliable inclusion criteria are needed to validate these results. A meta -analysis compared monotherapy with carbamazepine or phenytoin in children and adults with focal onset seizures (simple or complex focal and secondarily generalized), or generalized onset tonic -clonic seizures (with or without other generalized seizure types). Results demonstrated that the time to treatment failure (primary outcome) did not significantly differ between treatment groups. The time to first seiz ure after randomization and 6- month and 12- month remission were also similar between groups (Nevitt et al 2019). Approximately 20% to 40% of patients with epilepsy can be considered refractory to drug treatment, referred to as drug- resistant epilepsy. Treatment of drug- resistant epilepsy may include additional anticonvulsant drug trials, epilepsy surgery, vagal nerve stimulation, and dietary changes (the ketogenic diet) ( Sirven 2018 ). Combination AED regimens are an option for the treatment of drug- resista nt epilepsy. However, robust clinical evidence of suitable combinations of AEDs has been difficult to generate due to the large number of possibl e c ombinations of drugs and doses. Examples of combinations for which there is some evidence of efficacy includ e v alproate plus lamotrigine for partial- onset and generalized seizures, valproate plus ethosuximide for absence seizures, and lamotrigine plus topiramate for various seizure types; however, even this evidence is fairly limited. I n gener al, when considering combination therapy, it is recommended to combine medications with different mechanisms of action, and to be mindful of the overall drug load to minimize AEs. Two- drug therapy should b e at tempted before considering addition of a third drug, and higher numbers of drugs should be avoided as they ar e as sociated with a very low likelihood of additional seizure reduction ( Kwan et al 2011). A meta -analysis examined the efficacy of newer AEDs (eslicarbazepine, brivaracetam, perampanel, and lacosamide) versus levetiracetam as adjunct ive therapy for uncontrolled partial- onset seizures. Most patients in this meta- analysi s w ere on at least 2 other AED s at the time of treatment. In this analysis, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, a nd br ivaracetam were non- inferio r to levetiracetam in terms of efficacy, but all newer AEDs except brivaracetam had w orse tolerability profiles than levetiracetam at high doses ( Zhu et al 2017). A network meta- analysis examined the efficacy with refractory partial -onset seizures while using monotherapy (Zhao et al 2017). The efficacy outcomes studied were 50% responder rate and state of seizur e f reedom. The authors concluded that topiramate, levetiracetam, pregabalin, and oxcarbazepine were preferable for their relatively high efficacy and low risk of AEs. Rufinamide was the least preferable medication due to its low efficacy and high risk of AEs. A network meta- analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 17 newer AEDs for treatment of refractory partial - onset epilepsy with or without secondary generalization (Hu et al 2018) . The primary outcome was seizure freedom, which was defined as a 100% seizure reduction in the maintenance or double- blind treatment period of the trial. Safety was assessed by the withdrawal rate due to treatment -emergent AEs . Based on results of 54 studies that evaluated the efficacy outcome, the mos t effective agents included tiagabine, brivaracetam, and valproic acid, and th e l east effective agents included rufinamide, lamotrigine, and zonisamide. Products with favorable s afety included levetiracetam, brivaracetam, and perampanel, while those with t he least favorable safety included retigabine (not available in the United States), oxcarbazepine, and rufinamide. The authors stated that agents with the best outcomes in terms of efficacy and safety include d levetiracetam, vigabatrin, valproic acid, and brivaracetam. Cann abidiol (Epidiolex) was approved in June 2018 for use in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018).

Its approval for these 2 indications was based on 3 placebo- controlled trials in patients refractory to other treatments. Epidiolex , along with use of other agents , demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( Thiele et al 2018; Devinsky et al 2018; Devinsky et al 2017). To date, no comparative trials have been published. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) received an expanded indication for adjunctive use in TSC - associated partial -onset seizures in April 2018. Results of a randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled study of 366 patients with inadequately controlled seizures on 2 or more AEDs demonstrated a significant reduction in seizur e f requency compared to placebo ( French et al 2016). In August 2018, the FDA approv ed a second drug, stiripent ol (Diacomit), for use in the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Two multicenter placebo- controlled studies evaluated the addition of stiripentol t o c lobazam and valproate therapy in patients 3 years to less than 18 years of age with Dravet syndrome. Responder rates (seizure frequency reduced by 50%) with respect to generalized tonic -clonic seizures were significantly lower with stiripentol compared to placebo ( Diacomit prescribing information 2018) . In May 2019, a nasal spray formulation of midazolam (Nayzilam) was approved for the acute treatment of cluster seizures in adults and adolescents. In one randomized controlled trial in patients with seizure clusters while receivin g a s table AED regimen, the proportion of patients who experienced treatment success (seizure termination within 1 0 mi nutes and no recurrence for the next 6 hours) was significantly higher with midazolam nasal spray compared t o pl acebo (53.7% = 0.0109) ( Detyniecki et al 2019). Cenobamate was approved in late 2019 and its efficacy has yet to be compared to other AEDs. The approval of this agent was based on 2 multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled studies that enrolled 655 adults wit h partial -onset seizures with or without generalization who were not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 other AEDs. The results of these trials demonstrated that cenobamate significantly reduced the frequency of seizures occurring in a 28- day period. In the first trial, the median percent change in seizure frequency from baseline was - 55.6% with cenobamate and - 21.5% with placebo. In the second trial, the median percent change ranged from - 36.3% to -55.3% with cenobamate and was -24.3% with placebo ( Xcopri package insert 2019, Krauss et al 2020). A 2019 randomized controlled trial of children and adults with benzodiazepine- refractory convulsive status epilepticus compared the efficacy of intravenous levetiracetam (n = 145 patients), fosphenytoin (n = 118), or valproat e (n = 121) in this setting. Results demonstrated that each agent led to seizure cessation and improved alertness by 1 hour in approximately 50% of patients , with no significant differences between groups (Kapur et al 2019). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs I: treatment of new -onset epilepsy. American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( French et al 2004A , Kanner et al, 2018A ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guideline focuses on treatment of new -onset epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs. The 2004 publication summarizes the efficacy, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide for the treatment of children and adults with newlydiagnosed partial and generalized epilepsies. The r ecommendations from the 2004 guideline include the following: Patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy who require treatment can be initially treated with standard AEDs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, or the newer AEDs lamotrigine, gabapentin,oxcarbazepine, or topiramate. Choice will depend on individual patient characteristics. Lamotrigine can be included in the options for children with newly diagnosed absence seizures. The 2018 recommendations include the following : As monotherapy i n adult patients with new -onset focal epilepsy or unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures: Lamotrigine use should be considered to decrease seizure f requency. Lamotrigine use should be considered and gabapentin use may be considered to decrease seizur e f requency in patients aged 60 years. Levetiracetam and zonisamide use may be considered to decrease s eizure frequency. Vigabatrin appears to be less e fficacious than carbamazepine immediate- release and may not be offered; furthermore, the toxicity profile precludes vigabatrin use as first -line therapy . P regabalin 150 mg per day is possibly less efficacious than lamotrigine 100 mg per day .Data as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 67 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

There is insufficient evidence to consider use of gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate over carbamazepine. There is insufficient evidence to consider use of topiramate instead of phenytoin in urgent treatment of new - onset or recurrent focal epilepsy, unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures, or generalized epilepsy presenting with generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Data are lacking to support or refute use of third new-onset epilepsy. Data are lacking to support or refute use of newer AEDs in treating unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Ethosuximide or valproic acid should be considered before lamotrigine to decrease seizure frequency in children with absence epilepsy. An exception would be if there are compelling AE -related concerns with use of ethosuximide or valproic acid. The guideline does not address newly approved agents including cannabidiol, everolimus, or stiripentol. Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs II: treatment of refractory epilepsy . American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Kanner et al 2018B , French et al 2004B ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guideline focuses on management of treatment- resistant epilepsy with second and thir d gener ation AEDs . The 2004 oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide for the treatment of children and adults with refractory partial and generalized epilepsies. Recommendations from the 2004 guideline include the following: It is appropriate to use levetiracetam, epilepsy . Oxcarbazepine, topiramate , and lamotrigine can be as monotherapy in patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Topiramate may be used for the treatment of refractory generalized tonic -clonic seizure s in adults and children. Gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate may be used as adjunctive treatment of children with refractory partial seizures . Topiramate and lamotrigine may be used to treat drop attacks associated with LGS in adults and children . Recommendations from the 2018 guideline include the following: As adjunctive therapy in patients with treatment -resistant adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE): Immediate- release pregabalin and perampanel are established as effective to reduce seizure f requency. Lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended- release topiramate should seizur e f requency. Vigaba trin and rufinamide are effective for decreasing seizure frequency, but are not first-line agents . Ezogabine (no longer marketed) use should be considered to reduce seizure frequency, but carries a serious risk of skin and retinal discoloration. Clobazam and extended- release oxcarbazepine may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. As monotherapy in patients with TRAFE: Eslic arbazepine use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Data are insufficient to recommend use of second- and the other third- generation AEDs. For add- on therapy for generalized epilepsy, immediate- release and extended- release lamotrigine should be considered as add- on therapy to decrease seizure frequency in adults with treatment -resistant generalize d t onic-clonic seizures secondary to generalized epilepsy. Levetiracetam use should be considered to decreas e s eizure frequency as add- on therapy for t reatment -resistant generalized tonic -clonic seizures and for treatment -resistant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Rufinamide is effective to reduce seizure frequency as add- on therapy for LGS . Clobazam use should b e c onsidered as add- on therapy for LGS . For add- on therapy in pediatric patients with treatment -resistant focal epilepsy: Levetiracetam use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (ages 1 month to 16 years). Zonisamide use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (age 6 to 17 years). Oxcarbazepine use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (age 1 month to 4 years).Data as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 68 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society ( Krumholz et al 2015 ; r eaffirmed in 2018). This practice guideline makes recommendations based on a consideration of the evidence for prognosis and treatment of adults with an unprovoked first seizure. Recommendations include the following: Adults presenting with an unprovoked first seizure should be informed that the chance for a recurrent seizure is greatest within the first 2 years after a first seizure (21% to 45%). Clinicians should also advise such patients that clinical factors associated with an increased risk of seizur e r ecurrence include a prior brain insult such as a stroke or trauma, an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities, a s ignificant brain- imaging abnormality, or a nocturnal seizure. Clinicians should advise patients that, although immediate AED therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likely to reduce the risk of a seizure recurrence in the 2 years subsequent to a f irst seizure, it may not improve quality of life. Clinicians should advise patients that over the longer term (> 3 years), immediate AED treatment is unlikely t o i mprove the prognosis for sustained seizure remission. Patients should be advised that their risk for AED AEs ranges from 7% to 31% and that these AEs ar e pr edominantly mild and reversible. Immediate AED therapy after an unprovoked first seizure is likely to reduce seizure recurrence risk. A reduction in riskmay be important, particularly for adults, for whom seizure recurrences may cause serious psychological and socia l c onsequences such as loss of driving privileges and limitations on employment. However, immediate AED treatment is not well accepted and is debated. Decisions should be based on weighing the risk of recurrence against the AEs ofAED therapy, and should take patient preferences into account. It is accepted that when a patient has a second or additional seizures, an AED should be initiated because the risk ofsubsequent seizures is very high. Evidence- based guideline: t reatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children and adults. Guideline Committee of the American Epilepsy Society ( Glauser et al 2016). This publication provides conclusions and a treatment algorithm based on a structured literature review of randomizedtrials of anticonvulsant treatments for seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes. A total of 38 trials were included. For treatment in the adult population, c onclusions included the following: Intramuscular (IM) midazolam, intravenous (IV) lorazepam, IV diazepam (with or without phenytoin), and IV phenobarbital are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. IV lorazepam is more effective than IV phenytoin in stopping seizures lasting at least 10 minutes. There is no difference in efficacy between IV lorazepam followed by IV phenytoin, IV diazepam plus phenytoi n f ollowed by IV lorazepam, and IV phenobarbital followed by IV phenytoin. IV valproic acid has similar efficacy to IV phenytoin or continuous IV diazepam as second therapy after failur e of a benzodiaze pine. Insufficient data exist in adults about the efficacy of levetiracetam as either initial or second therapy. In adults with status epilepticus without established IV access, IM midazolam is established as more effectiv e c ompared with IV lorazepam. No significant difference in effectiveness has been demonstrated between lorazepam and diazepam in adults with status epilepticus. For treatment in the pediatric population, conclusions included the following: IV lorazepam and IV diazepam are es tablished as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Rectal diazepam, IM midazolam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are probably effective at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Insufficient data exist in children about the efficacy of intranasal lorazepam, as initial therapy. IV valproic acid has similar efficacy but better tolerability than IV phenobarbital as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine.Data as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 69 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and publis hed resources when making medical decisions. Insufficient data exist in children regarding the efficacy of phenytoin or levetiracetam as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. In children with status epilepticus, no significant difference in effectiveness has been established between IV lorazepam and IV diazepam. In children with status epilepticus, non- IV midazolam (IM/intranasal/buccal) is probably more effective tha n di azepam (IV/rectal). Conclusions included the following (age not specified): Insufficient data exist about the comparative efficacy of phenytoin and fosphenytoin. Fosphenytoin is better tolerated compared with phenytoin. When both are available, fosphenytoin is preferred based on tolerability, but phenytoin is an acceptable alternative. The overall treatment algorithm directs that: A benzodiazepine (IM midazolam, IV lorazepam, or IV diazepam) is recommended as the initial therapy of choice in the first phase of treatment (5 to 20 minutes after the beginning of the seizure). Although I V phen obarbital is established as efficacious and well tolerated as initial therapy, its slower rate of administratio n pos itions it as an alternative initial therapy. For prehospital settings or where first -line benzodiazepine options are not available, rectal diazepam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are reasonable initial therapy alternatives. In the second phase of treatment (from 20 to 40 minutes after the beginning of the seizure), reasonable options include fosphenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. There is no clear evidence that any of these options isbetter than the others. Because of AEs , IV phenobarbital is a reasonable second- therapy alternative if none of the 3 recommended therapies are available. There is no clear evidence t o guide therapy in the third phase of therapy ( 40 minutes after the beginning of the seizure) . Evidence- based guideline update: medical treatment of infantile spasms. Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Go et al 2012 ; reaf firmed in 2018) This publication provides updated recommendations for the treatment of infantile spasms . The literature review included an evaluation of 26 published articles on this topic. Recommendations include the following: Evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone as being as effective as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for short -term treatment of infantile spasms. Low-dose ACTH should be considered as an alternative to high- dose ACTH for treatment of infantile spasms. ACTH or vigabatrin may be offered for short -term treatment of infantile spasms; evidence suggests that ACTH may be offered over vigabatrin. Evidence is insufficient to recommend other therapies (valproic acid, vitamin B6, nitrazepam [not available i topiramate, the ketogenic diet, or novel/combination therapies ) for treatment of infantile spasms. Hormonal therapy (ACTH or prednisolone) may be considered for use in preference to vigabatrin in infants wit h c ryptogenic infantile spasms, to possibly improve developmental outcome. A shorter lag time to treatment of infantile spasms with either hormonal therapy or vigabatrin may be considered to improve long -term cognitive outcomes. There is a lack of sufficient randomized trials to provide definitive answers to key questions related to treatment ofinfantile spas ms. Practice p arameter: treatment of the child with a first unprovoked seizure. Quality Standards Subcommittee of th e A merican Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Hirtz et al 2003 ; reaffirmed in 2018) This parameter reviews published literature relevant to the decision to begin treatment after a child or adolescentexperiences a first unprovoked seizure and presents evidence- based practice recommendations. Treatment durin g t he neonatal period is not addressed. Recommendations include the following: Treatment with AEDs is not indicated for the prevention of the development of epilepsy. Treatment with AEDs may be considered in circumstances where the benefits of reducing the risk of a secon d s eizure outweigh the risks of pharmacologic and psychosocial AEs.Data as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 70 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The majority of children who experience a first unprovoked seizure will have few or no recurrences. Treatment wit h A EDs after a first seizure as opposed to after a second seizure has not been shown to improve prognosis for long- term seizure remission. Treatment has been shown in several studies combining both children and adults to reduce the risk of seizur e r ecurrence; however, there is a relative paucity of data from studies involving only children after a first seizure. Summary of recommendations for the management of infantile seizures . Task force report for the ILAE Commission of Pediatrics ( Wilmshurst et al 2015). This publication recommends an approach to the standard and optimal management of infants with seizures. Wh en pos sible, recommendations are evidence- based; however, when no evidence was available, recommendations ar e bas ed on expert opinion and standard pr actice. Recommendations/findings include the following: There is no indication for initiation of chronic AEDs for simple febrile seizures. However, in the acute treatment of febrile seizures, it is important to treat seizures lasting 10 minutes or longer. In an otherwise healthy infant, a policy of \"wait and see\" is reasonable after the first afebrile seizure. However, this is a rare event and close monitoring is essential. Treatment options with established or probable efficacy include the following: Focal seizures: levetiracetam Epileptic ACTH Dravet syndrome: stiripentol Treatment options or situational seizures: carbamazepine There is no clear evidence supporting an optimal duration of treatment; this is dependent on seizure type. Guidelines on n eonatal seizures. World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO 2011). This document was prepared based on a systematic review of the literature and involved cooperation between th e W HO, the ILAE, and the International Bureau of Epilepsy (IBE). Recommendations include the following: Phenobarbital should be used as the first -line agent for treatment of neonatal seizure s and should be mad e r eadily available in all settings. In neonates who continue to have seizures despite administering the maxim um tolerated dose of phenobarbital, either a benzodiazepine, phenytoin, or lidocaine may be used as the second- line agent for control of seizures (use of phenytoin or lidocaine requires cardiac monitoring). In neonates with a normal neurological examination and/or normal EEG, stopping AEDs may be considered if the neonate has been seizure- free for > 72 hours; the drug(s) should be reinstituted if seizures recur . In neonates in whom seizure control is achieved with a single AED, the drug can be discontinued abruptly without tapering the dose. In neonates requiring > 1 AED for seizure control, the drugs may be stopped one at a time, with phenobarbital being the last drug to be withdrawn. Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epilepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence - based review): teratogenesis and perinatal outcomes. Quality Standards Subcommittee and Therapeutics and T echnology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Hard en et al 2009A ; reaffirmed in 2013; Update in progress ) This publication summarizes evidence for selected issues regarding the clinical management of women with epilepsy(WWE) who are pregnant or plan ning to be pregnant . Recommendations include the following: If possible, avoidance of the use of valproate as part of polytherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy should be considered to decrease the risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs). If possible, avoidance of the use of valproate monotherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy may b e c onsidered to decrease the risk of MCMs.Data as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 71 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and publis hed resources when making medical decisions. To reduce the risk of MCMs, the use of valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy should be avoided, if possible, compared to the use of carbamazepine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of polytherapy with valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, should be considered, compared to polytherapy without valproate. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, may be considered, compared to the use of phenytoin or lamotrigine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of AED polytherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, compared to monotherapy should be considered. Limiting the dosage of valproate or lamotrigine during the first trimester, if possible, should be considered t o l essen the risk of MCMs. Avoidance of the use of valproate, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and facial clefts , and may be considered to reduce the risk of hypospadias. Avoidance of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital, if possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of specific MCMs: cleft palate for phenytoin use, posterior cleft palate use, and cardiac malformations for phenobarbital use. Carbamazepine exposure probably does not produce cognitive impairment in offspring of WWE. Avoiding valproate in WWE during pregnancy, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Avoiding phenyto in and phenobarbital in WWE during pregnancy, if possible, may be considered to reduce th e r isk of poor cognitive outcomes. Monotherapy should be considered in place of polytherapy, if possible, for WWE who take AEDs durin g pr egnancy to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possible, should be considered compared t o c arbamazepine to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possible, may be considered compared to phenytoin to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Valproate has the most data showing an association with risk from in utero exposure. If a change from valproate t o anot her AED is planned, it is prudent to make this change well before pregnancy. Although many of the recommendations in this parameter suggest minimizing AED exposure during pregnancy, for most WWE, discontinuing AEDs is not a reasonable or safe option. Discontinuing AEDs may expose the mother an d f etus to physical injury from accidents due to seizure act ivity. Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epilepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence - based review): vitamin K, folic acid, blood levels, and breastfeeding. Quality Standards Subcommittee a nd T herapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and Americ an E pilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009B ; reaffirmed in 2013 ; Update in progress ) This publication summarizes evidence for selected issues regarding the clinical management of WWE who ar e pr egnant or planning to be pregnant . Recommendations include the may be factored into the clinical decisionregarding the necessity of AED treatment for a woman with epilepsy. Monitoring of lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin levels during pregnancy should be considered. Monitoring of levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine (as monohydroxy derivative) levels during pregnancy may be considered. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute a change in phenobarbital, valproate, primidone, or ethosuximide levels related to pregnancy, but this lack of evidence should not discourage mo nitoring levels of these AEDs during pregnancy. Valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may not transfer into breast milk to as great an extent as primidone, levetiracetam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate. Although many of the AEDs were shown to cross the placenta or enter breast milk, studies were limited in duratio n and did not systematically evaluate neonatal symptoms.Data as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 72 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and publis hed resources when making medical decisions. G uidelines also support the use of AEDs for several common non- epilepsy indications: The American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society state that AEDs with established efficacy for migraine prevention include valproate, divalproex sodium, and topiramate; carbamazepine is noted to be possibl y effective ( Silberstein et al 2012; reaffirmed in 2015; Updat e in progress ). An American Academy of Neurology guideline for pediatric migraine prevention noted that children and adolescents with migraine receiving topiramate ar e probably more likely than those receiving placebo to have a reduction in migraine or headache day frequency, whereas there was insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of extended- release divalproex sodium for reduci ng frequency ( Oskoui et al 2019). The American Academy of Neurology, American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine, a nd A merican Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation state that, for relief of painful diabetic neuropathy, pregabalin is established as effective, and gabapentin and valproate are probably effective ( Bril et al 2011; Update i n pr ogress ). A retired guideline from The American Academy of Neurology states that gabapentin and pregabalin are of benefit i n reducing pain from postherpetic neuralgia ( Dubinsky et al 2004; retired February 27, 2018 ). American Psychiatric Association guidelines describe the key role of AEDs in the management of bipolar disorder, including the following ( Hirschfeld et al 2002): First-line pharmacological treatment for more severe manic or mixed episodes is either lithium plus an antipsychotic or valproate plus an antipsychotic; for less ill patients, monotherapy with lithium, valproate, or a n ant ipsychotic may be sufficient. For mixed episodes, valproate may be preferred over lithium. Carbamazepin e and ox carbazepine are alternatives. First-line pharmacological treatment for bipolar depression is either lithium or lamotrigine. When an acut e depr essive episode of bipolar disorder does not respond to first -line medication treatment, the next steps include adding lamotrigine, bupropion, or paroxetine. The initial treatment for patients who experience rapid cycling should include lithium or valproate; an alternativ e i s lamotrigine. The medications with the best empirical evidence to support their use in maintenance treatment include lithi um and valproate; possible alternatives include lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine. Note: This guideline was published in 2002 and cannot be assumed to be current; however, AEDs continue t o be r ecommended for both acute (mania or hypomania) and maintenance phases of bipolar disorder (Post 2017, Stovall 2018 ). SAFETY SUMMARY Tolerability and safety are as important as efficacy in determining the overall effectiveness of epilepsy treatment (Schachter 2019 ). Common AEs among AEDs include the Schachter 2019). Systemic anxiety , nervousness, insomnia aggression, irritability, hyperactivity depression, mood alteration confusion ataxia blurred or double vision Examples of rare but serious AEs include the following (Schachter 2019, individual package inserts ): suicidal ideation and behavior (AED s as a class, except everolimus )Data as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 73 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and publis hed resources when making and cardiac arrest (phenytoin) Abnormal magnetic resonance imaging signals in infants (vigabat rin) Intramyelinic edema (vigabatrin) A number of AEDs carry boxed warnings related to potentially serious AEs; these include the following: Carbamazepine: Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including TEN and SJS, have been reported. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and t he pr esence of HLA -B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA -B gene. Patients with ancestry in genetically at-risk populations (across broad areas of Asia) should be screened for the presence of HLA -B*1502 prior t o i nitiating treatment with carbamazepine. Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been reported. If a patient exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely, and discontinuation of the drug should be c onsidered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops. Clobazam, c lonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, and midazolam: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Concomitant prescribing should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate, and patients should be followed for signs and symptoms of respiratorydepression and sedation. Felbamate: Use is associated with a marked increase in the incidence of aplastic anemia. Felbamate should only be use d i n patients whose epilepsy is so severe that the risk of aplastic anemia is de emed acceptable. Routine bloo d t esting cannot be reliably used to reduce the incidence of aplastic anemia, but it will in some cases allow detection of hematologic changes before the syndrome declares itself clinically. Felbamate should be di scontinued if any evidence of bone marrow depression occurs. Cases of acute liver failure have been reported. Felbamate should not be prescribed for anyone with a history of hepatic dysfunction. Treatment should be initiated only in individuals without active liver disease and wit h nor mal baseline serum transaminases. It has not been proven that periodic serum transaminase testing will prevent serious injury, but it is generally believed that early detection of drug- induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery. Serum transaminases shoul d be m onitored at baseline and periodically thereafter. Felbamate should be discontinued if either aspartat e ami notransferase ( AST) or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) become increased to 2 times the upper limit of normal, or if clinical signs and symptoms suggest liver failure, and should not be considered for retreatment. Fosphenytoin and phenytoin: There is a cardiovascular risk associated with rapid IV infusion rates. The rate of administration should not exceed recommendations, and careful cardiac monitoring is required.Data as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 74 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and publis hed resources when making medical decisions. Lamotrigine: Cases of life- threatening serious skin rashes, including SJS and TEN, and/or rash -related death have bee n c aused by lamotrigine. Benign rashes are also caused by lamotrigine; however, it is not possible to predict which rashes will prove to be serious. Lamotrigine should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless th e r ash is clearly not drug related. Perampanel: Serious or life- threatening psychiatric and behavioral AEs including aggression, hostility, irritability, anger, a nd hom icidal ideation and threats have been reported. Patients should be monitored for these reactions and for changes in mood, behavior, or personality. The dose should be reduced if these symptoms occur, and it shoul d be d iscontinued if symptoms are severe or worsening. Valproi c acid and divalproex sodium : Hepatotoxicity, including fatalities, have been reported, usually during the first 6 months of treatment. Serum liver tests are required and patients should be monitored closely. There is an increased risk of valproate- induced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with mitochondrial disease. Valproic acid a nd divalproex sodium are contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by polymerase gamma (POLG) gene mutations, and in children < 2 years of age who are suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder . There is a risk to fetuses exposed in utero, particularly neural tube defects, other major malformations, and dec reased intelligence quotient (IQ). Valproate should not be given to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition, and women should use effectiv e c ontraception while using valproate. Pancreatitis, including fatal hemorrhagic cases, has occurred. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. Vigabatrin: Vigabatrin can cause permanent bilateral concentric visual field constriction, including tunnel vision that ca n r esult in disability. In some cases, vigabatrin may also damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Baseline and periodic vision assessment are recommended. However, this assessment cannot always prevent vision damage, and once detected, vision loss due to vigabatrin is not reversible. Vigabatrin should be w ithdrawn from patients who fail to show substantial clinical benefit. Due to the risks of vision loss, vigabatrin is available only through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program ( FDA REMS 2020). Healthcare providers who prescribe vigabatrin and pharmacies that dispense the product must be specially certified. Each patient must be enrolled in the REMS program.Prescribers must ensure that periodic visual monitoring is performed and report any AE suggestive of visio n l oss to program.

These products vary in terms of their indications for specific seizure types and indications other than epilepsy. Overall, the anticonvulsants have demonstrated efficacy for their FDA -approved uses. When possible, monotherapy wit h a s ingle AED is the preferred treatment approach. Patients who are refractory to monotherapy may be treated with combination therapy. When considering combinati on t herapy, it is recommended to combine medications with different mechanisms of action and AE profiles. Comparative efficacy data for the management of epilepsy are limited. Tolerability and safety are as important as efficacy in determining the overall effectiveness of epilepsy treatment. Bot h syst emic AEs and neurologic AEs commonly occur. Some AEDs are associated with rare but serious AE s, and careful patient selection and monitoring are required. Epilepsy management can be complex and is often performed by neurologists. A variety of AEDs should be available t o al low clinicians to select the most clinically appropriate agent for individual patients. Anticonvulsants are also established as effective for several non- epilepsy indications, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and neuropathic pain.Data as of February 20, 2020 KS-U /JA-U /AKS Page 79 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.
