In addition to the Plan's Advisory Body and Subcommittee members, the Office recognizes the following Department of Public Health employees for their contributions: The Office of Health Care Access greatly appreciates the cooperation and assistance of all who contributed to the 2012 Plan.Chris Andresen Olga Armah Carol Bower Marc Cotto Dingfelder Greci Leslie Greer Leonard Guercia Jennifer Filippone Valerie Fisher Tillman Foster Kevin HanstedSalina Hargrove Hynes Cindy Olejarz Pettigrew Sancho Kristin Sullivan Kristen Veneziano Alla VeybermanixEXECUTIVE SUMMARY OVERVIEW The Department of Public Health (DPH) Office of Health Care Access' (OHCA) planning and regulatory activities are intended to increase accessibility, continuity and quality of health services; prevent unnecessary duplication of health resources; and provide financial stability and cost containment of health care services. Section 19a-634 of the Connecticut General Statutes (CGS) charges OHCA with the responsibility of developing and maintaining a Statewide Health Care Facilities and Services Plan (the Plan), along with establishing and maintaining an inventory of all Connecticut health care facilities and services and conducting a biennial utilization study. It is through the Plan that OHCA 's regulatory and planning functions converge, as the Plan is noted in one of nine enumerated statutory guidelines, 1 specifying that when reviewing a Certificate of Need (CON) application, OHCA must take into consideration the relationship of the proposed project to the Plan. The Plan, considered an advisory document, is intended to be a blueprint for health care delivery in Connecticut, serving as a resource for policymakers and those involved in the CON process and providing information, policies and projections of need to guide planning for specific health care facilities and services. It includes standards/guidelines/methodologies for Acute Care Bed Need, Outpatient Surgery, Cardiac Services and Imaging Services/Equipment that, when adopted into regulation, will be utilized in the Certificate of Need review process.2 In addition, the Plan examines unmet need and identifies possible gaps in services. The Plan also incorporates available health care facilities and services utilization data that provide important information regarding shifts in the use of health care resources and services, identify what types of care specific populations use and how frequently, assist in examining the impact of new medical technologies or procedures, and may also indicate areas that warrant further study. These data serve as a foundation for projecting future health care needs and are the basis for determining resource needs. Additionally, through the inventorying of and reporting on utilization of services, the Plan will provide a means of monitoring the adequacy of access. An Advisory Body and three service-specific subcommittees (Acute Care/Ambulatory Surgery, Behavioral Health and Primary Care), and an Imaging Workgroup, consisting of representatives from a cross-section of the health care industry and State government, provided guidance on the development of the Plan. Developed with their input, the Plan's standards and guidelines are intended to guide the CON review and decision-making process, and improve the accessibility and quality of health care services provided. KEY ISSUES The Plan identifies key issues surrounding the delivery of health care in Connecticut: Even before health care reform has been fully implemented, the state's health care system has begun a transformation in response to and in anticipation of major changes in the way health care is financed and delivered. Many provisions of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) favor integrated systems to create efficiencies and address quality. Hospital mergers and the acquisitions of imaging centers and physician practices are key issues surrounding Connecticut's CON process today. As the health care delivery model continues to evolve, it will be important to monitor and assess whether the size, clinician mix and statewide distribution of the health care workforce is sufficient to meet the additional demand. Based on acute care bed need projections for 2015, Connecticut has an adequate supply of acute care inpatient beds statewide, however further study is necessary to determine if gaps in service-specific beds exist in certain regions of the state. As part of OHCA 's planning effort, focus groups were conducted in an effort to identify concerns about behavioral health (mental health and substance use treatment) patients treated in Emergency Departments (EDs) and their 1Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-639, as amended by Public Act 12-170 2These standards and guidelines are not final until adopted as regulation pursuant to Chapter 54 of the Connecticut General Statutes. xability to access behavioral health services. Three common themes emerged from focus group meetings: (1) behavioral health patients presenting at EDs, although other treatment settings would be more appropriate, (2) limited access to behavioral health services (especially inpatient adult or residential youth services and (3) lack of coordination of care between EDs and community based services. Focus group participants expressed concern that these issues will continue as long as EDs are the only \"24/7\" treatment option available. Market trends over the past several years have affected the environment in which hospitals and free-standing imaging centers operate. In the past, there was a steady and ongoing migration of imaging services out of the hospital setting, mostly to physician-owned free-standing imaging centers. Today however, reimbursement issues, access to capital, vendor relationships and physician employment are initiating a wave of acquisitions of imaging equipment at free-standing imaging centers by hospitals. 3 CON approval is required for these acquisitions and purchasers must demonstrate clear public need for the equipment. The behavioral health industry has shifted focus over the past several years from mainly a treatment driven system to one of recovery assistance and resilience enabling. The industry will continue to support this shift by building resilience in children and adolescents and providing greater recovery mechanisms and opportunities for adults. Many primary care providers offer some level of behavioral health care as a service component. Likewise, many behavioral health providers provide a primary care component to address basic needs of their patients. This relationship is a significant effort and growing trend that will likely continue to be emphasized in the health care industry. Connecticut's overall supply of primary care practitioners is adequate, however health care reform's insurance coverage expansion will likely lead to a new and increased demand for primary care services. NEXT STEPS/RECOMMENDATIONS Next steps and recommendations had several sources; they were either suggested directly by subcommittee and advisory body members, evolved from subcommittee and advisory body discussions, or were suggested by reviewers of the Plan. ACUTE CARE/AMBULATORY SURGERY The next steps/recommendations on acute care/ambul atory surgery are intended to build upon the first Plan's efforts. Explore whether and how data on observation days should be collected and submitted to OHCA and determine how the inclusion of bed days would affect the bed need methodology. Examine service type by region to determine if gaps in service exist on a regional basis. Investigate the development of planning regions that best facilitate the ability to assess the availability of and future demand for care, taking into consideration existing hospital service areas. Explore the formation of a statewide task force comprising key industry stakeholders to further examine action steps and solutions needed to address the concerns identified by the ED Focus Groups about inappropriate use of the ED. Evaluate ED capacity issues on an on-going basis. Examine availability of on-call specialty physicians to EDs. Further study Behavioral Health/ED Focus Group findings with the Connecticut Hospital Association (CHA)/Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) to determine if access to behavioral health services is a significant problem at Connecticut's EDs and if there are any opportunities to help improve access. Examine the effect on hospital EDs of increasing reimbursement for outpatient behavioral health programs. Examine the benefits of increasing the number of intermediate care center (ICC) beds. Examine cardiac program quality measures, including risk-adjusted outcomes, institutional and operator performance. 3 Jeter, E. & Sorensen, T. (2010, May 17). The Reconsolidation of Imaging Centers. ImagingBiz . Retrieved from http://www.imagingbiz.com/articles/view/the-reconsolidation-of-imaging centers.xi Continue to review and update Connecticut's cardiac guidelines to reflect current information and recommendations provided by professional societies and organizations with expert knowledge of cardiac care. Encourage the adherence to national cancer clinical practice guidelines and investigate the inclusion of standards and guidelines in future Plans. Consider adopting the following surgical facility classes as defined by the American College of Surgeons: Class A: Provides for minor surgical procedures performed under topical and local infiltration blocks with or without oral or intramuscular preoperative sedation. These procedures are also appropriately performed in Class B and C facilities. Class B: Provides for minor or major surgical procedures performed in conjunction with oral, parenteral, or intravenous sedation or under analgesic or dissociative drugs. These procedures are also appropriately performed in Class C facilities. Class C: Provides for major surgical procedures that require general or regional block anesthesia and support of vital bodily functions. Consider amending the definition of \"operating room\" as follows: \"Operating Room\" means a room with a fully controlled sterile environment that meets either (i) the standard for a Class B or Class C operating room as set forth in the 2006 edition of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Guidelines for the Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities or (ii) the standards for an operating room as forth in the R.C.S.A. \u00a7 19-13-D56, to the extent consistent with section 19a-493b. Include treatment rooms in future Plan discussions related to ambulatory surgery capacity. With respect to ambulatory surgery standards and guidelines, discuss and consider including backlogs in the service area; ability of physicians to schedule block times; patient throughput at other facilities; and the quality of care at other facilities as additional factors for consideration in the next Plan. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH The next steps/recommendations on behavioral health are intended to build upon the efforts of and discussions held by the behavioral health subcommittee. Explore ways that Connecticut's behavioral health service system can measure or determine capacity as it relates to need and access to care. Inventory and discuss behavioral health care services provided by private practitioners and include how the provision of services in private practice contributes to the overall provision of behavioral health care in the state. Further advance the discussion of additional types of providers (e.g., private practitioners, Veterans Administration) and the availability of clinical level services in the state and seek and provide more information on recovery supports available to residents in the state. Inventory distinct service levels. Enhance OHCA 's Hospital Reporting System (HRS) reporting mechanisms to capture accurate, usable data from short term general and children's general hospitals on hospital-based or hospital-affiliated behavioral health care services (such as a revamped Report 450 4 or a new schedule). Provide more focus on the provision and interrelation or co-location of mental health, primary care and/or oral health services within the various settings and provide further discussion as to the concept of \"no wrong door\" to accessing these services at any location. Further consider how health care reform and a possible blended behavioral health license might change the landscape for both behavioral health finance and delivery of care in the future. 4 Hospital Report 450 (Hospital Inpatient and Outpatient Other Services Utilization and FTE Employees) is the form into which hospitals electronically report utilization data to OHCA annually.xiiPRIMARY CARE The Primary Care Subcommittee's next steps/recommendations are intended to assure and enhance the quality of care provided by primary care providers in all settings by eliminating health disparities and barriers to access, and tracking and evaluation of health outcomes and patient satisfaction. Utilize the results of the DPH Primary Care Office survey of primary care providers to report on and highlight access issues related to primary care facilities and services to better identify practitioners' places of practice, affiliations or relationships with institutions (such as hospitals, FQHCs, multi-specialty practices) and to illustrate any primary care workforce needs, size, and distribution issues which the Primary Care Office identifies. Consider adjusting future Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaires so large enough samples are drawn in each county so that results for the questions related to health care access may be used for county level assessment and solutions. Consider mandating responses on all license renewal applications to certain survey questions on whether practitioners are actively practicing in the state; the primary location of practice; if the respondent is currently actively treating patients; and if he/she had ever been convicted of a felony. Improve OHCA 's Hospital Reporting System's reporting mechanisms to capture accurate, usable data from hospitals on hospital-based primary care services (such as a revamped Report 450 or a new schedule) and to collect primary care data on all providers of primary care services. Consider more comprehensively primary care provided by hospital-affiliated entities, which are expanding rapidly throughout the state. Provide additional Plan focus on the provision of mental health and oral health services in primary care settings, and assess the interrelation of these services with primary care. xiiiSECTION 1 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTION11.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 LEGAL AUTHORITY AND MANDATE Section 19a-634 of the Connecticut General Statutes (CGS) charges the Department of Public Health (DPH) Office of Health Care Access (OHCA) with the responsibility of conducting an annual statewide health care facility utilization study, establishing and maintaining an inventory of all Connecticut health care facilities and services and certain equipment specified in statute, and developing and maintaining a Statewide Health Care Facilities and Services Plan (Appendix A). The Plan is one of nine permanent, enumerated guidelines contained in CGS Section 19a-639, as amended by Public Act 12-170, specifying that when reviewing a Certificate of Need (CON) application, OHCA must take into consideration the relationship of the proposed project to the statewide health care facilities and services plan. 1.2 PURPOSE AND VALUE The Plan will serve as a blueprint for health care delivery in Connecticut by providing guidance on resource allocation decisions based on considerations of the appropriate balance of accessible quality health care for the state's residents. In addition, the Plan will: Be a resource document for policymakers and for those involved in the Certificate of Need process; and Provide various entities (e.g., institutions, State and local governments and individuals) with information, policies and projections of need (in some cases) to guide the planning for specific health care facilities and services and the state's health care system. The Plan is premised on establishing an inventory of health care services and facilities, examining access and utilization of certain services, and, as necessary, determining how best to distribute those resources in the most effective and efficient manner. It is intended to sustain hospital5 and health care system financial viability by: Helping to prevent excess capacity and underutilization of medical facilities; Fostering fair competition and a level playing field for entry into the most profitable services; Providing clearer rules for adding services (via CON standards and guidelines); Limiting the proliferation of services that would undermine community providers' ability to maintain financial viability; and Promoting shared service arrangements. The Plan is also intended to provide improved patient access to services by: Providing better access to services through planned geographic distribution; Enhancing primary care access and availability by identifying gaps in services and unmet need; and Lowering overall cost to the health care system by limiting duplication of services. 5 The use of the words \"hospitals\" or \"acute care hospitals\" throughout this document generally refers to hospitals that provide acute care in a general hospital setting. In Connecticut, these hospitals are licensed by the Department of Public Health as either a General Hospital or a Children's General Hospital pursuant to Section 19a-490 of the Connecticut General Statutes and Section 19-13-D1 of the Connecticut Public Health Code.21.3 ADVISORY BODY In October 2010, the Office of Health Care Access invited representatives from a cross section of the health care industry and State government to participate in an advisory body that would be charged with providing guidance on the development of the Plan. Advisory Body members are listed in Appendix B. The advisory body met monthly beginning in November 2010. In May 2011, advisory body subcommittees were formed to conduct more in-depth work in the areas of Acute Care/Ambulatory Surgery, Behavioral Health and Primary Care. Subcommittee members are listed in Appendix C. Both advisory body and subcommittee members provided OHCA with guidance and expertise in the development of CON guidelines, standards, methodologies and analyses used in the Plan, including: Reviewing research conducted by OHCA on other states' facilities plans' standards, guidelines and methodologies and providing feedback and discussion regarding adaptation and applicability for Connecticut's Plan; Recommending authoritative professional organizations, published studies, industry-recognized standards/ guidelines/methodologies, etc., to be considered by OHCA in the development of its plan; Providing insight on industry best practices and evidenced based research; Recommending data sources; and Offering feedback on OHCA 's use and interpretation of available data. 1.4 GUIDING PRINCIPLES The goal of OHCA 's planning and regulation activities is to improve the health of Connecticut's residents; increase the accessibility, continuity and quality of health services; prevent unnecessary duplication of health resources; and provide financial stability and cost containment of health care services. The guiding principles of the Plan are intended to: Promote and support the long term viability of the state's health care delivery system; Ensure that any regulated service will maintain overall access to quality health care; Promote equitable access to health care services (e.g., reducing financial barriers, increasing availability of physicians) and facilitate access to preventive and medically necessary health care; Encourage and support health education, promotion and prevention initiatives; Encourage collaboration among health care providers to develop health care delivery networks; Support the need for a sufficient health care workforce that facilitates access to the appropriate level of care in a timely manner (e.g., optimal number of primary and specialty care providers); Maintain and improve the quality of health care services offered to the state's residents; Promote planning that helps to contain the cost of delivering health care services to its residents; Encourage regional and local participation in discussions/collaboration on health care delivery, financing and provider supply; Promote public policy development through measuring and monitoring unmet need; and Promote planning or other mechanisms that will achieve appropriate allocation of health care resources in the state.CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION3CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 1.5 OVERVIEW OF PLAN STRUCTURE The Plan consists of five major sections: Section One provides an overview of the Plan and examines overarching policy issues. Section Two consists of chapters related to health care facilities, services and equipment for which Certificate of Need (CON) standards and guidelines are included (Acute Care, Outpatient Surgery, and Imaging Services/Equipment).6 Section Three consists of chapters on unmet need/gaps in services, Primary Care and Behavioral Health. Section Four provides next steps/recommendations and discusses data sources and limitations. Section Five consists of an inventory of health care facilities, services and imaging equipment in Connecticut. Prior to the publication of this Plan, OHCA used Certificate of Need as its primary planning tool. With the release of this Plan, however, OHCA 's ability to plan systematically for Connecticut's health care system will be improved. The Plan is, by design, an advisory document. The Plan includes new standards and guidelines for health-care related activities that will be utilized in the Certificate of Need review process once adopted into regulation. NOTE: THESE STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES ARE NOT FINAL UNTIL ADOPTED AS REGULATION PURSUANT TO CHAPTER 54 OF THE CONNECTICUT GENERAL STATUES. In addition to containing CON guidelines, standards and methodologies, the Plan incorporates available health care facilities and services utilization data.7 Such data are useful from a policy and planning perspective in that they provide important information regarding shifts in the use of health care resources and services, identify what types of services specific populations use and how frequently, assist in examining the impact of new medical technologies or procedures, and may also indicate areas that warrant further study. These data serve as a foundation for projecting future health care needs and as the basis for determining resource needs (e.g., personnel, training or facilities planning). 8 Additionally, through the reporting of utilization of services, the Plan provides a means of monitoring the adequacy of access. 1.6 INTERPRETATION OF THE PLAN The Plan becomes effective upon publication date, and will become applicable to Certificate of Need applications effective 90 days after its effective date. The effective dates of this Plan are State Fiscal Y ear 2012 through 2014. In its deliberations involving a CON application, when making findings concerning the relationship of a proposed project to the Plan, OHCA shall consider the most recent version of the Plan in effect on the date of the decision, regardless of when the application was filed or public hearing held. In reviewing CON applications, OHCA first applies CGS 19a-639 guidelines and principles, and then considers any additional standards adopted through regulation and provided in the Plan. As previously noted, these standards and guidelines will not be final until adopted as regulation pursuant to Chapter 54 of the Connecticut General Statutes. In reviewing CON applications, the latest version of the Inventory of Connecticut Health Care Services and Facilities and published utilization reports shall be considered. The Inventory of Connecticut Health Care Services and Facilities shall be available from the Department of Public Health Office of Health Care Access, 410 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06134, (860) 418-7001 and at http://www.ct.gov/dph/cwp/view.asp?a=3902&q=277344 Unless otherwise noted, the five Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP) Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS) regions are the geographic areas utilized in determining utilization rates but shall not be the service area for individual Certificate of Need applications. Recommendations for expansion of standards and guidelines are only effective and applicable to Certificate of Need 6 Although they do not include standards and guidelines, Long Term Care and Rehabilitation Services are also broadly addressed in this section. While not part of the main focus of the plan, these services and facilities are part of its planning and inventorying efforts as they represent a significant portion of the continuum of care. 7In those years when a Facilities and Services Plan is not published, utilization data are presented in an annual utilization study. 8 Bernstein A.B., Hing, E., Moss, A.J., Allen, K.F., R.B.

Any references, guidelines or national standards mentioned in this Plan means the most current version, and the Plan incorporates the most recent version, as amended from time-to-time. 1.7 RELATIONSHIP OF PLAN TO HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 AND CONNECTICUT STATE HEALTH PLANNING Healthy People 2020 is a 10-year national strategic health initiative led by the US Department of Health and Human Services which establishes objectives for health promotion and disease prevention for Americans. The initiative tracks 1,200 objectives organized into 42 topic areas, each of which represents a specific public health area. Within the topic area \" Access to Health Services\" is the initiative's goal of improving access to comprehensive, quality health care services. Healthy People 2020 acknowledges the importance of access to a location where needed health care services are provided and identifies such access to health services as a determinant influencing health status. Lack of or limited access to health services may greatly impact an individual's health. Barriers to access (e.g., the lack of availability of care) can lead to unmet health needs, delays in receiving appropriate care, the inability to obtain preventive services and, ultimately, preventable hospitalizations. 9 Healthy People 2020 specifically cites (1) increasing and measuring access to appropriate, safe and effective care, and (2) decreasing disparities and measuring access to care for diverse populations, including racial and ethnic minorities and older adults, as two issues that should be monitored over the next decade. The Department of Public Health is the lead agency for public health planning and is mandated to assist in the development of collaborative planning activities that respond to public health needs. DPH is currently conducting a State Health Assessment and developing a comprehensive, long term State Health Improvement Plan (Healthy Connecticut 2020). Healthy Connecticut is our state's translation of the national Healthy People effort. Once completed, the Assessment and Improvement Plans will complement future facilities and services planning efforts by providing additional guidance and focus. Together, these Plans will provide a mechanism for identifying community need, assessing the health care system's capability of meeting those needs and allowing for the allocation of the necessary resources to address those needs. 1.8 CERTIFICATE OF NEED (CON) OVERVIEW 1.8.1 CON DEFINITION, PURPOSE AND HISTORY Certificate of Need (CON) is a regulatory governmental program10 requiring certain types of health care providers to obtain State approval prior to making substantial capital investments in new equipment or facilities, changing bed complement (in hospitals) and adding or sometimes discontinuing a health care service. The CON program is intended to guide the establishment of health facilities and services which best serve public needs, ensure that high quality health services are provided, prevent unnecessary duplication of health care facilities and services and promote cost containment. States maintain CON programs to achieve a number of health policy goals. While the specific goals may differ somewhat among states and vary from one health service to another, all CON regulation and related planning are intended to promote access, ensure quality, and help control costs by limiting market entry to those facilities and services that are found to be needed, appropriately supported and designed to promote quality and equitable access to care. The rationale for imposing market entry controls is that regulation, grounded in community-based planning, will result in more appropriate allocation and distribution of health care resources and thereby, help assure access to care, maintain or 9Healthy People 2020. Retrieved from http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=1 10 Connecticut's CON program is regulated by two State agencies. The Department of Social Services (DSS) operates the program for nursing homes, homes for the aged and rest homes. The Department of Public Health (DPH) Office of Health Care Access administers the program for all other health care facilities.CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION5CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION improve quality, and help control health care capital spending.11 CON regulation also provides certain restrictions on exiting the market to ensure appropriate access is maintained. CON regulation in Connecticut has its roots in the early 1970s, when many states established such programs in an attempt to exercise control over a rapidly expanding health care system. Changes in health care delivery, increased health care spending, gains in private and public health insurance coverage, population growth and physician workforce expansion and specialization all contributed to states' push to require certificates of need in the health care industry. Connecticut's Certificate of Need (CON) program was established in 1973 (P .A. 73-117) in anticipation of the enactment of federal legislation, The National Health Planning and Resources Development Act (P .L. 93-641), which provided substantial funding for state and local health planning activities and CON programs. 1.8.2 RECENT CON CHANGES For nearly four decades, CON has shaped the structure of the health care system in Connecticut. The state's CON program has evolved over time and most recently, the scope of the program has become more focused on a limited number of health care facility and project categories. In 2010, Connecticut's CON program underwent significant changes, in part, to be responsive to impending shifts in the health care delivery system resulting from federal health care reform efforts focused on the development of a patient-centered integrated delivery system. The changes also improved CON's utility as a planning tool by: Better aligning health care resources with community needs; Simplifying CON procedural requirements; Focusing CON oversight on preserving access to \"safety net\" services; Avoiding potential areas of over-saturation or over-utilization; and Improving CON criteria to address the financial stability of the health care delivery system and enhance quality of patient care. 1.8.3 CON STATUTES AND IMPLEMENTATION Health care projects that fall within certain jurisdictional parameters are subject to review and decision by OHCA. Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-638 specifies that a CON is required for: 1) The establishment of a new health care facility; 2) A transfer of ownership of a health care facility;3) The establishment of a free-standing emergency department; 4) The termination of inpatient or outpatient services offered by a hospital, including, but not limited to, the termination by a short-term acute care general hospital or children's hospital of inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance abuse services; 5) The establishment of an outpatient surgical facility, as defined in section 19a-493b, or as established by a short-term acute care general hospital; 6) The termination of surgical services by an outpatient surgical facility, as defined in section 19a-493b, or a facility that provides outpatient surgical services as part of the outpatient surgery department of a short-term acute care general hospital, provided termination of outpatient surgical services due to (A) insufficient patient volume, or (B) the termination of any subspecialty surgical service, shall not require certificate of need approval; 7) The termination of an emergency department by a short-term acute care general hospital; 8) The establishment of cardiac services, including inpatient and outpatient cardiac catheterization, interventional cardiology and cardiovascular surgery; 11American Health Planning Association. CON Background. Retrieved from http://www.ahpanet.org/copn.html69) The acquisition of computed tomography scanners, magnetic resonance imaging scanners, positron emission tomography scanners or positron emission tomography-computed tomography scanners, by any person, physician, provider, short-term acute care general hospital or children's hospital (except for acquisition of any equipment by any person that is to be used exclusively for scientific research that is not conducted on humans); 10) The acquisition of non-hospital based linear accelerators; 11) An increase in the licensed bed capacity of a health care facility; 12) The acquisition of equipment utilizing technology that has not previously been utilized in the state; 13) An increase of two or more operating rooms within any three-year period, commencing on and after October 1, 2010, by an outpatient surgical facility or by a short-term acute care general hospital; and 14) The termination of inpatient or outpatient services offered by a hospital or other facility or institution operated by the State that provides services that are eligible for reimbursement under Title XVIII or XIX of the Federal Social Security Act, 42 USC 301, as amended. Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-639, as amended by Public Act 12-170, specifies that when considering a CON application, OHCA must take into consideration each of the following guidelines and principles: 1) Whether the proposed project is consistent with any applicable policies and standards adopted in regulations by the Department of Public Health; 2) The relationship of the proposed project to the statewide health care facilities and services plan; 3) Whether there is a clear public need for the health care facility or services proposed by the applicant; 4) Whether the applicant has satisfactorily demonstrated how the proposal will impact the financial strength of the health care system in the state or that the proposal is financially feasible for the applicant; 5) Whether an applicant has satisfactorily demonstrated how the proposal will improve quality, accessibility and cost effectiveness of health care delivery in the region; 6) The applicant's past and proposed provision of health care services to relevant patient populations and payer mix; 7) Whether an applicant has satisfactorily identified the population to be served by the proposed project and satisfactorily demonstrated that the identified population has a need for the proposed services; 8) The utilization of existing health care facilities and health care services in the service area of the applicant; and 9) Whether an applicant has satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposed project shall not result in an unnecessary duplication of existing or approved health care services or facilities. CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION7CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION In November, 2010, the Department of Public Health, in accordance with Public Act 10-179, adopted interim Certificate of Need Policies and Procedures for Implementation of Public Act 10-179, \u00a787, 89-93, which will be utilized by OHCA until official regulations are adopted by the General Assembly. 1.8.4 CERTIFICATE OF NEED AND HEALTH CARE REFORM The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) includes two provisions that may affect Connecticut's CON program: an increase in the insured population that will demand more services, which, in turn, may call for increased provider capacity; and provider payment reforms, which may restore some of the market constraints on prior health care system expansion. While it is unclear what the exact effect of these provisions will be, certain communities or regions may have adequate capacity to absorb increased demand, whereas those with a higher proportion of currently uninsured and less capacity may increase health care providers' reliance upon the CON program for health planning. 12 1.8.5 MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND AFFILIATIONS Even before health care reform has been fully implemented, the state's health care system has begun a transformation in response to and in anticipation of major changes in the way health care is financed and delivered. Many provisions of the PPACA favor integrated systems to create efficiencies and address quality. Hospital mergers and the acquisitions of imaging centers and physician practices are key issues surrounding Connecticut's CON process today. Hospitals are pursuing affiliation arrangements and mergers in an effort to contend with growing financial pressures driven by such factors as providing uncompensated care, treating the uninsured in crowded emergency departments, caring for Medicaid patients whose cost of care often exceeds federal and State reimbursement rates, the threat of reduced reimbursement by government payers and tough negotiations with health insurers over contract terms related to the cost of medical services. Financially struggling hospitals see mergers with stronger hospitals as a way to survive in the face of thin profits, gain access to capital to make needed facilities improvements or acquire technological equipment and contend with debt and liability issues. Affiliations help smaller hospitals share the cost of new technology, provide the opportunity to access specialists at larger hospitals and also offer patients a wider range of treatment and services. 13 A growing number of Connecticut hospitals have become members of larger corporate health care systems. This trend may be the result of a variety of factors including: a weak economy, increased competition in the health care market, anticipation of changes due to federal health care reform, an attempt to gain leverage in payer contract negotiations, to develop economies of scale when purchasing supplies and services, and to improve access to capital. Additional hospitals are currently in discussion with other health care systems or have officially submitted applications for regulatory approval that would alter the current structure of Connecticut's existing hospitals. It should be noted that while every hospital is analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing affiliations and possible mergers, some hospitals are deciding that affiliating or merging is not the best route for their institutions or their communities. Table 1.1 represents general hospitals that are part of a larger health care system at the time this document was published. 12 Y ee, T., Stark, L.B., Bond, A. M. & Carrier, E. (2011).

The current wave of mergers, acquisitions and affiliations is likely to continue throughout implementation of health care reform as health care providers react to shrinking payments and changes in the delivery of health care. The strategic financial and quality-of-care advantages associated with the integration of hospitals, physician practices and imaging centers are important drivers in today's CON environment.

These issues include health care reform, health information technology and workforce concerns. 2.1 HEALTH CARE REFORM The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, of 2010 (collectively referred to as federal health care reform) is far-reaching legislation that will transform Connecticut's health care system in many ways. The legislation has numerous provisions that will be implemented over several years; thus the short- and long-term ramifications of reform will not be fully realized for some time. What is clear, however, is that an increase in the number of insured residents, coupled with changes in funding, reimbursement, transparency and innovation will certainly affect Connecticut's health care facilities and providers, their administrative costs and the services they provide. In addition, the implementation of new models of care may require the adoption of new analyses of systems of care needs and performance. 2.1.1 INSURANCE COVERAGE EXPANSION The PPACA contains a number of provisions aimed at increasing health insurance coverage, including an optional State expansion of Medicaid to cover individuals in households with incomes below 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL); a requirement that states (or the federal government) develop and run health insurance exchanges through which individuals and small businesses can purchase health insurance coverage; a requirement that large and mid-size employers provide employee coverage or face possible penalties; and a requirement that most individuals obtain coverage through a private source or a public program or be penalized for non-compliance. 16 Connecticut has a relatively low uninsured rate. Approximately 13% of the state's non-elderly are uninsured, compared to a national average of 18%.17 This rate reflects, in part, the state's high rate of employer-sponsored coverage, relatively generous Medicaid eligibility limits and a new Medicaid program for low-income adults that replaced its State-Administered General Assistance (SAGA) medical program. It is estimated that, with health care reform, the proportion of Connecticut residents with health insurance will increase from 89 to 95%, or 170,000 residents, by 2016. Additionally, enrollment in Medicaid is estimated to increase by 130,000, or 31%. 18 Although expanded coverage options offered under the PPACA will likely result in a surge in demand for health care services statewide, some individuals are likely to remain uninsured (e.g., undocumented persons will not be eligible to purchase coverage from a health insurance exchange). Consequently, beginning in 2014, payments to hospitals through the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program19 will be significantly reduced by 75%.20 After the initial reduction, payment increases will be based on the percentage of the population that is uninsured and the amount of uncompensated care provided. Hospitals have expressed concern however, that the increase in insured individuals may not make up for the decrease in revenue. 16 Auerbach, D., Nowak, S., Ringel, J.S., Girosi, F., Eibner, C., McGlynn, E.A. & Wasserman, J.

Retrieved from http://www.pillsburylaw.com/siteFiles/Publications/2C9547A6BFCBB37D8366EA2272190123.pdf12Healthcare coverage, alone, does not guarantee access to health care services. Successful implementation of federal health care reform will depend on Connecticut's response to access issues including workforce and infrastructure capacity, and the regional supply of health care services. Access to health care will depend on the adequacy of the state's health care infrastructure (e.g., hospitals, clinics, etc.), available technology and necessary workforce capacity. 21 The capacity of the state's workforce is discussed later in this chapter. 2.1.2 COMMUNITY BENEFIT With approximately 385,60022 currently uninsured persons in Connecticut, providing charity care has historically been a significant portion of hospital community benefit activities. As noted above, the PPACA includes coverage, subsidy and penalty provisions that will extend insurance coverage to an estimated 170,000 state residents. 23 As the provisions of health care reform are implemented, Connecticut's hospitals will likely have fewer patients relying on charity care. To ensure that nonprofit hospitals continue to provide community benefit, the PPACA establishes a new set of requirements for hospitals to maintain their tax-exempt status. The PPACA also requires non-profit hospitals to conduct a community needs assessment every three years and to adopt implementation strategies to meet identified community health needs. Under the Act, hospitals are required to give increased attention to working with others to determine community health needs and take action to meet those needs, and to implement financial assistance and billing and collection polices that protect consumers. Hospitals will be obligated to collaborate with public health agencies, align patient payment requirements with patient financial capacity, advance community participation and promote public knowledge regarding hospital practices. 24 This emphasis on hospital engagement in consultative processes with relevant stakeholders is intended to ensure that hospital community benefit activities reflect an inclusive and interactive planning process.25 As part of this mandate, non-profit hospitals are required to submit audited financial statements as evidence of the community benefits they report. Although the law does not base federal tax exemption on a nonprofit hospital's provision of community benefits at any specific quantitative level, the IRS will apply a 'facts and circumstances' test to determine whether the benefits a hospital provides to its community are sufficient to warrant its federal tax exemption. 26 Hospitals' community needs assessments should collectively encompass all of the state's 169 towns. Once completed by all of Connecticut's non-profit hospitals, they will become a valuable resource for hospital planning for future versions of the Plan as they will assist the State in identifying communities' health needs and establish priorities for addressing them. Vulnerable populations and their needs may vary substantially from one community to another, and through implementation of its Statewide Health Care Facilities and Services Plan, DPH may have the opportunity to play a role in planning to channel community benefit efforts appropriately. 27 The state's acute care hospitals are actively working 21 Taylor, M.

They are profiling communities, identifying partners and looking at common elements. DPH and the Connecticut Hospital Association (CHA) are communicating on the coordination of Community Needs Assessments with the statewide health improvement planning process. 2.1.3 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY Non-profit hospitals are required to adopt, implement and widely publicize a written financial assistance policy. This policy must include the eligibility criteria for financial assistance and whether it includes free or discounted care, the basis for calculating patient charges and the process for applying for financial assistance. Each hospital must also adopt and implement a policy to provide emergency medical treatment to individuals. The policy must prevent discrimination in providing emergency care, including denial of service, against those eligible for financial assistance under the hospital's financial assistance policy or government assistance. 28 It is expected that there will be increased administrative costs for non-profit facilities to implement this provision.29 2.1.4 PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT BASED ON PERFORMANCE The PPACA includes provisions that will significantly affect providers and their reimbursement. Two payment systems have been established that directly tie reimbursement to performance -Value Based Purchasing (VBP) and bundled payments. 2.1.4.1 Value-based Purchasing Effective October 1, 2012, the PPACA mandates a value based purchasing model for all hospitals, where incentive payments are given to hospitals that meet or exceed benchmarks set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).30 Beginning in 2013, under this provision, a percentage of payments to hospitals will be tied to their performance on certain quality measures for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia, surgeries and healthcare associated infections. It is expected that these quality measures and the accompanying reporting requirements will increase administrative costs. It is not yet known if the increased payments would offset the anticipated administrative costs. 2.1.4.2 Bundled Payments In addition to the VBP reimbursement model, the PPACA established a 5-year Medicare voluntary bundled payment pilot, beginning in January 2013, for integrating care across hospitals, physicians and post-acute care providers during an episode of care for certain medical conditions. This pilot program pays for the overall management of a patient's health rather than discrete health care services, with a single reimbursement covering an entire episode of care31 rather than separate payments to hospitals and doctors involved in different aspects of a patient's care. Parallel goals of this effort are to correct the inefficiency of the current fee-for-service model and to lower hospital readmission rates. If the pilot is successful in reducing costs while maintaining quality, the Act allows for program expansion in 2016.32 2.1.4.3 Infection Control and Preventable Hospitalizations There are also health care reform provisions designed to encourage higher-quality care. Hospitals will need to improve their infection control programs or face reduced Medicare payments. Medicare payments to hospitals will also be reduced for preventable readmissions for certain conditions. 28 Kasprak, J. (2011, May 10).

The Prevention and Public Health Fund is intended to provide ongoing support to public health and prevention programs at the national, state and local level. The burden of chronic disease (e.g., heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes) presents a significant public health challenge to Connecticut. Since enactment of the PPACA in March 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded approximately $8.28 million in grants to organizations in Connecticut through this fund for wellness and prevention efforts. 33 These include $790,000 for community and clinical prevention efforts, $593,000 for strengthening the public health infrastructure and $6,901,000 to support the expansion of the public health workforce. 2.1.6 INNOVATION Health care reform is leading to innovations in the delivery of health care, focusing on primary care, care coordination and chronic disease management. They include: Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), which are networks of physicians, hospitals and other health professionals, that coordinate patient care and share in the savings generated for the government by keeping Medicaid patients healthy. It should be noted that it remains to be seen if the success of ACOs in achieving goals (reducing duplication of services, improving care and saving money), and consequently reducing hospital utilization, will create direct competition between physicians and hospitals, as the physicians will be incentivized to reduce hospital admissions; Medical homes, which are health care settings such as a primary care practice, that serve as the central coordinator for a patient's health care needs; and Health Information Technology improvements, discussed in more detail in the section below. 2.2 HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 2.2.1 HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND EXCHANGE The healthcare system in Connecticut and across the country is facing increasing costs, inconsistent payer rates, and independent information systems. One of the strategies to address these challenges is the coordination of health information exchange to improve health status and the experience of care for patients while reducing the cost of care. Health information technology and exchange (HITE) makes it possible for health care providers to better manage patient care through secure use and sharing of health information. A key component of HITE is the use of electronic health records (EHRs) instead of paper medical records to report patients' diagnostic data among healthcare providers serving that patient. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the HITECH Act) that sets forth a plan for advancing the appropriate use of health information technology to improve quality of care and establish a foundation for health care reform. The Act committed more than $48 billion over five years to develop data exchange systems and to encourage 'meaningful use' of health data exchange in a secure technological environment. These efforts, along with healthcare practices, support the five-year goals of better technology and information to transform health care for providers, payers and patients. Healthcare professionals in all fields will be required to assess and modify clinical practice, adapt roles and responsibilities, and create an environment that encourages innovation in practice through health IT/HIE. Direct patient care organizations such as hospitals, community clinics and private practices represent key settings for transforming the way health information is used to support improvements in the quality of care and efficiency of the Connecticut healthcare system. In Connecticut, the HITECH Act authorized over $13 million for multiple projects to advance health information exchange. The Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH) serves as advocate, regulator, and consumer of health 33 HealthCare.gov. The Affordable Care Act's Prevention and Public Health Fund in Y our State: Connecticut. Retrieved at http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/prevention/states/ct.htmlCHAPTER 2 OVERARCHING ISSUES15CHAPTER 2 OVERARCHING ISSUES information technology and exchange to serve public health and health care needs in Connecticut. In June 2009, DPH published the Connecticut State Health Information Technology Plan to set the agenda for health care information exchange and technology. By the end of 2009, DPH was designated as the State Health Information Exchange grantee to plan for a sustainable statewide health information exchange system for Connecticut. DPH contracted with the Health Information Technology Exchange of Connecticut (HITE-CT) to build and manage an HIE System. A majority of the HITECH Act investment is allocated for incentive payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to clinicians and hospitals when they use electronic health records (EHRs) in specific meaningful ways to improve care. The health care system's infrastructure in Connecticut ranges from a one-physician office to a 1,000 bed general hospital, with the scope of health care services expanding this range exponentially. The diverse and extensive components of Connecticut's health care system share a common issue - a limited infrastructure and capacity to exchange health information in a secure, efficient, and timely manner. 2.2.2 MEANINGFUL USE CMS and the US Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) established the Meaningful Use of Health Information Exchange priority for healthcare providers. The CMS Incentive Payment Program is based on a provider's attestation of meaningful use of electronic health data exchange. The requirements for meaningful use focus on medical objectives and certified electronic health record (EHR) technology for exchanging patient data on medications, laboratory results, diagnostics, radiological, and continuing care or medical home specific needs. 2.2.3 HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND EXCHANGE OF CONNECTICUT The Health Information Technology Exchange of Connecticut (HITE-CT) was established under Connecticut General Statute Section 19a-750 as a quasi-public agency managed by an appointed Board of Directors to coordinate and oversee Health Information Exchange (HIE) activities for the State. The members of the Board include key Connecticut stakeholders representing health care providers, medical researchers, academia, payers, employers, attorneys, State agencies, consumers and consumer advocates. Several initiatives underway in Connecticut have laid the groundwork for a state structure, and the priorities and concerns of the stakeholders involved will shape the state system. There are many local and regional health information exchange efforts underway in Connecticut. While most are still in the early planning stages, a number of initiatives are well developed, building stakeholder support and developing business plans with the expectation that they will move to implementation in the near future. Several of these are collaborations between hospitals and their affiliated providers; the goal being to help providers implement a single EHR product that would provide data exchange between them, the hospital, and other connected providers. 2.3 WORKFORCE The implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) will likely increase demand for health care services as a result of expanded coverage.34 Public health officials expect that following an initial surge, demand will level, but will likely remain greater than levels prior to PPACA implementation. As the health care delivery model continues to evolve, it will be important to monitor and assess whether the size, clinician mix and statewide distribution of the health care workforce is sufficient to meet the additional demand. The number of Connecticut residents age 65 and older is projected 35 to increase by 60%, from 500,000 in 2010 to 800,000 in 2030 (Fig 2.1). In 2030, one out of every five Connecticut residents will be 65 years of age or older. Demand for health care services increases with age. For example, Connecticut's 65-and-older population is at least three times more likely than younger people to have an inpatient hospital stay (Table 2.1). Similar inpatient hospital use rates applied to the 2030 population estimates would result in 100,000 additional 65-and-older hospital inpatients. Emergency 34Taylor, M. 6. 35Connecticut State Data Center population projections16and outpatient health care services could experience similar increases in demand. Shifts in the type of care required by the elderly may also occur as Connecticut attempts to rebalance its long term care system from nursing home care to community placement, under the Money Follows the Person (MFP) program. 36 The growing number of people with chronic diseases and the continued need to treat behavioral and mental health issues will likely result in greater demand for health care services. In addition, evolving changes in health care delivery models, reimbursement and government policy changes will have a significant effect on the types of care, provider types and service location. The demand for healthcare workforce outside of acute care settings is growing and may require Connecticut's future health care workforce to adjust to satisfy demand for additional ambulatory and home health care services in the community.Fig 2.1: Connecticut's Aging Population, 2010-2030 Source: Connecticut State Data Center population projections Table 2.1: Inpatient Utilization Projections by Age Group, Connecticut, 2010 and 2030 Source: Connecticut DPH, Office of Health Care Access Acute Care Hospital Inpatient Discharge Database aConnecticut\u0007State\u0007Data\u0007Center\u0007population\u0007projections 36 Money Follows the Person (MFP) is a federal demonstration program designed to help states rebalance their long term care systems to better support people living in institutions who want instead to live in the community.

Many of Connecticut's health care providers are approaching retirement age (Table 2.2 and Appendix D). Between one quarter and one third of Connecticut's licensed physicians, dentists, psychologists and alcohol/drug counselors are 60 years of age and older. In addition, in seven of the ten major licensed practitioner categories, at least 20% of the workforce is 60 years of age and older. Connecticut's largest cohort of health care practitioner type is registered nurses. Approximately 57,000 registered nurses are licensed at a rate of 1,606.8 per 100,000 population. However, determining the adequacy of Connecticut's practitioner supply is difficult. The use of existing licensing data may inflate practitioner supply, as key workforce elements (actively practicing, participating in direct patient care, or type of industry employed in) are not fully captured. DPH is presently collaborating with the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) to enhance its ability to collect workforce data for future planning efforts. NCSBN is a not-for-profit organization working to create a national public use nursing workforce database. DPH has initiated the collection of additional workforce data through its E-licensing program and is working to become a fully participating member in this national effort. 2.3.2 WORKFORCE DEMAND Connecticut's health care industry currently faces personnel shortages in physicians, surgeons, specialty areas, nurses and allied health professionals. In addition, the high cost of malpractice premiums and significant on-call burden have hindered the state's ability to meet the demand for surgeons and subspecialty surgeons. Hospitals face several significant cost issues involving recruiting and the retention of nurses. High vacancy rates are being seen in specialty fields such as emergency department and psychiatric nursing. 37 Projecting future workforce demand is difficult, given the uncertainty of future demand factors. It is clear that Connecticut has an aging population and older patients require more frequent and complex care. However, other factors are not as clearly defined. Shifts in patient care trends and proposed changes in health care related law (i.e., potential medication administration changes) may rapidly change the health care settings and practitioner mix necessary to deliver optimal, affordable patient care.Table 2.2: Selected Licensed Practitioners, Connecticut, licensure data aIncludes\u0007all\u0007practitioners\u0007holding\u0007an\u0007active\u0007Connecticut\u0007license bErroneous\u0007age\u0007values\u0007and\u0007age\u0007values\u0007of\u0007less\u0007than\u000714\u0007and\u0007greater\u0007than\u000790\u0007have\u0007been\u0007omitted\u0007from\u0007the\u0007calculation cBased\u0007on\u0007Census\u00072010\u0007data 37State of Connecticut, Task Force Report.

Ranked by the projected number of annual openings between 2008 and 2018, the five most in-demand health occupations are: Registered Nurses, Home Health Aides, Nursing Aides, Orderlies and Attendants, Licensed Practical and Licensed Vocational Nurses and Medical Assistants (Table 2.4). The data suggest that many of the job openings in nursing are due to replacement of lost workers, sometimes referred to as \"churning, \" and indicate that a significant portion of new practitioner hiring will maintain and not increase numbers. 38 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

If the scope of practice for Medical Assistants is expanded to include the administration of medication, demand for Medical Assistants may rise significantly, as LPNs currently provide medication and vaccinations. As elder advocates and government agencies seek to maintain elderly patients in the community, a growing demand for home health workers such as Personal Care Assistants and Home Health Aides may be required, in addition to registered nurses, to provide at-home care. The Connecticut Health Care Workforce Assessment report also states that in regard to workforce, the worst supply/ demand mismatch is for primary care physicians. 42 \"If reimbursement practices are changed to bring primary reimbursement into closer alignment with specialty practice, then more physicians may go into primary care practice. Without this change, there will continue to be a primary care physician shortage. \"43 According to the most recent data available from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Connecticut has a professional shortage44 of primary care (72 full time equivalents), dental (75) and mental health (38) practitioners on a statewide basis (Figure 2.2). Figure 2.2: Connecticut Health Care Practitioner Full Time Equivalent (FTE) Shortages Source: U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Furthermore, a 2011 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation report, Primary Care Health Workforce in the United States,45 indicated that the supply of physicians is not the only determinant of access to quality care. The report concludes that \" An adequate number of health care providers is necessary, but not sufficient, to provide access to high quality care. \" The report asserted that health care policy makers should focus their efforts on the geographic maldistribution of primary care providers to improve patient access and outcomes rather than looking exclusively at practitioner volumes. It will also be important to examine and determine the optimal mix of primary care providers (MD/APRN/PA) for Connecticut's health care needs. 42 Holm, et al., 23. 43 Holm, et al. 44 Further information on Health Professional Shortage Areas can be found at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HRSA Web site: http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/shortage/ 45 Dower, C., O'Neil, E.

HPSAs are designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) as having shortages of primary medical care, dental or mental health providers, and are further classified as being a specific geographic area, a specific population group, or in some cases, a specific facility. 46 Connecticut currently has 39 Primary Medical Care, 40 Dental and 27 Mental Health shortage areas. Thus, even with an adequate overall supply of health care providers,47 their practice focus and distribution throughout Connecticut may not be optimal. Additional details on HPSAs are included in Chapter 9. 46 Further information on Health Professional Shortage Areas can be found at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HRSA Web site: http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/shortage/ 47 Maine's 2008-2009 State Health Plan states that New England exceeds U.S. averages on available physicians - CT has 156 primary care docs per 100,000 (2006). CHAPTER 2 OVERARCHING ISSUES21SECTION 2 CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CAREACUTE CARE233.0 ACUTE CARE Acute care is a branch of health care where a patient is treated for a severe injury or episode of illness, an urgent medical condition, or during recovery from surgery and is typically of a short duration. Acute care may require an emergency department visit, a hospital stay or treatment in an ambulatory surgery center, diagnostic services, surgery, or follow-up outpatient community care. 3.1 ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS According to Connecticut General Statutes (CGS), \"hospital\" means an establishment for the lodging, care and treatment of persons suffering from disease or other abnormal physical or mental conditions and includes inpatient psychiatric services in general hospitals (19a-490(b)). According to Connecticut Public Health Code (PHC) that regulates hospitals, a General Hospital is defined as a short-term hospital that has facilities, medical staff and all necessary personnel to provide diagnosis, care and treatment of a wide range of acute conditions, including injuries (19-13-D3); a Children's General Hospital is a short-term hospital having facilities, medical staff and all necessary personnel to provide diagnosis, care and treatment of a wide range of acute conditions among children, including injuries (19-13-D4). Connecticut's 30 acute care hospitals provide a wide range of services from basic community level medical care to treatment of serious, complex medical illnesses (see Inventory Table 3 for a general list of services provided by individual hospital). Of the hospitals, 29 are licensed as a \"General Hospital\" and one, Connecticut Children's Medical Center (CCMC) is licensed as a \"Children's General Hospital. \" 48 The use of the terms \"hospital\" or \"acute care hospitals\" throughout this section refers to the 29 general hospitals and one children's general hospital. All but one of the state's hospitals currently are not-for-profit; however the number of for-profit hospitals may increase as the result of proposed hospital consolidations. All of Connecticut's hospitals provide services for Medicare and Medicaid patients and have a comprehensive free care policy. Federal law mandates that hospitals must provide treatment for all patients, regardless of ability to pay. 49 The vast majority of hospitals are located in the central or southwestern part of the state (Figure 3.1). Hospital size and setting differ greatly throughout the state and range from small community hospitals in rural locations to large urban-based hospitals providing a wide range of specialty care using advanced technology. Using licensed beds as an indicator of size, hospitals range from a relatively small, rural, 94-bed facility to a 1,008 bed, large, urban-setting campus (see Inventory Table 2 for a complete listing of hospitals). 48In addition to CCMC, Y ale-New-Haven Hospital operates a \"Children's Hospital\" within its General Hospital license. 49 Congress enacted the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act (EMTALA) in 1986 to ensure public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay. Section 1867 of the Social Security Act requires that Medicare-participating hospitals that provide emergency services conduct a medical screening examination (MSE) when a request is made for examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition (EMC), including active labor, regardless of an individual's ability to pay. Hospitals are then required to provide stabilizing treatment for patients with EMCs. If a hospital is unable to stabilize a patient or if the patient requests a transfer, then an appropriate transfer should be made. 24Figure 3.1: Acute Care Hospitals in Connecticut and Locations CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE25CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE 3.1.1 ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL UTILIZATION In FY 2010, Connecticut hospitals treated and discharged approximately 426,000 patients. These patients received a variety of inpatient services that are related to child birth, cardiac care, respiratory issues, general medicine, women's health and other services. These inpatient services accounted for more than two million patient days. Although inpatient care continues to serve as the bedrock for acute care, more effective medicines, improved procedures and follow-up care, and advanced technology have facilitated the growing trend in which acute care is delivered outside of traditional hospital settings.Nationally, inpatient usage has declined while outpatient utilization has increased. Similarly, the number of discharges and patient days in Connecticut from FY 2008 to FY 2011 also declined. Existing utilization numbers (Table 3.1) combined with expected demographic changes in Connecticut's population, suggest that future demand for inpatient services will remain steady for the foreseeable future. Hospitals will continue to adjust their business model and health service offerings to address outpatient care trends to remain competitive. Many hospitals currently offer or have partnered with additional providers to deliver a variety of outpatient services at hospital facilities or near hospital campuses. A complete list of acute care hospitals is given in Inventory Table 2.

Connecticut hospitals seeking authorization for additional licensed beds are required to demonstrate that they meet clear public need as well as other criteria set forth in Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-639. 3.2.2 BED NEED METHODOLOGY In coordination with the development of the Plan, the Acute Care and Ambulatory Surgery Subcommittee determined that a standardized methodology will enhance OHCA 's ability to evaluate the availability of acute care services, help identify areas with unmet need and provide an equitable measure to determine how acute care beds are distributed throughout the state. CONNECTICUT BED NEED CALCULATION 1. Bed utilization is based on patient days and is calculated using data from three consecutive Federal Fiscal Y ears (FFYs). Patient days are broken down by DEMHS region, hospital, service category (Medical/Surgical, Maternity, Psychiatric, Rehabilitation and Pediatric) and age group (0-14, 15-44, 45-64, 65+) - the Pediatric category uses different age groups (0-19, 20+) to better utilize population estimate age ranges. 2. Patient days are divided by 365 (days) to calculate Average Daily Census (ADC) for each year of the three years. 3. A Weighted ADC is calculated, giving the greatest weight to the most current year and the least weight to the oldest year. Weighted avg. daily census = (Y ear1 + Y ear2 x 2 + Y ear3 x 3)/6 4. The Weighted ADC is multiplied by a population growth/attrition factor for each DEMHS region (based on projected population estimates for 2010 and 2015, provided by the Connecticut State Data Center) to produce the Projected Average Daily Census. 5. The Projected ADC is divided by the Target Occupancy factors provided by the Acute Care/Ambulatory Surgery Subcommittee to determine the number of beds needed. 6. \"Beds Needed\" is summed by service/age category and totaled by individual hospital. 7. The sum of \"Beds Needed\" is deducted from a hospital's total number of licensed beds (excluding bassinets) to determine the number of excess or additional licensed beds that are required (Excess (-)/Deficit (+)). 8. Individual hospital utilization and licensed bed data can be summed by the region in which hospitals are located to produce regional results. Statewide capacity is calculated using data from all 30 acute care hospitals.Based on the acute care bed need projections for 2015, Connecticut has a statewide surplus of 1,581 inpatient beds. Each of the five individual DEMHS planning regions has excess capacity, ranging from a low of 71 surplus beds in DEMHS Region 2 to a high of 726 in DEMHS Region 3. CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE27CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE OTHER FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION The office may also take the following criteria into consideration during its review of an application: 1. Observation Days; or 2. An average weekday occupancy rate/census for two separate and distinct periods of 30 calendar days for the most recent twelve month period at or above 80% of total licensed beds, it may qualify to add acute care beds. Those qualifying hospitals may seek a CON to add up to 10% of licensed bed capacity (not to exceed 50 beds), or alternatively up to 30 beds, whichever is greater. A hospital seeking to add beds under this exception must not have been granted a bed increase in the past 12 months and must have been licensed for at least one year. 3. Particular innovations, changes in care delivery models or modalities, resources (including physical resources and building facilities) needed to treat specific diseases or conditions 4. Quality or patient safety concerns 3.2.3 BED NEED PLANNING AREA(S) OHCA 's acute care bed need planning uses the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS) regions. The DEMHS regions divide the state into five planning areas, comprising the Eastern, Western, North Central, South Central and Southwestern parts of the state (see Appendix E for a list of towns in each region). The DEMHS regions may be considered as part of the assessment under CGS 19a-639, specifically subsections (2) and (5), but are not necessarily considered the service area of the applicant. 3.2.4 ACUTE CARE BED NEED MODEL RESULTS Based on the acute care bed need projections for 2015, Connecticut has a statewide surplus of 1,581 inpatient beds. Each of the five individual DEMHS planning regions has excess capacity, ranging from a low of 71 surplus beds in DEMHS Region 2 to a high of 726 in DEMHS Region 3. It is important to note, however, that DEMHS Region 3 has more hospitals (10) than any other region. Projected regional and statewide bed need is shown in Tables 3.2 to 3.7. 28Table 3.2: Summary of Acute Care Bed Need Projections Table 3.3: DEMHS Region 1 - Acute Care Bed Need ProjectionSource: CT DPH Office of Health Care Access Acute Care Hospital Discharge Database aExcludes\u0007Newborn\u0007service\u0007category bExcludes\u0007bassinets Source: CT DPH Office of Health Care Access Acute Care Hospital Discharge Database aExcludes\u0007Newborn\u0007service\u0007category bSource:\u0007CT\u0007State\u0007Data\u0007Center\u0007(CTSDC) cExcludes\u0007bassinetsFY 2009 Patient DaysaFY 2010 Patient Days Patient Days aWeighted ADCProjected ADC 2015Beds NeededLicensed DP H Office of Health C ar e Access Acute C ar e Hospital Dischar ge Database a Excl udes Newborn s ervi ce ca tegory b Excludes bassinetsStatewideDEMHS Region 1 2 3 4 5 ServicesaFY 2009 Patient DaysFY 2010 Patient DaysFY 2011 ADCFY or Deficit (+) Medical/Surgical 0-14 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 -

However, further study is necessary to determine if regional gaps in service exist by service line/department (e.g., psychiatric, maternity, medical/surgical). OHCA 's ability to remedy any gaps identified would be limited, as acute care beds are licensed generally (not by service type or department). In addition, hospitals apportion beds based on individual operational considerations, rather than regional needs. 3.3 EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS Connecticut has emergency departments in each of its 30 acute care hospitals (Figure 3.2). The emergency department (ED) provides initial treatment to patients with a broad range of illnesses and injuries; some may be life threatening. Upon arrival at the ED, people typically undergo a brief triage to evaluate the nature of the illness or injury. Individuals with more serious illnesses are examined by a physician sooner than patients with less severe symptoms or injuries. After treatment in the ED, patients are discharged, admitted to the hospital, or stabilized and transferred to another hospital. Most EDs operate 24 hours and 7 days a week, with staffing levels usually lower at night. A free-standing ED is one that is located away from the main campus of a hospital and provides care for emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment. Free-standing EDs are not licensed separately from hospitals in Connecticut. OHCA regulates the establishment of these facilities. (Sec. 19a-630-(10)(C)). Connecticut's free-standing EDs are shown in Figure 3.2 and additional information is provided about them in Table 3.8. 3.3.1 RELATIONSHIP TO CERTIFICATE OF NEED Connecticut General Statutes Sections 19a-638(a)(3) and 19a-638(a)(7) specify that a Certificate of Need is required for the establishment of a free-standing emergency department or the termination of an emergency department by a short-term acute care general hospital. Connecticut hospitals seeking authorization to establish a free-standing emergency department are required to demonstrate that they meet clear public need as well as other criteria set forth in Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-639.Based on projections derived from the acute care bed need model, Connecticut has sufficient acute care inpatient bed capacity, overall. However, further study is necessary to determine if regional gaps in service exist by service line/department.32Figure 3.2 Emergency Departments and Satellite EDs CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE33CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE Table 3.8: Free-Standing Emergency Departments 3.3.2 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS The number of patients with behavioral health (BH) conditions treated in EDs has been increasing for more than a decade.50 One in eight (12.5%) visits made to U.S. hospital emergency departments in 2007 involved a diagnosis related to behavioral health.51 Compared to national estimates, data for Connecticut has higher ED utilization for patients with BH related issues, raising concerns in the emergency medical community about overcrowding. In FY 2010, 18% of all ED visits had a diagnosis (in any of the 15 captured diagnoses) related to BH.52 The Behavioral Health and Acute Care/Ambulatory Surgery Subcommittees determined that the creation of focus groups consisting of a broad representation of hospital and ED staff would be beneficial to help identify concerns about ED patients' ability to access behavioral health services. (See Appendix F for a list of members). Focus groups met in three different venues and discussed all ED patient populations (i.e., all payer types), and issues pertaining to both children and adults. 53 50 Larkin, G.L., Claassen, C.A., Edmond, J.A., Pelletier, A.J., & Camargo, C.A.

Each group was asked to discuss the following areas: patient management (patient characteristics, medical conditions, insurance coverage, etc.), behavioral health resources/system capacity (availability of resources, discharge planning and placement and community resources), and other challenges (constraints/barriers, transportation and other access issues, etc.). Several common themes emerged from the group discussion: Behavioral health patients presenting at EDs, although other treatment settings would be more appropriate Limited access to behavioral health services (especially inpatient adult or residential youth services) Lack of coordination of care between EDs and community based services The groups identified and listed examples of ED use that may be inappropriate: Police dropping off patients who are intoxicated Schools sending students with conduct problems Nursing homes transferring disruptive/combative or patients with dementia Parents bringing children who are under the influence of alcohol/drugs or exhibiting disruptive behaviors Family care givers who need respite bringing in family members for evaluation All focus groups reported a significant increase in behavioral health visits over the past several years. Participants anecdotally identified the characteristics of patients presenting more frequently at the ED: Behavioral health patients of moderate severity Combative patients Children and Adolescents Elders of family members who can no longer cope with their care Chronic alcoholic or PCP using patients ED staff participants believed that many behavioral health patients presenting do not need emergency room treatment and could be more effectively and less expensively managed in outpatient settings. Focus group members were concerned that inappropriate referrals will continue as long as EDs are the only facilities available around-the-clock. In addition, limitations on the length of stay for patients in general hospital inpatient psychiatric beds, by private insurance companies, has added to the problem of patients relapsing and returning to the ED. Participants noted that the decline in State-operated beds for adults and community residential beds for children places an extreme burden on EDs. For \"new\" patients with behavioral health needs, it can be difficult to schedule appointments in the community for initial assessments to obtain outpatient treatment or medication management. Obtaining preauthorization for behavioral health services can be very time consuming. The group believes that communication between EDs and community programs needs to be improved to help behavioral health patients receive more appropriate care in settings outside the ED (see Appendices G and H for the Focus Group Summary and Solutions documents in their entirety). 3.3.3 ED UTILIZATION ED utilization has increased steadily over the past few years as a result of multiple factors. Being uninsured or underinsured, appointment scheduling difficulties, and a poor economy where many residents have lost their jobs and health care coverage have all been mentioned as reasons for the spike in ED utilization. Sufficient availability, capacity and placement of primary care and behavioral health resources (both facility and private practitioner) may also result in the continuing increase in the utilization of hospital ED services. ED volumes have risen in each of the past four fiscal years. From FY 2008 to FY 2011, ED volume increased from 1.5 million to 1.6 million visits (7%) (see Figure 3.3 and Appendix I).CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE35CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE Source: CT Connecticut Hospital Association Chime, Inc.

OHCA encourages adherence to the ACEP Policy Statement. It states that: Access to emergency medical and nursing care should be unrestricted and available to all residents. Emergency departments must have adequate resources to support the evaluation, management and treatment of all patients presenting at an ED. EDs should maintain appropriate levels of qualified staff, 24 hours a day, due to the unscheduled and episodic nature of health emergencies. ED personnel must establish effective working relationships with emergency services providers (EMS), ancillary hospital personnel, physicians, and other health care and social service resources to ensure the continuity of ED patient care. Effective policies and plans should be in place to ensure that administration, staffing, design of facility, equipment, medication and all other ancillary services are sufficiently addressed and cohesively work together to provide quality health care for patients experiencing serious 2010 FY 2011363.3.5 TRAUMA A trauma center is a hospital equipped to provide comprehensive emergency medical services to patients who require complex and multi-disciplinary treatment following traumatic injuries. According to the public health code, the terms Trauma and Trauma Center are specifically defined as follows: \"Trauma\" means a wound or injury to the body caused by accident, violence, shock or pressure, excluding poisoning, drug overdose, smoke inhalation, and drowning (19a-177-1(6)) \"Trauma facility\" means a hospital that has met the requirements as prescribed in section 19a-177-4 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies and has received such designation from the Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS) in accordance with section 19a-177-3 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (19a-177-1(8)). The American College of Surgeons provides a voluntary verification that designates the specific capabilities and identifies trauma centers by \"Level\" designation. Hospitals seeking designation as a Level I, Level II, Level III or Level IV trauma facility must apply to and be approved by the OEMS. Connecticut currently has hospitals designated as Level I, Level II or Level III trauma centers. Connecticut trauma centers, their current trauma level designations and definitions of each level are given in Table 3.9. Table 3.9: Connecticut Trauma Centers LEVEL I: A regional resource and a tertiary care facility central to the trauma care system. In addition to acute care responsibilities, Level I trauma centers provide leadership in education, research, and system planning. LEVEL II: Also expected to provide initial definitive trauma care, regardless of the severity of injury. However, depending on a variety of factors (geographic location, patient volume, personnel and resources) patients with more complex injuries may be transferred to Level I trauma centers if needed. LEVEL III: Serves communities that do not have immediate access to a Level I or II institution and can provide prompt assessment, resuscitation, emergency operations, and stabilization. They also arrange for possible transfer to a facility that can provide definitive trauma care. LEVEL IV: Provides advanced trauma life support in remote areas before patients can be transferred to a higher level of care. A Level IV facility may be a clinic without a readily available physician and must establish a good working relationship with the nearest Level I, II or III trauma center in order to provide expeditious transfer of seriously injured patients. 54 54American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma.

This can include both basic and advanced emergency medical treatment. 55 3.3.7 OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (OEMS) The DPH Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS) administers and enforces emergency medical related services statutes, regulations, programs, and policies. OEMS regulates ground ambulances and is also responsible for the education, training and certification of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) workers. Public Act 00-151, passed in 2000, mandating the development of a data collection system to track patients from initial entry into the emergency medical service system through arrival at the emergency room. As of June 2012, 90% of services complied with the mandate, moving from paper Patient Care Run (PCR) forms to computer-based software, or electronic PCRs. This has enabled services, sponsor hospitals and OEMS to begin to collect EMS data, creating the potential to analyze the data and create best practices. In late 2008/early 2009 the American Heart Association formed a ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) stakeholders group comprising three sub-committees (Pre-hospital, Timely transfers and Education) intended to develop and promulgate best practice related to ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The group included physicians (EMS/ED, cardiology, and interventional cardiology), nurses, pre-hospital providers and health care administrators/regulators. This group drafted recommendations to improve care in relation to pre-hospital triage of STEMI patients, timely transfers of patients between facilities and issues of education for pre-hospital providers. In Connecticut, a \"STEMI Protocol\" was also drafted to offer statewide guidance for best practice regarding patients experiencing chest pain and subsequently diagnosed by pre-hospital EKG with a STEMI. The \"STEMI Protocol\" was reviewed by the CT EMS Medical Advisory Committee (CEMSMAC) beginning in 2010. After significant work by the CEMSMAC, a revised version of the document entitled \"CT EMS STEMI Guideline\" was approved by the Commissioner of Public Health in January 2012. 56 OHCA encourages adherence to the CT EMS STEMI Guideline. The foremost goal is for authorized EMS personnel to obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram in the field for all patients suspected of myocardial infarction, thereby increasing the likelihood for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 90 minutes of first medical contact. 3.3.8 LIFE STAR Life Star is a critical care helicopter service owned and operated by Hartford Hospital. Life Star responds to and provides transport for critical care patients who require tertiary care. Approximately 39% of transports are trauma related, 25% cardiac related, 14% pediatric, and 24% acute medical, including neonatal and high risk obstetrics. The Life Star program began operation in 1985 and currently operates two helicopters 24 hours a day, 7 days per week and is available to all emergency/critical care patients within a 150-mile radius of Life Star's two bases (the rooftop helipad at Hartford Hospital, and The William Backus Hospital in Norwich). Each helicopter can transport two patients and is generally able to be airborne within seven minutes and reach speeds of 155 miles per hour. According to OEMS, Hartford Hospital's Life Star program received approximately 629 service requests during 2010. 383.3.9 MOBILE FIELD HOSPITAL According to CGS, a mobile field hospital is a modular, transportable facility used intermittently, deployed at the discretion of the Governor for the provision of medical services at a mass gathering, for the purpose of training, or in the event of a public health emergency. Mobile field hospitals can be used for triage, isolation or to provide surge capacity for a hospital during a mass casualty event or when an infrastructure failure occurs (Sec. 19a-487). The Ottilie W . Lundgren Memorial Field Hospital is a multi-functional facility providing bed surge capacity, isolation capacity and an emergency/disaster medicine training facility for the healthcare delivery workforce, both civilian and military. It is deployable as a flexible configuration of 25 bed units that can be operated jointly or independently of one another to provide triage and treatment anywhere in the state in the event of a mass casualty, or to support an acute care hospital after catastrophic structural or mechanical failure. During long term deployments, resources from the state's 30 acute care hospitals and also the V A Hospital will staff the Field Hospital. The Field Hospital can be removed from storage and assembled in hours anywhere in CT, and be ready to triage and treat hundreds of patients during any public health emergency. The Field Hospital comes with medical equipment, and is staffed by the dedicated volunteers of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team, or DMAT, to triage and treat patients who may become sick or injured as a result of a man-made or natural disaster. 3.4 CARDIAC SERVICES 3.4.1 RELATIONSHIP TO CERTIFICATE OF NEED Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-638(a)(8) specifies that a Certificate of Need is required for the establishment of cardiac services, including inpatient and outpatient cardiac catheterization, interventional cardiology and cardiovascular surgery. Connecticut hospitals seeking authorization to establish a cardiac program are required to demonstrate that they meet clear public need as well as other criteria set forth in Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-639. According to OHCA 's Policies and Procedures, \"interventional cardiology\" is defined as non-surgical procedures performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory for the treatment of coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease. Procedures include, but are not limited to, angioplasty, valvuloplasty, cardiac ablation, coronary thrombectomy, and congenital heart defect correction. Only those procedures authorized pursuant to CON may be performed by a health care facility or provider. Multiple cardiac services may be authorized under one CON decision. A facility that is authorized to provide open heart surgery is also authorized to provide the full range of cardiac procedures mentioned above. 3.4.2 CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION Cardiac catheterization is defined as a medical procedure requiring the passage of a catheter into one or more cardiac chambers of the left and right heart, with or without coronary arteriograms, for the purpose of diagnosing congenital or acquired cardiovascular disease, or for determining measurement of blood pressure flow.CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE39CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE 3.4.3 PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI) Primary (emergent) Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) or Coronary Angioplasty (PCA) is an interventional procedure whereby a catheter, usually inserted into an artery in the groin, is threaded through the circulatory system to a previously diagnosed blockage in the heart. An expandable balloon is passed to this spot and inflated several times, thereby flattening the blockage-causing plaque, potentially widening the artery, and thus improving blood flow. Elective (scheduled) Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) or Coronary Angioplasty (PCA) is an interventional procedure performed in a catheterization lab whereby a catheter, usually inserted into an artery in the groin, is threaded through the circulatory system to a previously diagnosed blockage in the heart. An expandable balloon is passed to this spot and inflated several times, thereby flattening the blockage-causing plaque, potentially widening the artery, and thus improving blood flow. PCI and Elective PCI are often combined with the permanent placement of a small wire mesh tube called a stent to help prop the artery open and decrease the chance of it narrowing again. Some stents are coated with medication to help keep the artery open (drug-eluting stents), while others are not (bare-metal stents). 3.4.3.1 PCI without Surgical Backup Authorization for Connecticut hospitals to perform elective catheter-based interventions for coronary artery disease has been limited in the past to hospitals with the ability to perform cardiac surgery on-site. However, increasing operator experience, improvements in surgical technique and major advances in technology and pharmacology have contributed to a progressive trend to allow PCI without on-site surgical backup. New evidence gives support to the positive effects that these medical advances have contributed to the significant reduction in emergency surgery following PCI. 57 In 2011, the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Health Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (ACCF/AHA/SCAI) Practice Guideline for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention without on-site surgical backup was modified from a class III (not recommended, no benefit) to a class IIb (benefit is either equal to or greater than the risk) recommendation. In addition, the Cardiovascular Patient Outcomes Research Team (CPORT) Non-Primary PCI (CPORT-E) trial findings concluded in May 2012 that patients have no greater risk of death or complications when they have elective PCI at a hospital without cardiac surgery backup. Connecticut hospitals seeking authorization to initiate an Elective PCI program without on-site cardiac surgery capabilities will be required to meet the conditions required in the guideline and to demonstrate clear public need for the program. The guideline states that it is only appropriate to consider initiation of a PCI program without on-site cardiac surgical backup if this program will clearly fill a void in the healthcare needs of the community. Further, the guideline notes that competition with another PCI program in the same geographic area, particularly an established program Connecticut hospitals seeking authorization to initiate an Elective PCI program without on-site cardiac surgery capabilities will be required to meet the conditions required in the ACCF/AHA/SCAI Practice Guideline and to demonstrate clear public need for the program. The guideline states that it is only appropriate to consider initiation of a PCI program without on-site cardiac surgical backup if this program will clearly fill a void in the healthcare needs of the community. Further, the guideline notes that competition with another PCI program in the same geographic area, particularly an established program with surgical backup, may not be in the best interests of the community. 57 Shahian, D.M, Mayer, G.S., Y D.F. (2012). Percutaneous Coronary Interventions without On-Site Cardiac Surgical Backup. The New England Journal of Medicine.40with surgical backup, may not be in the best interests of the community. The revised guideline also emphasizes that such programs adhere to rigorous clinical programmatic requirements and angiographic criteria for proper patient selection. 3.4.4 OPEN HEART SURGERY Open heart surgery refers to a therapeutic operative procedure performed on the heart and/or its coronary arteries in order to correct anomalous conditions (for example, coronary artery bypass surgery, heart valve replacement), often using a heart-lung by-pass machine to perform the functions of circulation during surgery. 3.4.5 CURRENT SERVICE LOCATIONS Table 3.10: Adult Cardiac Services in Connecticut58 58In addition to the adult cardiac programs, Connecticut Children's Hospital has a full-service cardiac program for children.Source: CT DPH-OHCA Acute Care Hospital Service Line Survey, 2012 aAlthough\u0007authorized\u0007to\u0007provide\u0007cardiac\u0007catheterization,\u0007the\u0007hospital\u0007has\u0007not\u0007been\u0007providing\u0007the\u0007service.CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE Hospital Cardiac Catheterization Primary PCI Elective PCI Open Heart William.

Examples of expert sources to be used in determining standards and guidelines include: the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association and the Advisory Council for Cardiothoracic Surgery. PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI) Primary PCI 1. Based on ACC and AHA, Primary PCI for STEMI should be performed by experienced operators who perform more than 75 elective PCIs per year and, ideally, at least 11 PCI procedures for STEMI per year. Ideally, these procedures should be performed in institutions that perform more than 400 elective PCIs per year and more than 36 primary PCI procedures for STEMI per year. 2. A report by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on practice guidelines, referring to Class II b, suggests that Primary PCI for patients with STEMI might be considered in hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery provided that appropriate planning for program development has been accomplished and includes: experienced physician operators (more than 75 total PCIs and, ideally, at least 11 primary PCIs per year for STEMI); an experienced catheterization team on a 24 hours per day; 7 day per week call schedule; a well-equipped catheterization lab with digital imaging equipment; a full array of interventional equipment; intra-aortic balloon pump capability; and a proven plan for rapid transport to a cardiac surgery operating room in a nearby hospital with appropriate hemodynamic support capability for transfer. Primary PCI should be limited to patients with STEMI or MI with new or presumably new LBBB on ECG and should be performed in a timely fashion (goal of balloon inflation within 90 minutes of presentation) by persons skilled in the procedure (at least 75 PCIs per year) and at hospitals that perform a minimum of 36 Primary PCI procedures per year. (Level of Evidence: B - Limited populations evaluated. Data derived from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized studies). Elective PCI 1. Elective/urgent PCI should be performed by operators with an acceptable annual volume (>75 procedures) at high volume centers (> 400 procedures) with on-site cardiac surgery (Level of Evidence: C) 2. Elective/urgent PCI should be performed by operators and institutions whose current risk-adjusted outcome statistics are comparable to those reported in contemporary national data registries, (Level of Evidence: C) 3. It is reasonable that low volume operators (< 75 PCI procedures per year) perform elective/urgent PCI at high volume centers (> 400 PCI procedures per year) with on-site cardiac surgery. Ideally, operators with an annual procedure volume of fewer than 75 procedures per year should only work at institutions with an activity level of more than 600 procedures per year. Operators who perform fewer than 75 procedures per year should develop a defined mentoring relationship with a highly experienced operator who has an annual procedural volume of at least 150 procedures per year. (Level of Evidence C) 4. It is not recommended that elective/urgent PCI be performed by low volume operators (< 75 PCI procedures per year) at low volume centers (200 to 400 procedures per year) with or without on-site cardiac surgery. An institution with a volume of fewer than 200 procedures per year, unless in a region that is underserved because of geography, should carefully consider whether it should continue to offer this service. (Level of Evidence: C) 5. The 2005 PCI Guideline does not establish an explicit minimum hospital volume threshold for elective PCI; there are multiple references in the context of operator and institutional competency to \"centers\" performing 200 - 400 elective PCI procedures per year.42 6. The 2011 PCI Guideline states that operator and hospital volume recommendations have been maintained from the ACC/ AHA/SCAI 2005 Guideline Update for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. a. PCI in Hospitals without On-Site Surgical Back-up is in the Class IIb category. Class II b: Elective PCI might be considered in hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery, provided that appropriate planning for program development has been accomplished and rigorous clinical and angiographic criteria are used for proper patient selection (Level of Evidence: B) Any hospital considering elective PCI without on-site-cardiac surgery must meet the criteria set forth in the 2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI PCI Guideline, Section 4.8., PCI in Hospitals Without On-Site Surgical Backup: Recommendations (see link below): http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/124/23/e574.full. pdf+html Any hospital not meeting the 2011 ACCF/ANA/SCAI PCI Guideline criteria will be considered to be in Class III. Class III-Harm: Primary and elective PCI should not be performed in hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery capabilities without a proven plan for rapid transport to a surgery operating room in a nearby hospital or without appropriate hemodynamic support capability for transfer. (Level of Evidence: C) Quality and Performance Considerations for PCI Programs Based on the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Guidelines for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: 1. Every PCI program should operate a quality improvement program that routinely: a) reviews quality and outcomes of the entire program; b) reviews results of individual operators; c) includes risk adjustment; d) provides peer review of difficult or complicated cases; ande) performs random case reviews (Level of Evidence: C) 2. Every PCI program should participate in a regional or national PCI registry for the purpose of benchmarking its outcomes against national norms. (Level of Evidence: C) PCI quality and performance considerations are defined by attributes related to structure, processes, and risk adjusted outcomes. Structural elements include, for example: staffing, equipment, supplies, operator and institutional volumes, and the availability of electronic medical records. Processes include strategies for the appropriate patient, protocols for pre- and post-procedural care, appropriate procedural execution and management of complications, and participation in databases and registries for benchmarking program and individual operator performance. The end result of these structures and processes of care are risk-adjusted outcomes, and when available, are more reliable measures of quality than the institutional and individual operator volumes. 59 59ACCF/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

Guidelines for Standards in Cardiac Surgery developed by the Advisory Council for Cardiothoracic Surgery and approved by the American College of Surgeons' Board of Regents in October 1996 - Bulletin of the American College of Surgeons, Vol. 82, No. 2, February 1997: a) An annual volume of at least 100 to 125 open heart procedures per hospital is necessary from a quality standpoint and there is a greater variation in adjusted mortality rates for teams doing lower volumes as compared with those doing a high volume b) At least 200 procedures per year are necessary in order for a program to function efficiently c) A team approach with a minimum of 2 qualified cardiac surgeons is recommended to provide adequate and continuous perioperative care as well as assistance in the OR 2. The following conditions must be met to initiate a new OHS program: a) The annual caseload of other programs w/in the proposed PSA shall not drop below 350 procedures b) Epidemiological evidence of conditions for which OHS is appropriate w/in the PSA or demonstrates a significant unmet need in the PSA for these procedures c) Existing program(s) in the service area are performing at least 350 open heart surgeries annually d) Evidence demonstrating the performance of a minimum of 200 open heart surgeries annually within the first three years of the start of the new Open Heart Surgery program OTHER FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION Supplemental to the current guidelines and principles, as listed in Section 19a-639, CGS, OHCA may consider proposed service areas that include patients from those states that border Connecticut, i.e., Massachusetts, New Y ork and Rhode Island, when reviewing a Certificate of Need request. 3.4.7 UTILIZATION OF CARDIAC CARE Based on hospital discharge data, inpatient cardiac care is declining both in patient volume and overall patient days (Table 3.11 and Fig 3.4). From FY 2008 to FY 2011, Cardiac Care-Medical discharges dropped 6%, while the corresponding patient days declined by 3%. During the same time period, Cardiac Care-Surgical declined even more significantly, with both discharges (11%) and patient days (8%) falling. 60Guidelines for Standards in Cardiac Surgery. (1997).

Patient demand (the number of residents from a given region that received treatment for cardiac medical services or surgery in a given year) is compared to the overall volume of cardiac patients served by hospitals in the same region. If hospital volumes are lower than patient demand, additional capacity may be needed and additional study of patient migration may be warranted.Source: CT DPH Office of Health Care Access Acute Care Hospital Discharge DatabaseCHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARE45CHAPTER 3 ACUTE CARETable 3.12: Bed Need for Inpatient Cardiac Services at Acute Care Hospitals, Connecticut, FY 07-10 Source: CT DPH Office of Health Care Access Acute Care Hospital Discharge Database aHospitalizations\u0007are\u0007expressed\u0007as\u0007numbers\u0007of\u0007discharges,\u0007not\u0007as\u0007unduplicated\u0007patients;\u0007a\u0007single\u0007patient\u0007with\u0007multiple\u0007hospitalizations\u0007can\u0007thus\u0007be\u0007counted\u0007more\u0007than\u0007once.DEMHS Regi on Hospitals Servi (-) or (+) 202 314 222 125 644 580 708 699 714 3,433 3,481 3,399 3,528 Served Surplus schargesaPatient Days Medi cal Surgical 2Medi calSurgical1 Bridgeport, Norwalk, Greenwich, Stamford, St Vincent's Yale , Griffin, Milford, St Raphael, MidState SurgicalSurgical 4 Medi cal5Medi cal Surgical Medi cal Surgical3Medi cal Out of State, or Unknown AddressDempsey, Saint Francis, Bristol, HOCCT, Manchester, Hartford, CTCMC, Middle Rockville Hungerford, Sharon, St Mary's, Waterbury Distributed among se ve ral hospitals46 3.5 CANCER TREATMENT Oncology is the branch of medicine concerned with the study and treatment of cancer, including screening, diagnosis, therapy, follow-up and palliative care. It includes various sub-specialties such as radiation oncology (medical use of high-energy radiation to kill malignant cells), surgical oncology, and pediatric oncology. Chemotherapy, most generally the treatment of disease by chemicals, can be used for a range of diseases, but most frequently refers to antineoplastic drugs to treat cancer. In Connecticut, there is no unique licensure category for cancer treatment. The American College of Surgeons, Commission on Cancer (CoC) administers an accreditation program that encourages hospitals, treatment centers, and other facilities to improve the quality of patient care by focusing on prevention, early diagnosis, pretreatment evaluation, staging, optimal treatment, rehabilitation, surveillance for recurrent disease, support services, and end-of-life care. Nationally, 80% of all newly diagnosed cancer patients are treated in CoC-accredited cancer programs. 61 According to the Connecticut Cancer Partnership, 67% of acute care hospitals in Connecticut are CoC-accredited.62 Connecticut's cancer treatment services are well distributed throughout the state. Acute care hospitals, cancer centers, free-standing oncology centers, and private practices, along with appropriate support services are accessible to the majority of Connecticut residents.63 61American College of Surgeons Cancer Programs.

From FY 2008 to FY 2011, Cancer Care-Medical discharges dropped 4%, while patient days declined by 3%. During the same time period, Cancer Care-Surgical discharges declined (4%) and patient days fell 8%. Cancer patients receive most treatment on an outpatient basis. Chemotherapy and radiation, for example, are delivered primarily in outpatient settings. Some patients receive chemotherapy at their doctor's office or may, in certain cases, be given an oral prescription that can be taken at home. From FY 2008 to FY 2011 chemotherapy visits increased by 17% (Table 3.15). This increase may be the result of new drugs, or combinations of drugs and/or delivery techniques provided to patients. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) imaging are essential diagnostic tools physicians use to detect the presence and severity of cancer. PET/CT imaging helps physicians identify cancer, evaluate the extent of disease, select the most appropriate treatments, determine if the therapy is working and detect any recurrent tumors. From FY 2008 to FY 2011, PET volumes have fallen by 9% and PET/CT scans also fell by 4% (Table 3.15). A linear accelerator (LINAC) is the machine used to treat cancer patients, using external beam radiation treatments. Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells by damaging their DNA. Linear accelerator procedures increased by 4% from FY 2008 to FY 2011 (Table 3.15).

Facilities seeking authorization to establish a new outpatient surgical center are required to demonstrate that they meet clear public need as well as other criteria set forth in Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-639. 4.2 OVERVIEW Forty years ago, virtually all surgery was performed in a hospital. Since the early 1980s, however, there have been many changes in how surgical care is provided, due largely to advances in medical technology and changes in payment arrangements. The medical advances include new anesthesia that allow a patient to awaken more quickly after surgery, and better analgesics for pain control. In addition, minimally invasive and noninvasive procedures such as laser surgery, laparoscopy and endoscopy have been developed. 65 These advances allow many procedures formerly done in inpatient settings to be performed in outpatient surgical facilities. Concerns about rising health care costs also have contributed to the growth of ambulatory surgery. The federal government expanded Medicare coverage to include services provided in outpatient surgical facilities (OSFs). The prospective payment system based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) that was adopted for hospital inpatient care created financial incentives for hospitals to shift less complex surgeries to an outpatient setting. Under impending health care reform, how lucrative payments to OSFs are, hospital-owned and privately, remains to be determined.66 Ambulatory surgical care is defined in the Connecticut Public Health Code as \"surgical care not requiring overnight stay but requiring a medical environment exceeding that normally found in a physician's office\" .67 This care may be delivered in a licensed outpatient surgical facility or at an acute care hospital's designated outpatient surgical center. Along with the elimination of an inpatient hospital admission, surgery in an outpatient setting makes better use of resources, especially the surgeon's time. Currently, approximately 70% of the surgeries in Connecticut are performed as ambulatory procedures. 68 4.3 AMBULATORY SURGICAL PROCEDURES The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reviews surgical procedures to determine those that are appropriate for the outpatient setting. The CMS also determines which procedures are eligible for reimbursement of services under Medicare or Medicaid. A major consideration for the inclusion or exclusion of a procedure is patient safety in an OSF environment.69 CMS follows an established set of eligibility standards. The general standards for covered surgical procedures are those surgical and other medical procedures that: Are commonly performed on an inpatient basis in hospitals, but may be safely performed in an OSF; Are not of a type that are commonly performed, or that may be safely performed, in physicians' offices; Are limited to those requiring a dedicated operating room and generally requiring a post-operative recovery room (not overnight); 70 and 65 Cullen, K.A, Hall, M.J. & Golosinky, A.

(2012).52 Are not cosmetic surgery and related services, except as required for the prompt repair of accidental injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.71 Eligible surgical procedures are limited to the following specific standards: Those procedures that do not generally exceed a total of 90 minutes operating time and a total of four hours recovery time; Anesthesia must be local or regional or general anesthesia of 90 minutes or less; Those procedures that do not generally result in extensive blood loss or required major or prolonged invasion of body cavities or directly involved major blood vessels; or Those procedures that are not generally emergency or life-threatening in nature. 72 4.4 OUTPATIENT SURGICAL FACILITIES (OSFs) The acronym OSF is the term used in Connecticut law and regulation to refer to a particular type of licensed facility. The term ambulatory surgery center (ASC) is a specific term used in federal law and regulation that refers to a specific type of facility that must comply with CMS rules and accreditation standards. Connecticut has many ASCs that are licensed as OSFs, but not all DPH licensure category. New OSFs require Certificate of Need authorization prior to applying for a license to operate. All facilities, regardless of the type and procedures performed and/or reimbursed 73, are subject to regular State and federal inspections. 4.4.1.2 CMS Certification To receive reimbursement through Medicare, the CMS requires OSFs to have Medicare certification. The majority of CMS' conditions for Medicare certification are concerned with patient safety. The CMS Ambulatory Surgery Center Quality Reporting Program requires each OSF to submit information to track whether patients are transferred or admitted directly to a hospital, including a hospital emergency department, upon discharge from the facility. This information can indicate a potentially preventable complication, serious medical error, or other unplanned negative outcome. A high rate of transfers or inpatient admission may be an indication of suboptimal care or provision of care to patients that should not have been treated in an ambulatory surgical setting. 74 4.4.2 OSF TYPES AND OWNERSHIP OSF ownership structures include hospital only; physicians only; hospital and physician joint venture; and corporate-hospital. OSFs based at acute care hospitals operate under the hospital's license and management and provide the same types of services as other outpatient surgical facilities. These facilities may be part of the main hospital, in a separate building on the hospital campus or in a building off the hospital campus. Those facilities located off the hospital campus are listed on the general hospital licenses as satellites. Physician-owned OSFs provide physicians with more direct control over their surgical practices. They may schedule procedures at their convenience, assemble their surgical teams, ensure the equipment and supplies being used are best suited to their technique and design the OSF to suit their specialties. Physicians also benefit from the professional autonomy over their work environment and the quality of their care. These facilities are often referred to as \"free-standing\" as they are not hospital owned or hospital operated. 71Public Health, Exclusions from Medicare and limitations on Medicare payment. 42 C.F.R \u00a7 411.

Hospital-Physician Joint Ventures: Maximizing the Potential. Health Care Financial Management Association. 76Connecticut acute care hospitals have an estimated 413 operating rooms available for surgery/surgical procedures.Joint venture facilities owned by both hospitals and physicians became popular to help hospitals increase market share and stay profitable, and physicians to grow their surgical practices. In addition to the financial benefits, joint ventures enabled hospitals and physicians to provide patients with services in an efficient and convenient facility.75 Health care reform may dictate which ownership structures remain and how profitable they will be. 4.4.3 FACILITIES AND OPERATING ROOMS As of October 1, 2011, Connecticut had: 30 general or children's general hospital-based76 multi-specialty OSFs; 44 free-standing single-specialty OSFs. The locations and categories of the licensed OSFs are indicated in the maps in Appendices J, K and L. The categories are hospital-based, single-specialty and multi-specialty (Appendix L). Each Connecticut acute care general hospital performs outpatient surgical procedures either within the main hospital or at a separate building on the hospital's main campus. Fifteen of the 30 hospitals have satellite outpatient surgical office locations, including the children's general hospital, Connecticut Children's Medical Center. Middlesex Hospital, in addition to the OSF on its main campus, has a second facility at its outpatient center 2 miles away. Hartford Hospital has two satellite OSFs, a multi-specialty OSF in West Hartford and in Newington. The 44 free-standing single-specialty OSFs in Connecticut have a total of 70 operating rooms. Almost half are dedicated to endoscopic procedures, and approximately 36% to cosmetic surgery and eye surgery. Twenty-two OSFs have a single operating room and are located in a physician's office. These facilities are not generally used daily as the surgeries are scheduled to meet the needs of patients and the physicians themselves. The most common practitioners with office-based operating rooms are plastic surgeons, ophthalmologists, orthopedic surgeons, pain management physicians and gynecologists. Reimbursement from a third-party payer may be provided depending on the patient's insurer, except in the case of cosmetic surgery. As most cosmetic procedures are elective, patients are generally self-pay, and pay for their procedures in advance. The 17 multi-specialty free-standing OSFs have a total of 37 operating rooms, with a range of one to five operating rooms per facility. These facilities have many physicians that utilize block operating room times suitable to their surgical specialty. These facilities mostly operate on a regular five-day a week schedule with varying hours for the convenience of the physicians, staff and patients. It is common to combine two or more specialties with surgeries for each performed on the same day. There are 15 hospital satellite OSFs with a total of 67 operating rooms, with a range of one to five operating rooms per facility. One of the facilities is a two-operating-rooms endoscopy center and one is a four-operating-rooms eye surgery center; the remaining facilities are multi-specialty with the number of operating rooms ranging from one to 12. It is difficult to determine the number of operating rooms dedicated to outpatient surgery when a hospital does not have a designated OSF within its main facility or on its main campus.544.5 SURGERIES PERFORMED IN THE OUTPATIENT SETTING Multi-specialty OSFs may be free-standing, hospital joint-venture, or wholly-owned hospital facilities. A vast array of surgical procedures is performed at these facilities. Common procedures performed in multi-specialty OSFs tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy; Urinary procedures, ureteral catheterization and removal of ureteral stones; Musculoskeletal procedures, such as arthroscopic procedures on the knee, carpal tunnel release, reconstruction of cruciate ligaments in the knee; Cataract surgery and other eye procedures; Ear, nose or throat procedures, such as ear tube surgery; Inguinal and femoral hernia repair; and Gynecological biopsy and diagnostic dilatation and curettage. 77 Endoscopy procedures are one of the common types of procedures performed in a single-specialty OSF. Endoscopic procedures are mainly non-operative procedures performed through a scope to observe the interior of organs in the body, such as the bronchi, esophagus, and colon. 4.6 STANDARDS/GUIDELINES DEFINITIONS 1. Section 19a-493b, (CGS) defines an OSF as \"any entity, individual, firm, partnership, corporation, limited liability company or association, other than a hospital, engaged in providing surgical services or diagnostic procedures for human health conditions that include the use of moderate or deep sedation, moderate or deep analgesia or general anesthesia, as such levels of anesthesia are defined from time to time by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, or by such other professional or accrediting entity recognized by the Department of Public Health. An outpatient surgical facility shall not include a medical office owned and operated exclusively by a person or persons licensed pursuant to section 20-13, provided such medical office: (1) Has no operating room or designated surgical area; (2) bills no facility fees to third party payers; (3) administers no deep sedation or general anesthesia; (4) performs only minor surgical procedures incidental to the work performed in said medical office of the physician or physicians that own and operate such medical office; and (5) uses only light or moderate sedation or analgesia in connection with such incidental minor surgical procedures. \" 2. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect any obligation to comply with the provisions of Section 19a-691, CGS, concerning anesthesia accreditation or Section 19-13-D56 of the Public Health Code concerning licensing of outpatient surgical facilities operated by corporations. 3. \"Primary Service area\" for an OSF is the area where approximately 75% of the facility's patients reside. Service area may be towns, zip codes, or other U.S. Census geographical type. 4. \"Maximum Capacity\" is the number of surgical cases that may be performed in a year based on Monday through Friday, eight hours per day, and 250 days per year. It is the responsibility of the Applicant to provide sufficient documentation to establish the length of time the average case requires and the time required for cleanup. 5. \"Optimum utilization\" is the percent of the maximum capacity that a facility can achieve under a regular work environment, considering the variation in procedures performed, the number of physicians utilizing the facility, and other factors. 77 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Retrieved from http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb86.jspCHAPTER 4 OUTPATIENT SURGERY55CHAPTER 4 OUTPATIENT SURGERY The following guidelines and/or standards for the establishment of an OSF will be considered by OHCA when considering a Certificate of Need request: 1. When an Applicant proposes to establish a new multi-specialty OSF, the case volume of single-specialty OSFs dedicated solely and exclusively for endoscopy may be excluded from the existing; volumes when establishing need for the multi-specialty OSF as required by Sec. 19a-639 (3), CGS. 2. Unless otherwise established by the Applicant and supported with documentation: The capacity of the proposed facility will be based on eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days per week fifty (50) weeks per year for a total of 2,000 hours per year; The optimal utilization for an operating room in an OSF is 80%; The average time for an outpatient case will be sixty (60) minutes; and Thirty (30) minutes will be allocated to cleanup between cases; 3. Unstaffed operating rooms are considered as available and shall be included in any calculations for capacity and utilization; 4. Delivery rooms for Caesarean sections and operating rooms specifically reserved for cardiac cases shall be excluded from calculations for capacity and utilization; 5. Proposed new OSFs must have written policies concerning access to care by persons who are underinsured or uninsured; 6. The Applicant must demonstrate the financial feasibility of the OSF within the first three (3) years of operations or within a reasonable time based on factors reported and supported by the Applicant; 7. The proposed new OSF will have in place at start of operations a transfer agreement with an acute care general hospital; 8. The Applicant must have in place at the start of operations a quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Program and be certified by Medicare or a national accrediting body for which CMS grants status to accredit ambulatory surgery centers; 9. The applicant must have in place at the start of operations a contract with a patient safety organization as defined at CGS \u00a7 19a-127o. OTHER FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION Supplemental to the current guidelines and principles, as listed in Section 19a-639, CGS, OHCA may consider the following factors when reviewing a Certificate of Need request: 1. Changes in technology and changes in medical treatment specialties; 2. Proposed service areas that include patients from those states that border Connecticut, i.e., Massachusetts, New Y ork and Rhode Island; 3. Physician referral patterns; 4. Underserved populations; 5. Unique populations, specific clinical needs or performance of procedures more lengthy in nature; 6. Limited specialty programs where access to surgical services is limited; and7. Atypical barriers to care based on cost, quality, financial access or geographic access.564.7 CURRENT ISSUES PERTAINING TO OSFs OSFs, as other healthcare facilities and providers, are operating under the strain of current economic conditions, including physician shortages and regulatory mandates. They will also be affected by the changes resulting from health care reform. Commercial insurers often base their procedure reimbursements on the rates paid under Medicare and Medicaid. Historically, Medicare and Medicaid have paid providers at lower rates than other third-party payers. In addition, mandated electronic reporting will likely increase operating expenses for OSFs. With the aging of the population in Connecticut, most OSFs will require Medicare certification to obtain reimbursement for the services they provide to older patients. To receive Medicare certification, the OSFs will be required to meet Medicare's conditions of coverage, which specify standards for administration of anesthesia, quality evaluation, operating and recovery rooms, medical staff, nursing services and other areas. 78 Under the CMS' new quality reporting programs, those that fail to report the required information will face a reduction in their Medicare payments. As of October 1, 2012, OSFs are required to report data on patient burns, patient falls, wrong side of patient, procedure, implants, hospital admissions and transfers, and prophylactic IV antibiotic timing. In 2013 they will be required to report two additional measures: safe surgery checklist use in 2012 and 2012 volume of certain procedures. While these two measures will not be reported until 2013, OSFs must ensure they are using a safe surgery checklist and have a system in place by January 1, 2012 to capture surgical volume data. 78Federal Register.

CHAPTER 4 OUTPATIENT SURGERY57SECTION 2 CHAPTER 5 IMAGING AND NEW TECHNOLOGYIMAGING AND NEW TECHNOLOGY595.0 IMAGING AND NEW TECHNOLOGY 5.1 RELATIONSHIP TO CERTIFICATE OF NEED Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-638(a)(9) specifies a Certificate of Need is required for the acquisition of computed tomography scanners, magnetic resonance imaging scanners, positron emission tomography scanners or positron emission tomography-computed tomography scanners, by any person, physician, provider, short-term acute care general hospital, or children's hospital. Entities seeking authorization to acquire such imaging equipment are required to demonstrate that they meet clear public need as well as other criteria set forth in Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-639. 5.2 GENERAL BACKGROUND In 2009, OHCA formed an industry workgroup to review provider experience with the operation of the 2005 law governing CT scanners, with the goal of providing recommendations for possible use in the development of criteria and guidelines with which to evaluate CT scanners. Building upon those recommendations, OHCA formed a second workgroup in 2010 comprised of representatives from various segments of the Connecticut health care industry. It included independent and hospital radiologists, members of the Radiological Society of Connecticut, Connecticut Hospital Association, Connecticut Dental Association, Connecticut State Medical Society, Connecticut health care industry attorneys and OHCA staff. This workgroup helped OHCA develop proposed imaging standards and guidelines, which OHCA intends to promulgate as regulations. The imaging equipment definitions, standards and guidelines in this chapter have been developed through collaboration with the imaging workgroup. This chapter focuses on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). The standards and guidelines for PET scanners have been combined with PET-CT, the two have become imaging technologies intertwined to the point that providers are replacing PET scanners with PET-CT scanners, and vendors no longer support, sell, or lease PET scanners. 5.3 CURRENT IMAGING LANDSCAPE Pursuant to CGS 19a-634(c), in January 2012, OHCA surveyed all imaging providers in Connecticut to establish an inventory of all MRI, CT, PET and PET-CT scanners statewide. Based on survey responses, Connecticut currently has 114 MRI scanners, 123 CT scanners, 6 PET scanners and 21 PET-CT scanners. As stipulated in CGS 19a-690, all imaging equipment operating in Connecticut must be accredited through the American College of Radiology. The locations of these MRI, CT and PET and PET/CT scanners are shown in Appendices M-Q. The majority of imaging scanners were acquired through the Certificate of Need application process; however, some scanners were acquired without CON approval, as providers could acquire imaging equipment costing less than $400K without CON approval, Public Act 05-93 removed this threshold, in an effort to deter the acquisition of substandard equipment. Providers still were allowed to acquire the equipment without CON approval if they could demonstrate that it was acquired prior to July 1, 2005 and was in operation before July 1, 2006, pursuant to Public Acts 05-93 and 06-28. Many of these providers sought a CON determination stating that they were in compliance with the law, without having to demonstrate the need for the equipment. Under current law, any previously authorized imaging scanner (acquired through a CON Determination, a CON Decision or an Agreed Settlement with OHCA) can be replaced with a similar scanner (e.g., a 1.5T MRI scanner with a 3.0 MRI scanner, or a 4-slice CT scanner with a 16-slice CT scanner) and the owner or the authorized holder of the CON can relocate the imaging equipment anywhere statewide. Other than a notification to OHCA of the relocation and disposition of the replaced imaging scanner, no additional action is required. Market trends over the past several years have affected the environment in which hospital and free-standing imaging centers operate. In the past, there was a steady and ongoing migration of imaging services out of the hospital setting, mostly to physician-owned free-standing imaging centers. Today however, reimbursement issues, access to capital, 60vendor relationships and physician employment are initiating a wave of acquisitions of imaging equipment at free-standing imaging centers by hospitals.79 CON approval is required for these acquisitions and purchasers must demonstrate clear public need for the equipment. 5.4 STANDARDS/GUIDELINES DEFINITIONS 1. \"Magnetic resonance imaging\" or \"MRI\" means the use of magnetic fields and radio waves to produce cross sectional images similar to those displayed by computed tomography (CT); 2. \"Magnetic resonance imaging scanner\" means the magnetic resonance system consisting of an integrated set of machines and related equipment necessary to produce the images and/or spectroscopic quantitative data from scans, or any equipment that is classified by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a magnetic resonance diagnostic device; 3. \"Computed tomography\" or \"CT\" means the use of radiographic and computer techniques to produce cross-sectional images of the head or body; 4. \"Computed tomography scanner\" means x-ray CT scanning systems, including axial, spiral, helical or electron beam CT systems (except as set forth in 19a-638(b)(19)), capable of performing CT scans of the head, other body parts, or full body patient procedures, or any equipment that is classified by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a computed tomography device; 5. Positron emission tomography\" or \"PET\" is a non-invasive diagnostic technology which enables the body's physiological and biological processes to be observed through the use of positron emitting radiopharmaceuticals which are injected into the body and whose interaction with body tissues and organs is able to be pictured through a computerized positron transaxial reconstruction tomography scanner; 6. \"Positron emission tomography scanner \" means an FDA-approved full or partial ring scanner or coincidence system that has a crystal at least 5/8-inch thick, techniques to minimize or correct for scatter and/or randoms, and digital detectors and iterative reconstruction, or any equipment that is classified by the United States Food and Drug Administration as an emission computed tomography scanner\" is a medical imaging device which combines in a single gantry system both a positron emission tomography (PET) and a computed tomography (CT), so that images acquired from both devices can be taken sequentially, in the same session from the patient and combined into a single superposed image; and 8. \"Primary service area\" means that geographic area (by town), for the service location in the application, consisting of the lowest number of contiguous zip codes from which the applicant draws at least 75% of its patients for this service at such location.

Applicants acquiring new technological equipment shall report utilization and demographic data necessary to evaluate the technology and to facilitate State planning. 80 The definition does not specify types of technology, but historically, OHCA reviewed new and developing technologies such as MRI and lithotripsy in the 1980s, extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the 1990s, and Robotic Assisted Surgeries, such as the Da Vinci Robotic Surgery system, in the early 2000s. As these new technologies were introduced in Connecticut, they were first acquired by research and teaching institutions, then by other institutions and private practitioners.69SECTION 2 CHAPTER 6 OTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND FACILITIESOTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND FACILITIES716.0 OTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND FACILITIES 6.1 RELATIONSHIP TO CERTIFICATE OF NEED Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-638(a)(1) specifies a Certificate of Need is required for the establishment of a long term acute care facility. Facilities seeking authorization to establish a new long term care facility are required to demonstrate that they meet clear public need as well as other criteria set forth in Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-639. With respect to nursing homes, a Certificate of Need is required from the Department of Social Services. 6.2 LONG TERM AND REHABILITATIVE CARE SERVICES Long term and rehabilitative care includes a wide range of services and programs provided to individuals over an extended period of time. These services and programs are designed to meet medical, personal, and social needs in a variety of settings or locations to enable individuals to live as independently as possible. The phrase \"long term care\" refers to care and services over an extended period of time in settings such as: institutional; managed residential; other sites within the community; or in the home. The need for these services might be due to a terminal condition, disability, chronic illness, injury or infirmity of old age. 81 The need for long term and rehabilitative care services may last for a few weeks or months to years, depending on the underlying reason or reasons for needing care. The need for temporary long term and rehabilitative care for weeks or months may be necessary for: rehabilitation from a hospital stay; recovery from illness; recovery from injury; recovery from surgery; or a terminal medical condition. The need for ongoing long term and rehabilitative care for months or years may be necessary for: chronic medical or psychiatric conditions; chronic severe pain; permanent disabilities; dementia; ongoing need for help with activities of daily living; or need for supervision. 82 6.2.1 FUTURE GROWTH OF THE OLDER POPULATION The American population, age 65 and older, will continue to grow significantly in the future, especially between now and 2030 as the \"baby boom\" generation reaches age 65. This population has increased from 35 million in 2000 to 40 million in 2010 (a 14.3% increase) and is projected to increase to 55 million in 2020 (a 37.5% increase for that decade). By 2030, there will be about 72.1 million older Americans, almost twice their number in 2008. People 65+ represented 12.9% of the population in 2009, but are expected to account for 19.3% of the population by 2030. The 85+ population has increased from 5.6 million in 2009 to 5.8 million in 2010 and is projected to increase to 6.6 million in 2020 (a 13.8% increase) for that decade. 83 6.2.2 SKILLED CARE AND CUSTODIAL CARE Skilled care and custodial care are terms used by the medical community, health insurance plans, Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration to differentiate care provided by medical specialists from care provided by aides, volunteers, family or friends. The use of these terms and their application is important in determining whether insurance will pay for services. Generally, skilled services are paid for by a health care plan, whereas custodial services, not in conjunction with skilled care, are not covered. However, custodial services are almost always a part of a skilled service plan of care and as such they are covered. 84 6.2.3 MEDICAL REHABILITATIVE CARE The primary aim of medical rehabilitation is to restore an individual's ability to accomplish activities of daily living and 81 State of Connecticut, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, Long Term Services and Supports (2012).

Rehabilitation reduces the limitations that an individual may experience with certain activities. Kinds of rehabilitation programs are: acute rehabilitation; subacute rehabilitation; day rehabilitation; home care; outpatient rehabilitation; and nursing home rehabilitation. A patient may need and receive care in more than one rehabilitative setting, depending on medical condition and rehabilitation needs. One program may serve as a \"bridge\" to another.85 Acute rehabilitation programs provide both medical care and a full range of rehabilitation services. These services include physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), rehabilitation nursing, speech language/pathology services (S/LPS), vocational rehabilitation (VR), therapeutic recreation (TR) and other services. An acute interdisciplinary rehabilitation program is designed to meet each patient's needs. Doctors are in direct contact with the patient (usually daily, but no less than three times a week) to monitor medical condition and progress. The patient also receives 24-hour nursing care. Acute rehabilitation program is appropriate for individuals with complex medical needs. Such programs can be found in free-standing rehabilitation hospitals and in acute care hospitals with dedicated specialized rehabilitation units. 86 Subacute rehabilitation programs often provide therapy needed before or after a person completes acute rehabilitation but before they go home. A fairly wide range of rehabilitation services, including PT, OT, S/LPS, and TR, is provided. Subacute rehabilitation is less intensive and generally lasts longer than acute rehabilitation. A subacute rehabilitation program includes 24-hour nursing care, and a treatment plan supervised by a rehabilitation doctor. The rehabilitation doctor also provides additional health care, as needed. A patient will see the rehabilitation doctor less often than would occur in an acute rehabilitation program however. Subacute rehabilitation is best for a patient having a high level of disability, who does not require the amount or intensity of therapy given in an acute rehabilitation program. Subacute rehabilitation also requires that the patient be in stable medical condition but needs continued medical care to avoid possible complications. Subacute rehabilitation is offered in many different settings, including: free-standing, subacute rehabilitation facilities; general, acute care hospitals; skilled nursing units that are a part of general, acute care hospitals; and skilled nursing units located in nursing homes. 87 Day rehabilitation, or day treatment, programs are similar to subacute rehabilitation programs except that patients do not stay overnight in a hospital. These programs offer many rehabilitation services supervised by rehabilitation doctors. Nursing care and general medical care are also offered as needed. If the patient is medically stable and doesn't need intensive nursing care or constant monitoring by a doctor, a day rehabilitation program is appropriate care for the patient. Day rehabilitation programs can be independent free-standing programs or part of rehabilitation hospitals. 88 Outpatient rehabilitation is provided to patients who can travel from home to a treatment facility. It can include a full range of therapy services that make up a coordinated program of care, or only one or two services (such as physical or occupational therapy). Additional nursing care is not provided. Outpatient rehabilitation therapy services are often given to continue treatment after more intensive acute or subacute rehabilitation. Outpatient rehabilitation therapy services are provided in doctors' offices, hospital-based outpatient units, hospital-owned outpatient centers, and free-standing centers that are not a part of hospitals. 89 Home health care services allow individuals to receive rehabilitation treatment and nursing care at home. Services and care are provided as often as prescribed and once insurance allows. Typically a home health rehabilitation patient receives 1 to 2 hours of therapy per day, 1 to 3 days per week. 90 Nursing homes must offer rehabilitation services, either directly or by contract. The kinds of rehabilitation services offered and the intensity of the rehabilitation treatment may vary from one nursing home to another. Treatment ranges from a single rehabilitation therapy service, such as physical therapy, to a coordinated program of care that includes several different services. 91 85National Rehabilitation Hospital Research Division and the Health & Disability Research Institute at Boston University, [Guidebook] (n.d.)

In 1983 the United States Congress created LTAC hospitals to facilitate prompt discharge of medically complex patients from acute hospitalizations in an effort to decrease Medicare spending. LTAC hospitals serve in the continuum of care for patients who require longer than usual acute care hospital stays, on average twenty-five (25) days or more. 92 LTAC hospitals are generally for patients who can be treated, recover, and when well enough return home or move to the next level of their recovery. Alternatives to these hospitals include acute hospital step-down units for the most severely ill patients and skilled nursing facilities or inpatient rehabilitation facilities for the less severely ill.93 LTAC hospitals are certified by Medicare as \"long term care hospitals\" and are licensed by the State of Connecticut as chronic disease hospitals. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as of March 2011, there are 438 LTAC hospitals across the country. Three free-standing facilities in Connecticut provide LTAC hospital services: Gaylord Hospital in Wallingford, the Hospital for Special Care in New Britain and the Connecticut Department of Veterans Affairs' Sgt. John L. Levitow Veterans Health Center in Rocky Hill. Additionally, the Hospital for Special Care operates a Hartford LTAC satellite on the Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center North Campus (or Mount Sinai Campus). Three other licensed chronic disease hospitals in Connecticut operate without the Medicare certification. They are: Hebrew Home and Hospital in West Hartford, Masonicare Health Center in Wallingford, and Mount Sinai Rehabilitation Hospital in Hartford. Public Act 12-118 imposed a moratorium, from June 15, 2012 through June 30, 2017, on adding LTAC hospital beds to certain licensed chronic disease hospitals. The act prohibits the Department of Public Health's, Office of Health Care Access from accepting or approving any CON requests during the moratorium that would add new LTAC hospital beds to the system. LTAC hospitals provide intensive, specialized interdisciplinary care to medically complex patients who require more recovery time than is typically provided in a short-term acute care hospital and more services than a skilled nursing facility may be equipped to provide. These patients typically suffer from multiple concurrent illnesses, including pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, respiratory failure, complicated wound care, neuromuscular disease, gastrointestinal diseases, post-operative complications and end stage renal disease. 94 LTAC hospitals provide a wide variety of interdisciplinary patient care services, including daily physician visits, nursing, respiratory therapy, physical and occupational therapy, speech-language pathology services, nutritional therapy, case management and social services, laboratory, radiology and pharmacy services, telemetry, dialysis, pain management, family interventions and end-of-life care. They may also provide cancer care, care for psychological disorders or care for Alzheimer's disease. Depending on the individual hospital, many offer a full complement of clinics, laboratory and pharmacy services, scanning and imaging, and other outpatient services. 95 6.2.5 NURSING HOME CARE Nursing homes or convalescent facilities are places of residence for people who require constant nursing care and have significant deficiencies with activities of daily living. Residents include the elderly and younger adults with physical or mental disabilities that keep them from living independently. Residents may also receive physical, occupational, or other rehabilitative therapies following an accident or illness. Nursing homes are certified by Medicare as either skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) or nursing facilities (NFs). The corresponding nursing facility licensure categories utilized by the Connecticut Department of Public Health are chronic and convalescent nursing homes (CCNH) for facilities providing skilled and rehabilitative care and rest homes with 92 Acute Long Term Hospital Association.

Connecticut nursing homes can elect to be licensed in one or both of these categories. Some facilities provide sub-acute care, which is medically more sophisticated than traditional nursing home care. These facilities can usually provide this care at a lower cost than hospitals.96 CMS does not recognize sub-acute care as being different from SNF care. As of June 2012, there were 234 licensed nursing home facilities in Connecticut with a total of 27,976 licensed beds. Nursing home information by facility type and bed number from the DPH Licensure Database is presented in the Table 6.2. Nursing homes act as a cost-effective way to enable patients with injuries, acute illnesses or postoperative care needs to recover in an environment outside a hospital. Nursing homes also serve in caring for residents who have chronic illnesses and long term care needs. Some people never return home and live their final days in the nursing home; federal and State regulations recognize the nursing home as \"home\" for such residents. The nursing home is equipped to handle medical problems, disability and in some cases behavior problems that cannot be handled safely or effectively in the community. Because there are now so many other options for care prior to a nursing home, the trend is that residents on average are much sicker and older than in the past, at the time of nursing home admission. 97 Connecticut nursing homes provide a wide variety of patient care services. The following is a program/services listing as contained in the latest version of the Nursing Home Facilities Databook for 2011-2012: adult day pulmonary rehabilitation and vascular management; pastoral care; peritoneal dialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); traumatic brain injury (TBI); HIV/AIDS; and recreation. 99 6.2.5.1 Chronic and Convalescent Nursing Home The Connecticut Public Health Code defines a chronic and convalescent nursing home as a long term institution having facilities and all necessary personnel to provide skilled nursing care, under medical supervision and direction, to carry out simple, non-surgical treatment and dietary procedures for chronic disease or convalescent stages of acute diseases or injury. CCNHs are designed for individuals who need continuous skilled nursing services and/or 24-hour nursing supervision. These individuals have been diagnosed with uncontrolled, unstable and/or chronic conditions. Individuals may also have chronic conditions that require substantial assistance based on activities of daily living or cognitive status deficits, inadequate informal support, or insufficient financial resources to pay for home and community-based services. Residents typically need ongoing nursing care, but do not require hospitalization. 100 6.2.5.2 Rest Home with Nursing Supervision The Connecticut Public Health Code defines a rest home with nursing supervision as an institution having facilities and all necessary personnel to provide, in addition to personal care required in a residential care home, nursing supervision Facility Description: Facility Number CCNH Beds RHNS 15 1,446 261 1,707 Total Facility / Bed Count 234 27,552 424 27,976 Table 6.2: Connecticut Nursing Homes by Facility Type and Bed Count Source: DPH Licensure Database 96 Connecticut Department of Social Services, Aging Services Division.

RHNSs are for individuals with chronic conditions who are unable to live independently but do not need constant skilled care. These individuals typically have controlled and/or stable chronic conditions that require minimal skilled-nursing services, nursing supervision or assistance with personal care on a daily basis. Residents are normally not confined to a bed and usually have a greater degree of mobility than those individuals who reside in chronic and convalescent nursing homes. Nursing supervision under medical direction is provided twenty-four hours a day. A full range of medical, social, recreational and support services are provided. 101 A Kaiser 2009 nursing home study produced the following comparative results between the Connecticut nursing home experience and that of the rest of the country. 102 6.2.5.3 Trends in Connecticut's Nursing Home Facility and Bed Supply In 1991, State government attempted to reduce the number of residents in Connecticut's nursing facilities by placing a moratorium on the establishment of additional nursing home beds. From 1995 to 2012, the total number of licensed beds decreased from 32,054 to 27,976, a 12.7% reduction. The development of alternative programs and services that have enabled older and disabled individuals to either remain in their residences or delayed placement in a nursing home has stabilized the state's nursing home bed supply, especially in the light of the state's aging population. The mix of CCNH and RHNS beds changed substantially. In 1991, RHNS beds accounted for 21% of total licensed beds, compared to 1.5% in 2012. 103 The State intends to continue efforts to \"rebalance\" the long term care system so as to provide more home- and community-based services and fewer nursing home beds. Recently enacted legislation, signed by the Governor on June 15, 2012, under Public Act 12-118 extended from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2016, the Department of Social Services' moratorium on CONs for new nursing home beds. The law exempts certain nursing home beds from the moratorium, including those beds used by AIDS or traumatic brain injury patients, and beds associated with a continuing care facility. 6.2.6 RESIDENTIAL CARE HOME Residential care homes (homes for the aged, rest homes or personal care homes) in Connecticut are licensed by the Department of Public Health. Residential care home occupants may have some health, social and/or personal care needs, but do not require the extensive medical care. No nursing services are provided by a residential care home. Most residents require some assistance with activities of daily living, supervision of medications and/or protective oversight. Although residents possess some degree of independence, they are not able to live on their own. 104 The Connecticut Public Health Code defines a residential care home as an institution having facilities and all necessary personnel to furnish food, shelter and laundry for persons unrelated to the proprietor and in addition, providing services Table 6.3: Excerpts from Kaiser Nursing Home Facts Comparing Connecticut vs. the United States, 2009 101Connecticut Department of Social Services, Aging Services Division. 102 Kaiser Family Foundation, State Health Facts.

Some homes employ a licensed nurse on staff. Staff members can supervise medications that residents self-administer and if trained and certified, may administer oral, topical and inhalant medications to residents. They may also help residents schedule their medical appointments. As of June 2012, there were 100 licensed residential care homes in Connecticut providing a total of 2,735 beds. 6.2.7 HOSPICE INPATIENT CARE Hospice care focuses on the palliation of terminally ill patients' symptoms. Hospice patients are generally medically certified to have less than 6 months to live. The associated symptoms can be physical, emotional, spiritual or social. More than 90% of the hospice services provided in the U.S. is provided in home. However, when home care is not an option, hospice inpatient care is available at a free-standing inpatient hospice facility, a general hospital or skilled nursing facility. 105 As of July 31, 2012, the Connecticut Public Health Code defines hospice care as being provided by one of three entities: a \"short-term hospital\"; a \"special hospice\"; or a \"hospice inpatient facility\" each having facilities, medical staff and necessary personnel to provide medical, palliative, psychological, spiritual, and supportive care and treatment for the terminally ill and their families including outpatient care and services, home based care and services and bereavement services. Hospice care may also be provided by a licensed home health care agency that complies with additional provisions. Generally, treatment is not diagnostic or curative, although the patient may choose some treatment options intended to prolong life, such as CPR. Most hospice services are covered by Medicare or other providers, and many hospices can provide access to charitable resources for patients lacking such coverage. Connecticut was one of the last states to include a hospice benefit in its Medicaid State Plan. Hospice care allows for compassion and dignity in the process of dying. The objectives of hospice care are the following: manage the patient's pain and symptoms; assist the patient with the emotional and psychosocial and spiritual aspects of dying; provide needed medications, medical supplies, and equipment; coach the family on how to care for the patient; deliver special services like speech language/pathology services and physical therapy when needed; make short-term inpatient care available when pain or symptoms become too difficult to manage at home, or the caregiver needs respite time; and provide bereavement care and counseling to surviving family and friends. 106 Although most hospice patients are in treatment for less than 30 days, care may extend beyond 6 months. Medical and social services are provided to patients and their families by an interdisciplinary team of professional providers and volunteers; family caregivers; the patient's personal physician; social workers; clergy or other counselors; language/pathology, physical, and occupational therapists; health aides; complementary therapists; trained volunteers; and consultants. 107 In 2008, hospice treatment was utilized by 10,591 people in the Connecticut. They were treated within the 31 Medicare-certified hospice programs in the state, generating 505,731 hospice days with an average length of stay per patient of 48 days.108 Currently, there are two inpatient hospice facilities in Connecticut, licensed as \"hospital facilities\" by the Connecticut Department of Public Health. The Connecticut Hospice, a 52-bed facility in Branford, provides inpatient hospice care for adults and children. VITAS Healthcare Corporation Atlantic Inpatient Unit operates a 12-bed adult hospice unit within Saint Mary's Hospital in Waterbury. As of July 31, 2012, a new category of licensure, \"hospice inpatient facility\" was enacted by the Connecticut General Assembly. These facilities are planned to be smaller in size (i.e. in the 10 to 16 beds range) and provide for a more home-like environment. 6.2.8 ASSISTED LIVING SERVICE AGENCIES Assisted living \"managed residential communities\" is defined by the Connecticut Public Health Code as a combination of housing, supportive services and personalized assistance designed to respond to the individual needs of the resident. Licensed Assisted Living Service Agencies (ALSAs) provide health care management and monitoring, nursing services 105 Hospice Association of America. (2010).

They also provide assistance with activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing and eating. Assisted living residences may be part of a retirement community, nursing home, senior housing complex, or may be a stand-alone entity. They serve in the continuum of care for residents who require a level of service that exists between the type of care offered by home care services and nursing home facilities. Nursing and personal care services for residents of assisted living communities are licensed by DPH. There are 82 licensed assisted living service agencies in Connecticut. 109 6.2.9 CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY Continuing-care retirement communities (CCRCs or life-care communities) through contractual agreements, provide senior residents living accommodations and a wide variety of services such as long term health and nursing services. Various levels of care, such as independent living, assistance with daily activities and nursing home care are usually provided. Residents may move from one level of care to another as their needs change. There are 18 continuing care retirement communities in Connecticut. CCRCs are not licensed in Connecticut, but they must adhere to certain statutory requirements (17b-520 through 17b-535, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, Management of Continuing Care Facilities). Various components of their health care packages such as assisted living services and skilled nursing services are, however, licensed by the State. 110 6.2.10 CONGREGATE LIVING Congregate housing offers semi-independent living in a residential environment with some support services. Connecticut has 24 State-funded elderly congregate housing facilities for low- and moderate-income, frail seniors age 62 and older. Congregate communities are not licensed and do not provide rehabilitation or nursing services, nor do they dispense or monitor the self-administration of medications. Home health care agencies may provide services to these residents as they would in any \"home\" setting. 111 6.2.11 ADULT DAY CARE Connecticut's adult day centers are community-based, nonresidential facilities for frail seniors and disabled adults who cannot be home alone. These services, which help these individuals remain independent in their own homes as long as possible include supervision, social and recreational activities, therapeutic activities, medical and personal care, nursing services, meals, and respite. The adult day care centers are one way for elderly or disabled people to avoid or delay entering a long term care facility and this provides relief for family caregivers. 112 Adult day centers are not licensed, but they must be certified by the Connecticut Association of Adult Day Centers (CAADC) to receive State funding. Centers can operate without certification, but they do not receive State funding. Currently, 50 centers are operating, 48 of which are certified. One center in Massachusetts and one in Rhode Island serve Connecticut clients; the Connecticut Department of Social Services certifies centers based on their being licensed by their home states. 113 Adult day centers generally operate on either \"social\" or \"medical\" models. The social model serves people who need supervision and activities to reduce social isolation, but it does not provide extensive personal care and medical monitoring. The medical model provides nursing, personal care, and other medical services. According to CAADC, 41 of the state's certified centers are medical models and seven are social models.114 109 Connecticut Assisted Living Association.

Home health agencies deliver a variety of skilled services. The plan of care usually includes custodial services to help the care-recipient remain in the home. Home health care agencies provide medical care to help people rehabilitate in their homes from acute medical conditions such as accidents, illnesses or surgery. Services provided include registered nurses, speech language/pathology and physical therapists, social services and aides to help with bathing, dressing and ambulation. Home health agencies also may provide hospice care. Hospice care agencies offer palliative care for people who are not expected to live longer than 6 months. As of June 2012, there were 105 home health care agencies, 29 of which provide hospice services as hospice care agencies, licensed in Connecticut. 6.2.12.2 Homemaker-Home Health Aide Agency Homemaker-home health aide agencies are public or private organizations, except home health care agencies, which provide in the patient's home or a substantially equivalent environment supportive services which may include, but are not limited to, assistance with personal hygiene, dressing, feeding and incidental household tasks essential to achieving adequate household and family management. As of June 2012, there were seven homemaker-home health aide agencies licensed in Connecticut.

The DPH has identified 25 health priorities for increasing the life expectancy and quality of life of Connecticut residents. See Appendix R for details. Since January 2012, DPH has been developing a State Health Assessment that will: evaluate the health care delivery system; identify priority populations and areas; determine the need for services and programs; and inform policymakers and the public about the health of Connecticut residents. Subsequently, DPH will develop a State Health Improvement Plan in response to the findings of the assessment, to guide policy and program changes that will lead to improved access to care, improved outcomes and health equity for the state's residents. The Department will release the health assessment and improvement plan in 2013. DPH is working with representatives of other State agencies, local health departments, community organizations, educational institutions, complementary services providers, business and industry, and health care providers to develop the assessment and improvement plan. 7.1 IDENTIFYING PERSONS AT RISK AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS In the last few years, national efforts have been focused on reducing health inequalities or disparities for certain populations.115 Such inequalities gauge the health of the community and guide efforts to identify and implement solutions to improve health status in general. Although racial and ethnic minorities tend to have poorer health outcomes, they are not the only populations that experience inequities. The federal government has provided leadership in identifying health disparities and the priority populations that are at risk or vulnerable. DPH has developed a working definition of health disparities and priority populations for Connecticut based on federal guidelines and evidence-based research for its monitoring and surveillance activities. \"Health disparities refer to the differences in disease risk, incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality and other adverse conditions, such as unequal access to quality care, that exist among specific population groups in Connecticut. Population groups may be based on race, ethnicity, age, gender, socioeconomic position, immigrant status, sexual minority status, language, disability, homelessness and geographic area of residence. Specifically, health disparities refer to those avoidable differences in health that result from cumulative social disadvantages. \" 116 Priority, at risk or vulnerable populations in Connecticut have at least one of the following characteristics: they are elderly; residents of towns with the lowest income, highest poverty and extremely high population density (or urban core cities) that is, Bridgeport, New Britain, New London, West Haven, Hartford, New Haven and Waterbury117; residents with household income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level; racial/ethnic minorities such as blacks, Hispanics and other non-whites; residents of rural areas with average income, below average poverty and the lowest population density in Connecticut; uninsured population under age 65; people with chronic medical conditions; the disabled; speakers; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender population; and immigrants. 118 Estimates of Connecticut residents vulnerable or at-risk are shown in Table 7.1. 115 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

For the purposes of this plan, two definitions of unmet health care need are used. First, unmet need is defined as inadequate availability of health care services deemed necessary to deal with a particular health problem.119, 120 When this definition is utilized, the barriers to accessing care may be one or more of the following: Physical unavailability of service or professional shortage; Mismatched services for the needs of the people -- that is, the health care system is unresponsive; Inferior available services as compared to the norm; Lack of knowledge regarding what services are available locally or how to access them; Lack of enabling services such as translation services to non-English speaking immigrants or transportation to facilitate access, especially in rural areas; Insufficient coordination between different providers of different levels and types of services; Complex health insurance payer rules such as eligibility for Medicare and/or Medicaid and for accessing services; and Inadequate collaboration among governmental agencies and/or community providers. Second, unmet need is defined as when individuals of a distinct socio-demographic group, such as the uninsured or people with low income, forgo or delay accessing needed available health care services because the associated costs are unaffordable. The Institute of Medicine's (IOM) has identified lack of insurance as a significant driver of health disparities.121 Both definitions presume an adverse impact on health status from lack of or delayed care, or disparities in access. Whichever definition is used, unmet need has to be quantified to determine the appropriate intervention(s) or policy change. The expected result is a more integrated healthcare delivery system in which resources are allocated efficiently based on agreed priorities to improve health status and eliminate inequalities. 7.3 METHODS FOR EVALUATING UNMET NEED AND GAPS IN SERVICES Three methods are used to evaluate unmet need for primary care services in Chapter 9: 1) Federal designation approach; 2) Population-based relative availability approach; and 3) Proxy approach. 7.3.1 FEDERAL DESIGNATION APPROACH The first approach uses Medically Underserved Areas or Populations (MUA/P) or Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA) designations in comparison with uninsured rates to determine potential future demand for primary care-related services. The DPH Primary Care Office works with the Office of Shortage Designation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Bureau of Health Professions, to identify medically underserved areas in Connecticut that may qualify for these federal designations as underserved areas for primary care, dental or mental health care. Each of the three HPSA designations - primary care, dental and mental health - is subcategorized to enable demonstration of provider shortage(s) by: Geographic area for the area's total population; Population group in which over 30% have incomes at or below 200% of federal poverty levels and are migrant/ seasonal farmworkers and families, Medicaid eligible, Native Americans/Native Alaskan, homeless, or isolated from access because of language and cultural/physical barriers; or Facility such as community health centers, rural health clinics, federal correctional facilities, and state hospitals utilizing factors such as the facility's outpatient population, wait times, patients' residences, and in-house faculty. 119 DeCesaro, A., Hemmetter, J.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press.847.3.2 POPULATION-BASED RELATIVE AVAILABILITY APPROACH The second approach compares the geographic availability and accessibility of inpatient services between regions.122 Use rates are also calculated for certain at-risk populations and compared to rates for the general population. Comparisons with availability per 1,000 of general populations for specific subpopulations, are included where relevant and available. 7.3.3 PROXY APPROACH The third approach utilizes proxies in identifying gaps in outpatient services for at-risk populations. Proxies include mortality rates, ED utilization for non-urgent care as a gauge of wait times for primary care visits (e.g., obstetrics /gynecology, well child, and adult medicine) and preventable hospitalizations derived from acute care discharge data. 123 7.4 PROGRAMS/PLANS TO MITIGATE UNMET NEED AND GAPS IN SERVICES This section identifies any plans or programs in development, already developed and/or being implemented by DPH or other State agencies to mitigate unmet need in at risk-persons and vulnerable populations. (Appendix S includes additional information on DPH programs.) 7.4.1 FEDERAL MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS124 The federal HPSA designations, reviewed periodically, are a first step for the state and local communities to obtaining resources to improve access to health care services to vulnerable or at-risk populations and areas. Since 1982, when the Federal Bureau of Primary Health Care granted the state four MUA designations to cover areas served by Charter Oak Health Center and Community Health Services of Hartford, Cornell Scott-Hill and Fair Haven Community Health Centers of New Haven, to date, 29 more towns have applied for and been designated MUAs. Benefits include National Health Service Corps (NHSC) placements of qualified medical staff, improved facilities and laboratory services, enhanced Medicare reimbursements, Community Health Center Grants and other federal or State programs. HPSAs are also designated, mostly in poorer communities. Currently, the state has 104 designations covering 94 towns in the eight counties. DPH works with NHSC, which provides employment or financial incentives, to place both U.S. and non-U.S. citizen health professionals in the underserved and professional shortage areas. Non-citizen physicians who meet all the State licensing and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (UCSIS) requirements may apply and be considered to practice in a shortage area through 1) the National Interest Waiver (NIW) program 125, 2) the Conrad 30 J-1 or 3) HHS J-1 visa programs. Additional information on how these designations have been utilized to improve access to health care services in the state is provided in Chapter 9. 7.4.2 THE SAFETY NET SYSTEM \"Safety net providers\" are those who either by mandate offer health care services regardless of patients' ability to pay, or by mission have a patient mix that consists mostly of the uninsured, Medicaid beneficiaries, inner city and rural poor and other vulnerable populations.126 Public hospitals and clinics are widely accepted as safety net providers, the description 122 Mellow, J., Hoge, S.K., Lee, R.B., Belkin, G.

Washington, DC: National Academy Press.CHAPTER 7 PERSONS AT RISK AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS85CHAPTER 7 PERSONS AT RISK AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS is more inclusive, though many private health care providers opt out of serving Medicaid recipients, disadvantaged or uninsured patients.127 Even with the planned coverage expansion in the PPACA, it is expected that some people may remain uninsured and continue to rely on the safety net system for their health care needs. Additionally, the expansion is expected to increase the number of Medicaid beneficiaries, creating additional strain on existing capacity from people seeking care once they have coverage. It is therefore important that the safety net system is effective and remains financially viable. 7.4.2.1 Safety Net Hospitals By federal law, all emergent, non-elective patients at Connecticut's general hospitals must receive treatment, regardless of ability to pay. Sometimes hospitals are not reimbursed or compensated for the care they provide. This uncompensated care is either charity care, when the hospital knows in advance that the care provided will not be reimbursed, or bad debt incurred after the service has been provided, with no forewarning of non-payment. Bad debt and charity care were two-thirds and one-third, respectively, of $647.3 million in uncompensated care charges in hospital fiscal year (FY) 2010. 128 The State and federal government jointly fund the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) programs. These programs are designed to assist hospitals financially with their uncompensated and undercompensated129 care costs. The DSH programs provide supplemental reimbursement to offset these shortfalls to help hospitals continue in their role as a safety net to patients with limited access to health care. The Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS) administers uncompensated care related programs including the Connecticut Medicaid DSH programs, in accordance with an approved State plan. 7.4.2.2 Safety Net Community-Based Providers 7.4.2.2.1 Community Health Centers (CHCs) Services CHCs provide include general primary medical care, preventive dental care, screenings and behavioral health treatments and counseling. Additional details on community health centers are provided in Chapter 9. 7.4.2.2.2 School-Based Health Centers School-based health centers (SBHCs) are licensed outpatient facilities that offer comprehensive services to address medical, mental and oral health needs of students in grades pre-K through 12 during the academic year. Additional details on school based health centers are provided in Chapter 9. 7.4.2.2.3 Local Health Departments Local health departments (LHDs) are State-funded government entities that provide population-based essential public health services in their local areas. These public health activities include disease prevention and control, infectious disease control and environmental health in the community. There are 50 full-time LHDs in 29 individual towns and 21 districts of two to 18 towns, serving 144 Connecticut towns and 95% of the state's residents; additionally, 25 LHDs are part-time and serve the remaining 25 towns and 5% of the population. LHDs, other health care providers and refugee settlement agencies, assist DPH in its Refugee and Immigrant Health Program. Upon entry into Connecticut, each refugee 130 receives an initial health assessment, medical care for conditions that are potentially significant for public health, treatment for chronic conditions, and referrals for other health care services such as mental health and family planning. 127 Jones, A.S., & Sajid, P .S.

Annual Report on the Financial Status of Connecticut's Short Term Acute Care Hospitals for Fiscal Year 2010. Retrieved from http://www.ct.gov/dph/lib/dph/ohca/publications/2011/fsreport2010.pdf 129 Undercompensated care generally refers to government programs, like Medicaid, which tend to provide lower rates of reimbursement. 130 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) defines a refugee as \" Any person who is outside any country of such person's nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion... \"86Twelve LHDs operate licensed outpatient clinics authorized to provide ambulatory medical or dental care for local residents with chronic or acute medical conditions; these outpatient clinics also provide preventive and health maintenance care services. Additional details on LHD or municipality clinics are provided in Chapter 9. 7.4.3 PHYSICIAN NETWORKS AND SPECIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS Many private health care practitioners opt out of providing care to the uninsured or participating in government funded programs, especially Medicaid. Only a few physicians, nurses and other specialty care providers donate time or discounted services in their own settings or at a free clinic to disadvantaged patients, the underinsured, the uninsured and /or Medicaid beneficiaries who lack access to care. In 2010, uncompensated or charity care for private office-based physician visits in the U.S. was estimated at $5.1 billion. The aggregate associated costs, number of health care providers that fall in this category, and state residents that benefit from such services in Connecticut is not known. In 2010, eight free clinics provided approximately $7.3 million of free medical, behavioral and dental services. 131 These clinics provide at least one basic health care service that may be primary care, reproductive health, pharmaceutical, specific health condition or medication arrangement related. Generally free clinics are funded through private charitable donations from civic groups, churches, foundations and business organizations.132 Chapter 9 provides more information on free clinics. 7.4.4 NEWBORN SCREENING PROGRAM133 Newborn screening identifies infants at increased risk for diseases that timely medical treatment can avert complications and prevent irreversible problems and death. Connecticut State law mandates screening newborns within the first 4 days of life for selected genetic and metabolic disorders. Specimens are tested at the DPH State Laboratory; all abnormal results are reported to the DPH Tracking Unit, which reports the results to the primary care providers; and assures referrals are made to the State-funded Regional Treatment Centers for confirmatory testing and treatment. Regional Treatment Centers provide comprehensive testing, counseling, education, treatment, and follow-up services. The Tracking Unit coordinates and provides educational programs, guidelines, protocols, materials, technical assistance for birthing facilities staff, primary care providers, and health professionals; and provides telephone technical assistance for families and the general public. 7.4.5 CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS The Children and Y outh with Special Health Care Needs (CYSHCN) program is for residents under age 22 who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral or emotional condition and require health and related services beyond those required for other children. 134 Approximately 139,453 CYSHCN reside in Connecticut. DPH conducts statewide assessments of the needs of families with such children and providers who serve them, to identify the unmet needs and to assess capacity and performance. In Connecticut, 16% of children and youth have special needs compared to 13.9% nationally. Four out of five were predominantly racial/ethnic minorities or multi-racial; approximately 6.2% were uninsured sometime in the year, and more than one-third of the insured had inadequate health insurance coverage.135 With respect to access to care, about 12% of the children experienced an unmet need for a specific health care service; 25% had difficulty in receiving a needed health service referral; almost 4% did not have a personal doctor or nurse, with 4% relying on the emergency room as a usual source of care. More than one in five CYSHCN families paid over $1,000 out-of-pocket in medical expenses annually for the child; as a result a family member had to cut back or stop working to care for the child causing financial difficulties. 131 Potteiger, J.L. & Munson, H.

Rockville, Maryland.CHAPTER 7 PERSONS AT RISK AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS87CHAPTER 7 PERSONS AT RISK AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS The Connecticut Medical Home Initiative for children and youth with special health care needs builds on policies and programs to provide a system of care that ensures coordinated access to family-centered quality care, adequately trained providers and insurance coverage.136 The initiative attempts to improve community-based services for these children and their families by facilitating connections among families, agencies and medical homes that are accessible, compassionate, comprehensive, continuous, coordinated, culturally competent and family-centered; and to promote and sustain the medical home model. 7.4.6 HIV/AIDS SERVICES IN CONNECTICUT DPH administers a program working with various HIV/AIDS service- and community-based organizations to provide free core medical and supportive services to people living with HIV or AIDS (PLWHA) and their families. Services include: medical case management, primary medical care, oral health, mental health, substance abuse-outpatient, medical nutrition therapy, HIV-related medications sponsored temporarily by the DSS Connecticut AIDS Drug Assistance program, health insurance premium and cost sharing assistance, home health care, home-and-community based services, hospice care, medical transportation, housing-related services, food bank/meals, psychosocial support, linguistic services and related emergency financial assistance. As of December 2010, more than 10,500 people in Connecticut were living with HIV/AIDS with more than 400 newly diagnosed in the same year. HIV/AIDS occurs disproportionately among racial/ethnic minorities, with non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics accounting for two-thirds of the cases but only one-quarter of the population. PLWHA are twice as likely to be male as female, and seven in ten are between 40 and 59 years of age. Bridgeport, New Haven and Hartford, which are the state's three largest cities with the most Hispanic and non-Hispanic black residents, account for about one-half of the PLWHAs in Connecticut. 137 The gaps in core medical services to PLWHA are dental care, continuous health insurance coverage, outpatient substance abuse services, mental health services and financial assistance with purchasing AIDS-related medication. Other needs include assistance with support services such as food, housing and medical transportation. Some of the barriers faced by this subpopulation are the fear of their status being revealed, inability to pay for services, housing, and case management.138 7.4.7 CONNECTICUT CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION PLAN DPH and its partners are developing a chronic disease prevention plan for cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and asthma. The Plan is expected to be released in December 2012. It focuses on four modifiable risk factors-- poor nutrition, inadequate physical activity, tobacco use and excessive alcohol use, that are common to these chronic diseases-- and three intermediate risk factors-- high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and obesity. The goal of the plan is to reduce significantly the social and economic impact of chronic disease by targeting the modifiable risk factors the four diseases share. The plan prioritizes prevention and wellness, promotes cost-effective preventive care practices, advances health equity, and specifies goals, outcomes and measures to enable evaluation. 7.4.8 VULNERABLE POPULATION EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM DPH's Vulnerable Population Emergency Response Planning program provides an integrated database of the type and scope of care, monitoring, and human services necessary to enable populations with functional disabilities to remain in their homes and communities. The program goal is to build community resilience, by creating an accessible inventory of services that support non-institutionalized residents of each community with functional needs.

Moreover, community health centers and rural hospitals experience difficulty in recruiting and retaining professional staff.140 The 61 rural communities in Connecticut are well serviced by a network of community based primary care providers, mental health and substance abuse providers, and hospitals. Primary care providers are based closer to hospitals and therefore are not easily accessible to rural residents, most of whom have no private transportation. Residents have to travel out of their local areas to major medical centers to obtain specialty services. Although specialty care providers have opened satellite locations in suburban towns close to some rural towns, most providers are either not accepting new patients or Medicaid patients, making specialty medical care inaccessible to low-income residents of rural towns. Health care providers in rural towns have identified transportation, substance abuse, domestic violence, and translation services as the top five health care related services needed. As part of rural community health planning activities involving DPH, several towns bordering rural areas have been designated HPSAs to assist with health care professional related capacity issues. The Connecticut State Office of Rural Health (CT-ORH) has recommended interfacing with DPH to ensure that public health planning activities take into account the needs of rural areas. CT-ORH assists rural communities to locate funding sources and partners with philanthropic funders to help develop and implement plans that promote healthy communities. For example in 2011, CT-ORH assisted Northwestern Connecticut Community College in establishing a new associate nursing degree program; through the Community Health Centers Association grant, the office participated in the Student Experiences And Rotations Health (SEARCH) program to offer students clinical experience and placement in the area; and also offered competitive grants for preventive health care, behavioral health and emergency medical services training. To improve transportation-related barriers in rural communities over time, the Connecticut Department of Transportation (DOT) has implemented two initiatives, the Locally-Coordinated Public Transit Human Services Transportation Plan, which identifies transportation types, destinations, funding sources and gaps in services in these communities; and United We Ride, which is a federal initiative to coordinate transportation services in the state. 7.5 DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS The Department of Social Services (DSS) provides and administers a broad range of health care-related services to the elderly, persons with disabilities, families, and individuals through programs authorized by State and federal legislation. Some of the programs and the populations they serve are described below. 7.5.1 CONNECTICUT MEDICAID PROGRAM141 DSS funds and provides a free or low-cost health insurance coverage program for low-income elderly, blind, or disabled persons, and families with children. The Medicaid program is administered by DSS in adherence to Title XIX of the Social Security Act, the federal Medicaid law, to qualify for 50% reimbursement from the federal government. The program provides different plans and benefits to low-income subpopulations. Payments for health care services provided under each plan are made directly to providers. The Healthcare for UninSured Kids and Y outh (HUSKY) plan provides coverage for children and teenagers less than 20 years of age, based on family income, and pays for services such as doctor visits, prescriptions, and vision and dental care. Children under 19, their parents or relative caregivers and pregnant women with family income up to 185% of federal poverty level (FPL) receive coverage under HUSKY A; uninsured children in families with incomes between 185% and 300% and their families may qualify for coverage under HUSKY B on a sliding scale. The plan for the aged, the blind or disabled individuals between ages 18 and 65, HUSKY C or Title 19, is based on 139Connecticut Office of Rural Health. (2011, November). Annual Report .

In 2010, Connecticut was the first state to expand the Medicaid program to cover recipients of State Administered General Assistance (SAGA) under PPACA. This program, HUSKY D or Medicaid for low-income adults, provides health insurance coverage for single adults or married adults between ages 19 and 64, who are not pregnant and do not receive federal Supplemental Security Income or Medicare, with incomes below 56% of federal poverty levels.143 Beneficiaries receive full Medicaid benefits, long term care, home health care and non-emergency transportation. 7.5.2 CONNECTICUT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION INSURANCE PLAN144 DSS contracts with the Health Reinsurance Association to operate Connecticut's Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (CT PCIP). Formerly the temporary high-risk pool program, CT PCIP currently provides federal subsidies available through the PPACA. CT PCIP is open to Connecticut residents who have qualified, diagnosed medical conditions and have been uninsured for 6 months. The plan premium is a flat rate pre-approved by the federal government and provides comprehensive medical benefits coordinated through the UnitedHealthcare provider network. 7.5.3 CHARTER OAK HEALTH PLAN145 The Charter Oak Health Plan is a State-funded health insurance program administered by DSS since 2008 and offered to uninsured adults of all incomes, from ages 19 through 64 who do not qualify for the pre-existing condition insurance plan or HUSKY Health. Charter Oak offers a full range of coverage, including preventive care, emergency room and hospital visits, primary care and specialist physicians, pharmacy, behavioral health services, prescription medications and a total lifetime benefit of $1 million. By statute, Charter Oak enrollees cannot have been covered by health insurance during the preceding six months. However, applicants can request an exception to this waiting period for factors such as job loss, financial hardship or loss of HUSKY Plan eligibility due to age or income. Premiums are subsidized based on income levels and family size. 7.6 HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE The PPACA enabled creation of health insurance exchanges (HIE) by states for individuals and small employers with fewer than 100 employees to purchase health insurance coverage in an organized and competitive market. HIEs will provide consumers a choice of health plans at competitive rates developed with a set of rules for offering and pricing in this market; accessible easy to understand information on and how to enroll in plans; make the plans portable so that an individual will continue to have coverage even when he/she changes jobs; and reform the insurance market with respect to ensuring non-denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions and minimizing arbitrary premium increases. 146 Since September 2010, Connecticut has received nearly $115 million in federal funding for activities related to establishing a State HIE to increase access to affordable health coverage and reduce Connecticut's almost 378,000 underinsured and uninsured. Funded activities include background research, consulting with stakeholders, making legislative and regulatory changes, establishing the administrative structure, staff and a customer support program for the exchange, and developing an IT system and a system for ensuring program oversight and integrity by December 2014. Through the Governor's Office of Health Reform and Innovation, as part of PPACA implementation, the State is also receiving technical support from the National Academy of State Health Policy to educate health reform leaders on health equity issues, strategies to address disparities, and to measure effectiveness; to create a system to maximize participation of rural and, low-income and minority populations in Medicaid and HIE; and to improve Medicaid clients' transition to a person-centered system of service delivery. 147 142 Connecticut Department of Social Services, Adult Services, Bureau of Assistance Programs.

The foregoing requires that certain criteria set forth in Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-639 be met. As provided by subsection (b) of the statute, Certificate of Need approval is not required for non-profit facilities that contract with a State agency or programs licensed or funded by the Department of Children and Families (except psychiatric residential treatment facilities). In addition, behavioral health services provided by a licensed private practitioner do not require Certificate of Need approval. 8.2 SERVICE OVERVIEW Treatment for mental health and substance use disorders very often overlap and intersect. Adult and child/adolescent services also are interrelated, as services to a teen can transition to adult services as that person \"ages out\" of the child/ adolescent programs. In addition, entire families of various ages can be fundamentally involved in the treatment of an individual with a mental health or substance use disorder. The services of private providers and the services of State-operated entities are related by referrals between private and State programs and by State funding sources. 8.3 POINTS OF ACCESS OR ENTRY INTO THE SYSTEM Behavioral health care has numerous and varied entry points. The following listing of diverse entry or access points illustrates the complexity of the behavioral health system: General or Children's General Hospital emergency departments; Private practitioner's referrals (physicians, therapists, social workers); School systems (e.g., School Based Health Centers); Community Health Centers or other primary care clinics; The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services; The Department of Children and Families; The Department of Correction; The Courts and the Judicial Branch's Court Support Services Division; The Department of Developmental Services (for autism co-morbidity); Transfers from other entities/facilities in other states; Referral by home health providers; Nursing homes providers; Referral of individuals receiving substance use treatment to mental health providers; Referral of individuals receiving mental health treatment to substance use treatment providers; Referral of a teen into adult services when aging out of child/adolescent level services; Referral from 12-step and other recovery and self-help groups; and Self-referral or walk-in. These access points into the behavioral health system are an asset to someone seeking care, but can also pose challenges. The coordination of points of entry is a key element of an efficient and effective service environment in the state. Communication between the various levels of facilities and providers within the behavioral health industry is vital to the appropriate placement and subsequent treatment of individuals seeking behavioral health services.948.4 SYSTEMS THAT ENABLE OR ASSIST WITH RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has determined that Recovery-Oriented Systems of Care are a priority. Recovery Support is one of SAMHSA 's eight strategic initiatives. Recovery Support involves partnering with people in recovery from mental and substance use disorders to guide the behavioral health system and promote individual-, program-, and system-level approaches that foster health and resilience; increase permanent housing, employment, education, and other necessary supports; and reduce barriers to social inclusion. 148 This initiative has taken shape in Connecticut in recent years. In 2002, the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) adopted a policy to formally designate the concept of 'recovery' as the overarching goal of the service system operated and funded by the Department. Recovery is the guiding principle and operational framework for the system of care provided by the partnership of State and private agencies and consumer-run services that form the DMHAS healthcare system. Recovery is defined as a process of restoring or developing a positive and meaningful sense of identity apart from one's condition and then rebuilding one's life despite, or within the limitations imposed by that condition. Recovery is a person-centered approach and thus may vary from person to person and within the mental health and addiction communities. 149 DMHAS' Recovery Initiative focuses on helping to build consensus among stakeholders and momentum for change, while focusing efforts on several key ideas: Empowering people in recovery; Focusing on individualized and person-centered care and support; Building on already existing cornerstones of work; Using standards, practice guidelines and performance monitoring; Emphasizing outcomes; and Incorporating the best available practices. The following could be part of a person's recovery: maximizing the person's opportunities for establishing or reestablishing a safe, dignified, and meaningful life in the community; continuing education in support of career development; managing one's illness such that the person can live independently and have meaningful employment and healthy social relationships; reducing the painful effects of trauma through a process of healing; attaining or restoring a desired state such as achieving sustained sobriety; building on personal strengths to offset the adverse effects of a disability; connecting and re-connecting with family and friends; and pursuit of spiritual activities to the extent of interest. SAMHSA also supports the Systems of Care for Children's Mental Health Initiative that articulates and supports the features of an effective service system for children and youth. The Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program, administered through SAMHSA, funds Systems of Care, a community-based service delivery model that promotes positive mental health outcomes for children and youth from birth through 21 years of age and their families. The focus on providing family-driven, culturally and linguistically competent, and evidence-based services and supports in Systems of Care is ideally suited to addressing the mental health needs of young children and their families. Connecticut's Department of Children and Families endorsed the System of Care through its Kidcare Initiative and continues to support the approach through its Strengthening Families Practice Model. These initiatives seek to build or enhance resilience in children and youth with the help of families, providers and the community.The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has determined that Recovery-Oriented Systems of Care are a priority. 148 U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration description of Recovery Support.

Retrieved from http://www.ct.gov/dmhas/lib/dmhas/recovery/resourceguide.pdfCHAPTER 8 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE95CHAPTER 8 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE An individual's recovery plan or care plan depends on needs and circumstances. For adults, a plan might include transportation, vocational services, life skills training, housing, employment, social or recreational opportunities, faith organizations and community support. These are not health care services, but are related and, in many instances, may be necessary for full and lasting recovery within a community. These recovery support systems may be facilitated through or referred by a person's mental health or substance use treatment provider or the mental health or substance use treatment provider may have some recovery supports built directly into their program of care. The efforts of providers to focus on both the direct treatment services and needed support systems to serve the person in recovery is aimed at keeping persons in recovery in the community and creating opportunities for them to participate and thrive as a member of the community. The goal of these initiatives is to create a supportive system where persons don't relapse back into the treatment system or decompensate 150 due to lack of recovery supports. 8.5 DESCRIPTION OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ENVIRONMENT 8.5.1 ADULT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT 8.5.1.1 Hospital-Operated Facilities: Short-Term General Hospitals Many of Connecticut's short-term private or public general hospitals provide various types and intensity of inpatient services for the treatment of adult mental health conditions. For fiscal year 2011, 24 of the 30 hospitals (29 short-term general hospitals and one children's general hospital) had psychiatric discharges or patient days151 (see Appendix T). Most hospitals thus can provide at least short-term inpatient services for individuals with a mental health diagnoses. Several of the larger hospitals operate mental health services as a department or division within the hospital but maintain a distinct identity (such as The Institute of Living, a department of Hartford Hospital and Y ale-New Haven Psychiatric Hospital, a department of Y ale-New Haven Hospital, and the Behavioral Health Services at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center). In addition, many hospitals operate dedicated behavioral health units within the emergency department. There is currently not a single, verifiable source of information on the types or levels of behavioral health outpatient services provided by Connecticut's short-term general hospitals, but information from various sources indicates that the vast majority of the state's short-term general hospitals provide some level of behavioral health outpatient services, either as a hospital service or through an affiliated or contractual arrangement. These other sources include Value Options 152, the Connecticut Clearinghouse153 (https://www.ctclearinghouse.org/Default.asp), OHCA 's service line survey of hospitals (Inventory Table 3), the SAMHSA facility locator (http://store.samhsa.gov/mhlocator), the United Way of Connecticut's 2-1-1 Network of Care (http://connecticut.networkofcare. org/mh/home/index.cfm). 8.5.1.2 Hospital-Operated Facilities: Hospitals for Mentally Ill Persons Three Connecticut facilities are licensed as Hospitals for Mentally Ill Persons (HMIP). They are Masonicare Health Center with 30 licensed HMIP beds in Wallingford, Natchaug Hospital, Inc. with 60 licensed HMIP beds in Mansfield Center, and Silver Hill Hospital, Inc. with 129 licensed HMIP beds in New Canaan. All three are private, non-profit entities. As defined in Connecticut's Public Health Code 154, an HMIP is \"a psychiatric facility which primarily offers medically directed inpatient services for the diagnosis, treatment, care, protection and rehabilitation, as indicated, of individuals admitted with psychiatric disorders. \" The license allows the provider to offer inpatient, residential and outpatient services, mental health and substance abuse services to all ages and provide off campus services as satellite facilities. The Masonicare Health system holds various facility licenses, including Chronic Disease and Chronic and Convalescent Nursing Home, whereas Natchaug and Silver Hill hold only the Hospital for Mentally Ill Persons licenses and focus on 150Decompensate is a mental illness term meaning the inability to deal with environmental, emotional or psychological stressors. 151DPH Office of Health Care Access Hospital Reporting System for FY 2011.

Section 17-227-14a (G).96the services within this license category. The Masonicare Hospital for Mentally Ill Persons license is for the provision of its Geriatric Psychiatric and Mental Health unit, for persons over the age of fifty-five who are experiencing acute psychiatric and medical problems.155 8.5.1.3 State-Operated Inpatient Facilities156 and Local Mental Health Authorities DMHAS is Connecticut's State Mental Health Authority for adults 18 years of age and older and has statutory responsibility to promote and administer comprehensive behavioral health preventive and treatment services. DMHAS operates, funds, and coordinates inpatient and community-based services for adults having substance use or psychiatric disorders, or co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders who are indigent or medically indigent. It operates four facilities in the state for the provision of inpatient mental health services for adults. Three of the four DMHAS-operated facilities also provide various levels of outpatient mental health services. DMHAS' mental health service system for persons with a serious mental illness is delivered, at the regional and local level, through a network of State-operated and State-funded community services and supports. Included in this network are 13 Local Mental Health Authorities (LMHAs), six are DMHAS-operated and seven are DMHAS-funded (see Appendix U), along with over 90 affiliated private non-profit community-based organizations. A listing of LMHAs, the geographic areas they cover and the community-based providers that receive DMHAS funding is given on the DMHAS web site (www.ct.gov/dmhas).

Retrieved from http://www.masonicare.org/healthcare/on-site-health/hospital/acute-psychiatric-unit 156 Although John Dempsey Hospital of the University of Connecticut Health Center is a State-operated facility, it is included in all discussion or references in this chapter, as a short term general hospital.Connecticut Valley Hospital Connecticut Valley Hospital in Middletown is a DMHAS-\u00adoperated inpatient facility, which includes the Whiting Forensic Division, providing specialized inpatient services in 232 beds to individuals involved with the criminal justice system; the General Psychiatry Division with 220 beds and Addiction Services Division (located in Middletown and at the Blue Hills Hospital in Hartford) with 152 beds. Connecticut Mental Health Center Connecticut Mental Health Center (CMHC) in New Haven is a DMHAS-\u00ad operated inpatient facility which treats individuals suffering from severe and persistent psychosis, depression, anxiety, addictions (including alcoholism, cocaine, and gambling) and those with co-\u00adexisting mental health and substance use disorders. CMHC is a collaborative endeavor between DMHAS and the Yale University Department of Psychiatry and Yale -\u00adNew Haven Hospital. CMHC also operates outreach programs for individuals who are homeless, who are at serious risk for mental illness, or involved with the criminal justice system. CMHC also provides specialized culturally responsive, clinical service for people whose primary language is Spanish. CMHC has a 26 -\u00ad bed Acute Inpatient Unit and a 10 bed \"step down\" unit. Greater Bridgeport Community Mental Health Center Greater Bridgeport Community Mental Health Center (GBCMHC) in Bridgeport serves patients with prolonged psychiatric and co-\u00adoccurring illnesses. GBCMCH has a 42-\u00adbed Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit that provides treatment for severely and acutely ill psychiatr ic patients who require a safe, supportive, highly structured hospital level of care in addition to a 20 -\u00adbed co-\u00adoccurring treatment unit. Capitol Region Mental Health Center Capitol Region Mental Health Center in Hartford is a 16-\u00adbed facility with a focus on persons who are uninsured or who cannot obtain services from other providers. The program provides a broad range of services including medication management, individual and group therapy, occupational therapy, and recreational interventions. CHAPTER 8 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE97CHAPTER 8 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE LMHAs are the sub-State administrative and direct care component for the delivery and coordination of mental health services across the state. They are responsible for service coordination, care and case management, linkages with other agencies for service needs such as housing and entitlements, program development and management, utilization review and quality management and community relations. LMHA 's develop, maintain and manage a comprehensive system of mental health treatment, support services and rehabilitative services for the 23 DMHAS-designated \"Catchment Areas\" spread across five geographic \"Regions\" , thus creating local systems of services. DMHAS has implemented statewide, the evidence-based practice, Integrated Dual Disorder Treatment (IDDT), for people who have co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders in mental health treatment settings. Integrated dual disorders treatment differs from traditional approaches in several ways. The most important is integration of mental health and substance abuse treatments. One practitioner or one team in one agency provides both mental health and substance abuse treatments so that the consumer does not get lost, excluded, or confused going back and forth between two different programs. A number of State-operated and non-profit providers are actively engaged in this initiative. 8.5.1.4 Community-Based Residential Adult Services DMHAS defines residential services as services that provide engagement interventions, an array of skill building activities, and numerous opportunities to participate in integrated community organizations and activities to facilitate recovery and develop a personal recovery support system. Residential services include group homes and supervised apartments. Group Homes are congregate community residences that are staffed 24 hours a day/7 days a week that provide a set of residential and rehabilitative services. Group Homes are intended primarily as a step-down service from in-patient hospitalization. Supervised Housing provides recovery-oriented services 24 hours a day/7 days a week. Adult residential mental health services in a private, free-standing setting can be offered under one of the following State licensure categories: 8.5.1.4.1 Mental Health Residential Living Centers Currently 21 providers hold a Mental Health Residential Living Center license (Inventory Table 15), which pursuant to the Connecticut Public Health Code, is a supervised, structured and supportive group living arrangement that includes psychosocial rehabilitation services and may also include assistance in obtaining necessary community services to persons in need of mental health services. Four of the 21 licensed sites are located in New Haven. The towns of Bridgeport, Middletown, New Britain, Norwalk, and Waterbury are each the location for two licensed facility sites. 8.5.1.4.2 Private Free-standing Community Residences Currently five providers hold a Private Free-standing Community Residence license (Inventory Table 16), which pursuant to the Connecticut Public Health Code, is a residence for up to eight mentally ill adults as defined in section 19a-507a(3) of the Connecticut General Statutes. 988.5.1.5 Community-Based Outpatient Adult Services DMHAS defines outpatient services as services which are professionally directed and include evaluations and diagnostic assessments, bio-psycho social histories including identification of strengths and recovery supports, a synthesis of the assessments and history that results in the identification of treatment goals, treatment activities and interventions, and recovery services. Such services include individual, group, and family therapy, and medication management. Pursuant to State facility licensing laws, adult outpatient mental health services in a private, free-standing setting can be offered under one of two licensure categories, Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic for Adults or Mental Health Day Treatment. 8.5.1.5.1 Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic for Adults Under this licensure category, a facility may provide evaluation, diagnosis, and ambulatory treatment to individuals who have mental, emotional or behavioral problems, disturbances, dysfunctions or disorders as defined in the most recent edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association. Currently 205 providers hold a Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic for Adults license (see Inventory Table 17 for listing). Almost half of them are located in seven large Connecticut cities (26 service locations in Hartford, 20 in New Haven, 20 in Bridgeport, 11 in Waterbury, 10 in New Britain, 8 in Stamford, and 7 in Norwalk). Within the provision of outpatient treatment is a subcomponent called Intensive Outpatient, which is often a part of a patient's overall continuum of care. Some of the providers holding a Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic for Adults license are Community Health Centers. Many of Connecticut's Community Health Centers provide primary care, dental care and behavioral health services. Most general hospitals provide some level of outpatient mental health services, but they are not separately licensed as such. 8.5.1.5.2 Mental Health Day Treatment Under this licensure category, a facility may provide evaluation, diagnosis and ambulatory treatment services for individuals who are experiencing mental, emotional or behavioral problems, disturbances, dysfunctions or disorders as defined in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association and whose unit of service to each client is a minimum of 4 hours and a maximum of 12 hours. Currently twelve providers hold a Mental Health Day Treatment license for 18 Mental Health Day Treatment service locations throughout the state (see Inventory Table 18 for listing). All but one of the providers also hold one or more Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic for Adults licenses. Most general hospitals may provide some level of outpatient mental health services, including day treatment services, but they are not separately licensed as such. 8.5.1.6 Other Providers of Mental Health Services 8.5.1.6.1 Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Mental Retardation (ICF/MRs)157 An Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Mental Retardation (ICF/MR) is a facility that participates in the optional Medicaid program under Section 1905(d) of the Social Security Act. The facilities provide a protected residential setting that includes ongoing evaluation, planning, 24-hour supervision, coordination and integration of health, rehabilitative services and active treatment for individuals with mental retardation or related conditions. The purpose is to enable each individual to function at his/her greatest ability level. A total of 925 certified beds are within the facilities certified for participation in the ICF/MR program (Inventory Table 19). 8.5.2 SUBSTANCE USE OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT 8.5.2.1 Discussion of Substance Use Treatment and Demand Overall, it is estimated that less than 17% of adults in need of substance use treatment seek such services in Connecticut annually. Table 8.2 below shows an estimation of the statewide and regional population needing treatment and the estimation of the statewide and regional population seeking treatment for alcohol and illicit drug dependence and abuse.158 157Other than this discussion on ICF/MRs, this plan does not touch upon the service lines for persons with developmental disabilities. 158 The Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services requested and received Connecticut-specific data (rates of alcohol and illicit drug dependence and abuse) from SAMHSA 's Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. From that data, researchers at the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC) calculated both state and regional estimates of population needing treatment and population seeking treatment using the 2010 United States Census. CHAPTER 8 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE99CHAPTER 8 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE It is further estimated that about 10,500 adults are injecting drug users (cocaine, heroin), representing 3.7% of Connecticut's total population in need of treatment.159 According to The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), Connecticut's rate of unmet need for alcohol and/ or illicit drug abuse or dependence has remained between 9% and 10% over the last 7 years. This includes persons ages 12 and older (adolescents and adults). Connecticut's 2008-2009 rate of unmet need for alcohol and/or illicit drug abuse or dependence was 9.8%. This represented a slight increase, though not statistically significant, from the 2002/2003 estimate of 8.8%. Unmet treatment need increased slightly for both young adults and those age 26 and older but decreased for the 12-17 year-old population from 8.95% to 7.82%. Connecticut's rate of unmet treatment need for illicit drugs for the 12 and older population was 2.55 and highest for young adults (ages 18 to 25) at 7.86%. The overall 2008-2009 treatment gap was a drop from Connecticut's 2002-2003 estimated rate of 2.81%, which held true in all age groups, but changes were not statistically significant. 160 8.5.2.2 Substance Use Treatment Facilities or Services for Adults, Children and Adolescents For purposes of this chapter, the familiar term \"substance abuse treatment\" is not used as the industry itself has started to move away from this terminology. Instead, the words substance use disorder or substance use treatment will generally be used to reflect current industry trends. Substance use treatment facilities in the state include those for adults, adolescents, and children as the laws and procedures in the state generally combine the adult and child services for licensure purposes. The staffing skills needed for substance use treatment and prevention for children and adolescents, however, are particularly distinct from those of adults. In addition, there are some residential programs, clinics, and in-home programs funded by the Department of Children and Families that primarily serve youth with substance use disorders. 8.5.2.2.1 Hospital-Operated Facilities: Short-Term General Hospitals Many short-term private or public general hospitals also provide inpatient and outpatient services for the treatment of substance use or substance addiction. All 30 of the short-term general or children's general hospitals had substance use treatment discharges from FY 2008 to FY 2010, according to inpatient discharge data reported to OHCA 's inpatient discharge database. 159 University of Connecticut Health Center researchers used a combined methodology that included current heroin and cocaine injecting drug users as reported to DMHAS' client information system and application of a SAMHSA study that provided a national estimate of 0.18% of the general population age 12 and older. 160 The National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

Natchaug Hospital provides these services to all ages, and Silver Hill Hospital provides these services to adolescents and to adults. 8.5.2.2.3 State-Operated Inpatient Facilities and Local Mental Health Authorities DMHAS-operated facilities, including Connecticut Valley Hospital and Connecticut Mental Health Center, provide substance use treatment on an inpatient or outpatient basis. CVH operates programs at its Middletown (Merritt Hall) and Hartford (Blue Hills Hospital) locations for both inpatient detoxification and rehabilitation services, with a total of 152 beds. CMHC, serving the greater New Haven area, provides only outpatient substance use treatment services through its Substance Abuse Treatment Unit. Greater Bridgeport Mental Health Center has a 20 bed inpatient unit for persons with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders. 8.5.2.2.4 Community-Based Residential Adult Services and Community-Based Outpatient Services Residential services, such as residential detoxification programs and residential rehabilitation programs, are available for persons being treated for or recovering from substance use disorders. Residential detoxification is medical management of the withdrawal from alcohol and drugs along with case management linkages to treatment. Residential rehabilitation is treatment services in a structured, therapeutic environment for individuals who need assistance in developing and establishing a drug-free lifestyle in recovery. Such services include various levels of residential care, from intensive to long term. 161 Community-based residential adult services and community-based outpatient services are licensed by DPH under the licensure category Facility for the Care or Treatment of Substance Abusive or Dependent Persons (\"FCTSADP\"). This license is required for outpatient substance use treatment services in a private, free-standing setting, and covers a broad range of services. According to the Connecticut Public Health Code, 162 this type of facility may provide ambulatory chemical detoxification treatment or care and rehabilitation, chemical maintenance treatment, day or evening treatment, intensive treatment, intermediate and long term treatment, medical triage, outpatient treatment or residential detoxification and evaluation to substance abusive or dependent persons. Currently 199 providers hold an FCTSADP license in Connecticut (see Inventory Table 20 for listing). Over 50% of the licensed FCTSADP locations or service sites are in eight large Connecticut cities (24 service locations in Hartford, 18 in New Haven, 17 in Bridgeport, 14 in Waterbury, 10 in New Britain, 8 in New London and 7 in both Middletown and Stamford). Many of these providers also hold mental health service licenses. Providers holding both licenses can provide services to the patients experiencing co-occurring disorders. 8.5.2.2.5 Other Information Related to Substance Use Treatment Categorization and Criteria Another method of categorization of inpatient, residential and outpatient services which is more reflective of the service industry is by Type of Care listed in the most recent N-SSATS Profile for Connecticut. N-SSATS is the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.

Some provide these services within dedicated inpatient behavioral health programs. 8.5.3.2 Hospital-Operated Facilities: Hospitals for Mentally Ill Persons Of the three Hospitals for Mentally Ill Persons, Natchaug Hospital and Silver Hill Hospital provide various levels of mental health treatment services to children and adolescents. 8.5.3.3 The Department of Children and Families The Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF) was established to provide a spectrum of behavioral health services, child protection and family services, juvenile justice services, substance abuse-related services, education services and prevention services. DCF serves approximately 36,000 children and 16,000 families across its programs each year. DCF has five mandated areas: Child Welfare, Children's Behavioral Health, Adolescent Substance Use, Juvenile Services, and Prevention. DCF-operated facilities for children and adolescents are shown in Table 8.4.Category Type of Care within that Category Number of Facilities that provide this level of careb Outpatient Regular 120 Intensive 76 Day treatment/partial hospitalization 30 Detoxification 30 Methadone/buprenorphine 31 Non-\u00adHospital Residential Short-\u00adTerm 17 Long Term 39 Detoxification 3 Hospital Inpatient Treatment 12 Detoxification 16 163 American Society of Addiction Medicine.

DCF is mandated to license, monitor and evaluate certain services provided by private and community providers. The following are DCF licensure categories: 8.5.3.3.1 Outpatient Psychiatric Clinics For Children Sixty-three facilities (Inventory Table 21) hold this license, which is for a community-based facility providing mental health services to children and adolescents under 18 years of age and their families. These services are designed to: (A) promote mental health and improve functioning in children, youth and families; and (B) effectively decrease the prevalence and incidence of mental illness, emotional disturbance and social dysfunction. 8.5.3.3.2 Extended Day Treatment Facilities Twenty facilities (Inventory Table 21) hold this license, which is for a supplementary care community-based program providing a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach to treatment and rehabilitation of emotionally disturbed, mentally ill, behaviorally disordered or multiply handicapped children and youth during the hours immediately before and after school while they reside with their parents or surrogate family.164 8.5.3.3.3 Child Caring Facilities One hundred thirty-two facilities (Inventory Table 21, which was current through October 2011) hold this license, which is for a congregate residential setting for the out-of-home placement of children or youth under 18 years of age. Within the general term, child caring facilities are the following sub-categorizations (Table 8.5).Table 8.4: DCF-Operated Facilities in Connecticut 164 Except any such program provided by a regional educational service center established in accordance with Section 10-66a of the Connecticut General Statutes.The Alfr ed J.

PRTF is not a DPH or DCF licensure category but a designation for any non-hospital facility with a provider agreement with a State Medicaid Agency (the Connecticut Department of Social Services) to provide the inpatient services benefit to Medicaid-eligible individuals under the age of 21. 165 8.5.3.4.2 Intensive In-Home Services Although not a DCF licensure category, this service type demonstrates a shift in focus from residential and facility-based care toward community-based services. DCF and DSS (Medicaid) fund an array of intensive family-based behavioral health and substance abuse services in the home and community where families are living. This service type in Connecticut includes several evidence-based treatment models (e.g., Multi-Systemic Therapy, Functional Family Therapy, Multi-Dimensional Family Therapy). These models and services require certification from DCF and DSS to qualify for Medicaid reimbursement. 8.6 OTHER INITIATIVES OR INFORMATION SOURCES IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ENVIRONMENT Several State, federal and private programs collect information and report on Connecticut's mental health and/or substance use treatment environment.

This relationship is a significant effort and growing trend that has been and will likely continue to be emphasized in the health care industry. This is not just an effort or trend being seen on a state level but is a national emphasis. As can be seen in both the primary care and behavioral health chapters, including the recommendations of the subcommittees, these two areas are in many ways already interrelated. Many of the primary care providers, including community health centers and school based health centers, provide some level of behavioral health as a service component. Likewise, many behavioral health providers include a primary care component of its service line to address the basic needs of its patients. HRSA (the US Health Resources and Services Administration), indicates 172 that \"Nearly 70% of HRSA-supported health centers provide mental health counseling and treatment; almost 40% provide substance abuse counseling and treatment and close to 20% offer 24-hour crisis intervention services. \" SAMHSA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, indicates 173 that it has \"taken a primary role in the promotion and adoption of primary and behavioral health care integration nationwide through a number of different initiatives, including Section 2703 of the Affordable Care Act, which allows states to establish health homes through their Medicaid program, the establishment and awarding of primary and behavioral health care integration grants nationwide, and the establishment of the SAMHSA - HRSA Center for Integrated Health Solutions\" . The Center for Integrated Health Solutions \"promotes the development of integrated primary and behavioral health services, whether seen in specialty behavioral health or primary provider settings. \" Further, the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ) has established a National Academy for Integrating Mental Health and Primary Care. In 2008, AHRQ released a report entitled Integration of Mental Health/Substance Abuse and Primary Care; in 2009, the National Council for Community Behavioral Health released a report entitled \"Behavioral Health/Primary Care Integration and the Person-Centered Healthcare Home\"; and in 2010, the Millbank Memorial Fund commissioned a report entitled \"Evolving Models of Behavioral Health Integration in Primary Care\" . These are but a few references demonstrating this growing emphasis on efforts to study or promote integration efforts. This shows that the integration of these areas of health care service provision has been and will likely continue to be studied and emphasized going forward for Connecticut and the nation. Although OHCA established separate subcommittees for these two areas and has prepared separate chapters for this first iteration of the plan, it does try to show that there are current and growing interrelationships between these fields of health care services.Many of the primary care providers, including community health centers and school based health centers, provide some level of behavioral health as a service component. Likewise, many behavioral health providers include a primary care component of its service line to address the basic needs of its patients. 172 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Connecticut General Statutes Section 19a-639(10) provides the definition of a health care facility for Certificate of Need purposes. Outpatient Clinics are not contained within that definition. Consequently, Outpatient Clinics do not require Certificate of Need approval. In addition, primary care services provided by a licensed private practitioner do not require Certificate of Need approval. However, as provided by subsection (a) of Section 19a-638, the termination of hospital operated primary care services generally require Certificate of Need authorization. 9.2 SERVICE INTRODUCTION This section of the plan contains information on what primary care facilities and services, especially safety net services, are readily available and accessible in local communities statewide; identifies gaps in services and unmet need; provides an inventory of on-going public and private initiatives to address gaps in services and unmet need; and recommends areas that may benefit from a policy change or further investigations for future versions of the Plan. For the purposes of this Plan, primary care is that care provided by licensed independent practitioners specifically trained for and skilled in comprehensive first contact and continuing to address personal health care needs including but not limited to: prevention, care of chronic illness and routine care and not limited by problem origin (biological, behavioral, or social), organ system or diagnosis. 174 Identifying primary care providers and describing the nature of their services are integral to defining primary care.175 Designing a comprehensive system of primary care in which the role of other health care professionals is clearly defined facilitates efficient allocation of resources and increases access to quality and effective care. Most health care practitioners in any setting provide some primary care related service. But a primary care practitioner is distinctly one with whom a patient makes first contact and serves as a personal clinician who continues to diagnose, treat and educate the patient to meet most of his/her health care needs and maintain wellness in an outpatient setting within the community. The care is not episodic in nature and involves the widest scope of health care. In Connecticut, the legislatively mandated Statewide Primary Care Access Authority (SPCAA), in its 2010 report to the General Assembly, defined primary care practitioners to include physicians with specialties in family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, homeopathic medicine and naturopathy, advance practice registered nurses, licensed nurse midwives, and physician assistants. 176 The range of health care conditions a primary care practitioner may diagnose, treat and educate patients on and the associated services provided to patients includes: Comprehensive preventive care such as infant/child, adolescent and adult preventative care, immunization services, screenings for cancers, health promotion counseling including injury prevention, tobacco/drug counseling, heart disease prevention; Treatment of common acute illnesses such as those that are urologic or gynecologic in nature or infectious; Providing ongoing treatment of common chronic diseases that may be cardiovascular, rheumatoid arthritis, acne, gastrointestinal or genitourinary; Providing on-going treatment for common behavioral problems such as depression, anxiety disorder, substance abuse and other problems such as stress and grief reaction; and Other services such as community/public health services, consultant care coordination, comprehensive health assessment and patient education. 177 174 Developed by the Statewide Health Care Facilities and Services Plan Advisory Board's Primary Care Subcommittee utilizing American Academy of Family Physicians' guidelines.

Journal of American Medical Association , Vol. 271, No 19. 1149.3 OVERVIEW OF PRIMARY CARE DELIVERY IN CONNECTICUT People with health insurance coverage are most likely to access primary care services on a regular basis. For the underinsured and uninsured, with the enactment of the PPACA, it is predicted that with the planned coverage expansion through Medicaid and premium assistance, there will be an increase in primary care services accessed. This, together with an increasingly aging population in poor health, implies rising demand for health care services in Connecticut.178 At least 89% of Connecticut's 3.5 million residents had health insurance coverage in the last 5 years.179 Generally, health insurance coverage was either privately funded, i.e., employer-sponsored (67%), or individually or directly purchased (10%), or government-funded, i.e., Medicare, Medicaid or Military (26%).180 Most health care plans available through these sources require beneficiaries to have a personal primary care practitioner to diagnose, treat, educate and coordinate the services they access under the plans. The majority of the insured, particularly the privately insured and those with Medicare coverage, obtain their care in primary care practitioner offices or practices. In contrast the uninsured and Medicaid beneficiaries generally obtain their primary care services at a safety net provider facility such as a community health center, outpatient clinic or hospital emergency department. 181 For purposes of this Plan, a primary care practice is one that employs at least one primary care practitioner who is responsible for all the primary care needs of all the practice's patients. In Connecticut, a primary care practice, office, clinic or group may be operated under a clinician's license, the license of a general or children's general hospital or a broad outpatient clinic license category. 182 DPH is the licensing authority and does not have a separate license category for primary care practices or clinics. 9.4 PRIMARY CARE SERVICES PROVIDED IN FACILITY SETTINGS Below are descriptions of the primary care practice settings and the populations they serve in Connecticut. Where available, office locations, hours of operation, populations served and services provided are listed for each setting in the companion document, the Inventory of Health Care Facilities, Services and Equipment. The five main categories of primary care facilities covered in this section based on DPH health care provider license types or patient populations are: 1. Primary care practitioner offices/practices; 2. Primary care providers licensed as outpatient clinics;3. Hospital operated primary care centers/clinics; 4. Limited primary care services providers; and 5. Federal government primary care clinics. 9.4.1 PRIMARY CARE PRACTITIONER OFFICES/PRACTICES Over two-thirds of the US population receives their primary care services from a primary care practitioner (PCP) who operates in a solo office/practice, in a single-specialty or multispecialty group practice.183 Most of these offices/practices are operated under the individual license of a clinical practitioner as permitted by law. A few practitioners operate urgent care/walk-in, retail or free clinics, each of which is discussed later in this section. 178 According to U.S. Census Bureau's population projections, the number of Connecticut residents 65 and over is expected to grow from 13.8% of the total population in 2000 to 21.5% in 2030. In 2010, residents in the same age group were three times more likely than the general population to be in poor to fair health. 179U.S. Census Current Population Survey (CPS) estimates. 180Percentages do not add up to 89% because individuals may have multiple sources of health insurance coverage. 181 Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.

Two potential sources for obtaining the information are through a statewide survey or an all-payer claims database (APCD). The DPH Connecticut Primary Care Office (PCO)184 is in the process of administering a survey of primary care practitioners. Also, the Governor has created a multi-payer claims data workgroup which is in the process of developing an APCD for Connecticut. The legislature also lent support to this concept recently by passing Public Act 12-166, which requires the Office of Health Reform and Innovation (OHRI) to plan, implement and administer the APCD. Each of the health insurance plans authorized by the Connecticut Department of Insurance (DOI) to be sold in the state has a dedicated phone line and/or a web-enabled database to assist beneficiaries in locating primary care practitioners and other health care practitioners. Population served : Mostly people with health insurance coverage or the self-pay. Some practices offer discounted or free services to the underinsured, uninsured and/or Medicaid beneficiaries. Potential patients have to contact individual practices to determine if they are accepting new patients, a particular health insurance plan or payment type. To access: To purchase a health plan and/or find a primary care practitioner in its network, visit the DOI's webpage http://www.ct.gov/cid/cwp/view.asp?a=1272&Q=480608 for a current list of health plans and contact information. 9.4.2 PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS LICENSED AS OUTPATIENT CLINICS The DPH's license category Outpatient Clinics Operated by Corporations or Municipalities covers a wide range of health care facilities. This license covers outpatient clinics, other than those operated by a hospital, which provide ambulatory medical or dental care for diagnosis, treatment and care of persons with chronic or acute conditions which do not require overnight care, or for preventive and maintenance of health services for well persons.185 This section identifies the facilities that are primary care providers as defined in this Plan. 9.4.2.1 Community Health Centers/Federally Qualified Health Centers (CHCs/FQHCs) Community health centers (CHCs) are licensed outpatient clinics. Under the State's administrative regulations and Public Health Code (PHC), federal statutes and regulations, CHCs are defined as public or private non-profit health care facilities located in areas which have demonstrated medical need based on geography, demographics and economic factors. Typically, CHCs are safety net providers and serve as access points especially for the poor, medically underserved populations and areas, and those at risk for poor health status. CHCs provide care to all patients regardless of health insurance status, on a sliding fee schedule based on federal poverty level, family income and size. To ensure that a CHC is responsive to the needs of the community, it is mandated to be governed by a community board of directors, the majority of whom are required to be active registered clients of the center and representative of the race and ethnicity of the population(s) served. CHCs provide comprehensive, culturally appropriate primary care, behavioral health and/or dental health care services in medically underserved areas, and enabling 186 services in some locations. Core services that CHCs provide directly to patients or through contractual or cooperative agreements include: preventive and primary care; diagnostic services (lab and x-ray); family planning; prenatal and perinatal care; well child care and immunizations; screening for elevated blood levels, communicable diseases, and cholesterol; eye, ear and dental screening for children; preventive dental services; emergency medical and dental services; hospitalization; and pharmacy services. 184A description of PCO and its responsibilities are provided in a later section of this chapter. 185Connecticut Administrative Regulations and Public Health Code Sections 19-13-D45 to D53. 186For example, translation, transportation, case management, staff training, and education and health promotion services.116A CHC that receives grants under Section 330 of the Federal Public Health Service Act and is certified to receive cost-based reimbursements for treating Medicare and Medicaid patients is referred to as a federally qualified health center (FQHC). A FQHC look-alike meets all the requirements as grant-funded FQHC but does not receive Section 330 federal grant funding.187 There are 14 FQHC corporations in Connecticut.188 Except for Community Health Center, Inc., the remaining FQHCs are also members of the state's Primary Care Association (PCA), the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut (CHCACT). In addition to core CHC services the federal government requires FQHCs to offer: Behavioral health care; Cancer and other disease screening; Referrals to specialty care and hospital services; Medicaid eligibility services; Services that enable patients to access services e.g. transportation, translation, case management, home visitation and health education; After hours coverage including early morning, evening and weekend hours; Written contractual agreements and referral agreements with providers of required services the center does not provide; Physical location near a major road or public transportation for easy access; Appropriate mix of services for target population; Establishment and regular update of health care goals and objectives to address priority needs of the target population; and A medical director and appropriately licensed clinicians. Population served : CHCs accept all patients, with particular focus on poor, underserved, persons at risk for poor health, Medicaid beneficiaries, migrant farmers, the homeless, or the uninsured. CHCs served as the family doctor and medical home for over 8% of the state's population in 2010. In 2010, federally supported health center corporations with their 175 delivery sites served almost 300,000 patients. The patients were low-income residents, that is the poor below 100% (67%) and 200% (94%) of federal Medicaid (58%); Hispanic/Latinos (46%); African Americans (26%); rural residents (23%); over 1,300 seasonal farmworkers; and 15,000 homeless patients. 189 To Access: See Inventory Table 22 for the locations of Connecticut's CHC delivery sites. 9.4.2.2 School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) School based health centers (SBHCs) are free-standing medical centers, licensed by the Connecticut DPH as outpatient clinics or as hospital satellite clinics, located within or on the grounds of schools. Often, a school may partner with a community health center, hospital or local health department to operate the clinic. 190 SBHCs are safety net providers operated under the guidance of a medical director and staffed by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in caring for children and/or adolescents. The most common disciplines staffing SBHCs include nurse practitioners, physician assistants, physicians, social workers, dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, outreach workers, nutritionists and health educators. 191 SBHCs offer comprehensive services to address medical, mental and oral health needs of students in grades pre-K through 12. All students are eligible but require written parental permission to access services. Services are available during school hours throughout the academic year, from September through June, excluding weekends, holidays and school vacations. Some sites provide services year-round. 187 Designated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). 188United Community and Family Services in Norwich does not receive Section 330 grant funds. 189 National Association of Community Health Centers.

CHAPTER 9 PRIMARY CARE117CHAPTER 9 PRIMARY CARE All SBHCs provide, at the minimum, primary and preventative care services in accordance with federal and American Academy of Pediatrics standards. They include: Physical exams/health assessments/screenings for health problems; Diagnosis and treatment of acute illness and injury; Diagnosis and management of chronic illness; Immunizations; Health promotion and risk reduction; Nutrition and weight management; Reproductive health care; Laboratory tests; Prescription and/or dispensing of medication for treatment; and Referral and follow-up for specialty care that is beyond the scope of services they provide. SBHCs also provide mental health services, social services, and health education in accordance to the following prescribed standards; 1. Mental Health/Social Services 192: Services must be provided in accordance with nationally recognized and accepted standards such as the Child Welfare League of America or the National Association of Social Workers, Inc. Other nationally recognized and accepted standards may be utilized as a framework for professional practice with prior DPH approval. M ental health/social services provided include: Assessment, diagnosis and treatment of psychological, social and emotional problems; Crisis intervention; Individual, family and group counseling or referral for same if indicated; Substance abuse and HIV/AIDS prevention; Risk reduction and early intervention services; Outreach to students at risk; Support and/or psycho-educational groups focusing on topics of importance to the target population; Advocacy and referral for such services as day care, housing, employment, job training, etc.; Consultation to school staff and parents regarding issues of child and adolescent growth and development; and Referral and follow-up for care that is beyond the scope of services provided in the SBHC. 2. Health Education Services: Services must be supportive of existing health education activities of state and local education agencies including: Consultation to school staff regarding issues of child and adolescent growth and development; School staff and parent training regarding issues of importance in target population; Individual and group health education; and Classroom presentations. 192 Mental health treatment services provided in the school based health center setting is licensed by the Department of Children and Families for services to children seventeen years of age and younger and by the Department of Public Health for adults eighteen years of age and older. Substance abuse treatment services provided in the school based health center setting is licensed by the Department of Public Health. Refer to Chapter 8 for a discussion on behavioral health care.1183. Oral Health Services: Some SBHCs provide oral health on-site or in partnership with community dental programs. If provided, services conform with nationally recognized and accepted standards such as those recommended by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.193 Other nationally recognized and accepted standards may be utilized as a framework for professional practice, with prior DPH approval. Services may include: Screenings; Prophylaxis; Fissure sealants; behavioral Diagnostic X-rays; Treatment for carries; Simple extractions; and Referral and follow-up for care that is beyond the scope of services provided in the SBHC. There are a total of 121 SBHCs located in 22 towns statewide, serving over 44,000 students annually. 194, 195 Many of these sites receive programmatic funding from DPH. Population served : Students in grades pre-K to 12 authorized by a parent or guardian to access services at the SBHC. SBHCs accept all student patients with particular focus on the poor, the underserved, those at-risk for poor health, Medicaid, children of migrant farmers, the homeless and the uninsured. To Access: See Inventory Table 23 for the location of Connecticut's SBHCs. 9.4.2.3 Free Clinics Free or charitable clinics are tax-exempt facilities licensed by DPH as outpatient clinics and are \"volunteer-based, safety net health organizations that provide a range of medical, dental, pharmacy, vision and/or behavioral health services to economically disadvantaged individuals, \"196 predominantly uninsured. While CHCs/FQHCs and hospitals are well known as safety net providers, the contributions of free clinics tend to be overlooked. Free clinics are expected to respond to unmet need not accommodated by safety net providers, even since passage of the PPACA. Free clinics are mostly independent entities, operating in owned or leased facilities, mostly funded through private charitable donations from civic groups, churches, foundations and business organizations with some affiliated with hospitals. Clinic staff consists of paid employees and volunteers who tend to be physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers and psychologists. 197 Free clinics in the state offer scheduled and walk-in appointments to a broad range of quality services that include adult and pediatric medical care, chronic disease management, reproductive health services, screenings and health education, dental care, dispensing medication directly to patients or through local pharmacies, referrals to specialty care, laboratory services and some on/off site testing or procedures. 198 Connecticut has eight free clinics with 12 provision sites. In 2010, the clinics treated nearly 6,000 patients in over 15,000 visits while operating between 12 and 38 hours per week. Over 600 volunteers, including over 130 primary care providers, staffed the clinics. Population served: The uninsured or underinsured, people with low-income, racial/ethnic minorities, non-citizens, people with low English proficiency and the homeless. To Access: New patients are screened based on insurance status, income, and residency before qualifying to receive care.

The facilities manage a specific condition or set of conditions, including, chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These facilities provide primary care services to specialized populations such as the chronically ill, pregnant women, lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender residents and HIV/AIDS patients. Members of these populations have such special needs or cannot easily access primary care services in other settings either because of their condition or the unavailability/inaccessibility of alternatives. The limited or special populations clinics are included in the Plan to ensure available primary care services are not underrepresented. Population served : An insured or uninsured special or limited population. Potential patients have to contact the facilities directly to determine if the facility is accepting new patients and the accepted sources of payment.To Access: See Inventory Table 24 for the location of limited or special populations' clinics. 9.4.3 HOSPITAL-OPERATED PRIMARY CARE CENTERS/CLINICS Hospitals across the state provide a significant amount of primary care services through outpatient clinics, physician-based practices and foundations and rapid or urgent care services (a level below emergency care). Their medical staffs are organized into areas of care, including various primary care disciplines. Some hospitals have specialty services and clinics to address specific primary care needs based on condition or disease processes. Additionally, hospitals play a vital role in ensuring that all patients have access and education about primary (and, where appropriate, specialty) care services. Hospitals provide all patients who come to the emergency department with assessment and appropriate treatment and needed follow-up care or referral for services. Hospitals are a vital resource for information and assistance in locating ongoing services, including primary care services. Some primary care practices are hospital owned and operated or are affiliated and may be located on or off hospital campuses. Hospital-affiliated practices have complex relationships with the host hospitals, such as \"aligned\" but operated under a separate federal tax identification number. 199 Some groups, which have admitting privileges to the hospital but no other direct affiliation, are not covered in this plan. Services provided at hospital operated primary care clinics may include: Comprehensive preventive care (prenatal care, immunizations, cancer screening, infant/child/adolescent/adult/ elderly preventive care, physical exams and health assessments); Diagnosis and treatment of common acute illnesses; Diagnosis and ongoing treatment of chronic illnesses; Diagnosis and ongoing treatment of common behavioral health problems; Counseling; Health promotion; Patient education; Care coordination; and Referrals to other health care professionals. Of the 22 hospitals that responded to the survey, 200 12 hospitals provide these primary care services under their hospital license and tax identification number, at 26 on- or off-campus locations. Ten hospitals provide primary care services through an affiliate, such as an aligned physician practice group rather than as departments within the hospital, or do not provide any primary care services. Populations served : Vary from location to location, including all ages, newborns, infants, children, adolescents, adults, elderly, pregnant women, uninsured. To Access: Location and hours of operations for hospital-based primary care offices are provided in Inventory Table 25. 199 Includes practices such as Western CT Medical Group, Bristol Hospital Multispecialty Group, UConn Medical Group, L&M Physician Association, MidState Medical Group, Norwalk Hospital Physicians and Surgeons and Franklin Medical Group. 200 With the assistance of the Advisory Body's Primary Care Subcommittee, OHCA administered a survey to all 30 hospitals to identify those that provide primary care services under their hospital licenses and tax identification number. 1209.4.4 LIMITED PRIMARY CARE SERVICES PROVIDERS Health care facilities that provide episodic care and a limited range of primary care services to patients are also under the DPH outpatient clinic license. This category consists of urgent care centers, school infirmaries, clinics operated by municipalities, dental, well-child and family planning clinics. Retail or store-based clinics are limited primary care services providers, but they are not licensed facilities. 9.4.4.1 Urgent Care/Walk-in Clinics201 Urgent care/walk-in clinics provide medical diagnosis and treatment for minor illnesses and conditions that do not require immediate attention such as injuries. They may provide vaccinations, physical examinations and ancillary services which may include x-ray and laboratory services. Usually, such clinics offer extended hours beyond the core working hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., unlike primary practitioner offices or practices; do not require an appointment as needed to see a PCP; and provide services with shorter wait periods than usually experienced in a hospital emergency department (ED) for similar conditions. However, urgent care/walk-in clinics are not accessible 24 hours a day and seven (7) days a week and not subject to the Federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). Urgent care or walk-in clinics provide a limited scope of services, which are episodic in nature compared to full service primary care providers such as PCPs and CHCs. They may be operated under the license of a primary care practitioner, an outpatient clinic, a hospital, or as a hospital satellite. Under State regulations and the Public Health Code, urgent care centers licensed as outpatient clinics must be operated by a medical director and a staff of qualified health care professionals. Population served: Insured and self-pay patients of all ages with minor illnesses or conditions that do not require immediate attention.To Access: See Inventory Table 26 for the location of Connecticut licensed urgent care/walk-in clinics. The web link http://www.healthcare311.com/ also provides contact information for a list of urgent care, walk-in clinics and retail clinics in various Connecticut communities. 9.4.4.2 Retail or Store-Based Health Clinics No retail, store-based, minute or convenience care clinics are licensed as outpatient clinics in Connecticut. They are operated under the individual licenses of clinical practitioners, usually a nurse practitioner or physician assistant, who may or may not have an established relationship with a physician in the community. Retail clinics are usually based in a pharmacy or a supermarket and provide episodic care for the most common diagnoses that do not require immediate treatment (headaches, coughs, fever, nasal congestion and fever) and preventive care such as health screening, vaccinations and physical examinations. Population served: Insured and self-pay patients of all ages, with minor illnesses or conditions that do not require immediate attention. To Access: The web link http://www.healthcare311.com/ provides contact information for a list of retail or store based health clinics in Connecticut communities. 9.4.4.3 Licensed Outpatient Clinics Operated by Municipalities Outpatient clinics operated by municipalities are authorized to provide ambulatory medical or dental care for diagnosis, treatment and care of persons with chronic or acute conditions which do not require overnight care, or medical or dental care to well persons including preventive services and maintenance of health. Currently, the 14 licensed facilities provide limited primary care services to residents of their communities. A list of clinics operated by municipalities and locations are provided in Inventory Table 26. 9.4.4.4 Infirmary Operated by an Educational Institution Outpatient facilities licensed by DPH as school infirmaries and operated by educational institutions are not the same as school based health centers. Though their scope of services may lend itself to primary care, e.g. asthma, diabetes care 201Urgent Care Association of America. (2012). About Urgent Care. Retrieved from http://www.ucaoa.org/index.phpCHAPTER 9 PRIMARY CARE121CHAPTER 9 PRIMARY CARE and observation stays on college campuses and private schools, the care is not comprehensive or continuous and is provided to a limited population. The infirmary license allows a practitioner of the healing arts to provide care, treatment and overnight accommodation to students, faculty and employees for medical conditions that do not require the staff skill level and equipment of a hospital. A list of 19 licensed school infirmaries and their locations is provided in Inventory Table 26. 9.4.4.5 Well Child Clinics Currently, 15 well child clinics are operated in Connecticut primarily by visiting nurse associations and municipalities. These facilities are licensed by DPH as outpatient clinics. A list of the clinics is provided in Inventory Table 26. 9.4.4.6 Family Planning Clinics There are 21 family planning clinics licensed by DPH as outpatient clinics. Family planning clinics provide reproductive health care services for males and females, including clinical exams, contraception information and prescriptions, emergency contraception, pregnancy testing and counseling, STD and HIV testing and counseling, and other reproductive health services. Some sites provide pregnancy termination services. A list of the clinics is provided in Inventory Table 26. 9.4.5 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRIMARY CARE CLINICS The federal government operates a small number of facilities that provide health care service to a limited and specific population. Patients include veterans of the United States armed forces, their dependents and survivors, active service men and their dependents residing on military bases; and the federal prison population. The U.S. Veteran Affairs Veterans Health Administration (USVHA) runs the V A Connecticut Healthcare System which has a hospital campus and six community based outpatient clinics that provide a variety of services. The federal government also operates a Naval Branch Health Clinic in Groton and a medical clinic at the Coast Guard Academy in New London. Federally operated facilities are noted here to indicate they are part of the overall health care environment serving residents of the state; however, no additional information is provided on them in this plan. 9.5 EVALUATION OF UNMET NEED AND GAPS IN SERVICES Identifying the settings or access points for primary care services is important for policymaking on health status assessments and improvements. To evaluate unmet need and identify gaps in services, it is equally important to know the capacity available relative to the population, how appropriate, timely and accessible the services are, and the outcome of care. In 2010, Connecticut ranked 12th in the nation with 89.9 primary care physicians active in patient care per 100,000 of the state's population, compared to 79.4 for the nation.202 In 2012, the number of primary care practitioners with an unexpired Connecticut license was 13,050 or 364.4 per 100,000 of the population (Table 9.1). 202Center for Workforce Studies. (2011, November). 2011 State Physician Workforce Data Book. Association of American Medical Colleges. 122The SPCAA also noted in its report that the problem is not how many primary care practitioners there are but how they are distributed throughout the state relative to the population and it health care needs. Together, these data support the SPCAA 2010 observation that the overall supply of primary care practitioners in Connecticut is adequate. However, most of the uninsured and under-insured underutilize health care services, because they delay accessing unaffordable but needed services. It is generally accepted that the PPACA health insurance coverage expansion will likely lead to new and increased demand for primary care services as discussed earlier. The SPCAA also noted in its report that the problem is not how many primary care practitioners there are but how they are distributed throughout the state relative to the population and its health care needs. Other considerations are how many practitioners in direct patient care are accepting new patients and/or Medicaid-covered patients, the wait times for appointments, and availability and access to vulnerable populations residing in urban and rural towns in particular. The DPH online licensing database, eLicense, provides an inventory of licensed primary care practitioners; however, the practitioners do not uniformly provide information on their place of work and whether or not they are actively providing direct patient care in the state. Also, eLicense does not provide the specialties of the PAs and APRNs. This makes it difficult to determine the distribution of active clinical practitioners providing direct patient care, to identify the gaps in services and unmet need by geographic areas. Counting unexpired licenses leads to an overestimation of the supply or capacity, since the number includes out-of-state residents and those not practicing or not in direct patient care. Through the HPSA/MUA designation program, the PCO has identified areas, populations and health care facilities in all eight Connecticut counties experiencing shortages in primary care, dental and mental health professionals and indicating residents' reduced access to primary care services.

Conversely, a higher ratio implies reduced ability to absorb increases in demand for primary care services. The three most populous counties, Fairfield, Hartford and New Haven, which have the highest rate of uninsured, also have the highest number of PCPs per 100,000 population and therefore the lowest ratios (Table 9.3). In contrast, the less populous Windham, Tolland and Litchfield Counties with the largest share of rural communities in the state, have relatively lower number of PCPs per 100,000 population and may experience additional access constraints to already strained primary care systems. This is further compounded, especially in Windham County, by a high rate of Medicaid beneficiaries. However, the physician to population estimates do not include all primary care providers (in particular, LNMs, APRNs and PAs) the number of which have grown 19%, 54% and 85%, respectively, since 2007, and are likely to have a significant impact.

In 2008, one in ten hospitalizations for 255,000 patient days and $1.2 billion in charges could potentially have been avoided with timely outpatient care.204Additionally, in 2010, as in prior years, nearly one-half of ED visits could have been avoided through timely treatment or management in a primary care setting such as a doctor's office, FQHC or urgent care center. 205 Even when residents have a usual source of primary care, when there are barriers to timely access, the EDs become the alternative source of care. Hartford and New Haven Counties have higher rates of potentially avoidable ED visits and preventable hospitalizations than the state as a whole despite their relatively higher PCP per 100,000 population rates, Tables 9.3 and 9.4. As further proof of a constrained system, Windham County also had the second highest rate of avoidable ED use in the state; New London County had the highest. These areas have relatively high rates of racial/ethnic minority and elderly populations, are relatively low-income and are either rural or urban. 9.6 PRIMARY CARE FACILITIES AND AVOIDABLE ED VISITS Despite a concentration of primary care centers for the poor and medically underserved and the existence of hospital-operated primary care services, urban core and periphery cities (notably Stamford, Bridgeport, Waterbury, New Britain, Hartford, Meriden, New London and Groton) have the highest incidences of avoidable ED visits per 1,000 (Figure 9.1). These rates far exceed the state average rate of 416.3 visits per 1,000 residents. Certain areas of the state, largely concentrated in Litchfield and New London Counties and mostly rural, also have higher incidences of avoidable ED use rates per 1,000 residents than the state in general. There are few or no primary care centers alternatives in these areas. These two counties also have a reduced ability to meet demand for primary care services with the existing supply of primary care physicians (Table 9.3). A high proportion of residents without a usual source of care increases the likelihood of ED visits for non-emergent conditions. According to a New London County health assessment, New London and Norwich residents have the highests percentages of residents without a usual source of care. 206 The reasons for the relatively higher avoidable ED utilizations rates may vary from area to area. Additional investigation is required to identify the exact reasons and the impact of coverage expansion from PPACA to determine the appropriate methods and policies to implement in each area to reduce these rates. 204 CT DPH Office of Health Care Access.

Highlights of some of the initiatives and programs designed to address primary care service needs to fill the gaps in the system are given below. 9.7.1 DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH - CONNECTICUT PRIMARY CARE OFFICE DPH Primary Care Office (PCO) was created to improve the health of Connecticut's residents living in underserved areas, through assessment, planning, and assistance; and to increase access to primary care providers for medical, dental, and mental health services. The PCO identifies trends and develops strategies to address primary-care-related deficiencies through in-depth research and analyses of the healthcare delivery system and the populations served. 207 The PCO works with communities to identify geographic areas, population groups and health care facilities experiencing critical shortages of primary care, dental and mental health providers, in accordance with the Federal Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Shortage Designation Branch (SDB) guidelines for Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designations. The PCO provides information about the designation process; technical assistance to individuals and health care organizations/facilities preparing designation applications; identifies areas with underserved populations who have limited access to health professionals; and develops and submits applications to the federal government. It is the PCO's goal to ensure that Connecticut recruits and retains highly qualified primary care professionals throughout the state. Working with HRSA, the PCO serves as the point of contact for many federal and state workforce assistance programs, designed to help attract new and experienced health professionals of various disciplines to join Connecticut's healthcare provider community. The PCO collaborates with the state's Primary Care Association, the Community Health Center Association of CT (CHCACT), and the coordinator of the Student/Resident Experiences and Rotations in Community Health (SEARCH) program which places students and residents at the FQHCs in the state. 9.7.2 DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH - OFFICE OF ORAL HEALTH There is an integral relationship between oral health and general health, including associations between chronic oral infections and diabetes, osteoporosis, heart and lung conditions, and certain adverse pregnancy outcomes. Oral diseases are progressive and cumulative, and can affect economic productivity. Oral health disparities exist across population groups at all ages, including dental caries (tooth decay), periodontal or gingival diseases, oral and pharyngeal cancer, and conditions resulting from the side effects of over-the-counter drugs. The DPH Office of Oral Health (OOH) was established to coordinate and direct State and national dental public health programs activities in the state to: serve as a chief advisor on oral health issues; plan, implement and evaluate oral health programs within the state; and promote population-based approaches to improving the oral health of Connecticut's residents. The OOH's three main objectives are assessment, policy development and assurance. These are accomplished by implementing an oral health surveillance system for disease detection, and policy formulation and evaluation; providing leadership and collaborating with community partners to identify and implement solutions to address oral health needs; informing and empowering the public to access quality oral health services; and promoting laws and regulations that protect Connecticut residents' overall health and well-being. Initiatives and programs OOH has implemented or partnered with a coalition of stakeholders to implement include: 1. Develop and publish the first Oral Health Improvement Plan of Connecticut; 208 2. Collaborate with the PCO to survey dentists to identify dental HPSAs in Connecticut; 3. The Home by One Program;209 207 Additional information on PCO is available at http://www.ct.gov/dph/cwp/view.asp?a=3138&q=388118 208 Connecticut Coalition for an Oral Health Plan (CCOHP).

Conduct the Every Smile Counts oral health surveillance system to assess the oral health status off Connecticut pre-school and elementary school children, and vulnerable older adults. 9.7.3 CONNECTICUT ORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE211 The Connecticut Oral Health Initiative (COHI) is a statewide oral health advocacy organization which addresses the needs of all Connecticut residents focusing on the underserved. COHI seeks \"broad system change that will address the inequities in the state's oral health care policy, access to care, and the service delivery model. \" 9.7.4 THE STATEWIDE PRIMARY CARE ACCESS AUTHORITY The Connecticut General Assembly established the Statewide Primary Care Access Authority (SPCAA) for a 4-year term beginning August 2007 to develop: an inventory of the state's existing primary care infrastructure; a system that could serve the primary care needs of the state; and an implementation and evaluation plan for the new system. 212 SPCAA 's 2010 Interim Report included interim recommendations to improve and sustain a vital primary care clinical workforce and primary care system in the state to fulfill all residents' primary care needs \"regardless of insurance status, geographic location, health status, or demographic characteristics. \"213 1. Support development of patient centered medical homes: Financial support for non-FQHC practices seeking PCMH (Primary Care Medical Home) recognition. Financial support modeled after the \"regional extension center\" model to coach and train practices in transformation to the PCMH model. 2. Enhance efforts to secure timely, on-going primary care workforce data: Mandatory on-line electronic licensure renewal for all MDs, NPs, PAs, dentists. Implement full survey at re-licensure, using data set developed by SPCAA and approved by DPH. Direct DPH to devote appropriate resources to analyze submitted data and report to legislature annually. Mandate annual report by Dean of UCONN School of Medicine on number and percent of graduating students choosing primary care residency. 3. Invest in sustained strategies to improve recruitment and retention of primary care providers to practices in Connecticut: Designate a primary care healthcare workforce office at the State level charged with continually monitoring workforce adequacy, and primary care access across Connecticut. Maximize efforts to recruit NHSC scholars and Loan Repayment providers to CT. Implement key recommendations of the Institute of Medicine's Future of Nursing report that impact primary care. Leverage federal funding opportunities to develop new and expanded access points for primary care in schools, public housing nurse managed health centers, and FQHCs.1284. Address existing barriers to efficient primary care practice: Remove prohibitions against non-licensed personnel administering medication in the primary care setting and allow medical assistants, under the willing supervision of licensed health care providers, to administer routine immunizations and vaccines. Establish Medicaid pilot to provide transition care to enrollees admitted to hospital and monitor impact on re-hospitalization for Medicaid enrollees relative to other populations. 5. Expand primary care capacity through investment in additional delivery sites, particularly in underserved areas: Support continued development of school based health centers and community health centers. Support public and private colleges and community organizations in securing grant funding for education and training at both pre-licensure and post-licensure level. 6. Promote greater integration of primary care and mental/behavioral health: Align reimbursement with primary care. Modify billing systems. 7. Establish an \"all payer claims\" database (APCD) for Connecticut and enroll the State in the All Claims Database Council system: Specifically, track indicators for Obesity, Ambulatory sensitive admission to hospital, ER utilization, patient experience/satisfaction. Mandate annual report card to legislature on measures of health status of Connecticut's population. 9.7.5 COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER ASSOCIATION OF CONNECTICUT The Community Health Center Association of Connecticut is a non-profit service organization that supports the clinical and administrative operations of its member community health centers across Connecticut. It offers advocacy, program administration and technical assistance services to its member health centers. Its mission is to enable federally qualified health centers to provide access to the highest quality health care and social services to Connecticut's underserved populations through a joint initiative with the State to increase levels of service, extend hours of operations, enhance facilities, acquire state-of-the-art equipment and recruit qualified physicians and medical personnel. 214 9.7.6 SCREENING, BRIEF INTERVENTION, REFERRAL AND TREATMENT (SBIRT) The Connecticut Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment Program is a private-public partnership between the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, University of Connecticut Health Center, the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut and 9 federally qualified health centers. Ten Health Educators work at each of the participating health centers. The purpose of the program is to increase identification and treatment of adults, ages 18 and older, who are at-risk for substance misuse or diagnosed with a substance use disorder through the implementation of services at health centers statewide. It also furthers the linkages between primary care and behavioral health care at health centers and partnering substance abuse treatment agencies. 9.7.7 THE CONNECTICUT CENTER FOR PRIMARY CARE215 In 2002, ProHealth Physicians founded the non-profit Connecticut Center for Primary Care to preserve and strengthen the delivery of primary medical care services and the health of communities. Its mission is primary care research, translation of research into practice, quality improvement and patient safety, transforming the Connecticut primary care system, catalyzing the care coordination of its various elements, and sustaining change. It is also involved in the CareConcepts initiative to improve the process of chronic illness care in primary care practices and clinical outcomes. 214 Community Health Center Association of Connecticut.

OHCA will be continuously attentive to technological advances, research findings, demographic changes, shifting economic incentives, and significant changes in the organization and delivery of health care and planning and quality standards. Next steps and recommendations had several sources; they were either suggested directly by subcommittee and advisory body members, evolved from subcommittee and advisory body discussions, or were suggested by reviewers of the Plan. 10.1 ACUTE CARE/AMBULATORY SURGERY The next steps/recommendations on acute care/ambulatory surgery are intended to build upon the first Plan's efforts. Explore whether and how data on observation days should be collected and submitted to OHCA and determine how the inclusion of bed days would affect the bed need methodology. Examine service type by region to determine if gaps in service exist on a regional basis. Investigate the development of planning regions that best facilitate the ability to assess the availability of and future demand for care, taking into consideration existing hospital service areas. Explore the formation of a statewide task force comprising key industry stakeholders to further examine action steps and solutions needed to address the concerns identified by the ED Focus Groups about inappropriate use of the ED. Evaluate ED capacity issues on an on-going basis. Examine availability of on-call specialty physicians to EDs. Further study Behavioral Health/ED Focus Group findings with the Connecticut Hospital Association (CHA)/Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) to determine if access to behavioral health services is a significant problem at Connecticut's EDs and if there are any opportunities to help improve access. Examine the effect on hospital EDs of increasing reimbursement for outpatient behavioral health programs. Examine the benefits of increasing the number of intermediate care center (ICC) beds. Examine cardiac program quality measures, including risk-adjusted outcomes, institutional and operator performance. Continue to review and update Connecticut's cardiac guidelines to reflect current information and recommendations provided by professional societies and organizations with expert knowledge of cardiac care. Encourage the adherence to national cancer clinical practice guidelines and investigate the inclusion of standards and guidelines in future Plans. Consider adopting the following surgical facility classes as defined by the American College of Surgeons: Class A: Provides for minor surgical procedures performed under topical and local infiltration blocks with or without oral or intramuscular preoperative sedation. These procedures are also appropriately performed in Class B and C facilities. C lass B: Provides for minor or major surgical procedures performed in conjunction with oral, parenteral, or intravenous sedation or under analgesic or dissociative drugs. These procedures are also appropriately performed in Class C facilities. C lass C: Provides for major surgical procedures that require general or regional block anesthesia and support of vital bodily functions. Consider amending the definition of \"operating room\" as follows: \"Operating Room\" means a room with a fully controlled sterile environment that meets either (i) the standard for a Class B or Class C operating room as set forth 134in the 2006 edition of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Guidelines for the Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities or (ii) the standards for an operating room as forth in the R.C.S.A. \u00a7 19-13-D56, to the extent consistent with section 19a-493b. Include treatment rooms in future Plan discussions related to ambulatory surgery capacity. With respect to ambulatory surgery standards and guidelines, discuss and consider including backlogs in the service area; ability of physicians to schedule block times; patient throughput at other facilities; and the quality of care at other facilities as additional factors for consideration in the next Plan. 10.2 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH The next steps/recommendations on behavioral health are intended to build upon the efforts of and discussions held by the behavioral health subcommittee. Explore ways that Connecticut's behavioral health service system can measure or determine capacity as it relates to need and access to care. Inventory and discuss behavioral health care services provided by private practitioners and include how the provision of services in private practice contributes to the overall provision of behavioral health care in the state. Further advance the discussion of additional types of providers (e.g., private practitioners, Veterans Administration) and the availability of clinical level services in the state and seek and provide more information on recovery supports available to residents in the state. Inventory distinct service levels. Enhance OHCA 's Hospital Reporting System (HRS) reporting mechanisms to capture accurate, usable data from short term general and children's general hospitals on hospital-based or hospital-affiliated behavioral health care services (such as a revamped Report 450 218 or a new schedule). Provide more focus on the provision and interrelation or co-location of mental health, primary care and/or oral health services within the various settings and provide further discussion as to the concept of \"no wrong door\" to accessing these services at any location. Further consider how health care reform and a possible blended behavioral health license might change the landscape for both behavioral health finance and delivery of care in the future. 218 Hospital Report 450 (Hospital Inpatient and Outpatient Other Services Utilization and FTE Employees) is the form into which hospitals electronically report utilization data to OHCA, annually.CHAPTER 10 NEXT STEPS/RECOMMENDATIONS13510.3 PRIMARY CARE The Primary Care Subcommittee's next steps/recommendations are intended to assure and enhance the quality of care provided by primary care providers in all settings by eliminating health disparities and barriers to access, and tracking and evaluation of health outcomes and patient satisfaction. Utilize the results of the DPH Primary Care Office survey of primary care providers to report on and highlight access issues related to primary care facilities and services to better identify practitioners' places of practice, affiliations or relationships with institutions (such as hospitals, FQHCs, multi-specialty practices) and to illustrate any primary care workforce needs, size, and distribution issues which the Primary Care Office identifies. Consider adjusting future Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaires so large enough samples are drawn in each county so that results for the questions related to health care access may be used for county level assessment and solutions. Consider mandating responses on all license renewal applications to certain survey questions on whether practitioners are actively practicing in the state; the primary location of practice; if the respondent is currently actively treating patients; and if he/she had ever been convicted of a felony. Improve OHCA 's Hospital Reporting System's reporting mechanisms to capture accurate, usable data from hospitals on hospital-based primary care services (such as a revamped Report 450 or a new schedule) and to collect primary care data on all providers of primary care services. Consider more comprehensively primary care provided by hospital-affiliated entities, which are expanding rapidly throughout the state. Provide additional Plan focus on the provision of mental health and oral health services in primary care settings, and assess the interrelation of these services with primary care.CHAPTER 10 NEXT STEPS/RECOMMENDATIONS137SECTION 4 CHAPTER 11 DATA SOURCES AND LIMITATIONSDATA SOURCES AND LIMITATIONS13911.0 DATA SOURCES AND LIMITATIONS 11.1 DATA SOURCES In developing this plan, OHCA relied on the following primary sources of data: The OHCA Acute Care Hospital Inpatient Discharge Database (HIDD) which contains demographics, clinical and charge data for each inpatient discharged from the acute care hospitals in the state each year. Unless otherwise stated, HIDD data are reported semi-annually by hospital fiscal year (FY), that is, October 1 of a year through September 30 of the subsequent year. The OHCA Hospital Reporting System (HRS) database Twelve Month Actual Filings reports, which contain financial and inpatient/outpatient utilization data from the acute care hospitals, electronically submitted to OHCA by March 31 of each year. Data are reported in hospital FY . OHCA 2011 surveys administered to hospitals, outpatient surgical (OSFs), imaging providers and hospital-operated primary care facilities. Related data were reported for calendar year 2010 for surgery and imaging. DPH health care practitioners and facilities licensing online eLicense database and paper license submissions. DPH Primary Care Office data on U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) designations of a geographical area, a population group or health care facility in the state experiencing medical, dental and behavioral health professional shortages as a health professional shortage area (HPSA) or medically underserved area or population (MUA/P). Department of Children and Families behavioral health licensure dataset, October 2011. Connecticut Hospital Association, ChimeData emergency department (ED) database. U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. 11.2 DATA LIMITATIONS The HIDD does not include Connecticut residents that out-migrated or were discharged from hospitals in other states, including the border states of New Y ork, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Inpatient and outpatient services utilization data from the HRS are only available at hospital aggregate level. A panel of experts determined that the Acute Care Bed Need Methodology tool, in Chapter 3, may be enhanced with out-of-state hospital inpatient stays and Connecticut hospitals' observation stays. However, both types of data are currently unavailable to OHCA. Participation in the three OHCA administered surveys was not mandatory, therefore not all facilities responded to the surveys or filled out the questionnaires completely. Also, there was some inconsistency with respect to respondents' interpretation and approach to responses. There is no comprehensive data repository in the state on health care practitioners actively providing direct patient care, especially private practitioners and their place of work, hours of availability, indications that they are accepting new patients and utilization, for determining availability, utilization and access in outpatient settings as required by CGS 19a-634 (Appendix A). In lieu of an unavailable comprehensive database on primary care practitioners providing direct patient care and their place of work, OHCA relied on a) the U.S Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Prevention Quality Indicators tool for identifying potentially \"preventable\" hospitalizations; and b) a New Y ork University Center for Health and Public Health Research algorithm for identifying ED visits and conditions presented that were potentially avoidable and/or treatable in a primary care setting for indications of gaps in the primary care system. While OHCA obtained behavioral health service data from CT Clearinghouse and Value Options to ascertain service level detail, OHCA was unable to fully verify and accurately compare the data to provide service line detail for providers. 140 Beginning on October 1, 2012, OSFs will be subjected to the Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) Quality Reporting Program, a new federal regulatory requirement implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). Under this program, OSFs must ensure they are using a safe surgery checklist and have a system in place to capture surgical volume data as of January 1, 2012.219 CGS Section 19a-654 requires outpatient surgical facilities and facilities that provide outpatient surgical services as part of the outpatient surgery department of a short-term acute care general or children's hospital, to submit patient-identifiable encounter data to OHCA by July 1, 2015. OHCA acknowledges that all analytical forecasting models have limitations; however, statistical models help to provide an objective comparison that can be applied across similar entities. Models are generally used in coordination with other current/relevant supplemental information to help provide accurate assessments. Additional factors and other known unique circumstances with merit may be considered in addition to results derived from a particular forecasting model to determine unmet need or gaps in service for Connecticut's health care system. 219 Federal Register.

(Formerly Sec. 19a-150).Statewide health care facility utilization study. Statewide health care facilities and services plan. Inventory of health care facilities, equipment and services. As part of the OHCA Facility Plan process, the Subcommittees for Acute Care and Behavioral Health agreed to co-sponsor focus groups with hospital emergency department (ED) staff including ED, behavioral health and nurse directors. The aim of the focus groups was to gain better insight on how well persons presenting with behavioral health needs were receiving care either in the general hospital or through community programs. The Connecticut Hospital Association (CHA) provided the logistical support securing three meeting locations throughout the state and registering ED staff. A University of Connecticut Health Center research associate, on contract to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, facilitated the groups. Focus groups were held on May 23, 24 and 30, 2012 at CHA 's headquarters in Wallingford, the Mount Sinai Campus of St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford, and Bridgeport Hospital. A total of twenty-nine ED staff from seventeen hospitals representing large urban centers, medium-sized cities and smaller communities participated in the focus groups. Each group was asked to discuss the following areas: - Patient management: patient characteristics such as presenting behavioral health disorders, complicating factors such as co-morbid medical conditions; whether those admitted were first time or recurring patients; type of insurance coverage (i.e., public entitlement, no insurance, private); and any issues concerning payer requirements (preauthorization criteria, length of stay, etc.); - Behavioral health resources/system capacity: the availability of appropriate services within the hospital and/or in the hospital's catchment area; discharge planning to assure placement in the appropriate level of care; referral networks between ED staff and community behavioral health providers and/or administrative services organizations; and care coordination; and - Other challenges: noting any constraints/barriers in placing patients in behavioral health services outside the hospital such as transportation, appropriate housing, timely access to outpatient appointments and other recovery support services. Several common themes emerged (not in ranked order) from the three focus groups, including: 1. Inappropriate use of the ED by behavioral health patients (e.g., patients from geriatric/nursing homes, group homes, school referrals, police drop-offs) competing with ED resources and affecting overall quality of care delivered in the ED. 2. Limited access to behavioral health services especially for those patients requiring inpatient (adults) or residential (youth) services as well as difficulty initiating services for new patients (e.g., securing an outpatient appointment for assessment/intake, medication, or other social/recovery services). 3. Lack of coordination of care between ED and community based services. Appendix G: Emergency Department Focus Groups: Summary167Inappropriate Use of ED by Behavioral Health Patients There was a range of concerns raised by focus group participants as to the inappropriate use of EDs. These included: the police conducting \"sweeps\" and dropping off patients who are intoxicated - giving the patient a choice of jail or the ED; schools sending students who may be acting out or have conduct problems; nursing homes transferring patients who are disruptive/combative or who have dementia; concerned parents bringing their child who is intoxicated from alcohol and other drugs or exhibiting difficult behaviors; and family care givers who can no longer cope and need a respite. In addition to seeing the severely chronically ill behavioral health patient, many ED participants stated that they are seeing new patients, referred to by participant as \"the moderately\" mentally ill. Several factors were suggested as to the rise in the number of this type of patient. Participants cited the poor economy and resulting adverse life events, such as unemployment or difficulty meeting financial obligations (possibly having lost insurance coverage), home foreclosures, caring for a sick family member, being socially isolated (aging population) and other environmental factors. Most of these patients do not present with an immediate medical concern, but can tie up ED beds for many hours or even days waiting for a behavioral health assessment and an appropriate discharge from the ED. For instance, most focus group participants noted the rise in patients from skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) who cannot be discharged back to the SNF until they receive a \"psychiatric clearance\" from the ED. Participants reported that there has been an increase in combative patients placing ED staff at risk of physical harm. Consistently across the groups, it was reported that the number of serious assaults by patients have become commonplace, resulting in hospitals taking additional steps to enhance security, such as increased security presence in the ED, increased use of hand-held metal detectors, and, in some cases, employing specially trained dogs, to assure patient and staff safety. Participants spoke about patients hiding weapons or other implements on their body that could pose a danger to themselves or ED staff. There was also discussion of the increased incidence of staff turnover resulting from patient assaults, and the resulting costs to hospitals to train new personnel. Children and adolescents comprise one population increasingly presenting at EDs. Concerned parents are looking more often to the ED when they are unsure where to find help for a child who is abusing alcohol and other drugs, or is so disruptive that parents cannot manage their behavior. One hospital located in a large urban community reported a 50% increase in the volume of pediatric patients presenting to the ED in the past year. Participants noted a lack of substance use treatment programs for children, and waiting lists of child/adolescent partial hospital programs and residential beds, as contributing factors. Another group comprises family members who can no longer cope with the care of an elderly parent. The parent may be socially isolated, depressed or experiencing dementia but not a medical or psychiatric emergency. These patients and others can be costly in the diversion of ED resources. The ability for hospital EDs to manage the behavioral health population varied, with larger hospitals providing dedicated space to accommodate those with behavioral health needs. Nevertheless, even the larger, inner city hospitals may be overwhelmed. Some hospitals try to separate this population from the general ED medical patient population. Participants noted the importance of separating children from adults being treated in behavioral health ED; however, many do not have the capacity. One participant noted that, with the rise in patients inappropriately accessing ED services, care has become more \"custodial\" rather than clinical, as resources are diverted away from serving patients who truly need emergency medical care. All focus groups reported a significant rise in behavioral visits over the past several years, with one hospital reporting a 20% increase. As mentioned, some attribute this to the economic downturn with the corresponding loss of insurance coverage. Certainly the increase in patient populations such as those experiencing life stressors as mentioned above is another. The chronically ill behavioral health patients, who cycle through treatment and relapse (or decompensation), may also be accessing the ED more often, due to the fewer community resources (e.g., counseling, medication Appendix G: Emergency Department Focus Groups: Summary168management or housing). The ED participants felt that the severity of those presenting with a behavioral health problem is increasing (i.e., more acute and more often). Adding to this problem is the ubiquitous message placed on medical practices or behavioral health clinics' after-hours automated phone responses, stating, \"If this is an emergency to go to the nearest emergency room. \" ED staff note that the majority of these patients do not need emergency room treatment, and could be more effectively and less expensively managed in an outpatient setting. As long as EDs are the only available care facilities operating 24 hours / 7 days a week, many will look to them whether the visit is appropriate or not. Participants stated that EDs have become a \"dumping ground\" for patients with nowhere else to go, and \"when there's nowhere else to go, the ED's door is always open. \" Limitations on length of stay (five days) for general hospital inpatient psychiatric beds by private insurance companies was cited as being problematic, resulting in patients receiving inadequate care, frequently relapsing and then returning to the ED. EDs must provide one-to-one staffing for patients presenting with serious psychiatric concerns (including suicidal thoughts), or who exhibit aggressive behaviors, in order to avoid harm to themselves or others. This means that EDs must have specialized personnel, such as crisis workers, on staff. In smaller hospitals, getting a psychiatric evaluation may take some time, as the psychiatrist may not be physically present in the hospital, and available only by telephone, or available in person during limited hours. All of these issues place a burden on hospitals to appropriately staff EDs, at additional cost, and result in increased length of stays for patients. While all focus group participants strongly confirmed the recent increase in chronic alcoholic patients (many who detox in the ED), some hospitals noted a rise in patients presenting with PCP (Phencyclidine) or \"angel dust\" use, and noted that such patients are more likely to exhibit violent behaviors. Also more ED patients are presenting with nonmedical use of narcotic pain relievers, other prescription drugs (stimulants), and cough medicine (dextromethorphan), particularly in the eastern part of the state. While most patients who are admitted to an ED have some form of insurance (private or public entitlement-Medicaid) or are indigent and qualify for State-operated behavioral health services, there remains a cohort who is not insured, ineligible for public insurance, or does not qualify for State-operated services. EDs find it very difficult to find a community referral for these patients, which is one of the primary barriers to discharging a patient needing behavioral health care. Limited access/capacity for inpatient (adults) or residential (adolescents) services Most hospitals represented in the focus groups noted the shortage of inpatient beds for both adults and children needing psychiatric or substance use treatment services. For children with serious emotional disturbance, the wait for placement in a residential bed can take days if not weeks or may never happen. The burden of having a section of the ED separated for children waiting for a residential placement is especially difficult for smaller hospitals. The lack of available inpatient beds for adults was discussed at all focus groups, particularly regarding access to intermediate care beds that were recently placed on line as part of the Connecticut Behavioral Health Partnership (Medicaid) initiative. Participants noted that overall the decline in State-operated beds for adults, and community residential beds for children, for the most seriously ill behavioral health patients, places an extreme burden on EDs. These patients utilize a disproportionate amount of resources that were formerly available to the less severely ill patients, creating a \"logjam\" in the ED, and longer lengths of stays for all patients. The limited availability of adult respite beds, which could be used to stabilize patients outside of the ED setting, continues to add to the inability to discharge patients needing mental health services. Across hospitals represented in the focus groups, the average length of stay in an ED for those awaiting admission to a behavioral health service ranged from twelve to thirty-two hours, with longer waits for those needing an inpatient psychiatric bed. The lack of observation beds (less than twenty-four hours or extended stay for up to seventy-two hours) was mentioned, in the context of being able to \"hold\" the patient until an appropriate discharge could be completed, thus freeing up ED beds. For the most part, observation beds are in short supply due to reimbursement constraints by payers, and respite or observation beds are not available for homeless patients. Appendix G: Emergency Department Focus Groups: Summary169Difficulty initiating services for new patients For those \"new\" patients with behavioral health needs, it is difficult to schedule an appointment in the community for an initial assessment in order to obtain outpatient treatment or medication management. While most focus group participants stated an average wait time of three to six weeks, one hospital indicated it could take as long as six months for an outpatient appointment. Participants reported that some outpatient clinics require three appointments before a patient can see a psychiatrist for medication management, with the process taking several months. This also results in frequent re-admissions to the ED, while someone is waiting to receive outpatient services. In the past, patients such as these would not even present at the ED, as they would be receiving outpatient treatment or case management services. It can be difficult to connect ED patients who need referral to community alcohol and drug or mental health services outside of normal program operational hours. The EDs' busiest hours are usually evenings (after 4:00 p.m.), when it is impossible to arrange a referral to a community behavioral health provider. This necessitates keeping the patient until the next day, when a referral may be arranged. Weekends are even more difficult, since it is impossible to arrange a referral until Monday. Lack of coordination of care between ED and community based services Even for those with private or public insurance, obtaining preauthorization for behavioral health services is very time consuming. At one focus group, hospital ED participants reported difficulties in obtaining timely referrals and preauthorizations for behavioral health services for Medicaid Low Income Adults from the CT-Behavioral Health Partnership administrative services organization. Some ED participants noted that communication between the ED and community programs is often poor. Some areas reported problems with Sober Houses, which provide housing for persons in recovery, discharging them when a person relapses, rather than assisting them in arranging alternative services. All groups noted a \"low tolerance\" on the part of some treatment agencies for certain behaviors, such as missing appointments, or testing positive for substance use. Such circumstances should be acknowledged, anticipated and accommodated as human elements of the recovery process. Once discharged or released from a community based service program, these individuals then present at EDs, requiring psychiatric medications. It was also noted that there is a lack of community-based case management services, which would achieve some measure of coordination of care between the ED and community providers, although in some EDs, there exists a strong tie with State-operated services for adults. A few participants mentioned the need for a comprehensive resource directory and an up-to-date census report, indicating where alcohol and drug residential beds are available. As mentioned above, the readmitting practices of some SNFs, group homes and other institutions, that frequently send patients to the ED, is also causing gridlock. Many of the referred patients aren't appropriate for the ED, and once diagnosed, must be discharged as soon as possible back to the referring facility. Often the referring agency/facility states that the patient is no longer appropriate for their program. Overall, all regions reported use of the ED as a clearinghouse, or entry point, for access to all services (group home, inpatient, outpatient, substance abuse, etc.), leading to a back-up in the ED and inability to adequately care for those truly needing emergency services. For example, access to many detoxification facilities is only available upon referral from an ED. For opiate treatment, patients spend five to six hours in an ED for this referral. Others wait days for placement and are eventually stabilized and discharged from the ED before obtaining placement. In the end, these system issues add days of untreated behavioral health needs, huge costs to hospitals and insurers, and disruption in patients' and family members' lives. Some participants noted the ED length of stay for behavioral health patients is routinely five to seven days, and that the ED is essentially functioning as a short-term inpatient unit and detoxification facility for behavioral health clients who cannot access beds in appropriate facilities. All participants agreed that behavioral health patients are not getting an adequate quality of care in the emergency department and would be better served in other settings if resources were available. Participants noted, \"The ED is not conducive to providing quality care\" and that these patients do not have positive outcomes in the ED setting. Appendix G: Emergency Department Focus Groups: Summary170Appendix H Emergency Department Focus Groups: Solutions No Connecticut hospital is alike in terms of available resources, patient volume, and community demographics, but the majority of issues described by focus group participants appeared to be common to both large urban hospitals and smaller community hospitals. While federal law requires all Emergency Departments (EDs) to provide or arrange treatment necessary to attempt to stabilize patients who are found to have an emergency medical condition, they also provide treatment for individuals whose health needs are not of an emergency nature, but for whom EDs may be the only accessible or timely entry point into the broader health care system. Whereas participants shared many similar frustrations about the behavioral health system, perhaps the overarching concern was the function of the ED in the continuum of care as a \"custodial care\" institution, where behavioral health patients are \"boarded\" in the ED. From a planning perspective, the focus groups acknowledged that capacity issues for EDs must be monitored to ensure that overcrowding and wait times for patients do not threaten to compromise patient care. Common themes identified by focus group participants included (i) inappropriate use of EDs by behavioral health patients, (ii) limited access to behavioral health services/difficulty initiating services for new patients, and (iii) lack of coordination between EDs and community based services. These themes are addressed in further detail in an accompanying document, entitled \"Emergency Department Focus Groups Summary. \" While these problems are not unique to Connecticut, participants agreed that a frank, open, and ongoing discussion of potential solutions, including consideration of specific measures implemented among prehospital providers, ED providers, and providers of follow-up care, and the role government can play to incentivize the implementation of such solutions, are essential and beneficial elements of the planning process. Current Measures Participants cited the success of certain programs that may potentially be expanded to other regions or populations. For example, the child psychiatric emergency mobile teams (EMPS) are reportedly working well in most areas. One participant stated that four out of five child/adolescent crisis clients are diverted from the ED through this system. It was recommended that this approach might be utilized successfully with the adult population as well. Another program participants believe is \"very helpful\" is the \"ED diversion program\" through DMHAS for behavioral health patients. In addition, the \"wraparound\" diversion alternative to hospitalization for child and adolescent patients was noted as a successful program in one region of the state. Participants shared ideas about policies and practices that their hospitals' EDs have initiated to try to cope with behavioral health system issues. For instance, one large urban hospital experienced an increase in patients presenting with non-emergent complaints, afterhours and on weekends, from the local mental health care providers. The hospital engaged these providers, educating them on the appropriate use of the ED, and persuading them to change the messaging on their voicemail systems regarding possible emergency client calls. These modest changes resulted in a reduction in patient volume. Another hospital adopted the practice of admitting nonviolent children and adolescents presenting with behavioral health concerns into its inpatient pediatric unit for observation, in order to avoid \"boarding\" them in the ED. Most participants stated that the increasing number of ED visitors were resulting in new challenges to guarantee patient and worker safety. Many reported that their hospitals have taken decisive measures to address this challenge, increasing security staff, and investing in technology and equipment, such as hand-held metal detectors, to assure patient safety. Participants also cited the challenge of managing medications for those behavioral health patients presenting with medical co-morbidities, and those with multiple prescriptions. One hospital reported that it resorted to employing pharmacy technicians in the ED, to manage multiple prescriptions for patients who may remain in the ED for several days at a time. One large urban hospital dealt with an increase in geriatric patients presenting with behavioral health concerns by staffing more medical case managers in the ED, both to manage these patients and coordinate with SNFs. This same hospital reported that its crisis clinicians were essentially functioning as case managers for a significant portion of their time, although they also stated that this solution is \"unbillable and unreimbursable but helps with flow\" in the ED. Across the board, participants stated that case management was lacking for behavioral health patients, in pre- and post-hospital settings. Appendix H: Emergency Department Focus Groups: Solutions171Another participant reported that group homes for persons with developmental disabilities in the region served by their ED were developing and sharing with the ED their elaborate treatment plans for dealing with very violent patients. These detailed plans ensured that the group homes would take the patient back after an ED visit. Participants suggested that such a practice might be replicated with geriatric/nursing home patients and behavioral health group home patients. Participants shared a number of measures currently used to address the growing need to care for behavioral health patients in the ED, including: segregating patients such as children and adolescents and geriatric patients, placing them in a separate, more appropriate environment ; hiring nurses with psychiatric training and the skills necessary to manage ED patients presenting with mental health problems; establishing dedicated units within the ED to handle patients requiring a detoxification from alcohol or opiates; and instituting protocols for recurring ED patients seeking narcotic pain relievers, to stop the inappropriate prescribing of potentially addictive medication. Recommendations Some participants recommended the formation of a statewide task force to collect and share best practices, and to ensure a degree of consistency in ED behavioral health services throughout the state. Other states have published \"white papers\" that may be used as guidance. Furthermore, it was suggested that the taskforce look at innovative practices in other states, for example: Development of State-funded, self-contained psychiatric emergency facilities (as was done in California and New Y ork); Integrated care that is coordinated across systems as recommended in New Y ork's Medicaid Redesign Team- Behavioral Health Reform Work Group (October 2011 http://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/ docs/mrt_behavioral_health_reform_recommend.pdf Participants suggested repeatedly that there should be ongoing public evaluation of the effectiveness and availability of current behavioral health services. Areas recommended include: Availability and access to intermediate care beds recently placed on-line to accommodate reduction in State-operated inpatient beds; Overall effectiveness of behavioral health services in the state as relates to quality of care and long term outcomes; Geographic distribution of resources, treatment demand, and adequate capacity, especially for: Respite Beds Continuing care beds Adult acute inpatient beds (State and general hospital) Adolescent residential beds Observation beds (23 hour either in ED or outside) Management of behavioral health resources locally and cross-system coordination. Participants voiced several suggestions that could lead to true cost savings, both by hospitals and other providers, and at the same time improve patient access to appropriate behavioral health services. Those mentioned include: Bridge care: this could be in the form of observation or respite beds or a patient/peer navigator depending on the severity of the behavioral health condition, allowing the ED to discharge the patient with an interim treatment plan for further evaluation or referral to services. This model would provide for continuity of care and patient support during a vulnerable time when the patient most needs it. Urgent Walk-In Behavioral Health Centers: similar to urgent care clinics for medical conditions, this type of outpatient facility could accommodate the needs of those without a severe mental illness or substance use disorder. Given the movement to integrate primary and behavioral health care, these centers could be co-located with existing primary care centers. On-line Capacity Management System: automated information on behavioral health service capacity would greatly reduce time spent searching for a placement outside the ED. While in part, this exists, it is fragmented with no overarching systematic approach.
