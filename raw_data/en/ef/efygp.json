Courses requiring vaccinations September start - BSc (Hons) MSc Occupational Therapy (Pre-Reg) AECC University College has unique multidisciplinary clinics which attract a variety of clinicians and patients and we actively seek new opportunities for students off campus within the NHS and private sector to enrich their clinical learning. Whilst this presents great opportunities for students, there is a risk of contracting an infection whilst on placement and vaccination helps to reduce this risk to both yourself and the public. We take the safety of our community very seriously and advise all our students to be fully vaccinated (or have demonstrated immunity) against the following diseases: - Meningitis - Pertussis (whooping cough) - Tetanus - Diphtheria - Polio - Tuberculosis (TB) - Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) Chickenpox (varicella zoster virus) Please note: - You do not need to be vaccinated against Covid-19 at this time, although we do recommend it. - We need assurance that all childhood immunisations are up to date. - Please contact your GP practice if you do not have any of the vaccinations listed. Further information can be found in the FAQs (Pre-Reg) Whilst vaccination is not a mandatory requirement to study chiropractic, please note that students who are not vaccinated, or who cannot demonstrate immunity against the diseases listed above, may not be able to participate in the full range of placements available. If you are not vaccinated and cannot demonstrate immunity placement opportunities may be restricted to ensure the safety of yourself and your patients. Decisions will be made on an individual risk-assessed basis. Your Occupational Health check costs vary depending on the number of additional vaccines you need and how much your doctor charges for completing the form. We would advise reaching out to your GP Practice/Doctor as soon as possible, so that there is no delay. Call or email them to remind them of the importance and urgency of this process. Delays will have an impact on your ability to commence placement. If you have still not received your Occupational Health form, please [contact admissions](mailto:admissions@aecc.ac.uk) (before the deadline) to explain the situation, and explore options. If you're from outside the UK, you can use ask your GP (general practitioner), family doctor, or physician to complete the Occupational Health form (so long as they have access to your health records). If you do not have an NHS number, please enter 'overseas' in the relevant field/area on the form. Please note: International students are required to cover the cost of all vaccination processes. You must submit your Occupational Health form by 31 July 2023. Please be aware that immunisation for the purposes of travel available in pharmacies and similar providers is not the same as immunisation for occupational health reasons and will not count towards your eligibility to practice. Always seek advice from your GP or equivalent healthcare service. The Hep 3 step vaccination is required, not the 2 step travel vaccination. [I have had the HepB travel (2 injection vaccine) do I need to re-start and have the required 3 x HepB OH vaccine?](#collapsee50d367c66f2470d9efad854440ef08c) This would depend upon the time scale of the 2 vaccines (which would determine when the 3rd would be given) The typical time scale would be 2 years so if you have received 2 vaccines within 2 years, Dorset Healthcare would usually administer the 3rd vaccine and then a blood test to check immunity 6-8 weeks following this. The standard vaccines for meningitis are the ACYW. You will need confirmation from your GP Practice or equivalent if overseas that you have had chickenpox. A home blood test kit will not be acceptable as we would require a sample from a certified services such as a GP practice, this is inline with green book guidance (Dept of Health). [I had chickenpox when I was a child, if my doctor confirms this, is this enough as it will only be verbal confirmation from my parents of chickenpox, or do I need a blood test to check my immunity?](#collapseb37d354bfe1a4554a85d053f25db982a) If your GP confirms then this is sufficient, otherwise you will need a blood test. [Do I have to send the GP report and the AECC OH form as supporting documents when completing the pre-clearance health form online?](#collapsea0b77f28016d49f896ed66994e0af6c7) Please send the GP report, however, if you are struggling for this information you can upload the AECC OC form completed as part of your supporting evidence. UKVI require some overseas students to undertake a TB test as part of their visa application. However, not all countries are requested to do this. Occupational Health will require students from ['at risk' countries](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tuberculosis-tb-by-country-rates-per-100000-people) to undertake a blood test when they enrol, the student is liable for the cost of this blood test.
