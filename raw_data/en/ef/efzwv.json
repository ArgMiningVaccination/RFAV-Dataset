Proper immune function is an complex balancing act which nature has to carryout but with a little help. While functioning properly, our immune systems is able to discriminate effectively, between body's own tissues and foreign pathogens. A weakened immune system makes you vulnerable to virtually every type of illness. If the immune response becomes overactive or misdirected it begins to target the body's own tissues for foreign invaders and starts attacking them. Immunity is influenced by the digestive capabilities and our ability to digest, assimilate and absorb nutrients in our bodies. In a healthy body where immune function is strong, any invaders are neutralized or destroyed and then expelled and normalcy is restored. If digestive capabilities are impaired by an imbalance, metabolism is affected and the immune response and natural resistance are lowered. If the body is unhealthy by stored toxins from undigested food, then an environment is created in which invaders are encouraged to thrive. Over indulgence in activities like masturbation is reported to ruin your immune system since it depletes necessary hormones and neuro chemicals. What happens when your immune system is compromised?

All living creatures work on energy and a smooth functioning of the different metabolic processes in the body. The energies or \"prana/chi/qi\" are of different kinds and have their own distinct path of flow and influence. Air energy is better known as the air we breathe and from younger days we learn in school books that air purifies the blood in the lungs. The nose, the windpipe are the pathways and the transfer of energy happens in the lungs, on the blood. This blood feeds/influences the health of each and every cell of the body. The points of influence are the nose and windpipe. Similarly, there are subtle energies that have their own specific pathways called Meridians. These energies are also associated with special metabolic functions and better known by names that associate with the main organ in the line of their path. For example, digestive energies are associated with the Liver [meridian](https://www.lybrate.com/medicine/refresh-meridian-mouth-wash/health-feed) that follows a distinct path in the full body. There are specific zones along this path that can influence the manner in which energy flows along these paths and change the metabolic process of that energy meridian. These points of influence are called \u00e4cu-points'. Pressure applied along these points is referred to as Acupressure treatment\". When needles are used, it is called [Acupuncture treatment](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/acupuncture-treatment). The manner in which the [Acupuncturist](https://www.lybrate.com/acupuncturist) will choose a group of points will stimulate or [sedate](https://www.lybrate.com/medicine/sedate-p-325-mg-37-5-mg-tablet) the activity of toes energies. This will allow the body to regain better health. The needles help to regulate the flow of energy. Acupuncture is an exact science and needles are inserted into the skin at the point of influence. The depth of insertion, kind of needle, selection of points, angle in which needles are inserted, depth of needle insertion, twisting/turning of the needle, duration of therapy, the frequency of treatment; all these will create a change in the metabolic energies of the body. A lot of research is being done all over the world to find out how this system works and what it is best suited for. Some medical conditions are easily treated and some take time. Very good medical clinical data is published in leading medical journal regarding these studies. Acupuncture has proved to be very useful in pain management; [detoxification](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/detoxification); healing enhancement; [stress](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/stress-disorder) relief; improve digestion and few other health issues. Pure Acupressure medical science claims it is useful for all kinds of health disorder; modern medical research is by and by being able to prove this slowly. Typically, the process of an Acupuncture treatment will follow these steps: The acupuncture points are located throughout your body, and at times, the points may be located far away from a pain-affected area. The process of treatment involves the following steps: Benefits The most important benefits of acupuncture are as follows: Acupuncture is also being successfully used to treat [digestive disorders](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/digestive-disorders); hormone imbalances; stress and [depression](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/depression); bone to treating [diabetes](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/diabetes); overcome [acidity](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/acidity); [hair fall](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hair-fall) and many other diseases.
