Homeopathy is a low cost, safe, gentle and effective therapy. Its remedies are made from substances found in nature from plants, animals, and minerals sources and they are non-habit forming. They are given at a very low dosage, which eliminates toxic and allergic reactions. They are of benefit to many ailments such as hay fever, headaches, flu, sinus infections, bladder infections, food allergies, digestive and skin problems, etc... They usually come in the form of tablets, granules or drops. The clinical effectiveness of homeopathic remedies has been proven in major double blind studies published in Lancet the New England and British medical journals of medicine. Also pharmacological studies, done in France at the University of Montpellier and in Germany, have in recent years proven the scientific validity of Homeopathy, an alternative therapy now 200 years old. Homeopathic Medicine first began at the end of the eighteenth century, started by a German physician and chemist Dr. Samuel Hahneman. Disgruntled with the medical practice of his time, he stopped practicing medicine, and started to translate medical books for a living. Medical treatments of the time were still using bloodletting, mercury, silver, antimony and other toxic substances, which, very often, were worse than the disease itself. While translating a foreign medical text into German, he read and discovered that cinchona, the Peruvian bark, from which quinine was derived from originally to treat malaria, if given in greater quantities than the therapeutic dosage, would create the same symptoms as malaria if given to healthy person. He concluded that potentially any toxic product, if diluted, may be of use against that intoxication. He experimented on himself and a group of followers; their results were beyond expectations. The method they used was truly scientific. About thirty people were given a very small dose of toxic material with a notebook to record their symptoms and then they got together to compare notes after a few months, it was called \"proving\". The common symptoms were written down and consigned into a book called the Materia Medica. Each remedy had a personality and the personality of each individual patient in some of its most minute details was matched to the appropriate remedy. The more diluted the remedy was the more powerful the results were.
