Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of complex neurodevelopment disorders, characterized by social impairments, communication difficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior. Autistic disorder, sometimes called autism or classical ASD, is the most severe form of ASD, while other conditions along the spectrum include a milder form known as Asperger syndrome, the rare condition called Rett syndrome, and childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (usually referred to as PDD-NOS). Although ASD varies significantly in character and severity, it occurs in all ethnic and socioeconomic groups and affects every age group. Experts estimate that three to six children out of every 1,000 will have ASD. Males are four times more likely to have ASD than females. topWhat are some common signs of autism? The hallmark feature of ASD is impaired social interaction. A child s primary caregivers are usually the first to notice signs of ASD. As early as infancy, a baby with ASD may be unresponsive to people or focus intently on one item to the exclusion of others for long periods of time. A child with ASD may appear to develop normally and then withdraw and become indifferent to social engagement. Children with ASD may fail to respond to their names and often avoid eye contact with other people. They have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling because they can t understand social cues, such as tone of voice or facial expressions, and don t watch other people s faces for clues about appropriate behavior. They lack empathy. Many children with ASD engage in repetitive movements such as rocking and twirling, or in self-abusive behavior such as biting or head-banging. They also tend to start speaking later than other children and may refer to themselves by name instead of I or me. Children with ASD don t know how to play interactively with other children. Some speak in a sing-song voice about a narrow range of favorite topics, with little regard for the interests of the person to whom they are speaking. Children with ASD appear to have a higher than normal risk for certain co-occurring conditions, including Fragile X syndrome (which causes mental retardation), tuberous sclerosis (in which tumors grow on the brain), epileptic seizures, Tourette syndrome, learning disabilities, and attention deficit disorder. About 20 to 30 percent of children with ASD develop epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood. While people with schizophrenia may show some autistic-like behavior, their symptoms usually do not appear until the late teens or early adulthood. Most people with schizophrenia also have hallucinations and delusions, which are not found in autism. topHow is autism diagnosed? ASD varies widely in severity and symptoms and may go unrecognized, especially in mildly affected children or when it is masked by more debilitating handicaps. Very early indicators that require evaluation by an expert include: no babbling or pointing by age 1 no single words by 16 months or two-word phrases by age 2 no response to name loss of language or social skills poor eye contact excessive lining up of toys or objects no smiling or social responsiveness. Later indicators include: impaired ability to make friends with peers impaired ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others absence or impairment of imaginative and social play stereotyped, repetitive, or unusual use of language restricted patterns of interest that are abnormal in intensity or focus preoccupation with certain objects or subjects inflexible adherence to specific routines or rituals. Health care providers will often use a questionnaire or other screening instrument to gather information about a child s development and behavior. Some screening instruments rely solely on parent observations, while others rely on a combination of parent and doctor observations. If screening instruments indicate the possibility of ASD, a more comprehensive evaluation is usually indicated. A comprehensive evaluation requires a multidisciplinary team, including a psychologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, speech therapist, and other professionals who diagnose children with ASD. The team members will conduct a thorough neurological assessment and in-depth cognitive and language testing. Because hearing problems can cause behaviors that could be mistaken for ASD, children with delayed speech development should also have their hearing tested. Children with some symptoms of ASD but not enough to be diagnosed with classical autism are often diagnosed with PDD-NOS. Children with autistic behaviors but well-developed language skills are often diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Much rarer are children who may be diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder, in which they develop normally and then suddenly deteriorate between the ages of 3 to 10 years and show marked autistic behaviors. Girls with autistic symptoms may have Rett syndrome, a sex-linked genetic disorder characterized by social withdrawal, regressed language skills, and hand wringing. topWhat causes autism? Scientists aren t certain about what causes ASD, but it s likely that both genetics and environment play a role. Researchers have identified a number of genes associated with the disorder. Studies of people with ASD have found irregularities in several regions of the brain. Other studies suggest that people with ASD have abnormal levels of serotonin or other neurotransmitters in the brain. These abnormalities suggest that ASD could result from the disruption of normal brain development early in fetal development caused by defects in genes that control brain growth and that regulate how brain cells communicate with each other, possibly due to the influence of environmental factors on gene function. While these findings are intriguing, they are preliminary and require further study. The theory that parental practices are responsible for ASD has long been disproved. topWhat role does inheritance play? Twin and family studies strongly suggest that some people have a genetic predisposition to autism. Identical twin studies show that if one twin is affected, there is a 90 percent chance the other twin will be affected. There are a number of studies in progress to determine the specific genetic factors associated with the development of ASD. In families with one child with ASD, the risk of having a second child with the disorder is approximately 5 percent, or one in 20. This is greater than the risk for the general population. Researchers are looking for clues about which genes contribute to this increased susceptibility. In some cases, parents and other relatives of a child with ASD show mild impairments in social and communicative skills or engage in repetitive behaviors. Evidence also suggests that some emotional disorders, such as manic depression, occur more frequently than average in the families of people with ASD. topDo symptoms of autism change over time? For many children, symptoms improve with treatment and with age. Children whose language skills regress early in life before the age of 3 appear to have a higher than normal risk of developing epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity. During adolescence, some children with ASD may become depressed or experience behavioral problems, and their treatment may need some modification as they transition to adulthood. People with ASD usually continue to need services and supports as they get older, but many are able to work successfully and live independently or within a supportive environment. topHow is autism treated? There is no cure for ASD. Therapies and behavioral interventions are designed to remedy specific symptoms and can bring about substantial improvement. The ideal treatment plan coordinates therapies and interventions that meet the specific needs of individual children. Most health care professionals agree that the earlier the intervention, the better. Educational/behavioral interventions: Therapists use highly structured and intensive skill-oriented training sessions to help children develop social and language skills, such as Applied Behavioral Analysis. Family counseling for the parents and siblings of children with ASD often helps families cope with the particular challenges of living with a child with ASD. Medications: Doctors may prescribe medications for treatment of specific ASD-related symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Antipsychotic medications are used to treat severe behavioral problems. Seizures can be treated with one or more anticonvulsant drugs. Medication used to treat people with attention deficit disorder can be used effectively to help decrease impulsivity and hyperactivity. Other therapies: There are a number of controversial therapies or interventions available for people with ASD, but few, if any, are supported by scientific studies. Parents should use caution before adopting any unproven treatments. Although dietary interventions have been helpful in some children, parents should be careful that their child s nutritional status is carefully followed. topWhat research is being done? In 1997, at the request of Congress, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) formed its Autism Coordinating Committee (NIH/ACC) to enhance the quality, pace and coordination of efforts at the NIH to find a cure for autism (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-pervasive-developmental-disorders/nih-initiatives/nih-autism-coordinating-committee.shtml). The NIH/ACC involves the participation of seven NIH Institutes and Centers: the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the National Institute of Nursing Research, and the National Center on Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The NIH/ACC has been instrumental in the understanding of and advances in ASD research. The NIH/ACC also participates in the broader Federal Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) that is composed of representatives from various component agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the U.S. Department of Education and other government organizations. In fiscal years 2007 and 2008, NIH began funding the 11 Autism Centers of Excellence (ACE), coordinated by the NIH/ACC. The ACEs are investigating early brain development and functioning, social interactions in infants, rare genetic variants and mutations, associations between autism-related genes and physical traits, possible environmental risk factors and biomarkers, and a potential new medication treatment. top Where can I get more information?For more information on neurological disorders or research programs funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, contact the Institute's Brain Resources and Information Network (BRAIN) at: BRAIN P.O.

Alexander Executive Blvd NINDS Disorders Prepared by: Office of Communications Stroke National Institutes is autism ?Autism falls under the umbrella of a mental disorder. There are 5 types of autism and depending on the type that your child is diagnosed with, this will dictate the treatment that is necessary. Each one has specific criteria that is designed by psychological testing and a team approach of occupational therapy and speech therapy, that once met, are able to give you a full complement of the deficits of your child and the strengths of your child, helping to build a solid treatment plan for autism. What are the possible causes of autism in children?The possible causes of autism in children have been very study-varied, and research has emerged that has shown some genetic component and some birth trauma component. Some people believe it's vaccinations at an early age and some people think it's food. There has been no identified cause of it autism other than the fact that it is something that has to be looked at early, diagnosed, and treated in a really tight, compact way, to create the best outcome for your child. What are the warning signs that my child may be autistic?There are some social behaviors that will trigger your thought to go get an initial evaluation. Most autisms have some social component to them that is deficited in the ways of interacting with others. Oftentimes autistic children are much more inward and unable to interact with the world around them, meaning other people. They're fine one on one, but often they have a difficult time integrating themselves with their peers or into a group, so you will start to see some of that. But that's not to say your child has autism, more that there is something you want to take a look at and see what is developmentally appropriate for your child and what is not. What is the treatment and prognosis for a child with autism?Solid treatment plan for a child with autism means that the team has to be in place to address every strength and every weakness of that child. So a team may be comprised of a speech therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, behavioralist and occupational therapist, depending on the needs of your child. genetic genetic www.videojug.com/interview/autism occupational therapy Autism100 http://www.marchofdimes.com/professionals/14332_25619.asp Autism What are the symptoms of autism?

For more information References Autism is a general term for a group of disorders that affect how a child functions in several areas, including speech, social skills and behavior. Children who have problems in these areas are sometimes said to have an autistic spectrum disorder because the severity and breadth of symptoms varies greatly. Autism affects about 1 in 100 children in the United States (1). That means that an estimated 673,000 children in this country have autism.(1). More children than ever are being diagnosed with autism. The rates of autism have risen dramatically since the 1980s, and in this decade, have climbed from about 1 in 150 to 1 in 91 (1). Much or all of this increase may be due to improved awareness and changes in how autism is diagnosed (1). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all children be screened for autism during well-child visits at ages 18 months and 24 months (3). Early diagnosis and treatment can greatly improve the outlook for children with autism. What are the symptoms of autism?Each child with autism is unique. Some common characteristics and behaviors include (2, 4): Does not speak (about 40 percent of children with autism do not speak at all) Repeats words Performs repetitive movements, such as hand-flapping Doesn't play ?pretend? games Is overly active Has frequent temper tantrums Avoids eye contact Has difficulty starting and maintaining conversation and making friends Does not respond to being called by name Insists on same routine Repeats actions again and again Focuses on single subject or activity Wants to be alone Is overly sensitive to the way things feel, sound, taste or smell Dislikes being held or cuddled Has sleep disturbances Lacks fear in risky situations Has some degree of mental retardation or learning disabilities (in many, but not all, affected children) Is aggressive Hurts himself Loses skills (for example, stops saying words he used to say) Children with a mild autistic spectrum disorder called Asperger syndrome have some of the features of autism. However, children with Asperger syndrome generally have normal intelligence and learn to speak at the expected age. back to top When is autism diagnosed? A child with autism usually does not look different from other children. She may appear to develop normally for the first year or so of life. But during the second year, some children with autism begin to fall behind in social skills, fail to develop speech or even lose skills that they had previously acquired. Autism is often diagnosed around age 3; however, subtle signs of the disorder may appear before 18 months (3). These signs may include (3): Not turning when the parent says the baby's name A lack of back-and-forth babbling with parents starting around 6 months of age Late smiling Does not look when a parent points and says, ?Look at ? Toddlers with these signs do not necessarily have autism, as each child develops at a different rate. However, parents should not hesitate to discuss these possible signs and other developmental concerns with their baby's health care provider. Speech delays also can be early signs of autism. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends an immediate evaluation for autism if the child (3): Does not babble, point or use other gestures by 12 months Does not say any single words by 16 months Does not say any two-word phrases by 24 months Loses language or social skills at any age back to top How is autism diagnosed?There is no specific medical test to diagnose autism. Health care providers generally diagnose autism by observing a child's behavior and by using screening tests that measure a number of characteristics and behaviors associated with autism. If a screening test suggests a possible problem, the provider may do additional tests or recommend evaluation by a specialist. back to top Who is at risk for autism?Autism occurs in all racial, social and educational groups. Boys are about 4 times as likely as girls to be affected (2). Siblings of an affected child may be at increased risk for autism, though the risk appears fairly low: 2 to 8 percent (2, 3). Two recent studies also suggest that premature (born before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy) babies may be at increased risk of symptoms associated with autism (5, 6). back to top What causes autism?While the causes of autism are poorly understood, scientists do know that autism is not caused by poor parenting or other social factors. It is a biological disorder that appears to be associated with subtle abnormalities in specific structures or functions in the brain. Both genetic and environmental factors appear to play a role in the disorder. Scientists believe that at least a dozen genes on different chromosomes may contribute (4). A consortium of autism researchers recently found that abnormalities in a small region of chromosome 16 appear to increase a child's risk for autism by up to 100-fold (7). These abnormalities appear to cause about 1 percent of cases of autism (7). In a minority of cases, other genetic diseases, such as fragile X syndrome (mental retardation and behavioral problems) and tuberous sclerosis (non-cancerous tumors affecting the brain and other organs), also may play a role (2, 3). Certain infections that occur before birth (such as rubella and cytomegalovirus) have been associated with autism (2). back to top Do childhood vaccines contribute to autism?Childhood vaccines, including the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine, do not cause autism. Some parents of children with autism suspect that this vaccine, given around 12 to 15 months of age, contributes to autism because children sometimes begin to display symptoms of autism around the time they are vaccinated. However, most likely, this is because symptoms of the disorder commonly begin at this time, even if a child is not vaccinated. Another reason that childhood vaccines have been suspected of playing a role in autism is that, until recently, they contained a preservative called thimerosal that contains mercury. Since 2002, all routine childhood vaccines have been free of thimerosal. The exception is the flu shot, and thimerosal-free versions are available (8). While higher doses of certain forms of mercury may affect brain development, studies suggest that thimerosal does not. In 2004, an Institute of Medicine panel concluded, after reviewing many studies, that neither the MMR vaccine nor thimerosal-containing vaccines are associated with autism (9). A 2008 study found that the rate of autism in California continued to increase after thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines, also suggesting a lack of association between thimerosal and autism (10). back to top How is autism treated?Children often show great improvement in symptoms with intensive behavioral treatment beginning during the preschool years (2, 8). An individualized treatment program should begin as soon as the diagnosis of autism is seriously considered and should continue through the school years (11). There is no cure for autism. However, some children benefit from medications that help improve their behavioral symptoms so that they are better able to learn. Some commonly used medications include antidepressants, anti-psychotics and stimulants. One such medication is Ritalin, which is commonly prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A new anti-psychotic called risperidone (Risperdal) is the only drug that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for autistic behaviors, such as aggression, self-injury and temper tantrums (4). Some children with autism also are treated with various alternative therapies, such as dietary restrictions, vitamins and detoxification therapies (such as chelation to reduce the amounts of mercury and other metals in the body). To date, there is not enough evidence to show whether or not these treatments may be helpful or harmful (11). Parents who are interested in alternative treatments should discuss the possible risks and benefits with their child's health care provider. back to top For more informationAutism Information Center Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)National Center on Birth Defects andDevelopmental Disabilities (NCBDDD)(800) 311-3435Autism Fact Sheet National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Autism Spectrum Disorders National Institute of Mental HealthAutism Spectrum DisordersAmerican Academy of Pediatrics back to top References Kogan, M.A., et al.

When he was one, Melanie s brother loved to play peek-a-boo and mimic his mom s expressions and gestures. Melanie, on the other hand, rarely makes eye contact or responds when her parents call her name. Furthermore, she doesn t babble or make other baby noises. Her mom and dad try to engage her with toys, songs, and games, but nothing they do gets her interest, let alone a laugh or a smile. Melanie s parents have been waiting for her to catch up, but the gap between her and others her age is only getting wider. Last week, Melanie and her mom went to the zoo with some families from the neighborhood. The other babies pointed excitedly at the animals and stared in wide-eyed wonder, but Melanie didn t pay any attention to either the exotic animals or the other group members. At the end of the day, one of the kids banged his knee and started crying. The other babies looked distressed and many started crying themselves. Melanie didn t even seem to notice what was going on. Autism is a disorder that appears in early childhood, causing delays in many basic areas of development such as learning to talk and interact with others. The symptoms of autism vary widely, as does the impact of the disorder: some autistic children have only mild impairments, while others have more obstacles to overcome. But although the specific combination of symptoms and the severity of the disorder differ from person to person, kids with autism typically have problems in the following three areas: Social Skills Impaired social interaction is the hallmark sign of autism. This may appear as an apparent lack of interest in other people and the surrounding environment. Children with autism often appear to be in their own little world. They have trouble engaging in back-and-forth play, sharing emotions, making friends, and understanding what others are thinking and feeling. Communication Autism also involves problems with verbal and nonverbal communication. Spoken language is usually delayed in autistic children and may even be completely absent. Even when able to speak, children with autism usually have trouble conversing freely and easily. Other common symptoms involve odd or repetitive speech patterns, inappropriate facial expressions and gestures, and language comprehension difficulties. Repetitive behavior Autistic children often exhibit repetitive or stereotyped behaviors and narrow, restricted interests. This may show up as an extreme resistance to change, obsessive attachments to unusual objects, or inflexible routines and schedules. Repetitive body movements, or self-stimulatory behaviors, such as hand flapping and rocking are also common. There is some debate over how many people have autism and whether or not the disorder is becoming more prevalent. While more children are being diagnosed with autism than in the past, many experts believe that at least some of the increase can be explained by heightened public awareness of the disorder, as well as broader and more accurate diagnostic criteria that is catching milder cases. On the other hand, the latest research indicates that at the very least autism is more common in the U.S. than previously thought. According to a February 2007 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1 in 150 children has autism. While autism occurs with equal frequency across all races, ethnicities, and social classes, boys are three to four times more likely to have autism than girls. The siblings of those with the disorder are also at a higher risk. The Autism Spectrum Disorders Autism is one of a group of developmental disorders known as the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). All of the ASDs begin in childhood and involve delays in communication and social skills. They are known as spectrum disorders because every child on the autism spectrum is affected differently, with unique challenges, symptoms, and abilities. Learn More Causes of autism The causes of autism are unknown, but most experts agree that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. One popular theory is that certain individuals are born with a genetic predisposition for autism that is then triggered by something in the environment, either while the baby is still in the womb or shortly after birth. Genetic causes of autism Research indicates that genes particularly inherited genetic glitches and spontaneous DNA mutations play a primary role in the development of autism. But no single gene is to blame. Scientists believe that at least 5 to 20 major genes are involved in autism, with many others also contributing to the risk. The bulk of the evidence for autism s hereditary component comes from twin studies. Multiple twin studies show that when one identical twin develops autism, the other twin will also develop the disorder approximately 9 times out of 10. In fraternal twins who are no more genetically similar than normal siblings the concordance rate is just 1 in 10. Large epidemiologic studies also show that older parents are at a significantly higher risk of having autistic children. The age of the father appears to be particularly important. A recent Israeli study found that children born to fathers who were 40 or older were almost six times more likely to develop autism than the children of men younger than 30. This heightened risk is likely due to genetic mutations in sperm, which are more and more common as men age. But while some specific chromosomal abnormalities and mutations appear to cause autism themselves, in the majority of cases, the interaction of multiple genes leads to a susceptibility to autism without directly causing it. Environmental causes of autism Since genes don t completely explain autism risk or the rising number of new cases, scientists are searching for environmental explanations to fill in the blanks. The idea is that toxins, chemicals, or other harmful external elements may trigger autism, either by turning on or exacerbating a genetic vulnerability or independently disturbing brain development. While considerable attention has been focused on vaccines as a possible cause of autism, a growing body of research suggests that the disorder is caused by environmental factors that occur before vaccination, and sometimes even before birth. Evidence suggests that autism can be triggered by exposure either during pregnancy or the early months of life to viral infections, pesticides, insecticides, and the prescription drugs thalidomide and valproic acid. Recent studies have also found that oxygen deprivation during delivery or fetal development can up the risk of autism. Other environmental factors being studied include air pollution, food additives, mercury in fish, flame retardants, and certain chemicals used to make plastics and other synthetic materials. These substances are particularly dangerous to young babies, whose brains are more likely to absorb toxins and less effective at clearing them out. Autism and vaccines When it comes to autism, no topic is more controversial than childhood vaccinations. At the center of this controversy is thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative once commonly used in vaccines to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. The concern is that exposure to thimerosal may lead to mercury poisoning and autism. Scientific research, however, does not support the theory that childhood vaccinations cause autism. Five major epidemiologic studies conducted in the U.S., the U.K., Sweden, and Denmark found that children who received vaccines containing thimerosal did not have higher rates of autism. Additionally, a major safety review by the Institute of Medicine failed to find any evidence supporting the connection. Other organizations that have concluded that vaccines are not associated with autism include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the World Health Organization. With the exception of the flu vaccine, thimerosal is no longer used in any childhood vaccines. If you remain concerned about a possible connection between autism and mercury, you can request a thimerosal-free version of the flu vaccine from your child's pediatrician. Early signs and symptoms of autism Autism symptoms are usually apparent by 18 to 36 months of age, and subtle warning signs may be evident much earlier even as early as infancy. Because early intervention makes a huge difference in minimizing the symptoms and negative impact of autism, the earlier autism is identified the better. As a parent, you re much more likely to catch the early signs and symptoms of autism if you track your child s development, watching out for developmental delays and red flags. Developmental delays as a sign of autism VIDEO Creating Secure Infant Attachment As children grow, they go through a process where fundamental skills, or developmental milestones, are learned and mastered. These milestones include: physical skills (such as sitting up, crawling, and walking), social skills (such as smiling, playing, and imitating others), and communication skills (such as gesturing and talking). Since the pace of growth varies from child to child, there are flexible windows of time where certain developmental milestones should be reached. However, if your child has not reached milestones at the expected age, this indicates a developmental delay. Autism involves a multitude of developmental delays, so keeping a close eye on when or if your child is hitting all the key social, emotional, and cognitive milestones is an effective way to spot the problem early on. While developmental delays don t automatically point to autism, they do indicate a heightened risk. Furthermore, whether the delay is caused by autism or some other factor, developmentally delayed kids are unlikely to simply grow out of the problem. In order to develop skills in an area of delay, your child needs extra help and targeted treatment. Regression of any kind should be taken seriously. According to Catherine Lord, the director of the University of Michigan Autism and Communication Disorders Center, about 25% of autistic kids appear normal as babies and then regress at some point between 12 and 24 months. For example, a child who was communicating with words such as mommy or up may stop using language entirely, or a child may stop playing social games he or she used to enjoy such as peek-a-boo, patty cake, or waving bye-bye. The following delays warrant an immediate evaluation by your child s pediatrician: By 6 months: No big smiles or other warm, joyful expressions. By 9 months: No back-and-forth sharing of sounds, smiles, or other facial expressions. By 12 months: No babbling or baby talk. By 12 months: No back-and-forth gestures, such as pointing, showing, reaching, or waving. By 16 months: No spoken words. By 24 months: No meaningful two-word phrases that don t involve imitating or repeating. At any age: Any loss of speech, babbling, or social skills. Source: First Signs Detecting autism in babies Most children are diagnosed with autism around the age of three. However, when autism is detected even earlier, treatment can take full advantage of the young brain s remarkable plasticity. If detected by 12 months of age or even earlier, intensive treatment may even be able to rewire the brain and reverse the symptoms. However, the earliest signs of autism are easy to miss because they involve the absence of normal behaviors not the presence of abnormal ones. For example, autistic babies typically don t follow moving objects with their eyes, reach out to grasp toys, or make gestures to attract attention. In some cases, the earliest symptoms of autism are even misinterpreted as signs of a good baby, since the infant is quiet and doesn t make demands. But while such a baby may be easy to deal with, these are red flags of a very serious problem, not positive qualities. Babies like all humans are social creatures. By the time they are 2 to 3 months old, babies who are developing normally will make sounds to get their parents attention, smile at the sound of a familiar voice, play with other people, and imitate certain movements and facial expressions. If your baby isn t responding to you, despite your attempts to interact and show affection, it is cause for concern. Other early signs of autism: The baby doesn t make eye contact. The baby doesn't respond to his or her name. The baby doesn t follow objects visually. The baby doesn't smile when smiled at. The baby doesn t imitate other people. The baby doesn't point or wave goodbye. The baby doesn t babble or make noises. According to Harvard Medical School, babies who are passive and inactive at 6 months, then extremely irritable or joyless at 12 months, are also at a higher risk of developing autism. The First Sign of Autism A study published in the April 2007 issue of Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine found that the failure to turn or look in response to hearing one s name may be one of the earliest signs of autism. Autism red flags in children of all ages As children get older, the red flags for autism increase and become more diverse. There are many warning signs and symptoms, but they typically revolve around verbal and non-verbal communication difficulties, impaired social skills, and repetitive behaviors. Verbal warning signs and symptoms of autism: Slow to develop language skills. Repeats or echoes certain words or phrases. Has trouble expressing needs. Used to say a few words or babble, but doesn't anymore. Non-verbal warning signs and symptoms of autism: Avoids eye contact. Doesn t play pretend games. Reacts unusually to sights, smells, textures, and sounds. Doesn t seem to hear when others talk to him or her. Social warning signs and symptoms of autism: Appears uninterested in other people. Has trouble understanding or talking about feelings. Doesn t know how to talk to or play with others. Prefers not to be held or cuddled. Repetitive behavior warning signs and symptoms of autism: Has difficulty adapting to changes in routine. Shows unusual attachments to toys or other objects. Obsessively lines things up or arranges them in a certain order Repeats the same actions or movements over and over again. What to do if you 're worried If your young child or baby is delayed in any area or if you ve observed red flags or other warning signs for autism, schedule an immediate appointment with your pediatrician. In fact, it s a good idea to have your child screened by a doctor even if he or she is hitting the developmental milestones on schedule. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children receive routine developmental screenings, as well as specific screenings for autism at 9, 18, and 30 months of age. Autism Screening Online Screening Tools for Autism Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) Australian Scale for Asperger's Syndrome A number of specialized screening tools have been developed to identify children at risk for an autism spectrum disorder. Most of these screening tools are quick and straightforward, consisting of yes-or-no questions or a checklist of symptoms. The pediatrician should also get your feedback regarding your child s behavior. If you aren t asked about your specific concerns, don t be afraid to speak up. No one knows your child better than you. If the pediatrician sees possible signs of autism, your child should be referred to a specialist for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. Screening tools can t be used to make a diagnosis, which is why further assessment is needed. Getting Immediate Help for Your Child The diagnostic process for autism is tricky, and sometimes it can take awhile. But you don t have to wait for an official diagnosis before you begin to get help for your child. Ask your doctor to refer you to early intervention services. Early intervention is a federally-funded program for infants and toddlers with disabilities.

Alternative Names Pervasive developmental disorder - autism Causes Autism is a physical condition linked to abnormal biology and chemistry in the brain. The exact causes of these abnormalities remain unknown, but this is a very active area of research. There are probably a combination of factors that lead to autism. Genetic factors seem to be important. For example, identical twins are much more likely than fraternal twins or siblings to both have autism. Similarly, language abnormalities are more common in relatives of autistic children. Chromosomal abnormalities and other nervous system (neurological) problems are also more common in families with autism. A number of other possible causes have been suspected, but not proven. They involve: Diet Digestive tract changes Mercury poisoning The body's inability to properly use vitamins and minerals Vaccine sensitivity The exact number of children with autism is not known. A report released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that autism and related disorders are more common than previously thought. It is unclear whether this is due to an increasing rate of the illness or an increased ability to diagnose the illness. Autism affects boys 3 - 4 times more often than girls. Family income, education, and lifestyle do not seem to affect the risk of autism. Some parents have heard that the MMR vaccine children receive may cause autism. This theory was based, in part, on two facts. First, the incidence of autism has increased steadily since around the same time the MMR vaccine was introduced. Second, children with the regressive form of autism (a type of autism that develops after a period of normal development) tend to start to show symptoms around the time the MMR vaccine is given. This is likely a coincidence due to the age of children at the time they receive this vaccine. Several major studies have found NO connection between the vaccine and autism. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention report that there is no proven link between autism and the MMR vaccine, or any other vaccine. Some doctors believe the increased incidence in autism is due to newer definitions of autism. The term \"autism\" now includes a wider spectrum of children. For example, a child who is diagnosed with high-functioning autism today may have been thought to simply be odd or strange 30 years ago. Other pervasive developmental disorders include: Asperger syndrome (like autism, but with normal language development) Rett syndrome (very different from autism, and only occurs in females) Childhood disintegrative disorder (rare condition where a child learns skills, then loses them by age 10) Pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), also called atypical autism. Symptoms Most parents of autistic children suspect that something is wrong by the time the child is 18 months old and seek help by the time the child is age 2. Children with autism typically have difficulties in: Pretend play Social interactions Verbal and nonverbal communication Some children with autism appear normal before age 1 or 2 and then suddenly \"regress\" and lose language or social skills they had previously gained. This is called the regressive type of autism. People with autism may: Be overly sensitive in sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste (for example, they may refuse to wear \"itchy\" clothes and become distressed if they are forced to wear the clothes) Have unusual distress when routines are changed Perform repeated body movements Show unusual attachments to objects The symptoms may vary from moderate to severe. Communication problems may include: Cannot start or maintain a social conversation Communicates with gestures instead of words Develops language slowly or not at all Does not adjust gaze to look at objects that others are looking at Does not refer to self correctly (for example, says \"you want water\" when the child means \"I want water\") Does not point to direct others' attention to objects (occurs in the first 14 months of life) Repeats words or memorized passages, such as commercials Uses nonsense rhyming Social interaction: Does not make friends Does not play interactive games Is withdrawn May not respond to eye contact or smiles, or may avoid eye contact May treat others as if they are objects Prefers to spend time alone, rather than with others Shows a lack of empathy Response to sensory information: Does not startle at loud noises Has heightened or low senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste May find normal noises painful and hold hands over ears May withdraw from physical contact because it is overstimulating or overwhelming Rubs surfaces, mouths or licks objects Seems to have a heightened or low response to pain Play: Doesn't imitate the actions of others Prefers solitary or ritualistic play Shows little pretend or imaginative play Behaviors: \"Acts up\" with intense tantrums Gets stuck on a single topic or task (perseveration) Has a short attention span Has very narrow interests Is overactive or very passive Shows aggression to others or self Shows a strong need for sameness Uses repetitive body movements Exams and Tests All children should have routine developmental exams done by their pediatrician. Further testing may be needed if the doctor or parents are concerned. This is particularly true if a child fails to meet any of the following language milestones: Babbling by 12 months Gesturing (pointing, waving bye-bye) by 12 months Saying single words by 16 months Saying two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months (not just echoing) Losing any language or social skills at any age These children might receive a hearing evaluation, blood lead test, and screening test for autism (such as the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers [CHAT] or the Autism Screening Questionnaire). A health care provider experienced in diagnosing and treating autism is usually needed to make the actual diagnosis. Because there is no biological test for autism, the diagnosis will often be based on very specific criteria from a book called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV. An evaluation of autism will often include a complete physical and nervous system (neurologic) examination. It may also include a specific screening tool, such as: Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R) Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Childhood Autism rating Scale (CARS) Gilliam Autism Rating Scale Pervasive Developmental Disorders Screening Test - Stage 3 Children with known or suspected autism will often have genetic testing (looking for chromosome abnormalities) and may have metabolic testing. Autism includes a broad spectrum of symptoms. Therefore, a single, brief evaluation cannot predict a child's true abilities. Ideally, a team of different specialists will evaluate the child. They might evaluate: Communication Language Motor skills Speech Success at school Thinking abilities Sometimes people are reluctant to have a child diagnosed because of concerns about labeling the child. However, without a diagnosis the child may not get the necessary treatment and services. Treatment An early, intensive, appropriate treatment program will greatly improve the outlook for most young children with autism. Most programs will build on the interests of the child in a highly structured schedule of constructive activities. Visual aids are often helpful. Treatment is most successful when it is geared toward the child's particular needs. An experienced specialist or team should design the program for the individual child. A variety of therapies are available, including: Applied behavior analysis (ABA) Medications Occupational therapy Physical therapy Speech-language therapy Sensory integration and vision therapy are also common, but there is little research supporting their effectiveness. The best treatment plan may use a combination of techniques. APPLIED BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS (ABA) This program is for younger children with an autism spectrum disorder. It can be effective in some cases. ABA uses a one-on-one teaching approach that reinforces the practice of various skills. The goal is to get the child close to normal developmental functioning. ABA programs are usually done in a child's home under the supervision of a behavioral psychologist. These programs can be very expensive and have not been widely adopted by school systems. Parents often must seek funding and staffing from other sources, which can be hard to find in many communities. TEACCH Another program is called the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH). TEACCH was developed as a statewide program in North Carolina. It uses picture schedules and other visual cues that help the child work independently and organize and structure their environments. Though TEACCH tries to improve a child's adaptation and skills, it also accepts the problems associated with autism spectrum disorders. Unlike ABA programs, TEACCH programs do not expect children to achieve typical development with treatment. MEDICINE Medicines are often used to treat behavior or emotional problems that people with autism may have, including: Aggression Anxiety Attention problems Extreme compulsions that the child cannot stop Hyperactivity Impulsiveness Irritability Mood swings Outbursts Sleep difficulty Tantrums Currently, only risperidone is approved to treat children ages 5 - 16 for the irritability and aggression that can occur with autism. Other medicines that may also be used include SSRIs, divalproex sodium and other mood stabilizers, and possibly stimulants such as methylphenidate. There is no medicine that treats the underlying problem of autism. DIET Some children with autism appear to respond to a gluten-free or casein-free diet. Gluten is found in foods containing wheat, rye, and barley. Casein is found in milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Not all experts agree that dietary changes will make a difference, and not all studies of this method have shown positive results. If you are considering these or other dietary changes, talk to both a doctor who specializes in the digestive system (gastroenterologist) and a registered dietitian. You want to be sure that the child is still receiving enough calories, nutrients, and a balanced diet. OTHER APPROACHES Beware that there are widely publicized treatments for autism that do not have scientific support, and reports of \"miracle cures\" that do not live up to expectations. If your child has autism, it may be helpful to talk with other parents of children with autism and autism specialists. Follow the progress of research in this area, which is rapidly developing. At one time, there was enormous excitement about using secretin infusions. Now, after many studies have been conducted in many laboratories, it's possible that secretin is not effective after all. However, research continues. Support Groups For organizations that can provide additional information and help on autism, see autism resources. Outlook (Prognosis) Autism remains a challenging condition for children and their families, but the outlook today is much better than it was a generation ago. At that time, most people with autism were placed in institutions. Today, with the right therapy, many of the symptoms of autism can be improved, though most people will have some symptoms throughout their lives. Most people with autism are able to live with their families or in the community. The outlook depends on the severity of the autism and the level of therapy the person receives. Possible Complications Autism can be associated with other disorders that affect the brain, such as: Fragile X syndrome Mental retardation Tuberous sclerosis Some people with autism will develop seizures. The stresses of dealing with autism can lead to social and emotional complications for family and caregivers, as well as the person with autism. When to Contact a Medical Professional Parents usually suspect that there is a developmental problem long before a diagnosis is made. Call your health care provider with any concerns about autism or if you think that your child is not developing normally.

Our personalities, our consciousness, what makes us unique as humans and individuals is a function of the structure and function of the brain cells. Our personality is physiology. To be precise, it is the physiology of the cell membranes of each cell. Every cell in our body has a double layer of mostly fat and protein called a membrane which protects the cell and is what the cell uses to communicate with the outside world(other cells, blood, lymph, etc.) The cell membrane is where nutrients are let in and wastes are let out and where messages originate as nerve transmission or hormones that are sent into the bloodstream carrying messages to other cells in the body. So when the cell membranes of our brain cells are functioning normally, our personality, our feeling of wellbeing, our feelings of happiness;our entire perception of life is able to proceed as it should. We see, we recognize, we hear, we feel, we respond. We know that under certain conditions our perception of our interaction with the outside world can be altered. The drug LSD is essentially a poison that dissolves in the fat of the cell membranes and changes the normal function or ability of the brain cells to perceive reality. There is no increase of perception as is claimed by users, but an alteration of perception. The outside is perceived as different, because the cells can no longer process information as they would normally. In other words, under certain conditions, the persons ability to interact with his/her environment is impaired. In effect, ADHD and Autism are normal brain cell physiology gone wrong. What makes the physiology go wrong? As stated above about LSD, any toxic substance(most, if not all are fat soluble they dissolve in fat and not water) gaining access to the cell membrane will dissolve in and lodge in the fat(cell membranes are 50-60% fat) and in the brain cells the synapses, or where brain cells touch and communicate messages to each other, is 80% fat. In the case of autism, it is known that many in many cases, children were immunized with vaccines containing thimersal, a mercury containing preservative. Mercury is a very toxic metal that dissolves in the cell membrane and changes the membranes ability to function normally by changing the structural properties of the fats. It is the structural characteristics of the fats that allow the fats to function in such a way as to make normal physiology possible. Change the fats and you change function. Change the fats and you change physiology. Change the fats and you change perception. Change perception and you change reaction. In other words, you have inappropriate response to a normal input because the input is perceived as different than it really is. To an outside observer, the response is labeled ADHD or Autism. In the case of ADHD there is evidence that the strep bacteria may be a primary cause in many cases. The bacteria, if present, would cause disrupted function through toxic waste products dissolving in the cell membranes. How else can the structural /functional fats in the cell membranes be changed? So-called good fats are good because they possess the characteristics necessary to be incorporated into the body s anatomy(structure) that is able to function in normal body physiology. In fact, it is these characteristics, that made human physiology possible. In other words, good fats make thinking possible! These good or essential fats have the correct length and shape and correct location of special connections(bonds) between the carbon building blocks(atoms) of the fat. Conversely, bad fats , including the trans fats , as popularized in the media, have the wrong shape they are either too long, odd shaped or have the incorrect location of bonds between the carbon atoms. Good fats can be thought of as round pegs that fit the round holes of the body. Bad fats can be thought of as square pegs that don t fit the body s round holes. Good fats must be eaten to provide the building blocks essential to normal physiology and in the case of ADHD and Autism, to normal thinking. If you eat bad fats, the body has no choice but to take the bad fats and try to fit them into the cell membranes with disastrous effects. The body can t make good fats out of bad fats. The body makes good fats out of good fat building blocks. You can t think straight without good fats!!! Also, there are vitamins and minerals like B6 and zinc and magnesium that the body requires to properly use fats. So, Proper diet and toxins are essential factors in ADHD and Autism. Toxins must be located and eliminated if present. The diet must provide the essential building blocks and avoid items that contain bad fats and deplete minerals and or vitamins. Grains and soy products deplete minerals and contain proteins that irritate the cell membranes. Eating too many carbohydrates and sugars causes hormone imbalance and leads to irritation of the cell membranes. The Applied Kinesiology techniques of Contact Reflex Analysis and Body Restoration Technique afford us impressive noninvasive ways of analyzing people for the presence of toxins and nutritional deficiencies. brain Autism ADHD adhd LSD Contact Reflex Analysis Body Restoration Technique www.doctorjackson.org/health/adhd.cfm Autism11 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wendy-gordon/brain-drain-could-environ_b_499086.html It never occurred to me to worry about autism when I was pregnant in the '80s, but today it seems that few expectant parents haven't considered the possibility that autism might affect their child. In fact, the number of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been rising steadily, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now estimate that ASD affects about one in 110 children in the U.S. Science journalist, Catherine Zandonella, notes in an excellent essay on NRDC Simple Steps, that \"The cause of this rise in autism, which many studies have shown cannot be explained by changes in diagnosis methods, is still unknown. Although a few percent of ASD cases can be traced to inherited genes, our genes don't change dramatically over the span of just a few decades. One thing that has changed dramatically over the last several decades is human exposure to toxic chemicals and metals in the environment. Many of these chemicals and metals are known to affect the developing fetal brain. These include lead, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), arsenic, cadmium, and manganese. The developing brain is highly sensitive during the first three months of growth. In children who are susceptible, exposure to a neurotoxic metal or chemical during this window could confer a lasting change in brain structure and function. The chemicals known to cause harm to the developing fetal and infant brain are part of a larger family of 200 chemicals known from workplace studies to cause neurological harm in humans, according to a a recent review article by Philip J. Landrigan of the Children's Environmental Health Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine published in Current Opinion in Pediatrics. Children are exposed to roughly 3,000 chemicals in personal care products, building materials, cleaning products and motor vehicle fuels, yet fewer than 20 percent of these chemicals have been tested thoroughly to see if they harm the developing brain. \"We've created a situation where we are exposing our children and grandchildren every day to new chemicals that didn't exist [until recently],\" says Landrigan. \"We've never tested them, and we don't have a clue what these chemicals do to early development.\" Chemicals suspected of harming the developing brain include phthalates (found in personal care products), bisphenol A (BPA), (found in the linings of food cans), brominated flame retardants (found in old computers, television sets and foam padding), chlorinated solvents used in industry, the now-banned organochlorine pesticide DDT, and organophosphate pesticides. Although these chemicals have not been directly linked to ASD, the fact that they can cause learning and behavioral problems supports the idea that chemicals in the environment could cause ASD. How might environmental chemicals contribute to the risk of developing autism? One possibility is that these chemicals trigger ASD in children who inherited genes that make them susceptible to autism. These genes could be \"turned on\" or activated by an exposure in the womb, during childbirth, in early life, or during the toddler years. Another possibility is that chemicals in the environment cause spontaneous gene alterations, called \"de novo\" mutations because they arise anew rather than being inherited. Mutations are fairly common but normally our DNA-repair mechanisms keep them from causing disease. When DNA-repair mechanisms fail, these mutations can lead to diseases such as cancer. Several de novo mutations have been detected in children with ASD. Some of these mutations are in genes related to brain development. Environmental chemicals also could cause de novo mutations in the one or both of the parents. If these mutations occurred in egg or sperm cells, they could be passed on to the next generation. This could help explain why older fathers and mothers are more likely to give birth to a child with ASD. It may be that multiple factors contribute to the range of conditions we call ASD. Many researchers now view ASD as an array of related disorders with similar symptoms but potentially with different causes. More research is needed to explore the environmental aspects that contribute to the risk of developing ASD. Over a lifetime, the cost of care is estimated to reach $3.2 million per individual. Autism's costs are felt not just by the parents of children with ASD but also by society as a whole. I've excerpted here just parts of Zandonella's truly fascinating article on autism but encourage you to read it all, especially if you or someone you know is considering parenthood. It offers several very thoughtful suggestions for ways to reduce risks. brain mutations U.S. Mount Sinai School of Medicine Landrigan dna ASD CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Catherine Zandonella NRDC Simple Steps Philip J.

It represents the observations, views and opinions of the author, but is not a recommendation for treatment. Anyone reading it should consult his/her physician before considering treatment. The Origin of my Involvement/Interest I do not have an autistic child and do not treat autistic children. However, almost two years ago Bernie Rimland, director of the Autism Research Institute, (4182 Adams Avenue, San Diego, CA 92116) put me in contact with Victoria Beck of New Hampshire. She had recently discovered secretin was helping her autistic son, Parker. She had received two infusions of secretin for Parker at the University of Maryland, discovered a profound improvement in his autism and was refused further treatments. After an extensive search she found a doctor who would prescribe secretin for her, but could find no doctor who would infuse it. Bernie Rimland was familiar with my experience with bringing vitamins through the skin using DMSO and thought it might be helpful to Victoria. He thus put me in contact with her. This was the beginning of a delightful experience for me not only working the technical problems, but getting to know Victoria where the descriptors devoted mother, brilliant, and unselfish humanitarian can only partly and inadequately describe her. After many weeks of long frequent phone conversations with Victoria, the preliminary tests showed no toxic reaction to DMSO and finally she was successful with a transdermal application of secretin. This allowed her to continue with her secretin-autism treatment discovery. In my case, it got me fascinated with trying to understand the biochemistry of how secretin performed the task. This was also the subject of many conversations with Victoria, and I believe we made considerable progress. I am presently very pleased that at this point Victoria and her husband, Gary, are receiving the public recognition that they deserve with a review on Dateline in October 1998, and a feature article on the front pages of the NY Times and the Wall Street Journal, March, 1999. With the numerous people now gaining experience with the treatment, I am left with the memory of a delightful experience that I will always cherish. As the development of using secretin to treat autism matures, I see my role as having reached a state of completion since the next stage requires treating patients which I can not do. However, before I move on to other challenges totally, I have some additional thoughts/clarifications that I believe might be helpful for some. Transdermal Secretin I have been receiving many e-mail requests for a better understanding of how DMSO can be used for a transdermal application of secretin. I thought this information had already been provided by Victoria, but apparently not everyone can find it. I will thus try to present a brief, but adequate description here. In summary, I don't treat patients and thus can only repeat what I have been told. DMSO can transport secretin through the skin and into the blood stream efficiently enough to be effective for treating autism. The general approach is to wet the skin with DMSO (99.9% pure), apply some secretin powder, and then add more DMSO over it (using an eyedropper). It is not important what area of skin is used, but it may be desirable to vary the location to minimize the irritation to any one spot. Care must be taken to clean the skin so undesirable components are not transported into the blood stream along with the secretin. DMSO has a tendency to dehydrate the skin so some irritation may result. This can be remedied by dabbing on water or adding some water to the DMSO. I don't know if adding water to the DMSO will reduce the transfer of secretin. You will have to discover that for yourself. There is a question as to how efficient this is in terms of utilization of secretin. Experience has demonstrated that secretin is soluble enough in DMSO to be transported by it. However, there is some indications it is not highly soluble in DMSO. Thus, one suspects that the efficiency of use of secretin by this transdermal approach has room for improvement. This could be approached by simply using more DMSO, or by adding components that will increase its solubility in DMSO or going to a different transdermal carrier. Quantifying this should be a trivial exercise for a chemist familiar with transdermal transport technology and who also has a capability to perform the final test, the test as to how well it works on a patient. It is my belief that in the long run, transdermal application of secretin will prove to be far superior to infusions. Infusions inherently involve an invasive treatment and a large pulse of secretin that may give the patient problems. The transdermal approach, applying secretin more frequently in lower doses, should allow a more continual approach, resulting in less shock to the patient, and more capability to adjust the application rate in response to observed reactions. It also should result in a more efficient use of secretin. Given the attention it is now getting, I have little doubt that improved effective transdermal products will be arriving on the market in the near future. I should mention that the secretin you are using is not secretin. It is prosecretin. When hormones are synthesized in your body they are synthesized to the point of being the pro-hormone (prosecretin) and stored as such. They are thus in a position where they can dissociate, releasing the hormone rapidly, upon demand. The prosecretin is stored in the duodenum and disassociates to release secretin upon sensing the acid from the stomach. Secretin itself has a very short life in the blood stream. If secretin was used, it would not be effective because one would have to exercise an impossible level of control, applying it only when the stomach acid progresses to the duodenum. Since the secretin you are using is derived from pig duodenum, where it is was stored, it can be concluded without looking that it is prosecretin and not secretin. Thus, when it is applied it is selectively absorbed by your duodenum and stored for further use (by a wonderful, but not understood mechanism.) This brings a question to my mind: Is the synthetic secretin really secretin and not prosecretin and can that explain why it doesn't seem to be as effective? Intravenous Feeding-a Secretin Complement/Substitute? The best overall description I have found presenting a detailed overview of the biochemistry of secretin is presented in the Textbook of Medical Physiology by Guyton Hall, 1996, Published by the W.B. Sanders Company. The book presents the known effects of secretin, but does not address its recently discovered relationship to autism. Briefly, secretin is a hormone that has a multitude of effects, but the best understood effect and possibly the one that best explains its benefit to autistic children is its influence on the digestive system. Secretin stimulates the release of a bicarbonate flush from the the pancreas into the duodenum, as needed, which neutralizes the stomach acid as food makes its transit from the stomach to the intestine. However, this is more meaningful that first appears. This same bicarbonate flush also transports the digestive enzymes, synthesized in the pancreas, into the duodenum. They are necessary for digesting carbohydrates, proteins and fats. There is a similar bicarbonate flush in the bile ducts that helps to transport bile into the duodenum. The bile is necessary for emulsifying fats, making them digestible. A child lacking the ability to release secretin will have a multi-pronged attack on the digestive system. First, the unneutralized stomach acid will severely damage the intestine. Second, there will be a deficiency of digestive enzymes and bile to process food. It is no wonder that they often have stools that visually appear to contain undigested food of all types. With such a damaged digestive system, the absorption of nutrients from the intestine is severely impacted. This alone could explain the deterioration of mental function associated with autism. (There may be other effects also.) When secretin is infused, the first thing that happens is the stools turn normal, indicating a better functioning intestine. At this point the presentation of autism diminishes. There is another specially interesting point. The fact that the autism is greatly helped is also a positive statement that at least some forms of autism are reversible (in the earlier years). The mental dysfunction does not represent permanent neurological damage. The autistic children that exhibit severe dietary restrictions-willing to eat a very limited number of foods, familiar to most mothers of autistic children, are the set that should be helped by secretin. There is another set that can eat anything. These children are probably not suffering from a digestive problem, probably do not lack secretin, and are probably the ones that are not helped by secretin. An alternative or complement to secretin treatment: There is an ongoing debate as to whether the repair of the digestive system due to well known effects of secretin is sufficient to explain all of its benefits for treating autism, or if there are also some critical direct effects on the brain. It occurred to me that there is a highly developed technology called intravenous feeding that has kept people alive for months and even years. Evidently, it has been developed to the extent where it can provide a complete, sufficiently nutritional input. I propose that if the sole benefit of secretin is to remedy the digestive system and thus the nutritional input to the autistic child, then intravenous feeding should accomplish the same task and give the same results. As a scientist, I find this to be a fascinating experiment with inconvenience, but no known health risk to the child. I also believe that it could provide a reasonable alternative for some patients. It is easy to criticize this concept in its early stages due to the inconvenience of present intravenous feeding methods. However, never short change the inventors. If it is shown to be effective, I am confident that methods that improve convenience will surface. I suspect that if this intravenous treatment shows promise for treating autism, we will discover that using it in combination with secretin treatments to be more effective than using either alone. Stem Cell Treatment - A Cure? This exciting technology is very new and is proceeding to be explored with a speed similar to what happened with secretin, but is approximately a year behind. As with secretin, reports of the latest developments are discovered in news releases, not journals. During the many phone discussions that Victoria and I had, there was a time a little over a year ago when Victoria mentioned that she heard a rumor that there were two cases where the autistic children also had leukemia. When they received a bone marrow transplant as part of the treatment for Leukemia, they no longer appeared to be autistic. This was a rumor and we could not trace it. It had been discounted because no one could make sense out of it. However, it continued to bother me. It may have been true, and if so, what was going on? Then I suddenly realized what must have happened if these reports were true. The bone marrow transplant would have put an entirely new set of genetic material into the child from someone who was not autistic and this was enough to correct the disease. The rumors could make technical sense. The doctors had performed a successful genetic transplant and did not recognized it! I got back to Victoria with this, and encouraged her to make another effort to trace the rumors. She tried, but failed. This insight still bothered me because it suffered from another problem. I was unable to identify the specific biochemical mechanism by which the new genes where able to take control of and thus provide for adequate production of secretin. I let this drop temporarily because I could not see any way to take it further. However, in the past several months I have become aware of what appears to be the beginning of a medical miracle. It started with the discovery that cord blood (umbilical cord blood) from the birth of a baby, which is normally disposed of, is an exceptionally rich source of stem cells. It is also exceptionally easy to obtain, non intrusively, and plentifully. It is normally disposed of. It was also found that it could be used for bone marrow transplants. In fact, it appeared to be easier to achieve a match that would avoid immune rejection, typical of transplants, than using the marrow extracted from an adult donor. Abruptly another light turned on and I understood not just why the cord blood could be used for bone morrow transplants but how it can and does introduce new genetic material that can spread not just to the bone marrow of the recipient, but also to every organ of the body. It can then function as new cells in those organs with the new genetic material of the donor. With this insight, one would logically conclude that it was a very promising treatment method for autism and numerous other genetically carried diseases, whether the genetic malfunction was inherited or caused later by a chemical insult such as a vaccination. Some Key Developments Concepts: 1. The newly discovered availability of stem cells from cord blood: The discovery that the blood saved from the umbilical cord from the birth of a child was rich in stem cells and could be used for bone marrow transplants was the key turning point for this technology. There is already a national cell bank for bone marrow transplants, but obtaining such bone marrow is not easy on the donor. This new discovery opened up a vista of genetic diversity for the bank that is almost unlimited and totally nonintrusive on the donor. It is a thrown away waste product (or at least was so formally). 2. Stem cell differentiation: When stem cells are injected into the blood stream they are carried everywhere in the body and stick in various organs, possibly all of them, not just the bone marrow. Once they take up residence in any particular organ, they look around, identify the type of organ they should be, and go through a process called differentiation where they start forming that type of cells. This process of differentiation has been well studied and documented. Thus, they can form new cells, containing the new genetic information of the injected cells, in every organ of the body. At this point they share occupancy of the organ with the original cells in a way that is not understood and will certainly be the subject of future research. In the case of a bone marrow transplant, the original cells have been destroyed and they form new marrow cells, which is easy to detect. Their presence in other organs that are functioning is more difficult to detect. However, if the original, host cells have a genetic defect that is causing a disease, there is no reason to believe the new cells will have it (provided the donor doesn't), and the new cells thus have an opportunity to compensate for the defect by manufacturing the missing enzymes that are necessary for normal, healthy function of the organ - such as the production of secretin. Upon looking at the mechanism, it is clear that its potential, if it meets expectations, goes far beyond the treatment of autism. 3. Bone marrow destruction was found not to be necessary: I was concerned that the process carried out in a bone marrow transplant, the risky initial destruction of the host bone marrow, might be necessary to minimize the threat of rejection. However, another person watching a news program I missed said that it reported that bone marrow destruction had been found to be unnecessary for a successful treatment. 4. Transplant unusually compatible: A reason has been identified that explains the ease of use of cord blood for transplants. The stem cells are so young that they have not yet gone through the process of identifying what should be host cells and what should be foreign cells. Thus, they will not reject the new host, which is a problem with conventional bone marrow transplants. We are aware of the transplant problem of a transplanted organ being rejected by the immune system of the new host. However, it is not as commonly known that for bone marrow transplants, there is an additional risk of the new, transplanted cells forming an immune system that rejects the new host. This does not happen with stem cells from cord blood, helping greatly with the process. Beyond this, if these new cells do form an immune identification system, it will be in the host body, recognizing that body as normal. It is also possible that this adaptation will be sufficient for the existing host immune system to recognize the new cells as normal and not foreign. Much of this latter postulation needs confirmation. 5. The first test on an autistic child may have already happened: I have taken the opportunity to discuss this potential medical miracle with many people over the past few months. In one recent case the person told me he heard a report on television that stated that an autistic child had already been treated with stem cells and the results were successful and long lasting (so far). 6. The chemical complexity of the disease is no longer an issue: If one looks at the complexity of chemical processes taking place in any one cell, it is far beyond comprehension. Trying to design an approach to correct an individual process, or several of them, is truly a formidable task. However, one must remember that our genes do this on a daily basis with what appears to be the greatest of ease. So many genetically based diseases appear to involve extremely complex chemistry, only a small part of which can be identified. How can we hope to perform a correction in the middle of this morass. If we try to design it, we have an extremely difficult time indeed. However, a genetic correction with a complete complement of new, healthy genes has the potential of performing corrective tasks of almost unlimited, self directed complexity with the ease with which a healthy cell normally carries them out. Thus, even though the biochemical basis for diseases such as autism seem impossibly complex, they are not too complex for correction by genetic modification. In fact, one can easily arrive the conclusion that this approach is realistically the only possible approach for curing genetically carried diseases. If it works for inherited genetic diseases, we have no reason to believe won't work equally well for diseases caused by genetic damage occurring after birth by a chemical insult such as a vaccination. This should further illuminate why the medical research community is becoming so excited about this discovery. 7. Due to the ease of stem cell availability, the safety of experimentation, and the profound potential, stem cell research is progressing very rapidly and is probably now taking place at every medical research establishment in the world. With this in mind, many of the unanswered questions should get answered quickly along with confirmations of successful treatments and initial identification of limitations. It appears that the most recent discoveries may be reported in the news before they reach the journals. Over a year ago when I first talked to Victoria and learned of her secretin discovery, upon taking a close look at it I concluded that was so technically sound that it was truly a world class medical discovery which would eventually be validated and wrote her a letter to that effect. This has come to pass. I have a similar belief about this technology. It seems to be technically sound and about a year behind secretin in its development. We can expect that the next year will tell the story, or at least a large part of it. It will be an exciting year, and hopefully a promising one for the parents of autistic children and the children themselves. It really may be the long term or even permanent cure for autism. I would be delighted to learn if any of these concepts get tested. It may also be sensible to add a section of testimonials to this Health Note so others can learn of the results also. So, please e-mail me if you think it is appropriate. I won't post any testimonials with your name without your permission. Responses/Comments 1) 3/12/99-I received a phone call from a mother who told me: 1) She started with infusions of secretin with her son and they were helpful, but when she changed to the transdermal approach using DMSO, which allowed her to use frequent, small doses, the effectiveness of the treatment improved dramatically. 2) She found that adding some water to the DMSO improved the solubility of the secretin and improved the effectiveness of the treatment. 3) At one point in her life her father was very ill and she went through a long period where she had to feed him at home intravenously. She thought that if the intravenous feeding approach was successful in treating autism or simply helped with it, it would not be an unreasonable option. 2) 3/18/98-I received an e-mail from a lady who said that on a number of occasions she had the opportunity to observe autistic children who had been admitted to the hospital for problems other than autism and had been put on intravenous feeding. She observed that their autism seemed to improve very noticeably, and when the intravenous feeding was terminated, the autism returned to its original characteristics. This may be a promising indication that intravenous feeding may be found to be quite helpful. 3) 3/18/98-I talked to a doctor from a stem cell treatment center ( he did not want to be identified) and he believed that it would not be possible to conduct a successful stem cell treatment without first severely suppressing the immune system of the host, such as destroying the bone marrow. Otherwise, he was confident that the immune system of the host would rapidly destroy the infused stem cells. He was very interested in tracking down the rumored cases of autistic children receiving a bone marrow transplant (for cancer) and then not being so autistic. If anyone could help with that, please do. 4) 3/23/99 - Stem cell Storage: Cord blood can be stored by California Cryobank. You can learn all about them on their web site: www.cryobank.com. 5) 4/9/99 - I received an e-mail from a mother with an autistic son. She said he did not respond to treatment with secretin. However, following the concept of nutritional deficiency being the primary cause, she went though a process (with her doctor) focusing on replacing the intestinal flora. A flora consisting of healthy (good) bacteria is essential for producing many essential nutrients. When it gets taken over by bad bacteria, which often happens, it results in a severe nutritional deficiency. This is well know by all doctors, and there are procedures to correct this including using yogurt and formulations available at health food stores. When she followed this procedure, the autism symptoms were greatly reduced. 6) 4/9/99- I have a new insight concerning stem cell treatment in an attempt to achieve a cure for autism (or any other genetically carried disease). I believe the basic concept presented above is correct, except I think a bone marrow transplant, involving the initial killing of the patient's existing bone marrow and replacing it with the new (healthy) cells, will be required for not just one, but two essential reasons. 1) It is probably true that it will necessary to totally suppress the immune system (by totally killing the bone marrow) of the patient to avoid it killing the new stem cells (with new, healthy genes). 2) The new bone marrow, consisting of the new, transplanted, healthy genes will serve as a continuous, long-term, resupply of cells with healthy genes that go everywhere in the body. The red blood cells don't have a nucleus and thus don't carry the healthy genes. However, the white blood cells do. They are also taken up by every organ in the body as part of our distributed immune system. Some of them are likely to dedifferentiate into the organ cells themselves, resulting in the organs now having a component of cells with healthy genes. In time, due to the continuous resupply from the blood (bone marrow) this fraction should grow. I believe this continuous resupply mechanism will be essential for this genetic modification process to sustain itself. 7) 12/16/99 An article just appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine reporting on a study where treatment with synthetic human secretin was found to be ineffective in helping autism. I send the following e-mail response: Adrian D. Sandler, et al e-mail: adsandler@pol.net Re: Lack of Benefit of a Single Dose of Synthetic Secretin in the Treatment of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder The New England Journal of Medicine, December 9, 1999, Vol. 341, No. 24 Dear Sirs, You have carried out the wrong experiment and have given the incorrect impression that treatment of autism with secretin is ineffective. Because of the broad distribution of your paper, it has the potential of causing considerable harm and suffering. Let me explain: The only form of secretin that has ever been effective has been prosecretin, not secretin. For years, the extraction of secretin from pig duodenum has been missnamed secretin when it is actually prosecretin . This makes all the difference in the world. Prosecretin can be very effective and secretin has no chance of being effective. I anticipated that this misunderstanding would eventually cause problems in the focus of those attempting to make a synthetic version and discussed it many months ago on my web page: www.krysalis-sparx.com Briefly: If you want to review the difference between a hormone and a prohormone I would suggest you read a treatment of it in Guyton Hall, Textbook of Medical Physiology ninth edition, 1996. Hormones are synthesized in the body initially as large molecules which are sequentially broken into smaller molecules which eventually leads to the prohormone. The prohormone is then stored in cells for ready use. When called upon, it makes the final transformation releasing the hormone itself. This can be done rapidly because only one simple step remains. Hormones are not stored in the tissue, prohormones are. Thus, the extraction of secretin from the tissue of the duodenum of pigs is prosecretin, not secetin. The autism community is well aware that the pig extraction works and the synthetic products don't. I am confident that this is because the wrong form of secretin has been synthesized, which is the basis of your study. Secretin: Secretin is synthesized in the duodenum where it is stored as prosecretin. When the stomach acid (in chime) contacts the duodenum, the stored prosecretin releases secretin which then stimulates the pancreas to release a bicarbonate flush into the duodenum, neutralizing the stomach acid. This flush also takes place in the bile ducts. The flush sweeps in with it the digestive enzymes as will as bile. Both are essential for digestion of food. Once the secretin is released, it is very rapidly removed from the blood, after doing its job. An injection of pure secretin will simply overstimulate the pancreas, briefly, possibly causing damage, and then vanish. Since it is not stored, it can have no lasting effect. The only release of secretin that can be beneficial is one that is timed properly with the arrival of stomach acid in the duodenum. It would be impossible to time injections usefully. When an infusion is made with prosecretin it remains in the blood long enough to allow the cells of the duodenum to recognize it and assimilate it. It is then stored in the duodenum cells for release as needed, perfectly timed with the arrival of acidic chime from the stomach. One class of autistic children are characterized by tolerating only a very limited diet. When treated with prosecretin from pig duodenum, not only is their autism improved, but also their stools change from being whitish, full of undigested food and fat, into normal looking stools. This is the common observation of many mothers. It would thus appear that a major contributing factor to one class of autism is the severe lack of nutrition entering the blood and thus getting to the brain. An injection of prosecretin corrects this, allowing greatly improved nutritional support to the brain, mitigating the autism. It does not appear to completely eliminate the autism, but I have received numerous e-mails from mothers who have found the benefits sufficiently dramatic to never want to go back to the pre prosecretin treatment world. This is brief, but leads to a hope: Your have made a start and it is now time to finish the job with at least two steps: 1. rerun your experiments with prosecretin and add stool measurements to your diagnostics. 2. Alert the company synthesizing secretin that they need to make prosecretin instead. This will change an impotent product into a potent one. I should also comment that if such a product is made it will have broader application than just autism. I know a woman who has severe irritable bowel syndrome and has similar stools (containing obviously undigested food). I suspect she is also having a secretin problem. The consequence for her is severe depression instead of autism. David Gregg, PhD krysalis@value.net; www.krysalis-sparx.com; Ph/Fax: 925-284-5434 UPDATE 1/01 Connection with Crohn's Disease Web Page: We have made what might be a very helpful connection between Crohn's Disease and Autism, resulting in a clearly identified treatment possibility. To read about it see my Crohn's Disease web page linked at the top of this web page. Go to the end for Update 1/01. Breaking the Vicious Cycle by Elaine Gottschall: As part of this, I would strongly urge everyone with an autistic child to purchase and read the book: Breaking the Vicious Cycle by Elaine Gottschall. It's primary focus is intestinal disorders as related to Crohn's Disease, but it applies directly to the class of autistic children that have associated severe intestinal problems. These are also those that are responsive to treatment with secretin. The book focuses primarily on a particular cause for the disorders, the inability to fully digest complex carbohydrates. This not only minimizes their nutritional value to the person, but the undigested carbohydrates then feed the wrong type of intestinal bacteria, which then can produce toxins that further damage not only the intestine, but can get into the blood stream and even do brain damage. The dietary limitations and responses are exactly the same as those so many parents have reported for their autistic children. It clearly explains why the children have the limitations, and why this could affect mental function. It also presents easily followed dietary approaches that have been shown to reverse the problem. It is a must for every parent of an autistic child. It may not be the total solution, but it definitely should be included as part of the solution. UPDATE 2/01 Subject: tell you how wonderful that pig duodenum has been both for myself and my autistic son, Adam. It has totally taken away all of his gastric upsets, which were considerable. As a result , he is so much calmer and happier. He has the fragile x syndrome , which is a genetic cause of his autism and mental retardation, so he has many different problems. The pig duodenum has totally alleviated a major physical one. I am ever so grateful. I myself have always had digestive upsets and problems. Now I find the duodenum really takes away ALL of the symptoms. Considering with my son, all of the expensive and time-consuming things I have tried over the years have been no help at all, so this is truly a miracle, as it works. I thank you so much, and I thank my brother-in-law Robert Myers for introducing me to your site. Sincerely, Hi David, I am completely blown away after reading your article outlining the DMSO/Chron's disease connection you have posted. You have put a lot of research into this area with a lot of open minded insight. For me this is really, really exciting. My son, James, has been diagnosed as autistic spectrum disorder since 3 and is now 7. Since his neurological workup was normal but he had a neurologically based disorder we were obviously confused and saddened. However, when bringing up his the fact he has had long standing, chronic allergies (skin, sinus, anti phlactic, digestive, etc.) the team of medical pros said that allergies and autism do not have a link. He was a really well baby who deteriorated into a really ill two year old. So we went to work on his body. If anything we wanted to make him feel better - development aside. Our philosophy is that if you don't feel well, and feel really, really unwell at such a young and important age, how can typical development happen. I mean you body is working so hard on infection, disease process, inflammation, allergies, etc. how can you expect perfection? Well over the course of years (literally 6) we set about correcting all of the little problems we could. One at a time. One year of anti-fungal for candida, athletes foot, ringworm, etc. Another 4 years working on allergies - food intolerances - which is a complete joke. Once you remove foods at the rate he was becoming sensitive we had nothing left to feed him. And along the way somewhere we realized he had some sort of bowel disorder. It was sad. We had accepted James's subtle and changing bowel habits all along the way as being normal for James. He was our first child and he seemed to slowly develop symptoms along the way. Remember, he could not express himself with words since the major area of developmental delay was lack of communication. Another sad point is, he gave up ever feeling well. I am sure he had many, many miserable bouts of chron's disease or inflammatory bowel disorder and just went along without realizing what it was to feel well. Researching possible treatments for James we (of course) ran across Secretin. Well, as with any other method or protocol we had to access it if it was appropriate for James. His body is his own and we will not inflict any plan on him just because it worked for another child with the same label. Well Secretin made sense since he had so many errors in digestion. We had just completed the anti fungal and had a upper and lower GI workup (not easy to talk the doc into) and had a very rude awakening. He had extreme gastroenteritis coupled with severe constipation...very upsetting to realize this was what he was really living with. We went to our other doctor and with great cooperation found secretin (human synthetic) and had it compounded into a transdermal application. With James's history of allergies human synthetic secretin was the most responsible choice in case he wold be allergic to any of the properties of the porcine product. The compound form contains the secretin in a base of DMSO. We applied the topical secretin every other day or so for 3 months more or less. Well it was really helpful, but from time to time it was too hot . Meaning we only gave it to him if he needed the digestive support. Sometimes he developed loose stools if we gave him too much. However, physically he was feeling much, much better. We slowed down the applications to an as needed basis according to his physical need to support digestion. On another note, several months later I re-read some information exclusive to dietary intervention for autistics how a gluten/casein free diet may be helpful as a biological intervention in improving autism. . In the front of the book it mentions a metabolic disorder of the phenol sulphur transferase enzyme group in kids with developmental disorders where they do not have enough free sulphur ions in the body to detox phenolic compounds. The overload of phenolic toxins and overload causes trouble in many ways - developmentally, attention, behavior, etc. James fit the criteria for a deficiency of the detoxification pathway by many of the physical features common in the disorder. Night sweats, red ears, facial flushing etc. Well this is really, really significant since one of the most phenolic compounds available is anti-histamines. And James, unfortunately, had been taking an antihistamine EVERY day for SIX years to control his uncontrollable allergies. At the time the book was written in the early 1990's the only thing to do for this phenomenon is to remove phenolic foods from the diet to relieve the enzymes enough to do a better job. This is because in the early 1990's sulphur was not something readily available for supplementation. Parents were doing Epsom salt baths (magnesium sulphate) hoping for some transfer of the sulphur to the body. WELL, IT DAWNED ON ME IMMEDIATELY, THE DMSO USED IN THE TOPICAL SECRETIN IS SULPHUR. We may have introduced the answer for James's body to heal and not realized it! The human synthetic secretin may not have been nearly as important as the DMSO preparation for supporting James metabolic inefficiency to detoxify phenolic compounds by addding sulphur to body system. The biologically available DMSO metabolite which is 38% sulphur which is a convenient supplement free of side-effects and virtually non-allergic. I researched the benefits of MSM and it's compadability for James' condition and went ahead and made the choice to use the supplement in place of his allergy medicines. On Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday, January 2001, we took the jump and removed anti-histamines from James's daily routine and substituted MSM. 'Bout 3 grams a day between morning and lunch. We use crystals mixed in 7-up - he loves it. Well, only 6 weeks later it has been nothing short of a miracle. It seems that the DMSO healed his gut and daily MSM has picked up the rest of the work. I am going to make a long list of benefits we have noticed/enjoyed: Allergies are 95 - 99% relieved. That includes nasal (chronic sinusitis), eczema, plugged ears, headaches, dark circles around the eyes, nervous system involvement including hearing and vision disruptions, coughing SNORING, night sweats, and a long list of other small things, Appetite has increased.. he has grown from a size 5 youth to a size 10 youth. He has gained 17 pounds and grown 3 inches since we started DMSO/secretin and MSM over 6 months now, He has NORMAL digestion and elimination. Regular, normal bowel movements, PAIN FREE. He does not seem to have reflux or acid indigestion. HE HAS ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY. He does not seem fatigued anymore and has the normal little boy rhythms that we like to see. His cheeks are pink again. Gone are the dark circles and pale complexion his blood tests showed anemia more than once over the years ) He is HAPPY and outgoing. He wants and has friends now. For his 7th birthday we had a party (first one ever) with 9 friends. He goes to play at his friends house alone and has them over to play after school. His language is improving... he suffers less and less from brain fog . Phenols are also natural in the body as by products of normal neurological and hormonal metabolism. Without the detoxification pathway for phenols operating you get alot of buildup that translates into static . This reduction of static alone accounts for most of James incredible leaps in development. He hears better, sees better and reacts to stimulus in a normal fashion. Only people familiar with autism will interpret the significance of this one, however, for James the improvement has been very, very dramatic. He has discontinued Occupational therapy at school. Actually he was discharged. In September he could not hold a pencil in his hand and is now writing at age level, using scissors like the other kids and no longer needs therapy! He is moving into his mainstream classroom more and more. He has library and PE with them and enjoys it very much! He is academically at the first grade level now. His language, especially expressive, has improved sooooo much. Remember he only had 10 or so words a year ago and now speaks sentences out loud. He still has a long way to go with articulation, but he is improving EVERY DAY!. Physically, he has lost a lot of water weight. He seemed to have an all over inflammatory condition which was not exactly only in his intestines. He has a rounded face and chubby, baby fat like arms and legs. Now, we can see (after an initial 2 week detox of lots of fluid) that his muscle tone has improved somewhat. This is important too since he had another condition called hypotonia on his upper body. His skin is gorgeous. He had allergic eczema rashes over most of his body. It is gone. Literally gone. Looking back I can see where the DMSO was critical to get his digestion healed. Looking forward I can see MSM being a supplement for the rest of his life. If there is such a thing as a sulphur deficiency and how amino acids are metabolized I can say that was what James had. He had so many sub-clinical errors in his health that wholly the only possible explanation is that he was not getting nourishment to his body. Since sulphur supports the digestive tract and the turnover of cells it would seem to reason that if the cycle of health would be adversely effected without sufficient amounts of the substance sulphur. Our next addition to the plan is pig duodenum (however you spell it) and 1 mcg. of melatonin nightly. I contacted you David after we experienced all of these benefits after a random search of the net for Autism/MSM to see if anyone else had noticed these benefits.....well imagine my surprise when I found your website about DMSO and chrone's disease. Thanks again. Just another note. While James is not cured of anything - the door now is wide open for a full recovery now that his body is well and he can benefit like never before from therapies available to him. We expect a full recovery of lost time from ill health. We never really bought into the fact that a child with a normal neurological workup could actually have a neurologically based, irreversible, incurable disorder without the world knowing the cause or offering a cure..... I never bought it for a single minute. See, James was well when he was born, he will be well and whole again. No question about it here. Take care, I will be in touch! Wendy krysalis@krysalis.net Hello Mr. Gregg, James is doing really well. We have started slowly with the Pig Duodenum - about a tsp. every 4/5 days. He has had alot of improvements so far - better language especially! We would like to dose as needed but are at a loss as to how to determine when he needs it. His bowels get touchy sometimes, however, we don't think it is too much of a problem! Talk to you soon, Wendy Frye UPDATE 8/01 Summary update from Lynn Beebe, grandfather of the first autistic child to try dietary pig duodenum powder (which I sent to him). Subject: postable 8/30/01 To: David Gregg, krysalis@value.net David, Below you will see portions of some emails that I sent previously along with some notes and the last section is new today. You may post any or all of these if you wish. Lynn Date: Saturday, June 17, 2000 Dear David, You may recall I sent two emails to you on 5/1/00 and you were kind enough to send your old sample of pig duodenum. A four year old autistic grandchild is taking about a tablespoon per meal and his parents report more solid stools. No hard science here but they seem willing to continue as the one day they skipped the dose the stools became loose. You said you could check with your supplier to see if the product was still available. Please do that and advise me. Thank you very much for your help, Lynn Beebe (Grandpa). Date: Sunday, June 18, 2000 Hi David, My wife and I saw the boy yesterday. Usually we visit him every three or four weeks. There is always progress evident due to the good amount of ABA type attention he is getting. This time I saw more social interaction, more eye contact and a definite enjoyment (smiling and laughing) as he went down the slide with his sister as opposed to his usual subtle enjoyment sliding alone. I did suggest uping the dose but his parents are cautious....Lynn. David, Over the past year our daughter managed to get four secretin infusions for her son. She stopped using the PD during that three month period. The infusions were beneficial but did not give the consistant gut function that using the PD provides. I have been searching for a test to determine if my grandson produces enough of his own secretin but no such test is available. It has finally occured to me that stool pH may be an indicator for the bicarbonate output of the pancreas and liver. I have sent some litmus paper to our daughter, range 0 to 13, and will let you know the results....Lynn. Subject: porcine duodenum and stool pH Date: Saturday, August 25, 2001 David, Our daughter was feeding her son one tablespoon of free-dried PD per meal when she started measuring stool pH. After getting pH 5 (using 0-13 litmus paper) for several days she increased his intake to 2 tablespoons per meal. The result was pH 6 to 7 the next day along with a jump in verbal activity. After a couple more days she increased to 3 tablespoons and the pH went to the 8 to 9 range. I told her to cut back and try to keep pH in the 7 range. So far it looks like the PD may be useful for controlling stool pH. I'm sure you already know that pancreatic enzyme activity is sensitive to pH and drops off rapidly with increased acidity in the duodenum. I think it would be interesting to test stool pH on your friends with Crohn's or any other GI problems to see if they might be candidates for PD. Apparently not all autistic kids have acid stools so they may not all benefit from PD......Lynn Subject: Re: porcine duodenum and stool pH Date: Sunday, August 26, 2001 3:15 PM David, Just talked to the daughter on the phone and she is still very convinced she can control the stool pH with the duodenum. I have revised my ideas for people using synthetic secretin. I now suggest they first take pH measurements on stools for a few days. If the pH is in the acid range, they should give a tiny amount of secretin transdermally (thanks to David Gregg) about 60 to 90 minutes after every meal to get the stool pH neutral or slightly alkaline so that enzymes will function properly and that the gut will left alkaline. Since a kid's secretin producing cells are triggered by acid, it is silly to leave the gut acid inbetween meals and expect it to function properly when the stomach next empties. They can then take the balance of their daily amount of secretin left over from the every meal application and use it in one more application when the child goes to bed. Lynn Date: Wednesday, August 29, 2001 David, In my notes to you I have focused on my grandson's gut function. It has been my belief that if we keep that function close to normal then his body stands the best chance of healing his mind and body. Thanks to the porcine duodenum you provided and our new found ability to judge his pancreas output using litmus paper to measure stool pH, we have a way to keep gut function normal. And while it is comforting to know that John's stomach acid is no longer trying to destroy his intestines, causing him pain, and decreasing his digestion and absorption of vital nutrients, it is also very pleasing to note his behavioral progress. He does much less stimming, has a larger vocabulary (a year ago had none, now one of his words is Granpa), is happier, plays and interacts with others, and has obviously improved eye contact. On my last visit, about two weeks ago, he approached me, took me by the hand and led me out on the back porch to play. I was really surprised when, without any prompting, he looked up into my eyes for over five seconds. We are expecting more rapid progress now that we have a way to keep his GI tract near normal. I should suggest that what we do may not be appropriate for all autistic children. Since our first objective is getting normal GI function, I think every parent should be testing stool pH to determine whether or not their child's pancreas and liver are dumping enough bicarbonate after every meal to neutralize the acid chyme coming from the stomach. If the stool pH is nearly neutral (6.8 to 7.3), then I see no reason to eat PD with meals. However, if the pH is 6 or less, supplimenting every meal with one tablespoon of the freeze-dried porcine duodenum may be a good starting point. The increase or decrease in amount of PD can be judged from the next day pH measurement. You can increase the PD until the pH is about 7. If you have any trouble finding pH paper, as I did, you can get pH strips from McMaster Carr (732)-329-3772 or www.mcmaster.com. Part number 8707T11 tests pH from 0 - 13 and costs $8.89. I ordered from their web site and they shipped the next day. Total cost was about $12.50 with shipping. Many parents are not familiar with the secretin cycle and enzyme function and the pH system. I should write a study guide to give people a basic understanding. I'll give a try later this week. While I think it would be great if everyone with GI problems, whether Crohn's or UC or whatever, would do the stool pH testing, I should mention that people with cystic fibrosis who are pancreatic insufficient should not use the PD to stimulate the pancreas because the PD may also stimulate the pancreas to excrete enzymes which won't leave the pancreas if they are totally unable to produce the bicarbonate that flushes out the enzymes. Thank you again David for all your help.

As far as an adult with autism goes, Jeff Hudale is kinda the poster-child. He\ufffds been in studies, sat on state task forces and is active in the autism community. He was in his teens, misdiagnosed with schizophrenia when doctors found that he actually had autism. He ended up graduating from The University of Pittsburgh with a degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering. He got a job at a small firm and didn\ufffdt disclose his disability. More on autism: Visit our Autism page. Jeff: About a year after I was hired that I guess I was doing something for them one day in the office and my hands must have been flapping about something and she asked, Jeff are you autistic? And I immediately was startled, I thought, Oh No, I\ufffdm going to get fired. He didn\ufffdt. But a few years later, he was laid off. He spent decade looking for work in his field. He applied for jobs. Jeff: During an interview, sometimes my eyes would drift away and some people think if I wasn t looking directly at them that I wasn t being honest with them but then again a lot of people don\ufffdt really understand that\ufffds one of our little idiosyncrasies. Jeff is a higher-functioning autistic \ufffd book smart, great with numbers, an avid conversationalist. A few years ago he got a job at BNY Mellon Corporation. Jeff: Its great to be fully employed but I feel that my skills are not really being utilized properly. His is a common concern among high-functioning autistic adults. They can get through college. But when they get jobs they flunk coffee break. Phil: I\ufffdve never held a job for more than about a year and a half in my life. I simply cannot maintain employment. And the problem has to do with always with social issues, every job I have had they say. Phil your good at that job. All the performance reviews say, Phil your really good at that job. And, We can\ufffdt keep you. That\ufffds Phil Garrow. He\ufffds 46 and has Asperger\ufffds. Phil: One of the great sadnesses in my life is that I have received all of this training, I ve gone to school. I\ufffdm a mechanical engineer. I m a computer scientist. I\ufffdve gone to school. And that I can\ufffdt hold a job because of social reasons, no matter how good I am at those skills, no matter how much money, no matter how much time I ve spent in therapy and other types of training. I can\ufffdt tell you how sad that makes me. Much of the attention focused on autism has to do with childhood. But autism is a lifelong disorder. We spend most of our lives as adults. And we spend much of our adulthood working. Caitlan Freedman is 30. She\ufffds Phil\ufffds partner. Caitlan: Autism is a different disability than being blinded or losing the use of one\ufffds limbs. It is what s called a social disability. The traits that might drive others away from them, brought the pair together. Phil: There is an understanding that we have of each other\ufffds sensory and social needs. Phil says the hardest hurdle is the intolerance people display towards adults with autism. He has what he calls a blindness, he can\ufffdt pick up on social cues. Phil: People build libraries about what works and what doesn\ufffdt work. If you miss those clues starting at birth, then you don\ufffdt build those libraries. Or the libraries are much harder to build. The failures in building those libraries, as one gets older, are much more dramatic. If a two-year-old misses a visual clue you say, ahh, they\ufffdre 2 years old. If a four-year-old misses them, again you say, ahh. If a 44-year-old misses them, you say, That guy why didn t he shoulda oh boy, you know. That\ufffds a big thing. That\ufffds a problem. It\ufffds a common problem that professionals say they see. Larry Sutton manages the local Bureau of Autism Services for the Commonwealth. Larry: One individual was doing very well until they changed the bathroom cleaning schedule. He became enraged because of what had occurred. He was fired for workplace violence for yelling at the staff that was cleaning the bathroom. Trouble with work may lead some adults to self-employment in creative fields. Sheryl Yaegar\ufffds didn\ufffdt thrive at any of her jobs. A few years ago she discovered painting with pastels. Not only has art provided her with a livelihood, it\ufffds become an essential part of her identity. Sheryl: I was abused as a child and it made me feel better because it took away a lot of the pain and a lot of the hurt and sorrow that I suffered throughout my childhood years. She has been lauded for her work and done over 2,000 paintings, which she keeps in boxes in the kitchen of the apartment in a Senior Citizen high-rise where she lives. Her work has been in shows around the country. Sheryl: I do more birds and animals than anything else\ufffdI feel free when I do art, one with God and one with nature\ufffdFor instance even when I see birds or nature stuff outside or whatever, I seem to relate to them better than people. I guess because they don\ufffdt talk back or they\ufffdre innocent and they accept you for who you are. She has autism. Like many older adults on the spectrum, she wasn\ufffdt diagnosed as a child. She was in her 30\ufffds. She\ufffds 49 now. She says her life is lonely. Sheryl: I really don t have any true friends and I would really like to find autistic friends that have a lot of things in common with me. Her limitations aren\ufffdt limited to social ones. Sheryl: Sometimes I m really angry that I have autism. I feel that way because I can\ufffdt do things as good as other people. Like I can t, no matter how many times I try, I can\ufffdt do computers and I can\ufffdt put film in a camera. Sheryl says most of the support groups aimed at adults with autism are filled with younger adults, not people in middle-age like her. Phil and Caitlan belong to one such group. Caitlan: Meeting other people with autism it s kind of like looking into a mirror. Phil: With that community, with that group, the way that I talk, the way that I am, the decisions that I make, the behaviors all seem to fit, all seem normal, all seem reasonable. Outside of that room, I\ufffdm a little weird. They are renovating a home in Oakland. For them, housing isn\ufffdt an issue. But it is for many on the spectrum. Jeff lives in Penn Hills with his aunt and cousin. His parents are dead. He has never lived on his own. Jeff: Very clutzy and all, and not really all that organized. When it comes to intellectual things I do all right, but common sense to me, I\ufffdm a liability. His aunt says if she were not around, Jeff would live on the street. She buys his clothes, cooks his meals and looks after him. His being social is also his pitfall. Flo: People pick on him all the time because of his condition. Several times in his lifetime, he was swindled out of quite a bit of money. One time it was to the tune of $35,000. He gets harassed. Jeff: A couple bowling friends of mine came over and said, Well Jeff, no matter what, you\ufffdll always be Rainman to me, and I go, Please, don t you dare call me Rainman. Then a couple of other guys said, ok, Rainman. And he gets taken advantage of. Flo: They see that he\ufffds not quite right I think they all think, Well. Why shouldn\ufffdt I try? There is another area where he is deficient in. Jeff and his aunt Flo. Jeff: Not only do I not have a girlfriend, I\ufffdll take it one step further and say, I\ufffdve never even had a date. And there have been some people who have actually even made fun of me because of it. Flo: Jeffrey does not date, he has never dated, he is 38 years old. And he would really have a rough time being out on a date with a young lady at this stage in his life because he\ufffds never done it. He\ufffdd probably be all thumbs like anyone else whose doing that for the first time. Jeff\ufffds saving grace has been living with his aunt, although she worries what will happen when she\ufffds gone. Richard Campbell is 56 years old. He has spent much of his childhood and adulthood in and out of psychiatric hospitals and personal care homes. He has dual diagnoses \ufffd schizophrenia and bipolar. He now lives in a group home. About 20 years ago, he was diagnosed with autism. Richard: I was stunned. I was overwhelmed. He\ufffds had problems keeping jobs or staying in personal care homes. But the biggest problem, he says, has been being bullied. Richard: Some people call me retarded, stupid, I\ufffdm not going to say anything else, but people still pick on me today sometimes. Increasingly, medical and social service Professionals are getting more calls from adults or their family members saying they\ufffdve heard of autism and think they fit the bill. Some have been misdiagnosed. Nina Wall Cote runs the state\ufffds Bureau of Autism Services. Nina: Adults with autism are very very hard to find because they are labeled with other things, there really wasn\ufffdt a service delivery for people with a diagnosis of autism so the only way you could get services is if you had a diagnosis of mental retardation or an intellectual disability or mental health diagnosis. Recently, Pennsylvania revealed the results of an autism census. At present there are an estimated nearly 4,000 people with autism who are over 21. Nina: We have a count of the number of adults with autism which we know is an egregious lowball and many of them are lost to us. They are at home with aging parents they\ufffdre homeless, they\ufffdre in the criminal justice system. The state has an Adult Autism Waiver that helps pay for care. Nina:We will need more in the way of resources to support the thousands and thousands of people who will be coming into the system. And we don\ufffdt have an answer for that part.

Evidence against X-Linkage as a cause of Autism Seratonin and Autism Autistic Brains Improvement In Autistic Behavior Seen As Individuals Age Center for Human Genetics Autism Research Support Organizations Autism is a chronic, nonprogressive developmental disorder. Individuals with autism have a unique set of symptoms in three areas: socialization (interaction with others), communication, and behavior. Autism is a common disorder, when other diagnoses such as pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), pervasive developmental disorder (not otherwise specified - PDD-NOS), and Asperger's disorder are included in the spectrum. Autism is a complex genetic disorder thought to be caused by one or more genes, either acting alone or together with other factors. Through the Medical Genetics collaborative research study into the hereditary basis of autism, we hope to find the gene(s) that leads to autism. Finding these gene(s) will provide valuable insight into how the disorder is caused and will hopefully lead to improved diagnostic and treatment modalities. Can Autism Be Inherited? We are often asked the question, Am I at risk for having a child with autism or having another child with autism? The answer is not simple since autism has many causes. Some individuals may have a genetic form of autism. If possible, the underlying cause for the autistic-like behavior must be identified. Several inherited disorders are associated with autistic-like behavior. Some of these disorders include Fragile X Syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), and Phenylketonuria (PKU). When a diagnosis of autistic disorder is made by a health care provider, it is important to determine whether the behavior is the result of one of these well known genetic disorders. If specific testing indicates one of these disorders is responsible for the behavior, the recurrence risk and perhaps the medical treatment will be altered. In most cases, there is no specific cause for autism in an individual. In these instances, the autism is said to be idiopathic, meaning that the behavior is secondary to an unknown cause. These non-specific answers can be frustrating for parents or family members who would like some explanation. In this research study, we include individuals and families with idiopathic autism because these are the individuals most likely to carry the gene or genes that cause autism. By finding the genetic factors that play a role in the development of autism, we will someday be able to provide accurate recurrence risks to individuals and families as well as develop better treatments. For families that have one child with idiopathic autism, there is an increased risk of having another child with autism. This recurrence risk is estimated to be about four percent which is greater than that found in families that do not have a child with autism.

Evidence Against X-linkage as a Major Cause of Autism Since it is a known fact that more males have autism than females, researchers believed that autism might be associated with a non-working gene on the X chromosome. Recent data for our group and others have shown that it is unlikely that a gene on the X chromosome causes the majority of cases of autism. How do we know this? By studying many different families in which more than one member has autism, or a variant of autism such as Asperger s syndrome or PDD, we have seen that in a number of families the \"gene\" is passed through the father to a male child with autism. Since a father transmits an X chromosome only to his daughters and not his sons, the \"gene\" cannot be on the X chromosome in these families.

(Specifically, serotonin is concentrated in a part of the brain stem called the raphe nucleus). Serotonin is also present in certain blood cells called platelets. It is thought to be involved in inducing sleep, sensory perception, temperature regulation, and control of mood. Serotonin is of interest to autism researchers because some individuals with autism have consistently been found to have high levels of serotonin in their blood stream platelets. However, it is unclear what a high serotonin level signifies. Dr. Cuccaro and his colleagues at W.S. Hall Psychiatric Institute/USC School of Medicine in Columbia, South Carolina may have discovered an important clue. They conducted a study that looked at the level of blood (platelet) serotonin and the verbal ability of individuals with autism and their immediate relatives. Using a well accepted IQ test (Wechsler scales), these researchers found that individuals with high serotonin platelet or blood levels, had lower verbal ability scores. However, other measurements of intellectual abilities were not changed, including visual-spatial ability or memory. Intelligence is a combination of many different abilities including verbal, visual-spatial ability, memory and other areas. What does this mean for individuals with autism and their immediate relatives? First, it provides one more biological clue about autism. While not all individuals with autism have high blood serotonin levels, many individuals do. Perhaps individuals with autism and high serotonin levels have one type of autism or perhaps high blood serotonin levels influence the signs and symptoms associated with autism. More research is needed before the relationship between serotonin levels and autism is understood. Currently, a high or low blood serotonin level does not alter in any way how individuals with autism are managed medically. Occasionally, medications called serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. Fluoxetine, Sertraline and Paroxetine) are prescribed for some individuals with autism. (This type of medication is also widely used to treat depression). Serotonin reuptake inhibitors keep serotonin in the brain longer so that its function as a chemical communicator is further enhanced. Studies in different populations of autistic individuals will help establish which individuals with autism will benefit from serotonin reuptake inhibitors or other drugs that influence blood and brain serotonin levels.

Total Brain Volume Can Be Greater In Individuals with Autism Thirty eight high-quality magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans of individuals with autism who were more than 12 years old were obtained. In addition, 38 MRIs of individuals over 12 years of age who did not have autism were also obtained. These MRIs were used as controls. Through careful measurement of the volume of the brain, Piven et al. reported that in almost half of the individuals with autism, the total brain volume was greater than in individuals without autism. These results confirm earlier MRI findings reported by the same group. These results suggest a problem in brain development (as opposed to a later injury). Unpublished data suggest that the enlargement may occur in particular regions of the brain and is not a generalized phenomenon. These results should provide important clues about the neurobiology of autism. For example, a new group of genes that are responsible for brain growth have recently been discovered. Abnormalities in these genes may underlie our findings of regional brain enlargement in autism. Also, since brain enlargement occurred in almost half (46%) of the subjects studied, brain size and shape may aid us in eventually identifying subgroups of autistic individuals with different causes for their autism. Dr. Piven and his associates are continuing to study imaging data and will be trying to obtain further funding to follow-up these results over the next year.

Improvement In Autistic Behavior Seen As Individuals Age At the April 1995 Society for Research in Child Development Meeting, Dr. Piven and his research group presented the results of their behavioral studies. They reviewed data on the current autistic behaviors in 38 high-functioning adolescent and adult autistic individuals and compared it to their behaviors at age 5 years. These researchers found that there was clear improvement in all three domains of behavior that define autism. However, the most substantial change occurred in the social and communication behaviors. Eighty percent of the males and one hundred percent of the females improved their social and communication skills. Both males and females had fifty percent improvement in ritualistic-repetitive behaviors. Dr. Piven and his colleagues are continuing their study of the course of behavioral change in autism.

Center for Human Genetics Autism Research To help us reach the goal of discovering the genetic, or inherited causes of autism, we collaborate with other researchers and medical centers. Our growing team now includes other experts in the fields of autism and genetic research. Our collaborators include Robert DeLong, MD of Duke University Medical Center, Dr.'s Ruth Abrahmson, Mike Curcarro and Harry Wright of the W.S. Hall Psychiatric Institute (Columbia, SC), Joseph Piven, MD at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA), Susan Folstein, MD at Tufts University (Boston, MA), Nina Sajaniemi, PhD at Helsinki University Central Hospitial (Helsinki, Finland), and their research groups. In order to find the genes for autism, we compare the genetic material (DNA) of individuals with autism to their family members without autism. We also compare genetic material between the families that have members with autism. The genetic material is obtained through blood samples. Once a family decides to join our study, we request all participating family members to give a blood sample. We also review family and medical history and conduct the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI) in order to confirm the diagnosis of the family member(s) with autism. However, families will not have to travel to Duke University Medical Center in order to participate. Instead, we try to visit the families personally to collect blood samples and diagnostic information. Family physicians may also collect the blood samples and mail the samples to us. The family history interview and ADI may be done as a telephone interview at any time convenient for the family. All information shared with the Center for Human Genetics is considered medical information and thus kept confidential. Since this is an ongoing research study to identify the genes associated with autism, there are no individual test results that we can report to participating families. However, we update the families participating in our study each year through our newsletter which explains our current findings and research progress. This has been a productive year for the autism genetic research study. Over the past year we have had the privilege of working with more than 125 families. Sixty of these families have more than one family member with autism. We have enjoyed meeting these families and we look forward to working with them over the next few years.

According to Wikipedia.org: Autism is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests in delays of social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play, with onset prior to age 3 years, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The ICD-10 also requires symptoms to manifest before the age of three years. Autism is often not physiologically obvious, in that outward appearance may not indicate a disorder, and diagnosis typically comes from a complete physical and neurological evaluation. $('overviewFull').hide(); Add Content RSS Autism add social interaction Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ICD-10 neurodevelopmental disorder Mac Autism Front Page Articles Pictures Videos Wikipedia.org: Autism www.zimbio.com/Autism Wikipedia.org: Autism119 http://treatingautism.co.uk/ WISE TRADITIONS UK FESTIVAL FOR TRADITIONAL NUTRITION Sunday, March 21st, LondonThe Weston A Price Foundation campaigns for wise traditions in food, farming and the healing arts, challenging the diet dictocrats and politically correct nutrition.Speakers: SALLY FALLON MORELL, MA, president and founder of the Weston A.

Topix www.topix.com/health/autism Autism120 http://www.townandcountrypeds.com/test_health_autism.htm In recent years, the term autism has become commonplace in magazines, in the movies, and in discussions between parents. The following information is a brief overview on autism. It would be impossible to include every facet of this complex disorder, but the basic facts are as follows. Autism Frequently asked questions about autism. Autism 1. What is autism? 2. How common is autism? 3. What causes autism? 4. What are the symptoms of autism? 5. How is autism diagnosed? 6. Are there any tests for autism? 7. Is there a cure for autism? 8. What therapies are available? 9. Which therapy is effective? 10. What is known about alternative therapies? 11. How will I know if a therapy is working? 12. Are medication used in the treatment of autism? 13. Where can I get more information about autism? 1. What is autism? Autism is one disorder in a complex spectrum of developmental disabilities. Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) is a more general term used to describe several developmental disorders, including Autistic Disorder, Asperger Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Rett Syndrome. PDD affects the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Since it is a spectrum of disabilities, the symptoms can become evident in a variety of combinations. The disabilities can be mild to severe. For the purposes of this article, the term autism will be used and refers to any of the disorders that fall within the spectrum. 2. How common is autism? It is estimated that autism spectrum disorders occur in 2 to 6 per 1000 persons (500,000 to 1,500,000 people in the US). It is four times more prevalent in boys. It affects all races, ethnic groups, and social classes. It is one of the most common developmental disabilities. Since the disorder can take on a mild form, the public may be unaware of all of those affected by autism. 3. What causes autism? A single cause is not known despite considerable research that has been done. It is known that bad parenting or immunizations do not cause these disorders. Recent research strongly suggests a genetic basis, but a single genetic link has not been discovered. Current research in looking at the chemical, biological, and neurological differences in the brain of those affected by the disorder. 4. What are the symptoms of autism? Most children with autism appear normal in the first year or two of life. Parents often notice delays in language skills and the way a child plays or interacts with others. Children may be overly sensitive or under-responsive to stimulation of the five senses (Hearing, Touch, Smell, Taste, and Sight). Repetitive behaviors (hand flapping, rocking, echoing words) may also be seen. Behavior may be aggressive (at self or others) or very passive. In retrospect, after diagnosis, past behaviors that were thought of as normal may have been subtle symptoms. 5. How is autism diagnosed? An accurate diagnosis of autism or any of the related disorders requires multiple observations of the child's behavior, communication, and developmental skills. It is difficult to diagnose because of the variety of presentations these disorders have. Evaluation by a multidisciplinary team is thought to be the diagnostic standard. The team of specialists might include a neurologist, psychologist, developmental pediatrician, speech/language pathologist, occupational therapist, and a genetics counselor. Parental observations are also very important. 6. Are there any tests for autism? No, there are no specific medical tests that can be done to diagnose autism. Instead, tests are done to rule out other underlying problems that may be the cause of the developmental delays. Blood tests may be done to rule out lead poisoning, metabolic diseases, and genetic disorders. An electroencephalogram (EEG), a tracing of the brain's electrical activity, may also be done to rule out the possibility of a seizure disorder as the cause of a child's behavior issues. A hearing test is done to rule out a hearing deficit that may interfere with language skills. A CAT scan of the brain is usually not indicated. Newer tests that measure by-products of proteins from the diet in the urine do not have FDA approval and should not be viewed as diagnostic. Beyond the medical tests that are part of the diagnostic work-up, there are many psychiatric, developmental, and behavioral tools that are used by trained specialists. These specialists make up the multidisciplinary team that is recommended in making the diagnosis of autism. 7. Is there a cure for autism? No. Autism is a life-long disorder. However, there are many therapies available to lessen the symptoms and to develop better coping strategies for managing the symptoms of autism, but none are known to be curative. 8. What therapies are available? The answer to this question is a very complex one. There are so many therapies available that it is mind-boggling. Some therapies are traditional and time-tested, while others are just a passing fad. Unlike other disorders, there are no published treatment guidelines or protocols for autism. However, experts do agree that therapy should be started early and should target the deficits or delays that are common in children with autism communication and behavior issues. Comprehensive treatment usually includes speech therapy, occupational therapy, and behavior modification. Within each of these entities are many types of interventions. Outlined below are the more common approaches. Occupational Therapy (OT) addresses sensory-motor skills of a child with autism as well as many other disorders. The ultimate goal of traditional OT is assisting the child in participation of daily life tasks and activities as independently as possible. OT should be a major component of a treatment plan for autistic children. Sensory Integration (SI) Therapy is among the latest subspecialties of Occupational Therapy. It is based on the theory that autistic children have difficulty perceiving incoming sensory information. The goal of SI is to control sensory input during age-appropriate activities to either reduce or increase an autistic child's response to external stimuli through repeated exposure. Despite the popularity of SI, there is little to no scientific data available on its use or effectiveness. Behavioral Modification Therapy is usually started in all children with autism. There are many different behavioral therapies available, each with a different set of teaching principles. The goal of behavioral therapy is to improve a child's social development through behavior modification. Ideally, autistic children would normalize their behavior so that inclusion in a regular classroom setting would be possible. Developed by Professor Ivaar Lovaas from UCLA, Discrete Trial Training (DTT) is a very intensive therapy that teaches a child how to learn through repetition of behavioral responses. This therapy requires one-on-one sessions with specially trained teachers, 40 hours per week for 2 to 3 years. Needless to say, this therapy is expensive and not a choice for many families. This therapy has been promoted as THE treatment for autism, yet there is no comparative research to support the claim. Modifications of Dr. Lovaas' theory have evolved into other forms of behavioral therapy, Intensive Behavior Intervention (IBI) and Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). All of these therapies are started in the preschool years in hopes of achieving kindergarten readiness with developmentally normal peers. Division TEACCH is an acronym for Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication-handicapped CHildren. The program was developed at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. The goal of TEACCH is to provide a structured learning environment for children with autism to optimize their individual strengths and independence. The program is multidisciplinary and involves the family and community. Treatment is intensive - 5 hours a day, 5 days a week in a TEACCH classroom. This intervention is popular and is supported by years of anecdotal data on its success. Very little scientific data exist on the outcomes of TEACCH. Dr. Stanley Greenspan, MD, a well-known, highly published child psychiatrist developed Floor Time as a treatment for autism. This therapy is based on his Developmental, Individual-Difference, and Relationship-based (DIR) model. This theory posits that further learning and development can only be obtained after meeting six relationship-based milestones. The goal of Floor Time is to help the autistic child overcome sensory processing issues so these relationship-based milestones can be achieved. Therapy consists of 6 to 8 30-minute sessions of child-guided play each day. Parents are taught to do the therapy at home. Many Occupational Therapists use this model in their daily treatment plans for autism. There is no scientific evidence to support the use of this therapy. Inclusion Therapy involves putting autistic children in classrooms of developmentally normal children. It is thought that an autistic child will naturally learn from his normal peers in the academic environment. An aide is assigned to the autistic child and the curriculum is modified to address the child's strengths and weaknesses. It is thought that autistic children placed in inclusive environments have better verbal and social skills. However, this has not been proven. Carol Gray developed Social Stories (Social Scripts) in 1991. Its main goal is to clarify social expectations, teach the rules of society, and encourage self-management in social situations. The scripts that are written are individualized to a certain person and situation. The scripts are read and reread until the behavior is learned. Behavior is thought to improve with this repetition. However, there is no scientific evidence supporting this claim. Speech-Language Pathology covers a wide range of disorders. Speech disorders are defined by a difficulty in producing the sounds of language. Language disorders are defined by a difficulty in understanding language or using words in spoken communication. Autistic children often present with both issues. Therapy is aimed at improving verbal and nonverbal communication skills. PECS is an acronym for Picture Exchange Communication. This program, often seen within a TEACCH environment, goes beyond traditional speech therapy. This type of therapy helps a child attach meanings to words through pictures. It is useful in verbal and nonverbal children. The goal is to help the child with spontaneous communication. It is helpful to have two trainers available in the initial part of the program when it is most intensive. Facilitated communication (FC) involves a facilitator who assists the nonverbal child in pointing to letters or pressing keys on a keyboard to spell words for communication with others. This type of communication for autistic children is a topic of debate. It is thought that the facilitator has too much influence over the communication, and therefore, it is not the autistic child's thoughts or expressions. FC is not a recommended form of communication and is not supported by many autism experts or scientific research. 9. Which therapy is effective? Unfortunately, there is little to no scientific data to support many of these therapies. This is most likely due to the fact that creating a study with autistic children is almost impossible. There are too many variables between children, from the severity of the disorder to their home environment, not to mention the ethics involved with creating a double blind, controlled study. It would be impossible to control and any data resulting from studies that are not controlled properly may be statistically inaccurate. However, despite the lack of scientific support for therapy, developmental experts agree that early intervention dramatically improves outcomes for young children with autism. There is no single specific therapy that works for all children. Therapy needs to be tailored to the child's own needs, based on his strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Therapy should be multidisciplinary, using occupational therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral therapy, as a basis. Your child's autism specialist should be able to guide you through your choices. 10. What is known about alternative therapies? Unfortunately, for every parent searching for the cure for their child, there is an unethical person waiting with false promises for that cure. The Internet is fraught with scams that promise to cure autism. Below are some therapies that have no scientific support for the use in autistic children and should be avoided. Auditory Integration Training (AIT) Dr. Guy Berard, a French otolaryngologist, originally developed this therapy. AIT requires listening to processed music through headphones. This music is heard at various decibel levels, some which can be very loud. Treatment sessions may last 30 minutes a day for a year or more. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support AIT and the medical device used is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Secretin Therapy Secretin is a natural hormone that is found in the small intestine. Extracted secretin from humans or pigs has been used as a diagnostic tool for intestinal and pancreatic disorders. Apparently, in 1998, there was a report of an autistic child who, while undergoing diagnostic tests, received secretin. Following the test, his autism symptoms dramatically improved. Since then, thousands of autistic children have received secretin despite the lack of safety and efficacy data. As recently as September 2002, Pharmacotherapy, a journal for pharmacists, published an analysis of all the studies relating secretin use and autism. The conclusion is that secretin does not improve symptoms of autism and should not be used. Visual Therapy It is thought that children with autism rely on their peripheral vision, have tunnel vision, or are hypersensitive to light. Visual therapy is intended to address these issues, however, there is no scientific data backing its effectiveness. Dietary Modification Some people theorize that food intolerance and allergies may worsen symptoms of autism. Specifically, yeast, gluten, and casein are the named culprits. There are no scientific studies that support the omission of these foods from an autistic child's diet. Vitamin/Mineral Therapy It is thought that supplemental B vitamins and magnesium reduce tantrums and other behavior issues in autistic children. Dimethlyglycine (DMG) is chemically similar to Vitamin B 15 and is available over-the-counter. Vitamin therapy has not been studied and is not recommended. Other Therapies The list of other interventions can go on for pages. A few examples that are not recommended or supported by any type of scientific research are; Delacto Method, Osteopathy/Craniosacral Therapy, Holding Therapy, The Squeeze Machine, Son-Rise Program, Higashi Therapy, and photostimulation. Be wary of therapies that make promises of a cure. There is no cure for autism. 11. How will I know if a therapy is working? With all the various types of therapy available for parents to choose, it is important to pick the one most likely to improve the symptoms of autism. However, there are no guarantees that the choice will be effective. A few general guidelines should be followed. Try one therapy at a time and continue it for about 2 months before changing to another if no improvements are seen. However, if improvements are seen in the first week or two of a therapy then another intervention can be added. Remain objective and ask others who know your child if they notice any differences in behavior. 12. Are medication used in the treatment of autism? Yes. The main groups of medications that are used to reduce the symptoms of autism are Neuroleptic Agents Not all children with autism need these powerful medications, and many can have serious side effects. 13. Where can I get more information about autism? Be careful about information obtained from Internet sites, as much of the information is biased and not proven. Avoid the following Internet sites: Autism Research Institute at www.autism.com. Bernard Rimland, Ph.D., father of an autistic child, developed this site. The site consists of many of his editorials about autism. It is not based on scientific fact. Also, the Center for the Study of Autism at www.autism.org developed by Stephen Edelson, Ph.D., references the work of Bernard Rimland. This site encourages the use of diet, supplements and the Hug Machine for the treatment of autism. Recommended Internet sites are those of the Autism Society of America at www.autism-society.org and Autism-PDD Resources Network at www.autism-pdd.net and the Autism Research Centre at www.autismresearchcenter.com. The Autism Society of America is a great starting point for information gathering. The Autism-PDD Resources Network has great links to state programs and aids in the development of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for use in the public schools. However, this site is not an advocate of TEACCH programs. The Autism Research Centre addresses autism from a scientific approach with research and journal publications. As always, if you would like more information or you have questions about autism, please call your child's health care provider. Our offices have a comprehensive list of local neurologists, developmental pediatricians, occupational therapists, speech therapists, geneticists, and others specialists that are qualified to help you and your child. If there is concern, your child will be referred to these specialists for a complete evaluation. They may be able to guide you through the maze of reading materials and Internet sites that are available. pointing genetic brain genetic Pervasive Developmental Disorder Autism Research Institute www.autism-society.org Autism Society of America TEACCH PDD University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Stanley Greenspan Internet Son-Rise Program Bernard Rimland www.autism.org MD childhood disintegrative disorder social interaction anxiety ABA Developmental US Food and Drug Administration FDA tantrums ritalin UCLA Auditory Integration Training haldol prozac zoloft Rett Syndrome American Academy of Pediatrics Autistic Disorder Applied Behavior Analysis Ritalin Carol Gray Asperger Syndrome Ph.D. IBI Autism Research Centre Center for the Study of Autism OT SI Behavioral Modification Ivaar Lovaas Discrete Trial Training DTT Intensive Behavior Intervention Floor Time Individual-Difference Relationship-based Speech-Language Pathology Picture Exchange Communication FC AIT Guy Delacto Method Squeeze Agents Anti-Anxiety Dexedrine Adderall Anti-Seizure Agents Stephen Edelson Hug Machine Plan www.townandcountrypeds.com/test_health_autism.htm www.autism.com. www.autism-pdd.net www.autismresearchcenter.com. dexedrine adderall applied auditory integration training ait Autism121 http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Els-for-Autism-Charity-ProAm-bw-3685489266.html?x=0&.v=1 Press Release Source: M. Shanken Communications On Monday March 15, 2010, 6:55 pm EDT PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The 2nd annual Els for Autism Charity Pro-Am Golf Tournament was held March 14-15 at PGA National Resort & Spa in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The event raised more than $800,000 for the Els for Autism Foundation, which is dedicated to finding a solution to the epidemic of autism in young children. The organization was founded by Ernie Els and his wife Liezl, in conjunction with Marvin R.

Easter Seals Living with Autism Study results reveal parents raising children with autism are very concerned about the future independence of their children. In fact, they re far more concerned than parents of typically developing children nearly 80 percent say they re extremely or very concerned about their children s independence as an adult, compared to only 32 percent of other parents. This is especially true when it comes to their financial independence, quality of life, social and inter-personal connections, and employment and housing opportunities and with good reason. Autism is a growing public health crisis, with millions of families desperate for solutions and resources. Easter Seals and others in the autism community are doing their best, but current systems, structures and resources to help people with autism and their families do not adequately meet the growing need, especially for adults with autism. The study quantifies what we ve heard anecdotally over the years, says Patricia Wright, Ph.D., MPH, Easter Seals national director, autism services. The one consistent message Easter Seals hears from the families we serve after the initial apprehension and anxiety of learning their child has autism is an overwhelming concern about the life-long supports their child with autism may need to be independent. Study Shows Parents Hope for Independence . . . Financial and Otherwise The nationwide study provides new insight into the ongoing challenges facing individuals and families living with autism, particularly their concerns about the future. It s unique in that it closely considers and quantifies the very real concerns of parents of children with autism in relation to parents of typically developing children. A sampling of the findings: Parents of children living with autism are very concerned about their children fitting into society, with very few feeling their children will be able to: Make his or her own life decisions (14% compared to 65% of parents with typically developing children) Have friends in the community (17% compared to 57% of typical parents) Have a spouse or life partner (9% compared to 51% of typical parents) Be valued by their community (18% compared to 50% of typical parents) Participate in recreational activities (20% compared to 50% of typical parents) Children with autism also are less likely than their typically developing peers to have bank accounts (37% vs. 55%) and use electronic products like cell phones (9% vs. 41%) or MP3 players (23% vs. 49%) all tools of mainstream society. Many parents of children with autism report they re financially drowning, with concerns for their children s financial independence seeming to far surpass the worries of typical parents. Seventy-four percent of parents of children with autism fear their children will not have enough financial support after they die, while only 18% of typical parents share this fear. They also express extreme financial strains and costs associated with caring for a child with autism, with more than half stating that the cost of caring for my child: Drains my family s current financial resources (52% compared to 13% of typical parents) Will drain my family s future finances (50% compared to 10% of typical parents) Will cause me to fall short of cash during retirement (54% compared to 13% of typical parents) Key to adult independence is employment, yet only 24% of teenagers with autism have looked for a job, compared to 77% of their typically developing peers. And 76% of parents of children with autism are concerned about their child s future employment, when only 35% of typical parents share this fear. Families living with autism face so many challenges on a daily basis, says John Chandler, senior vice president and chief marketing officer of MassMutual s U.S. Insurance Group. But this study has really brought home for us how much stress they face when it comes to their current financial situation, the future of their child with autism, their other children and their own retirement. Our hundreds of Special Care Planners across the country are in a great position to help make at least this part of their struggle easier. As an Easter Seals corporate partner and the study sponsor, MassMutual is committed to serving people living with autism and other disabilities through its exclusive SpecialCareSM program, an innovative solution that gives families with individuals with special needs access to information, specialists, and financial strategies that can help improve their quality of life. Easter Seals worked with Harris Interactive, and in cooperation with the Autism Society of America, to conduct the Living with Autism Study and survey 1,652 parents of children who have autism and 917 parents of typically developing children about daily life, relationships, independence, education, housing, employment, finances and healthcare.* Study Findings to Drive Solutions Easter Seals strives to make data-based-decisions, Wright says. With this study, the disparities that parents of typically developing children and parents of children with autism experience can now be shared via solid numbers. Easter Seals will use the study results to raise awareness of and advocate for the life-long services millions of families living with autism desperately need including school to work transitions, employment support, residential and community support, and financial planning. For parents of kids with autism, there are no simple answers, adds Wright. There is an urgent need for increased funding and services especially for adults with autism. Easter Seals wants to help change all of this and make a difference for families living with autism today. *Methodology This Easter Seals Living with Autism Study was conducted online within the United States by Harris Interactive on behalf of Easter Seals between June 16 and July 17, 2008 among 1,652 parents of children age 30 and under who have autism and 917 parents of typically developing children age 30 and under. No estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated; a full methodology is available.

The court had ruled 13 months ago that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, commonly known as MMR, does not cause the disorder, and the new ruling may finally close the bulk of litigation on the matter. More than 5,000 parents had filed claims with the court, formally known as the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, seeking damages because they believed their children had developed autism as a result of vaccinations. The cases that three special masters for the court chose to include in the omnibus proceeding were considered among the strongest, so the outlook appears grim for others making the same claim. Special Master Denise K. Vowell wrote in one of the decisions that \"petitioners propose effects from mercury in [vaccines] that do not resemble mercury's known effects in the brain, either behaviorally or at the cellular level. To prevail, they must show that the exquisitely small amounts of mercury in [vaccines] that reach the brain can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts experienced prenatally or postnatally from other sources do not.\" She also dismissed claims that some groups of children are unusually susceptible to the effects of mercury. \"The only evidence that these children are unusually sensitive is the fact of their [autism] itself.\" The special vaccine court was established in 1986 because vaccine manufacturers were facing many liability suits that threatened their ability to continue manufacturing the valuable medicines. The court holds no-fault hearings to determine if a child has, in fact, been damaged by a vaccine. Compensation comes from a special fund based on a surcharge leveled on each dose of vaccine. The court has made many awards to parents who successfully showed that their children were damaged neurologically or otherwise by vaccination - a rare, but nonetheless real event - but has refused to accept claims that autism is caused by vaccination. textSize() Copyright 2010, The Los Angeles Times Sphere.Inline.search(\"\", \"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/sns-health-thimerosal-autism-link,0,118944.story\"); E-mail Digg Twitter Facebook StumbleUpon Comments (0) Add comments Currently there are no comments.

Most programs will build on the interests of the child in a highly structured schedule of constructive activities. Visual aids are often helpful.Treatment is most successful when geared toward the child's particular needs. An experienced specialist or team should design the program for the individual child. A variety of therapies are available, including:Applied behavior analysis (ABA)MedicationsOccupational therapyPhysical therapySpeech-language therapySensory integration and vision therapy are also common, but there is little research supporting their effectiveness. The best treatment plan may use a combination of techniques.APPLIED BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS (ABA)This program is for younger children with an autism spectrum disorder. It can be effective in some cases. ABA uses a one-on-one teaching approach that reinforces the practice of various skills. The goal is to get the child close to normal developmental functioning.ABA programs are usually conducted within a child's home, under the supervision of a behavioral psychologist. Unfortunately, these programs can be very expensive and have not been widely adopted by school systems. Parents often must seek funding and staffing from other sources, which can be hard to find in many communities.TEACCHAnother program is called the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH). TEACCH, developed as a statewide program in North Carolina, uses picture schedules and other visual cues. These help the child work independently and organize and structure their environments.Though TEACCH tries to improve a child's adaptation and skills, it also accepts the problems associated with autism spectrum disorders. Unlike ABA programs, TEACCH programs do not expect children to achieve typical development with treatment.MEDICINEMedicines are often used to treat behavior or emotional problems that people with autism may have, including:AggressionAnxietyAttention problemsExtreme compulsions that the child find impossible to stopHyperactivityImpulsivenessIrritabilityMood swingsOutburstsSleep difficultyTantrumsCurrently, only risperidone is approved for the treatment of children ages 5 - 16 with irritability and aggression associated with autism. There is no medicine that treats the underlying problem of autism.DIETSome children with autism appear to respond to a gluten-free or casein-free diet. Gluten is found in foods containing wheat, rye, and barley. Casein is found in milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Not all experts agree that dietary changes will make a difference, and not all reports studying this method have shown positive results.If you are considering these or other dietary changes, talk to both a doctor who specializes in the digestive system (gastroenterologist) and a registered dietitian. You want to be sure that the child is still receiving enough calories, nutrients, and a balanced diet.OTHER APPROACHESBeware that there are widely publicized treatments for autism that do not have scientific support, and reports of \"miracle cures\" that do not live up to expectations. If your child has autism, it may be helpful to talk with other parents of children with autism and autism specialists, and follow the progress of research in this area, which is rapidly developing.At one time, there was enormous excitement about using secretin infusions. Now, after many studies have been conducted in many laboratories, it's possible that secretin is not effective after all, but research is ongoing.

What are the most common characteristics of autism? What is the difference between autism and PDD? What is Asperger's Syndrome? Why is early intervention so important? What is autism? Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life and is the result of a neurological disorder that affects the normal functioning of the brain, impacting development in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Both children and adults with autism typically show difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. Autism is a spectrum disorder and it affects each individual differently and at varying degrees. What are the most common characteristics of autism?Every person with autism is an individual, and like all individuals, has a unique personality and combination of characteristics. Some individuals mildly affected may exhibit only slight delays in language and greater challenges with social interactions. They may have difficulty initiating and/or maintaining a conversation. Their communication is often described as talking at others instead of to them. (For example, a monologue on a favorite subject that continues despite attempts by others to interject comments). People with autism also process and respond to information in unique ways. In some cases, aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior may be present. Persons with autism may also exhibit some of the following traits: Insistence on sameness; resistance to change Difficulty in expressing needs, using gestures or pointing instead of words Repeating words or phrases in place of normal, responsive language Laughing (and/or crying) for no apparent reason; showing distress for reasons not apparent to others Preference to being alone; aloof manner Tantrums Difficulty in mixing with others Not wanting to cuddle or be cuddled Little or no eye contact Unresponsive to normal teaching methods Sustained odd play Spinning objects Obsessive attachment to objects Apparent over-sensitivity or under-sensitivity to pain No real fears of danger Noticeable physical over-activity or extreme under-activity Uneven gross/fine motor skills Non-responsive to verbal cues; acts as if deaf, although hearing tests in normal range What is the difference between autism and PDD? The term \"PDD\" is widely used by professionals to refer to children with autism and related disorders; however, there is a great deal of disagreement and confusion among professionals concerning the PDD label. Diagnosis of PDD, including autism or any other developmental disability, is based upon the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC, 1994), and is the main diagnostic reference of mental health professionals in the United States. According to the DSM-IV, the term \"PDD\" is not a specific diagnosis, but an umbrella term under which the specific diagnoses are defined. What is Asperger's Syndrome? What distinguishes Asperger's Syndrome from autism is the severity of the symptoms and the absence of language delays. Children with Asperger's may be only mildly affected and frequently have good language and cognitive skills. To the untrained observer, a child with Asperger's may seem just like a normal child behaving differently. They may be socially awkward, not understanding of conventional social rules, or show a lack of empathy. They may make limited eye contact, seem to be unengaged in a conversation, and not understand the use of gestures. One of the major differences between Asperger's Syndrome and autism is that, by definition, there is no speech delay in Asperger's. In fact, children with Asperger's frequently have good language skills; they simply use language in different ways. Speech patterns may be unusual, lack inflection, or have a rhythmic nature or it may be formal, but too loud or high pitched. Children with Asperger's may not understand the subtleties of language, such as irony and humor, or they may not recognize the give-and-take nature of a conversation. Another distinction between Asperger's Syndrome and autism concerns cognitive ability. While some individuals with autism experience mental retardation, by definition a person with Asperger's cannot possess a \"clinically significant\" cognitive delay, and most possess average to above-average intelligence. Why is early intervention so important? Early intervention is defined as services delivered to children from birth to age 3, and research shows that it has a dramatic impact on reducing the symptoms of autism spectrum disorders. Studies in early childhood development have shown that the youngest brains are the most flexible. In autism, we see that intensive early intervention yields a tremendous amount of progress in children by the time they enter kindergarten, often reducing the need for intensive supports.

Temple Grandin, diagnosed with autism as a child, talks about how her mind works sharing her ability to think in pictures, which helps her solve problems that neurotypical brains might miss. She makes the case that the world needs people on the autism spectrum: visual thinkers, pattern thinkers, verbal thinkers, and all kinds of smart geeky kids.

The vaccines court had ruled 13 months ago that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, commonly known as MMR, does not cause the disorder. The new ruling on thimerosal, which contains mercury, may finally close the bulk of litigation on the matter. More than 5,000 parents had filed claims with the court, formally known as the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, seeking damages because they believed their children had developed autism as a result of vaccinations. The cases that three special masters for the court chose to include in the omnibus proceeding were considered among the strongest, so the outlook appears grim for others making the same claim. Special Master Denise K. Vowell wrote in one of the decisions that petitioners propose effects from mercury in [vaccines] that do not resemble mercury's known effects in the brain, either behaviorally or at the cellular level. She also dismissed assertions that some groups of children were unusually susceptible to mercury. The only evidence that these children are unusually sensitive is the fact of their [autism] itself. The new ruling was welcomed by Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had already had its day in science court and failed. But the controversy has tarred vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he said. It's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them. A group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court wanted to affirm government policy more than protect children. The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court, Rebecca Estepp of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges. The special vaccine court was established in 1986 because vaccine-makers were facing many liability suits that threatened their ability to continue making the valuable medicines. brain MMR U.S. Court of Federal Claims Denise K.

What should an autism evaluation include? How early can a diagnosis of autism be made? My child was just diagnosed with autism. Now what? Is a special diet needed? What might be some sensory needs of an individual on the autism spectrum? Does autism change with age? What is the life expectancy of a person with autism? What is autism? Autism is neuro-developmental disorder that impacts four main areas of an individual s life. Individuals with autism are typically challenged with social skill deficits, difficulties with sensory integration, communication and language deficits, and restrictive or repetitive behaviors. In more mild forms of autism, these deficits may be subtle and not obvious to the general observer. In moderate and more severe cases of autism, these areas of functioning may be severely impaired and the individual may have great difficulty functioning in their home and community environments. Individuals with moderate or severe forms of autism often have great difficulty in their daily living and in their general adaptation to the world around them. Families of children with autism often face unique and very challenging obstacles in their lives as they attempt to support their child s development and learning. It is not uncommon for parents and families to feel very frustrated and overwhelmed when faced with these issues. Families facing these challenges need specific information about autism and many will require high levels of support from family, friends, and professionals. Back to Top What causes autism? The causes of autism are still unknown. However, there is a considerable amount of research underway in an attempt to discover the causes of this growing neuro-developmental condition. While there are many hypotheses about the causes of autism, research is the only acceptable method to facilitate our understanding of the etiology of autism. Many parents have heard that childhood vaccinations and/or diet can cause autism. It is important to know that at the current time, there is not sufficient research to support a causative association between childhood vaccinations and autism. There is not sufficient evidence to link diet or vitamin/minerals to autism. More research is needed in these areas. The most promising research links autism to genetics. There is also research evaluating environmental triggers that are thought to be associated with autism. Given the pace of research in this area, it is anticipated that we will know more clearly the causes of autism in the next five years. Back to Top How is autism treated? Early intervention and Applied Behavior Analysis also known as ABA are the only treatments for autism that show clear positive results in the literature. When autism is identified early in young children, the interventions and support provided to these children tend to have stronger and longer lasting effects. When autism is identified later in childhood or adolescence, the interventions and support techniques and strategies tend to have less of an impact on an individual s functioning. Early intervention is really an important component in the treatment of autism. In addition to early intervention, research indicates that Applied Behavioral Analysis training is effective for individuals with autism. ABA training is based on the principals of behaviorism and includes direct behavioral approaches to increase specific and more adaptive behaviors in a child s repertoire. With the application of ABA principals and high levels of support, children with autism have been known to gain a significant amount of adaptive skills to their lives. The increase in adaptive and more functional behaviors has allowed many children with autism to more effectively interact with others, to communicate better with others, and to function in their homes and schools more successfully. Other common interventions for children with autism include the application of a specific behavioral support and response plan, direct training to expand verbal and nonverbal means of communication, sensory training to assist with better adaptation to touches, sights, smells, tastes, and sounds, and social skills training. We do know that children with autism that are involved in treatment tend to do better than children with autism that have not had treatment and support. Treatment is very important for these children. Back to Top Are there different kinds of autism? We refer to Autistic Disorder as being on a spectrum. One form of autism known as Asperger disorder -- is thought to be a more mild form of autism and would be on one end of the Autism spectrum. Asperger disorder includes all the same symptoms as autistic disorder but the symptoms are milder and usually have less of a severe interference in the child s life. Most often, children diagnosed with Asperger disorder use verbal language whereas many children with autistic disorder do not have functional verbal language. There are other forms of autism that fall somewhere on the spectrum based mainly on the severity and type of symptoms or the age at which the symptoms appear. Other disorders on the spectrum include Rett Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Pervasive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. Again, all of these are forms of autism with the most common being Autistic Disorder and Asperger Disorder. Back to Top What are the signs and symptoms of autism? Typically, the signs of autism can be seen early in a child s life. Early signs can include the absence of babbling and cooing as an infant and/or the absence of facial expressions and responsiveness to cuddling. In more severe cases, the infant may actually pull away from physical nurturing. As the child develops, other signs to look for include the lack of emotional expressions, lack of reciprocal social engagement, restrictive interests in pieces and parts of objects, lack of imaginative play, lack of functional play, and lack of an ability to read nonverbal social cues like gestures, tone of voice, facial expressions and others. As a toddler, children with autism may begin to repeat sounds or words also known as echolalia and may seem extremely shy or fearful in social settings. One of the hallmark signs of autism is the absence of language development. Extreme behavioral challenges often emerge in children with autism commonly sparked by tactile or auditory stimulation, change in routine, or requests to engage in simple activities. Children with autism are often very restrictive in their interests, routines, and behaviors. Almost all children with autism have difficulty learning in traditional classrooms. Thus, the educational setting is an environment where children with autism can be especially challenging. Again, individuals with autism may exhibit some or all of these symptoms to varying degrees. Back to Top Can autism be cured? Today, there is no known cure for autism. Early intervention including diagnosis and using the behavioral strategies of applied behavior analysis can lead to improvements in communication, social, life skills and behavioral functioning. Given the amount of research currently underway in the United States and other countries, advancements in our knowledge and interventions is expected over the next many years. While we have no known cure, we do know that the majority of children diagnosed with autism demonstrate improvement in functioning with appropriate identification, support, and treatment. Back to Top How can children with ASDs be taught to communicate? The lack of appropriate language development is one of the hallmark signs of autism. We now know that children who have autism can be taught to communicate through a variety of verbal and nonverbal methods. In some children with autism, verbal language can be successfully taught, obtained, and maintained by the use of behavioral strategies. In this method, verbal language is built and expanded on over time. Many children with autism can learn basic verbal language to use to meet their basic needs or to express their experiences or desires to others. It is true that children with autism even those with severe forms of the disorder -- can learn to use verbal language to communicate. It is also important to know that for many children with autism, alternatives to verbal language can be provided and are often combined with basic verbal expressions. Many children with autism can develop functional communication through picture exchange systems and sign language. Back to Top Is medication necessary for autism treatment? Depending on the symptoms and the severity of the symptoms and behaviors of concern, medication can be useful for individuals with autism. Medications have demonstrated some efficacy when focusing on the more severe symptoms of autism such as extreme hyperactivity, sleeplessness, agitation, and aggression. While medications have shown to help in many cases with symptom reduction, research indicates that behavioral interventions are necessary and essential for longer-term behavioral change and for the development of more adaptive and functional behaviors and skills. Medication can help with symptoms but it cannot teach new behaviors. Typically, children with autism are treated with a variety of interventions and medication is just one component of a treatment plan. Back to Top Where do I go for an evaluation? If you have concerns about your child and suspect autism, we suggest that you always consult with your primary care physician or pediatrician first. It is not uncommon for a primary medical condition to produce symptoms that are similar to those seen with autism. For example, a toddler with a history of severe ear infections may have great difficulty learning to talk. Extreme forms of childhood anxiety may manifest as underdeveloped socialization or the avoidance of people and play. A thorough medical evaluation is a very good first step. If your physician suspects autism, he or she is likely to refer the child for a specialized evaluation. The referral for evaluation is typically made to a behavioral pediatrician, a child psychologist, or a master s level licensed behavioral health professional that specializes in child development. Back to Top What should an autism evaluation include? When considering an evaluation to rule out autism, it is important to note that there is no specific battery of tests or set of accepted procedures used to diagnose an individual with autism. Areas that must be included in an evaluation for autism include an assessment of cognitive functioning, an assessment of expressive and receptive language, an assessment of behavioral functioning, and in some cases, an assessment of academic achievement/skills. A diagnosis of autism cannot be made without a complete and thorough developmental and family history interview. Medical conditions must be ruled out. In addition to these procedures, an appropriate evaluation for autism includes behavioral observations of the child in a variety of different settings. It is also important to get information and input from as many caregivers as possible including parents, teachers, babysitters, etc. In addition to these procedures, an evaluation for autism should include specific behavioral and developmental checklists specific to autism. Some common diagnostic checklists include: Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS) Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS) Autism Diagnostic Inventory Revised (ADI-R) Back to Top How early can a diagnosis of autism be made? The diagnosis of autism can be made as early as age 18 months, but is more commonly identified between ages 3 -4. Many, if not the majority of children with autism, will not be diagnosed until they enter school. This is probably because this is the time that children s skills and development are more commonly compared to peers, because learning and behavioral delays are more easily identified in the school setting, and because there are more resources available to identify children with developmental challenges when they enter school. It is important to note that early identification, diagnosis, and treatment is very important. The earlier the identification, the more likely intervention and support strategies will have the greatest impact in the long run. Back to Top My child was just diagnosed with autism. Now what?

In children with autism, there is no empirical evidence that supports the use of special diets as a primary intervention strategy. Research has not produced results that indicate that diet has an impact on the primary symptoms of autism. However, it is important to note that excessive amounts of any particular food or diets limited to one or two foods can create problems and symptoms in children. Indeed, excessive sugar or other foods in excess can influence a child s behavior. Like other children, a child with autism who eats a nutritious and well balanced diet will behave and function better than a child that eats nothing but French fries and pizza. Back to Top What might be some sensory needs of an individual on the autism spectrum? Individuals diagnosed with autism can experience a variety of functional and sensory differences and deficits. Heightened sensitivity and defensiveness when experiencing visual, auditory, olfactory, oral or tactile stimuli is often present with individuals diagnosed with autism. Sensory and sensory integration challenges for those with autism can present at varying levels in each individual. Some individuals may experience great sensory challenges and needs, while others exhibit very little needs in this regard. Back to Top Does autism change with age? While Autism is a pervasive and chronic neuro-developmental condition, individuals with the disorder can certainly demonstrate changes in their functional behavior, their language, and their communication skills. Depending on the services in place and how early in life that intervention is started, changes can take place over time. Individuals may become more social, communicative, and learn to identify their basic needs and even address those needs independently. Progress over time also varies from individual to individual. Some make very significant progress and gain the skills necessary to function adequately in the community. Others with autism may not demonstrate as much response to treatment and may need high levels of support and supervision for most of their life time. It is so very important that consistent evaluation of progress be an integral part of any serve plan for an individual with autism. Back to Top What is the life expectancy of a person with autism? Individuals with autism are generally expected to live just as long as those who have not been diagnosed with the disorder. It should be noted, however, that it is not uncommon for individuals with autism to also have other medical and developmental conditions that may affect their life expectancy. Atypical neurological conditions, seizure disorders, and genetic syndromes are not uncommon in individuals with autism. These additional conditions likely have a greater impact on life expectancy than the diagnosis of autism and the related symptoms.

I'm Dr. David Hill and today we're going to be talking about the question, what is autism? Autism is a description of a type of behavior that was only described around 1950 or so. It came into being as a formal diagnosis in the early 1980s and become much more widespread in the diagnostic literature in the 1990s. Our basic understanding of autism is a whole spectrum of behavior but the one thing the spectrum has in common is difficulty or complete failure understanding that other people have emotions, feelings and thoughts, the same as the child whose stricken with autism. This makes it obviously very difficult for the child to understand what other people mean when they're trying to communicate with him, and I say him, because most children who have autism are male. It also makes it very difficult for that child to get his needs known and express what he wants to express. A child with autism may look at somebody's face, for example, as just another object. Which means all the new ones are just facial expressions that we used to communicate with each other are lost on that child. Likewise, he may have a very difficult time learning words because words are just random sounds as far as he's concerned. The first signs of autism are evident as early as 9 months of age, and usually show up with speech delays or odd behaviors. Autism is usually pretty easily diagnosed by 18-24 months of age, if somebody's looking carefully for the appropriate signs. In terms of the causes of autism, they're being discovered everyday. Up to 40 percent of autistic children are now known to have some sort of genetic mutation that may contribute to their autistic behavior. However, 60 percent of cases really we don't know the cause exactly. However, we are learning more and more that autism is caused by things that happen before birth, in the uterus. And it while, it's a disease with a common presentation, it's probably going to end up being dozens, if not hundreds of different underlying diseases that look the same on the surface. Talking about what is autism, I'm Dr. David Hill.\" genetic genetic David Hill 4874526 www.ehow.com/video_4874526_autism_.html 48745 Autism130 http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism_and_autism_spectrum_disorders.cfm There is no conclusive scientific evidence that any part of a vaccine or combination of vaccines causes autism, even though researchers have done many studies to answer this important question. There is also no proof that any material used to make or preserve the vaccine plays a role in causing autism. Although there have been reports of studies that relate vaccines to autism, these findings have not held up under further investigation. Currently the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides the most accurate and up-to-date information about research on autism and vaccines. Its Vaccines and Autism Theory web site provides information from the federal government and from independent organizations about vaccines and autism. CDC U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Autism Theory www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism_and_autism_spectrum_disorders.cfm Autism131 http://www.chop.edu/service/vaccine-education-center/hot-topics/autism.html Hot Topics: Autism A Look at What Causes, and Doesn't Cause, Autism Recently, stories carried by the media have caused some parents to fear that the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) causes autism. Below is a summary of: The Wakefield studies (studies that support the notion that MMR causes autism) Studies showing that MMR vaccine does not cause autism Other studies on the causes of autism Conclusions The Wakefield studies Two studies have been cited by those claiming that the MMR vaccine causes autism. Both studies are critically flawed. First study In 1998, Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a paper in the journal Lancet. Wakefield's hypothesis was that the MMR vaccine caused a series of events that include intestinal inflammation, entrance into the bloodstream of proteins harmful to the brain, and consequent development of autism. In support of his hypothesis, Dr. Wakefield described 12 children with developmental delay - eight had autism. All of these children had intestinal complaints and developed autism within one month of receiving MMR. The Wakefield paper published in 1998 was flawed for two reasons: About 90 percent of children in England received MMR at the time this paper was written. Because MMR is administered at a time when many children are diagnosed with autism, it would be expected that most children with autism would have received an MMR vaccine, and that many would have received the vaccine recently. The observation that some children with autism recently received MMR is, therefore, expected. However, determination of whether MMR causes autism is best made by studying the incidence of autism in both vaccinated and unvaccinated children. This wasn't done. Although the authors claim that autism is a consequence of intestinal inflammation, intestinal symptoms were observed after, not before, symptoms of autism in all eight cases. Second study In 2002, Wakefield and coworkers published a second paper examining the relationship between measles virus and autism. The authors tested intestinal biopsy samples for the presence of measles virus from children with and without autism. Seventy-five of 91 children with autism were found to have measles virus in intestinal biopsy tissue as compared with only five of 70 patients who didn't have autism. On its surface, this was a concerning result. However, the second Wakefield paper was also critically flawed for the following reasons: Measles vaccine virus is live and attenuated. After inoculation, the vaccine virus probably replicates (or reproduces itself) about 15 to 20 times. Measles vaccine virus is likely to be taken up by specific cells responsible for virus uptake and presentation to the immune system (termed antigen-presenting cells or APCs). Because all APCs are mobile, and can travel throughout the body (including the intestine), it is plausible that a child immunized with MMR would have measles virus detected in intestinal tissues using a very sensitive assay. To determine if MMR is associated with autism, one must determine if the finding is specific for children with autism. Therefore, children with or without autism must be identical in two ways. First, children with or without autism must be matched for immunization status (i.e. receipt of the MMR vaccine). Second, children must be matched for the length of time between receipt of MMR vaccine and collection of biopsy specimens. Although this information was clearly available to the investigators and critical to their hypothesis, it was specifically omitted from the paper. Because natural measles virus is still circulating in England, it would have been important to determine whether the measles virus detected in these samples was natural measles virus or vaccine virus. Although methods are available to distinguish these two types of virus, the authors chose not to use them. The method used to detect measles virus in these studies was very sensitive. Laboratories that work with natural measles virus (such as the lab where these studies were performed) are at high risk of getting results that are incorrectly positive. No mention is made in the paper as to how this problem was avoided. As is true for all laboratory studies, the person who is performing the test should not know whether the sample is obtained from a case with autism or without autism (blinding). No statements were made in the methods section to assure that blinding occurred. BACK TO TOP Studies showing that MMR vaccine does not cause autism Ten studies have been performed that disprove the notion that MMR causes autism. In 1999, Brent Taylor and co-workers examined the relationship between receipt of MMR and development of autism in an excellent, well-controlled study. Taylor examined the records of 498 children with autism or autism-like disorder. Cases were identified by registers from the North Thames region of England before and after the MMR vaccine was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1988. Taylor then examined the incidence and age at diagnosis of autism in vaccinated and unvaccinated children. He found that: The percentage of children vaccinated was the same in children with autism as in other children in the North Thames region No difference in the age of diagnosis of autism was found in vaccinated and unvaccinated children The onset of symptoms of autism did not occur within two, four, or six months of receiving the MMR vaccine One of\ufffd the best studies was performed by Madsen and colleagues in Denmark between 1991 and 1998 and reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study included 537,303 children representing 2,129,864 person-years of study. Approximately 82 percent of children had received the MMR vaccine. The group of children was selected from the Danish Civil Registration System, vaccination status was obtained from the Danish National Board of Health, and children with autism were identified from the Danish Central Register. The risk of autism in the group of vaccinated children was the same as that in unvaccinated children. Furthermore, there was no association between the age at the time of vaccination, the time since vaccination, or the date of vaccination and the development of autism. Subsequent studies have corroborated the findings that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. BACK TO TOP Other studies on the causes of autism Genetics One of the best ways to determine whether a particular disease or syndrome is genetic is to examine the incidence in identical and fraternal twins. Using a strict definition of autism, approximately 60 percent of identical and 0 percent of fraternal twins have autism. Using a broader definition of autism (i.e. autistic spectrum disorder), approximately 92 percent of identical and 10 percent of fraternal twins have autism. Therefore, autism clearly has a genetic basis. Home-movie studies Clues to the causes of autism can be found in studies examining when the symptoms of autism are first evident. Perhaps the best data examining when symptoms of autism are first evident are the home-movie studies. These studies took advantage of the fact that many parents take movies of their children during their first birthday (before they have received the MMR vaccine). Home movies from children who were eventually diagnosed with autism and those who were not diagnosed with autism were coded and shown to developmental specialists. Investigators were, with a very high degree of accuracy, able to separate autistic from non-autistic children at 1 year of age. These studies found that subtle symptoms of autism were present earlier than some parents had suspected, and that receipt of the MMR vaccine did not precede the first symptoms of autism. Other investigators extended the home-movie studies of 1-year-old children to include videotapes of children taken at 2 to 3 months of age. Timing of first symptoms Using a sophisticated movement analysis, videos from children eventually diagnosed with autism or not diagnosed with autism were coded and evaluated for their capacity to predict autism. Children who were eventually diagnosed with autism were predicted from movies taken in early infancy. This study supported the hypothesis that very subtle symptoms of autism are present in early infancy and argues strongly against vaccines as a cause of autism. Structural abnormalities of the nervous system Toxic or viral insults to the fetus that cause autism, as well as certain central nervous system disorders associated with autism, support the notion that autism is likely to occur in the womb. For example, children exposed to thalidomide during the first or early second trimester were found to have an increased incidence of autism. However, autism occurred in children with ear, but not arm or leg, abnormalities. Because ears develop before 24 days gestation, and arms and legs develop after 24 days gestation, the risk period for autism following receipt of thalidomide must have been before 24 days gestation. In support of this finding, Rodier and colleagues found evidence for structural abnormalities of the nervous system in children with autism. These abnormalities could only have occurred during development of the nervous system in the womb. Natural rubella infection Similarly, children with congenital rubella syndrome are at increased risk for development of autism. Risk is associated with exposure to rubella before birth but not after birth. BACK TO TOP Conclusions The following studies all support the fact that autism occurs during development of the nervous system early in the womb: The genetics of autism The timing of the first symptoms of autism (home-movie studies) The relationship between autism and the receipt of the MMR vaccine Structural abnormalities of the nervous system of children with autism Thalidomide and natural rubella infection Unfortunately, for current and future parents of children with autism, the controversy surrounding vaccines has caused attention and resources to focus away from a number of promising leads.

Ms. Sebelius has ordered, suggested, beseeched, implored (?) American journalists NOT to \ufffdgive these people (anyone concerned with vaccine safety) equal weight in their reporting\ufffd because she has decided by informal governmental decree that the debate is closed?

Autism is Treatable. Watch the PSA here OVERVIEW DEFINITIONS/SYMPTOMS HOW IS AUTISM DIAGNOSED? VARIOUS TREATMENT OPTIONS RECOMMENDED READING AUTISM OVERVIEW BY ED ARRANGA DO YOU SUSPECT AUTISM IN SOMEONE? 12 TIPS TO HELP YOU TELL A PARENT. HELPFUL WEB SITES OVERVIEW Whether it's biomedical and therapy interventions combined, or simple therapy, autism can be treated...and thousands of children have progressed because of it. When families and caregivers begin looking into the various treatment options available for autism spectrum disorders, they will be surprised to find that there are many options out there. Unfortunately, what works for some families, may not work for others. Since individuals with autism spectrum disorders are not exactly the same, treatment plans need to be made specific for each individual. One thing's for sure, autism is not a hopeless diagnosis. To become educated about therapies and providers of therapies and biomedical interventions in your area, we suggest four things: Join a local support group or local discussion forum.* Join a national discussion forum. There are many to choose from. Click here for a list of groups.* Find a DAN (Defeat Autism Now) clinician in your area. Click here for a listing. Find a Generation Rescue Angel in your Area: Click Here. Check with your child's primary care provider for referrals to private therapists such as speech pathologists, occupational therapists, ABA specialists, etc. *Check with a DAN doctor, or your child's primary care physician before initiating any biomedical intervention. DEFINITIONS/SYMPTOMS Autism is a bio-neurological developmental disability that generally appears before the age of 3. Autism impacts the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction, communication skills, and cognitive function. Individuals with autism typically have difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. Individuals with autism often suffer from numerous physical ailments which may include: allergies, asthma, epilepsy, digestive disorders, persistent viral infections, feeding disorders, sensory integration dysfunction, sleeping disorders, and more. Autism is diagnosed four times more often in boys than girls. Its prevalence is not affected by race, region, or socio-economic status. Since autism was first diagnosed in the U.S. the occurrence has climbed to an alarming one in 150 people across the country. Autism does not affect life expectancy. Currently there is no cure for autism, though with early intervention and treatment, the diverse symptoms related to autism can be greatly improved. According to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development*, there are five behaviors that signal the need for a doctor** to immediately evaluate a child for autism \ufffd Does not babble or coo by 12 months of age \ufffd Does not gesture (point, wave, grasp, etc.) by 12 months of age \ufffd Does not say single words by 16 months of age \ufffd Does not say two-word phrases on his or her own (rather than just repeating what someone says to him or her) by 24 months of age \ufffd Has any loss of any language or social skill at any age. HOW IS AUTISM DIAGNOSED? Autism is diagnosed based on clinical observation and testing by a professional using one or more standardized tests. Professionals most likely to diagnose autism are psychologists, psychiatrists, developmental pediatricians, and school psychologists. Some of the screenings and tests which may be used in the diagnostic process are: CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale), Autism Diagnostic Checklist Form E-2, CHAT (Checklist for Autism in Toddlers), M-CHAT (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers), Pervasive Developmental Disorders Screening Test -2, ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale), and ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview ? Revised). In addition, parental interview and medical history are taken into consideration. The current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) has specific criterion required to make a diagnosis of autism, or a Pervasive Development Disorder. There are five disorders under the PDD umbrella which include Autism, Aspergers, Rhett's Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and PDD-NOS (not otherwise specified). The diagnosis of autism may be made when a specified number of characteristics listed in the DSM-IV are present. DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR 299.00 AUTISTIC DISORDER** *Source: The American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Washington D.C., American Psychiatric Association, 1994. A. A total of at least six items from (1), (2), and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): Qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction. failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) lack of social or emotional reciprocity Qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole body movements) persistent preoccupation with parts of objects B. Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. C. The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. For information on the diagnostic criterion for Aspergers, Rhett?s, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and PDD-NOS. If you suspect your child has a problem, go with your gut. Do not wait. Ask your child?s physician for a referral to a developmental specialist. If they refuse to give you a referral, call your local or state early intervention center and make an appointment for your child to be screened.

Where do I begin? Education is key. Parents are, and must remain, the driving force of our community, the stakes are too high and the issues too sacred to delegate to outside interests. Networking is vital. Parents need to network with more experienced parents, therapists, doctors, school officials and others who will be involved in the care of their child. Time is crucial. While a diagnosis provides entry to certain programs there is no need to wait, in some cases a year or more, before beginning various interventions. Biomedical tests, for instance, while not a diagnostic tool can identify many of a child's underlying etiologies and treatments started. Treating a child with autism is a large effort involving many professionals and non-professionals. The world of autism is dynamic. It is crucial parents continue to educate themselves and monitor, maintain, and direct the goals of the team for the benefit of their child. For many parents perhaps the greatest challenge is responsibility. Leaving the warm cocoon of established medicine to embark upon a more promising path requires faith in their own abilities and judgments and an understanding of their unique role as the final authority to help their child. Autism requires a parent's knowledge to be broad and deep. Questions and answers do not stop at the boundary of a discipline. There are no algorithmic answers. The most effective treatment plans combine a number of disciplines from the biomedical to the behavioral, each with their own range of options, each impacting the other. Parents must also deal with issues involving insurance companies, separation and divorce, state and federal regulations, and legal issues. Each child is different responding in different ways to identical treatments. Each parent is different as well. Some parents immediately recognize the benefits of and embrace treatments while others are reluctant at best or hostile at worst to even consider the most benign treatments. My expertise and job as a parent is to investigate, weigh, and implement the best options for my son, be they biomedical, behavioral, or other with an understanding of his unique talents, abilities, constitution and response to various treatments. Together the autism community moves forward replacing ignorance and fear with growing numbers of healthy children. In May of this year, my two year-old daughter was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. She has begun a few interventions already including developmental and speech therapy. She is to start a neurohealth preschool next month. Adding Omega 3-6-9 organic formula fatty acids to her diet has greatly reduced the amount of frustration that appears to be her constant companion. Also, a vitamin and iron supplement was added. What words of advice do you have for us? What is the rate of autism in children who are unvaccinated? My heart goes out to you autism can be a devastating diagnosis. I admire you and your husband's decision to move forward. There will be difficult days ahead but more than anything else your daughter needs your grace and strength, not your grief. Your daughter is fortunate to have been diagnosed at such a tender age. Please be aware our children get better; many recover completely given the proper treatments and therapies (and by recover I mean they are indistinguishable from neurotypical children). The earlier interventions are started the better. The fact our children get better is extremely important in how you perceive the problem and how you proceed to help. Recovery is not a rumor, or a myth, or a dream, or an article of faith, it is a fact borne of tens of thousands of children who have improved dramatically, many recovered. The idea of recovering children from autism is so far removed from people's concepts it is rarely thought about or acted upon. Currently the language of autism revolves around noise words like Not Otherwise Specified and Pervasive Development Disorder which reveal more about the meaning makers than the disease. Linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf contended that language determines the nature and content of our thought. Absent a vocabulary, the vehicle of thought which carry the ideas of recovery forward it will not happen. The vocabulary of autism needs to be placed firmly in the best tradition of the scientific method; testing, empirical evidence, measurement, examination, and objectivity. Hope is real. Autism is multivariate in presentation and cure. The disease bows to the collective weight of doctors working with therapists working with educators working with researchers working with parents working to recover their children. Your daughter's team of therapists, doctors, and educators must understand your goal and work together to implement your ideas and plans. Therapy You mention your daughter is receiving developmental and speech therapy at home. At her age Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is generally the most effective developmental therapy. You may want to include sensory integration. Other therapies to investigate for possible inclusion at a later date or to incorporate at the present depending upon her progress are Verbal Behavior (VB) and Floortime (DIR/Floortime). Preschool You also mention your daughter's enrollment in a neurohealth preschool. While it sounds good there are a number of factors to be considered. How many hours per week does she attend? She should be receiving a combined 30 to 40 hours a week (in-house and preschool) of one-on-one therapy. Does she have an Individualized Education Program (IEP)? Working in conjunction with the preschool you should develop an IEP with goals and objectives targeting skill-sets and behaviors. Do you receive a daily written log of her activities and behavior? A log, not a summary, detailing her day is a wonderful tool to track performance, uncover potential problems, and plan proactively. It also serves as a means for you to communicate in writing with the teachers. (I discuss this in more detail below.) How experienced are the teachers/therapists working with your daughter? She needs bright, energetic individuals with a minimum of 1 to 2 years working with children with autism. It would be preferable if they have obtained or are working toward their master's degree. A supervisor with a minimum of 5 years experience should work closely with your daughter's team of teachers and therapists overseeing, coordinating efforts, and adjusting the program as necessary. Coordinate the efforts of home therapy with school therapy. Act Now - Five Steps You Should Begin Immediately 1.) Find a doctor for your daughter who has recovered children with autism. Time after time parents fall into the trap of feeling a need to educate their practitioner. It becomes a full-time job, an end in itself. Left untreated autism is a deteriorating disease. Do not waste time playing teacher. Your current doctor can be used to order tests while you locate a more qualified physician. Your daughter's doctors do not have to be located in the same city or even the same state. Technology has created a global village. She can be videotaped so the doctor may better appreciate her behaviors and condition. Online video conferencing is also becoming popular. Conference calls, emails, instant messaging, and faxes facilitate real-time communication. Work with a variety of professionals including allopathic, naturopathic, chiropractic, Ayurvedic, homeopathic and Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners. For instance, children with autism should not take most over-the-counter medicines. Instead homeopathic remedies can be safely used to treat all the cuts, scraps, coughs, insect bites and other minor maladies our children are susceptible to. Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine botanicals are marvelous for treating fevers, yeast, and parasites. Many chiropractors are trained in cranial sacral therapy, a form of manipulation which has been very helpful for many children with autism. Defeat Autism Now! or DAN! practitioners are listed here. By and large DAN! practitioners follow the DAN! protocol for treating autism. The protocol is available here. Yahoo autism groups are another excellent resource. Currently there are over a thousand Yahoo groups devoted to autism. They range in membership from a few dozen to several thousand. Join a number of the larger groups and post asking members for help in finding a practitioner. Most of the members are fellow parents. The gold standard in the autism community is word-of-mouth recommendation by another parent. Parents will be honest and forthright with you about their experiences with physicians. While we are on the subject of Yahoo groups they perform another invaluable service. You can post almost any question and some parent or group of parents will have answers, good answers, usually within 24 hours. The collective knowledge in the autism online networked community is without precedent. It is the promise of the Internet realized. 2.) Test for yeast and bacteria overgrowth in your daughter's gut. A form of yeast called candida albicans and other intestinal microbes are a known problem in children with autism. The Organic Acid Test (OAT) will help you determine the severity of the problem. Typically children with autism have a history of ear infections which were treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics kill the good gut bacteria which normally keeps the yeast in check. Once the delicate balance has been disrupted yeast flourishes. Some of the behaviors linked to yeast overgrowth include confusion, hyperactivity, short attention span, lethargy, irritability, and aggression. Attempting to restore intestinal balance is a constant struggle. Probiotics (meaning good bacteria) are an excellent supplement to begin replenishing the stock of natural flora. Controlling yeast may be accomplished using an anti-fungal medication like Nystatin in combination with natural yeast-fighting supplements like garlic, MCT oil (medium chain triglycerides) and activated charcoal. Be careful. Other antifungal medications, like Diflucan and Nizoral inhibit the synthesis of steroid hormones. Treatment with either should not exceed 3 to 4 weeks followed by a 3 to 4 week rest period before beginning another round. During yeast die-off symptoms and behaviors often temporarily worsen due to toxins flooding the body. Yeast die-off reactions generally begin within a week after antifungal treatments are started and last for 2 to 7 days, sometimes longer. Your daughter should drink plenty of distilled water, at least 8 ounces every 2 hours, during the die-off period. There is growing evidence to suggest that individuals who experience greater than normal yeast die-off reactions suffer from elevated heavy metal levels. In addition, yeast overgrowth may only be eliminated in the long-term by removing the heavy-metal burden from the body. (Heavy-metal toxicity is something I will discuss in more detail below.) 3.) Implement a gluten- and casein-free (GFCF) diet. Almost 70 percent of children with autism respond favorably. The diet is not as difficult as it may seem at first. Download Mary Romaniec's presentation GFCF and Do We Really Have to do this Diet from this page which provides easy to follow, step-by-step instructions. Instead of GFCF diet the phrase GFCF environment might be more appropriate. Gluten is found in toothpaste, hair shampoo, Play Dough, glue, and finger paint among other items. Gluten is also hidden in many foods you would never suspect, for instance, raisins are often dusted with flour (gluten) to keep them from clumping. To effectively implement a GFCF diet a child's exposure to gluten and casein must be completely restricted (GFCF environment). Contamination can occur by touch, taste, or smell (skin, mouth, or nose). Some children are so sensitive they will react to gluten-free labeled foods which have been cross contaminated by the tiny amounts of airborne gluten found in plants processing other foods. Call the manufacturers to ensure foods are gluten and casein free. Your daughter may not react to cross-contaminated foods. On the other hand be alert to the possibility. In addition, manufacturers often change ingredients and manufacturing operations. Food from a trusted company may suddenly become a problem. It is a good habit to constantly check food labels and keep in phone contact with companies. The first month or two is a learning experience. Within a very short period of time, however, it will become second nature. Don't forget to throw away the old toothbrush when you begin the GFCF diet and begin using GFCF toothpaste. In addition to the GFCF diet is the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD). Many children who do not respond to the GFCF diet fare wonderfully on the SCD. Elaine Gottschall created the SCD and her book Breaking the Vicious Cycle is a testament that good science and clear, concise writing are not mutually exclusive. Reading Elaine's book is to know the illuminating power of science in the hands of a gifted writer. Ideas are presented not only in terms of what to do, but more importantly in terms of why. Elaine's work is a program for action steeped in something lived (Elaine saved her own daughter using a special diet). In conjunction with a special diet (GFCF or SCD) consider enzymes as part of your daughter's supplements. Enzymes will help her properly digest gluten and casein introduced inadvertently. Enzymes will also help her digest other proteins, fats, starches, carbohydrates, and fibers. 4.) Test for nutritional deficiencies. I'm happy your daughter responded well to the omega 3-6-9 fatty acids as well as the iron and vitamin supplement. Frustration is a behavior often associated with a deficiency in omega fatty acids. Care, however, must be exercised. Children with autism face unique nutritional requirements and can be particularly sensitive to the introduction of supplements. For example, omega fatty acids can have the effect of increasing sound sensitivities, tantrums, and meltdowns. B6 needs to be supplemented with magnesium. Copper and zinc ratios are usually out of balance requiring additional zinc. Iron will exasperate constipation. Binders, diluents, lubricants, artificial flavorings, and colorings found in most vitamins can cause problems. Our children are severely deficient in vitamins, minerals, enzymes, other nutrients, and fiber. A good place to start is to perform a nutritional assay. Please keep in mind each child is unique. How your daughter reacts can only be determined by carefully adding, or in some cases withdrawing, supplements and monitoring her behaviors, skin, nails, hair, stools, and urine. For the first year additional testing should be done about every 2 to 3 months to determine if she is digesting and absorbing the nutrients, and to make any necessary changes in supplements and dosage. Vitamin Diagnostics is a good lab for testing for deficiencies in vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and neurotransmitters as well as testing for heavy metals and other problems associated with autism. Vitamin Diagnostics can be reached by phone at 1.800.886.7773 or by email at vitamindiag@optonline.net. Other good labs include Doctor's Data, Immunosciences and Great Smokies. 5.) Test for heavy-metals. Over the past few years it has become more and more evident many of our children suffer from heavy-metal toxicity, particularly mercury. Mercury is in the air, water, food supply, dental amalgams (silver fillings), and it remains in many vaccines and the flu shot. It is not simply a matter of how much mercury our children are currently exposed to. Of great importance is the mother's exposure before, during pregnancy, and while breastfeeding. Studies by the CDC indicate that nearly 8 percent of childbearing-age American women currently have blood levels of mercury that exceed safe amounts. Many women received Rhogam shots during pregnancy and immediately after delivery. Rhogam, until recently, contained as much as 25 mcg of mercury. The mercury in a mother is passed to the developing fetus or nursing infant. Other sources, for example, in consumer products and fish can increase the level of mercury to the toxic tipping point. We normally excrete mercury through our hair, urine, feces, nails, and breath. Many children with autism, on the other hand, cannot effectively eliminate mercury. Their detoxification pathways are broken with mercury in the environment continually adding to burden. A hair-sample study by Amy Holmes, MD found strikingly lower levels of mercury in the hair of children with autism than neurotypical children. Dr. Holmes collected samples of baby hair, the first haircut, of 43 boys with autism and 14 neurotypical boys. The hair level of mercury in the boys with autism was barely detectable. The findings suggest children with autism cannot excrete mercury from their systems. The mercury builds to toxic levels. More information about Dr. Holmes treatment for mercury is available here. A study by Jeff Bradstreet, MD et al. corroborates Dr. Holmes' conclusion that children with autism lack the ability to eliminate mercury. The study evaluated the concentration of mercury in the urine following a three-day treatment with DMSA. DMSA (meso2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid) is a chelating agent which binds with and pulls heavy metals out of the body. The test results showed mercury in the urine of children with autism to be six times higher than the control group. Contrary to claims by vaccine manufacturers touting mercury free vaccines an investigation by Health Advocacy in the Public Interest (HAPI) recently found mercury in all four vials tested. This despite manufacturer claims that two of the vials were completely mercury free. Boyd Haley, PhD, Chemistry Department Chair, University of Kentucky, feels that if mercury can be detected in any vaccine using standard instrumentation, the content should be disclosed in the product insert and manufacturers should not be allowed to call the product mercury free. Heavy metal testing can be done using a sample of hair (2 - 3 cm) cut from the nape of your daughter's neck and sent to Vitamin Diagnostics or one of the other laboratories mentioned above. You will need to check with each lab for their policy about ordering test kits. Some require a physician's signature. Hair tests while a good general indicator of heavy metals do not provide absolute certainty. There is a small subset of children with autism who excrete far more mercury than average. Another test called a challenge test involves the use of a chelating agent followed by collecting and testing the urine for heavy metals. The challenge typically involves multiple doses over a 3-day period. Often multiple challenges are necessary before a child begins to eliminate the mercury in their system. Many parents are currently using DMSA as the chelating agent. Although DMSA is approved by the FDA Dr. Boyd Haley considers DMSA to be a neurotoxin. Dr. Rashid Buttar is experiencing great success using transdermal (applied to the skin) DMPS (2,3 dimercaptopropane sulfonate) as the chelating agent. A presentation by Dr. Buttar is available on this page. Education Socrates when asked what is good replied knowledge. There is no greater good you can do for your daughter than becoming knowledgeable about all aspects of autism. You are the expert. You know her abilities, desires, passions, problems, obstacles, and potential as no one else ever will or could. A number of good books to read include Children With Starving Brains, Biological Treatments for Autism and PDD and Let Me Hear Your Voice. Autism is a dynamic field. Try to keep abreast of the latest developments. The Schafer Autism Report is a free daily e-newsletter which provides important and timely information about autism. Also, the Yahoo groups previously mentioned will help. Responsibility Several years ago my son started ABA therapy. Crying during the initial ABA sessions, although common, is nonetheless heart-wrenching. This particular session Jarad's cries seemed different. The therapist was physically attempting to keep Jarad in his seat, forcing him to sit. I agonized for ten minutes trying to decide if I was imagining things. Finally, I entered the room picking Jarad up to comfort him, much to the chagrin of the therapist. I could see the wheels turning in her head, overly-protective parent rushes to aid of child, disrupting session, thwarting progress. Jarad's bottom and back of his legs were dotted with punctures. Being forced to sit compressed the cushion pushing the sharp screws into Jarad. The tips were not visible, hidden by the plastic seat cover. Jarad's screams were cries of pain, not frustration. Trust your instincts. No matter the time, place, or professional involved if you feel the least bit uncomfortable remove your child from the situation. Give yourself time to reflect, collect your thoughts, weigh other options, and make an informed decision. You are the final and ultimate authority on what is best for your daughter. Do not be bullied. For some it is a terrifying thought, the idea of assuming complete responsibility, the equivalent of stepping off the edge of a cliff at night. It can be the greatest difficulty parents face on the road to helping their children - the transition from trusting to questioning from acquiescence to Cartesian doubt. Question everything. The personnel at your daughter's preschool may be well-intentioned and wonderful professionals. As harsh as this may sound they are not your friends. Cultivate clinical detachment when dealing with professionals. Attempt to put as many decisions as possible in writing. A daily log can serve as an important permanent record for communication between you and the school. Sections can be devoted to requests, decisions, daily activities, special requirements, nutritional supplements, dietary restrictions, and other categories. Experimenting is Good While experiment has a Frankenstein-ish connotation it is the bedrock of science. Many parents, unfortunately, distance themselves from the idea. You will need to experiment with your daughter. For example, she may have great difficulty with any number of nutrients. Regardless of test results indicating particular deficiencies it is often not as simple as adding them to the mix. Proceed cautiously. Should there be a problem experiment with the dosage, experiment with the time of day a nutrient is given, experiment with every other day or every third day dosing. Your daughter's unique constitution is the only barometer of a treatment's efficacy. I am not aware of any treatment that does not cause some percentage, no matter how small, of regression in children with autism. Regression is generally not permanent and reverses when the offending treatment is discontinued. Develop a Plan Develop a 3-, 6-, and 12-month biomedical plan similar to an IEP. For instance, your daughter's IEP will contain specific goals like identifying shapes along with the methods employed to reach the goal. The same type of goal-driven plan may be employed for biomedical treatments. Consider the results of a hypothetical organic acid test indicating your daughter suffers from yeast. The goal is to drastically reduce the amount of yeast in your daughter's intestine. Define quantitative measures (numbers or percentages) to use as milestones (goals to reach in 3, 6 and 12 months). Again hypothetically consider her yeast score is 100. Normal is 5. The 3-month goal could be 60, the 6-month goal 20 and the 12-month goal 8. What methods will be utilized to reach the goals? MCT oil, Nystatin, probiotics and garlic are all effective in fighting yeast. She may have a bad reaction to one. Should another supplement be substituted? Which one? There are at least a dozen others. What dosage? What are the side effects? What if in 6 months the level of yeast is elevated? Perform the exercise for every problem (e.g., sound sensitivity, short attention span) or deficiency (e.g. vitamins) you can identify paying particular attention to the holistic action among treatments. For instance, omega-6 may cause sensitivity to sound. After removing the omega-6 your daughter could begin audio integration therapy and the omega-6 reintroduced. Developing a plan uncovers scenarios and leads to a better and deeper understanding of options and constraints. The plan is not static and is best if it accurately reflects your daughter's current condition as well as the latest treatment options. Keep a Log It is very easy to forget when a supplement was added or when a behavior first appeared. You have enough on your mind without trying to remember which came first. Also the act of writing serves as an aid to memory. Vaccinated versus Non-vaccinated I am not aware of any credible studies which compare the rates of autism in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated populations. There have been some studies which after initially receiving much attention by the mainstream media were shown to be fatally flawed, for instance, the Danish studies. You may be interested in the Geier's research which found children are 27 times more likely to develop autism after exposure to three thimerosal-containing vaccines than those who receive thimerosal-free versions. Mark Geier, MD, PhD, and his son David, are the only self-funded researchers publishing in peer-reviewed journals on thimerosal and autism using CDC data. A piece of great news and another indicator of the effect of mercury-containing vaccines versus mercury-free vaccines is the recent drop in the number of cases of autism reported in California. For the first time in the 35-year history of collecting data in July, 2004 California reported a third consecutive quarter drop in the number of children with autism. The decrease in the number of children with autism is the result of the reduction of thimerosal in vaccines beginning in 2000 and 2001. Much more work remains to be done as the autism community moves forward both at the state and federal levels to eliminate a known neurotoxin from vaccines and full shots. This year Iowa became the first state to ban the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines with many other states preparing to introduce similar legislation. At the federal level Congressman Dave Weldon, MD, and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney introduced legislation - HR4169 - for a broader ban on the use of mercury in vaccines. Can you offer a better understanding of orthodox medicine as it applies to autism treatment? I find it helpful when attempting to understand a field, orthodox medicine in this case, to put it in terms of familiar ideas. My background is software engineering. Surprisingly, at a fundamental level software engineering has more in common with medicine than it does with many of its engineering cousins, like mechanical and aerospace engineering. Software engineering and orthodox medicine suffer from the same underlying problem. The problem which causes your Windows Operating System to crash is the same problem which prevents orthodox medicine from helping children with autism. Two types of systems: continuous and discrete The distinction between software engineering and medicine, on the one hand, and mechanical and aerospace engineering on the other has to do with two different types of systems: discrete verses continuous. Software programs that run on your PC, like Windows, are discrete systems. Aerospace, mechanical and other engineering disciplines work largely in continuous systems. Continuous systems Here is an example of a continuous system. If I throw a ball into the air I can expect the ball to reach a certain height and return. It would be astonishing if the ball stopped in midair and then began accelerating upward. In continuous systems, like throwing a ball in the air, certain laws apply. As a result continuous systems can be modeled in mathematics. In continuous systems small changes in input result in small changes in output. Variables in continuous systems are knowable and predictable. Continuous functions are used to accurately map inputs to outputs. There are no hidden surprises. Continuous systems also exhibit a separation of concerns. In large complex continuous systems, such as an airplane, systems which are not connected will not impact one another. For example, we would be very unhappy if, as a result of a passenger in seat 38E turning on an overhead light, the plane immediately executed a sharp dive. Discrete systems Discrete systems (software) are not constrained by the same limitations as continuous ones. In software small changes in input can result in drastic changes in output, for instance, click the print icon in Windows and your system crashes. The values of variables in discrete systems are not always predictable. A variable may be 5 and after the next instruction is executed it may be 20 or 900. The value cannot always be predicted until the program runs. Discrete systems are non-deterministic. In discrete systems any part of a system can potentially affect any other part of the system. In other words, discrete systems do not benefit from naturally occurring separation of concerns. Every component in discrete systems is potentially connected to every other component. In discrete systems the ball could easily continue accelerating upward and the plane could execute a shape dive. Continuous systems (throwing a ball, cars, bridges) characteristics ? Small changes in input produce correspondingly small changes in output. ? Outputs can be accurately predicted based on inputs. ? There is a separation of concerns. Every element is not interconnected (a plane?s fuel system is not connected to its landing gear). ? The laws of physics apply, there are no hidden surprises (can be modeled by continuous functions). Discrete systems (software) characteristics ? Small changes in inputs can produce drastic changes in outputs. ? Outputs cannot always be predicted based on inputs. ? There is no naturally occurring separation of concerns. Every element in the system is potentially influenced by every other element. ? The laws of physics do not apply (cannot be modeled by continuous functions). The problem domain Grady Booch states, ?Since we have neither the mathematical tools nor the intellectual capacity to model the complete behavior of large discrete systems, we must be content with acceptable levels of confidence regarding their correctness.? It?s chilling, but accurate: We have neither the mathematical tools nor the intellectual capacity to model the complete behavior of large discrete systems. Moreover, large discrete software systems pale in comparison to the complexity of the human body. A misdiagnosis Orthodox medical theory and practice misdiagnoses discrete systems as continuous. The belief that children with autism function as continuous systems has been devastating in terms of diagnosis, research, and treatment. While orthodox medicine does not use the term continuous systems its diagnostic techniques, organization, and treatment options operate under many of the same assumptions. Orthodox medicine is obsessed with germ theory and disease states. The emphasis is on outputs and algorithms, or to put it in medical terms, on diseases (symptoms) and formulistic treatments. Only at a very superficial level does orthodox medicine permit the possibility of discrete systems behavior (any input has unforeseen outputs, small inputs produce drastic outputs). The differences between continuous and discrete systems demand different mindsets, new kinds of analysis and synthesis, and a different world-view. The most important step is to acknowledge the problem domain, to grant, rather than deny, the types of characteristics exhibited by children with autism are the same as those found in discrete systems. Small changes in input and predictable outputs Esteemed biochemist Roger Williams, PhD, found a 200-fold difference in calcium requirements among different healthy human subjects. Recent research in the toxicity of mercury has revealed sensitivities to mercury vary as much as a million-fold from one individual to another. Dr. Williams stressed that inborn differences between humans are extensive, significant, and crucial to understanding and solving most human problems. Dr. Williams also found nutritional status can influence the expression of genetic characteristics. The most important consideration according to Dr. Williams is biochemical individuality. Vitamins and other nutritional substances may well be the greatest and most enduring of medical discoveries of the 20th century. Vitamin A (1912, the first vitamin to be discovered) was named retinol because, without it, a healthy retina in the eye could not be formed. With the B-vitamins came the cures for beriberi, pellagra, pernicious anemia, nerve degeneration, enlarged heart, energy production, and many others diseases and conditions. Incredibly, orthodox medical practitioners are not required to understand nutrition to be licensed to practice medicine. The biochemistry of children with autism reveal many nutritional deficiencies, including vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, and amino acids (small inputs). Many children given supplements improve along a number of axes (profound outputs). For instance, children with autism often rub and poke their eyes. Some must be restrained with head gear to keep from gouging their eyes. It?s due to a calcium deficiency. The red rash seen around the lips, often called clown lips, is due to a vitamin B2 deficiency. Viewing a child with autism in terms of discrete systems behavior provides a more accurate model than the current continuous systems concepts. Children from autism suffer from extreme chemical sensitivities, food allergies, delayed food allergies, hypersensitivity to sound and light (small inputs). In addition, how different children react to trace amounts of the same substances cannot be predicted (outputs ? biochemical individuality). One child may suffer anger, another constipation, a third diarrhea. Limited by continuous systems thinking orthodox medical practitioners cling to the notion that your child is the same as my child is the same as every child. Autism is a one size fits all label precluding the necessity of further individualized investigation. Separation of concerns Orthodox medicine is a house defined by separation of concerns. The two general divisions are medicine and surgery. Within medicine there is internal medicine, cardiology, gastroenterology, pediatrics, geriatrics, dermatology, immunology, epidemiology, allergy, neurology, psychiatry, radiology, and pathology. Surgery is divided into surgery, orthopedics, urology, ear, nose and throat, obstetrics and gynecology, anesthesiology, and ophthalmology. Anatomical divisions include cardiovascular, nervous, urinary, integumentary, musculoskeletal, endocrine, reticuloendothelial and hematologic systems. One of mastering complexity has been known since ancient times: Divide et impera (Divide and rule). Granted, many important discoveries are due to analytical techniques which by partitioning (separating) produce manageable areas of study. Partitioning, however, is not without its own effects and not all of them are good. Analysis is only part of the equation. The separation of orthodox medicine into its current specialty and anatomical divisions is not by necessity, but by convention. Divisions evolved arbitrarily over a period dating to the middle ages. Today, it stands as the defining organizational paradigm of orthodox medicine. The blood brain barrier (BBB) was and is touted as a natural partition separating the brain from the body protecting our most vital organ from all manner of potential toxins. Recently, however, a number of methods have been discovered allowing toxins to penetrate the barrier. The entire blood-brain barrier edifice was built on experiments conducted in the 1920s and 30s. It was widely held, practiced, and believed that emotions originate in the brain. The hypothalamus was considered the seat of emotions which trickled down through its neural connections to the back of the brain, or brainstem, or through the secretions of the pituitary gland to the body. It is now understood emotions can originate in the body as well the mind, the paths are two-way, not one-way streets. Only within the past twenty years have cellular communication capabilities been discovered with the detection of interleukins, now called cytokines. The list of discoveries is endless, as it should be. Yet experience, not just theory must guide our understanding. There is an old adage, ?When theory meets reality, reality always wins.? A child with autism symptoms appear to originate in the mind, but that is only to the untrained eye which avoids looking at the entire body. Every input (possibility), including food, toxins, yeast, and others must be considered when a child bangs their head on the ground and walks on their toes. In children with autism the ball will continue upward and the plane will execute a sharp dive. Sidney Baker, MD, one of the founders of DAN! says ?Anatomically the CNS (central nervous system) and immune systems are quite distinct and different. One is made up of stationary long branching permanent cells with a compact headquarters between ones ears. The other is made up of a disseminated population of short-lived mobile cells with no specific organ to call home. Pick up any textbook of anatomy, physiology, or pathology. The CNS and immune system chapters are widely separated as are the experts who wrote the chapters. From the way I see it, however, they are a functional unit.? Dr. Baker suggests a different world-view, a separation of concerns based not on anatomy, but on functionality, a more natural and richer model. Functional medicine is part of a larger holistic health care movement which seeks to integrate, not separate. Holistic practitioners follow in the footsteps of empiricist physicians in the continuing battle for medicine dating to the dawn of science. Empirics promote the practice of medicine based on observation and experience. Rationalists (today known as orthodox medicine) seek medical certainty in formal logic (mathematics). Formal logic, however, has proven to be inadequate as a means to model large discrete systems. Organizational behavior Organizational behavior theory can be used to help understand, to examine how organizations work. The survival instinct is well established as one of the basic foundations in life, but it is not just life forms which exhibit survival strategies, organizations do so as well. Sterling?s pioneering work discovered a key organizational foundation: An organization?s chief concern is the optimum allocation of its resources to ensure its own survival. The specialties and anatomical divisions in orthodox medicine are organizations that act in their own best interests regardless of stated goals. Organizational behavior also finds the structure of an organization dictates its solutions, not to change them, but to reflect them. The super-structure surrounding orthodox medicine, including fundraising, allocation of resources for research, prestige, power, reimbursement for medical care and medical education depend on the current organizational format. Internal as well as external forces dictate its continuance. As a biomedical disease autism does not fit well into the current separation of concerns. (Autism is a multisystem disease with neurological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immune, developmental, and communicative abnormalities.) Turf warfare, politics, bureaucratic inertia, hubris, and other ?human? factors prevent orthodox medicine from applying an interdisciplinary approach to autism. Attempting to ?divide and rule? the body orthodox medicine has created walls to understanding. Orthodox medicine places a premium on analysis yet lacks an equal emphasis on synthesis. The organizational structure of orthodox medicine is an artificial separation of concerns. The tool has usurped reality as a world-view. Derivations from the model, like autism, are not addressed. Problems with orthodox medicine Do not equate orthodox medicine with medical science. Orthodox medicine is deeply flawed; its science preserved in amber-logic, existing outside of experience. Orthodox medicine has metastasized; rigidly staying within the confines of its own self-reinforcing coterie making it singularly unable to adjust, to learn, to help. Orthodox medicine?s fetish with continuous systems thinking, specialties and anatomical divisions relegates children with autism to a number of pre-determined, hugely unqualified, sub-specialists, among them pediatric neurologists and behavioral psychiatrists, where they are largely declared beyond the help of ?medical science.? To any of the countless questions parents raise when talking to orthodox medical practitioners the answers are uniquely uninformed, misleading, and often dangerous: Environmental toxins? Not a At its core orthodox medicine is antithetical to autism. A rigid reliance on deterministic disease definitions spins jabberwocky non-answers inducing Alice in Wonderland effects. After reading Jabberwocky Alice proclaimed, ?Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas - only I don?t know exactly what they are.? Summing up All children with autism exhibit discrete systems behavior (widely divergent outputs are exhibited based on similar inputs). Key for parents is recognizing the biochemical individuality of each child, bringing biomedical treatments to bear at the most appropriate points. Much as a jeweler carefully giving a gentle tap on a diamond reveals its inner symmetry, sparkle, brilliance and fire parents can bring the inner beauty of their children to the world by biomedical ?tapping? at the ?right? points. Our children are diamonds; each is unique, infinitely more precious. Contrary to the widely held orthodox medical opinion, our children get better; many fully recover (please see my previous column). Following Alice down the rabbit hole will never reveal the inner brilliance and happiness of our children, addressing their biochemical individuality and needs will. For more information please visit http://www.autismone.org Do You Suspect Autism in a Grandchild, Niece, Nephew, Neighbor, Etc? Telling a parent that you suspect their child has autism can be a scary process. Yet, it?s best for the child to not wait. Here are some tips that may help. 1. Make Sure ? Autism is a combination of serious symptoms. Be sure you are fully aware of the symptoms and have observed the child enough to know if the symptoms are present. Educate yourself thoroughly before causing false panic. 2. Gather the Literature ? Whether you get it from a reliable book, accredited web site, or other proven source, make sure you have gathered literature that outlines the signs of autism, how it is diagnosed, and where to find help. It may be helpful to mark the signs you see in the child on the literature itself. Be sure to make two copies if it is a two-parent home, and have an extra copy on-hand for yourself. Also, make sure the literature is simple and easy-to-read, and store it in a bag or briefcase until you meet with the parents. 3. Call ? Let the parents know you would like to sit down and speak with them. If they ask what it?s about, you can explain you are conflicted about something and would like to get their feedback. That way, you?re not lying, but at the same time, you aren?t blurting out ?There may be something wrong with your child.? 4. Don?t Wait ? Absolutely do not hold off telling them because you fear they?ll be mad at you. It?s easy to get caught up in not wanting to upset them too much or make them angry, but don?t. Their reaction will likely be less than favorable. Remember, you?re doing this for the child. The sooner you tell them, the better. 5. Do Not Tell One Parent ? If it is a two-parent home, make sure both parents are present when you voice your concerns. Call before you leave for the meeting to confirm both parents will be there. If one is unable to attend, ask to come at a time when both may be present. 6. Explain Your Reasoning ? Once you have sat down with the parents, explain you are there out of caring for them and their child. Speak about your observations. Because early intervention is so important, be sure they understand that, although you?re sorry to bring this concern to their attention, you feel as though you are doing the right thing. If you?ve had any hands-on experience with autistic children, be sure to remind them of this. 7. Present the Literature - Once you?ve explained your intentions, allow them to look at the literature you?ve prepared without interruption. The pages that outline the symptoms should be the first thing they see. 8. Don?t Be a Know-It-All - Do not overwhelm them with statistics, facts, or your vast knowledge of autism. In fact, once they review the literature, encourage them to get an opinion other than yours. Be sure you portray yourself as a messenger of information more than an authority on the subject. Chances are, if the child?s doctor hasn?t picked up on anything, they will automatically consider you wrong in your assessment. Ask them to please take the information to the doctor and request a referral to an early intervention center. Help them to understand in a delicate way that it will not hurt the child to be evaluated and may only be a precautionary measure. The less you push, the more receptive they will be. 9. Do Not Argue Back ? In the event that one or both parents becomes angry with you and wants to ?shoot the messenger,? or even attempts to argue the points you?ve presented, be sure to remain calm and compassionate. Do not argue. If it becomes too tense, leave the literature with them in a very kind way and follow-up later. There?s also a chance you will be asked to leave, or that one parent will leave the discussion. Do not argue do not follow the parent who has left. Simply leave the literature and be on your way. 10. Understand - Go into the situation understanding that everyone handles devastating news differently. Do not assume you will receive a ?thank you? or be looked at as a hero. You most likely will not. Parents do not want to hear their child is sick. Having to know in order to fix the problem is much different than wanting to know. Don?t assume you?re doing them a favor even though you?re technically an angel in disguise. In time, they will thank you, but for now they will feel the way they feel and react accordingly. Accept and understand. 11. Offer Support ? Chances are you are also devastated. If it is your grandchild or other family member who may have autism, you may need time for yourself to cope and grieve. During the meeting, be sure to focus on their sorrow and not your own. They are hearing the news for the first time, and their lives have just been turned upside-down. They need support now more than ever. If they are angry at you, choose to be strong for them by offering support. By doing this, you are quickening the healing process as well as helping the child. 12. Give It Time ? Do not call an hour later asking if they?re okay. Wait a day or two to call as a gesture of support. Do not make the conversation about their reaction, or your reaction to their reaction. Simply offer support. If they do not wish to speak with, don?t take it personally. Remember, they?re grieving for their child and, in some cases, are still trying to grapple what they?ve heard. Make sure to communicate with them on their terms and not your own.

Karen Mcdonough, executive director of the Autism Society of Illinois. Jenny McCarthy to deliver keynote address at Autism conference AutismOne and Generation Rescue announce a comprehensive autism conference, Autism Redefined, Monday, May 24-Sunday, May 31, at the Westin O'Hare Hotel, Chicago. This year's conference features more than 150 speakers, seven days of information, six tracks of education, four think tanks and a number of exciting new programs, including the Student Scholars for Autism as well as the Prediction and Prevention and Autism Advocacy Tracks. AutismOne was built by parents for parents to provide immediate answers to pressing questions - answers that educate and empower parents and that can be immediately implemented. Training for professionals is also a hallmark of the conference, benefiting everyone from doctors to lawyers to teachers to speech and behavioral therapists. This year AutismOne and Generation Rescue, Jenny McCarthy's and Jim Carrey's autism organization, will work together to help more children and families. They say that given the proper treatments and therapies children get better, many recover. In addition, they note that autism is treatable and they look forward to helping attendees become effective advocates and healers. Don't miss the inaugural American Human Rights Rally Wednesday, May 26, in Grant Park, planned as part of the conference.

The report, which confirms the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in the United States is one percent of the population, or one in 110 of children 8 years of age in 2006, ignited a firestorm of media attention. \"But for all of us working to enhance the lives of those with autism, the numbers really weren't a surprise,\" McDonough says. The report simply confirms what she's been seeing for years and the critical importance of early identification and interventions. \"It was the first time we've actually heard our government acknowledge the real increase in autism and the tremendous impact it can have on individuals, families and their communities.\" The report was conducted by the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network in 11 sites in 2006 and tracks prevalence in children eight years of age. Among report details is an important finding that while better diagnosis accounts for some of the prevalence, a true increase isn't ruled out. \"These findings can't be solely random or attributed to better diagnosis,\" McDonough says. \"Surely there must be an environmental component.\" Ongoing delays persist The report also cites the fact that ongoing delays in identification persist. Children diagnosed in 2006 were being diagnosed on average only five months earlier than in 2002. Other findings cite significant increases in prevalence among minority populations, with a 91 percent increase among Hispanic children, a 41 percent increase among Black children and a 55 percent increase among white non-Hispanic children. Prevalence was found to be 4.5 percent higher in males than females - citing one in 70 boys and one in 315 girls with autism. McDonough cites the recent explosion in treatment offerings, therapies, services and supports for those with autism and their families. Along with the increase in prevalence, she notes, comes an increase in need for lifelong adult programs, interventions and services. \"While the causes of autism are unclear, the good news is autism is treatable,\" she says. \"Millions of families are desperate for solutions and resources and we're here to provide support, information, networking and referral all along the way.\" While medical research continues to provide a greater understanding of the biological basis of autism, today's families have much more information on this disease and its roots as a neurobiological disorder. Autism Society Board of Directors Executive Director Karen Mcdonough President Kym Bills Vice President Dean Myles Treasurer Julie Goodman Secretary Michael Gallivan Past President Eric Smith Directors Joan Drummond Teresa Fox Laura Wald Sherry Laten Becky Moore Early diagnosis and intervention are critical, McDonough says. So is the need for expanded adult services including access to ongoing therapies, vocational training, augmentive communication, residential opportunities and more. \"The sooner people with autism and their families seek help and support, the better the outcomes,\" she adds. What is autism? According to the Autism Society of America, autism spectrum disorder or autism is a developmental disability considered the result of a neurological condition affecting normal brain function, development and social interactions. It affects more than 1.5 million Americans and their families. Children or adults with autism often find it difficult or impossible to relate to others in a meaningful way and may show restrictive patterns of behavior or body movements. Five developmental disorders fall under the Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis: Classic Autism occurs in males three times more than females and involves moderate to severe impairment in communication, socialization and behavior. Asperger's Syndrome is sometimes considered a milder form of autism and often diagnosed later in life. Those with Asperger's usually function in the average to above average intelligence range but struggle with social skills and restrictive/repetitive behavior. Rett Syndrome is diagnosed in baby girls who seem to develop normally until five to 30 months of age when motor skills and abilities begin to regress. A key indicator is the appearance of repetitive, meaningless movement. Childhood Disintegrative Disorder involves a significant regression in previous acquired skills and deficits in communication, socialization and repetitive behavior. Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) includes other children not fully meeting criteria for another diagnosis and those not having the degree of impairment.

Vision Our dedicated volunteer team of autism professionals provides free medical, educational, and diagnostic training to parents, professionals, and educators seeking information across the globe. All of our work is done on a volunteer basis. Our training teams take vacation time from their jobs to travel and conduct trainings which allows over 90% of donations to go directly towards our mission. Our organization was founded in response to a global autism crisis. Misunderstanding and misinformation continue to have dramatic consequences for children with autism. In many cases, children with autism go undiagnosed and fail to receive proper medical and educational treatments. In places around the globe children with autism are punished for behavior over which they have no control. Parents are stigmatized by the disability of their child and hide their children from the public. Children with autism are socially isolated and have no way to make their voices heard. AACTION\ufffds training and education will lead to better understanding and help people with autism realize their full hope for the future. AACTION\ufffds hope is that someday all individuals with autism across the globe will be accepted and lead independent, productive, and happy lives.

The so-called spectrum ranges from mild Asperger's syndrome to severe mental retardation and social disability, and there is no cure or widely accepted good treatment.Story continues below ?advertisement | your ad heredap('&PG=NBCMSH&AP=1089','300','250');Standard genetic tests to look for chromosomal abnormalities and testing for Fragile X, the single largest known genetic cause of autism, often fail to detect anything, even though genes are responsible for up to 15 percent of autism cases.The newer chromosomal microarray analysis test is far more sensitive. It searches the whole genome for places where chromosomes have been added, are missing or are in the wrong place. But because it is not recommended for the first round of testing, some insurance companies do not cover it.\"What we're hoping is to provide evidence to make it harder for insurance companies to say we don't want to pay for this,\" Dr. David Miller of Children's Hospital Boston, who worked on the study published in the journal Pediatrics, said in a telephone interview.getCSS(\"3088867\")Video\ufffd\ufffdStudy: Parent interaction key to autistic kidsMarch 15: A study by the University of Miami finds parent interaction integral in an autistic child\ufffds development.

Fragile X tests were abnormal in 0.46 percent of patients, while results of the CMA test turned up abnormalities in 7.3 percent of patients.\"What we showed here is what happens when you order all three of these tests up front. You end up getting more information from ordering the microarray test than from both of the two other tests combined,\" Miller said.Based on the findings, the CMA test should be considered a part of the routine diagnostic evaluation for people with autism spectrum disorders, said Bai-Lin Wu, director of Children's DNA Diagnostic Lab, who led the team.They estimated that without the CMA test, they would have missed a genetic diagnosis of autism in at least 5 percent of cases.Miller said genetic testing helps families that already have one child diagnosed with autism assess their risk of having another child with autism. And it can help parents get early intervention for a younger sibling that might be too young for an autism diagnosis.

Endorsed by the U.S. Surgeon General and the American Academy of Pediatrics, ABA is the only treatment for autism that has been consistently validated by independent scientific research. School districts are confronted by the ever-increasing needs of a growing population affected by autism spectrum disorders. Indeed, the recent CDC Study, estimating that approximately 673,000 children aged 3-21 have been diagnosed with autism nationwide, implies a huge gap between the number of children who need autism intervention and the availability of evidence-based autism services. In fact, it is estimated that less than 5,000 people worldwide are certified in ABA, making it difficult for school districts to develop and staff ABA-based program for students with autism.

These are also known as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). They are abnormalities in the neurological and/or psychological development resulting in difficulties communicating and interacting socially. They also have repetitive and stereotyped behavior patterns. Some of these patients have significantly lower IQ\ufffds to the point of mental retardation, see bestessay.com for more information about Autism. The Spectrum of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PPD) PPD subtype: Explanatory remarks: Asperger's syndrome Cognitive function and language skills are better than in autism, but they are perceived as eccentric with odd behaviors. They are clumsy, have repetitive behavior patterns and are socially isolated. Hypersenitive to noises, smells or tastes. One-sided interests; have difficulties recognizing jokes. Autism (autistic disorder) Onset at age 2 or 3 years; impaired language skills, social interaction, communication skills. Stereotyped, repetitive behaviors; some have mental retardation; some have seizures. Needs early diagnosis and aggressive comprehensive treatment program that focuses on child's deficiencies and helps to overcome these weaknesses. This may lead to independent living in adulthood in 50% of the cases (used to be only 10 to 15%). Childhood disintegrative disorder Initially there is a normal development unti the age of 2 years when suddenly a marked regression in development occurs. At least two of the following four functions are deteriorating: bladder and bowel control; language skills; social interaction; motor skills. It can become so severe that the symptoms are worse than in autism. Some of the behaviors may mimic autism or schizophrenia. Rett syndrome Affects mainly girls and is inherited by a mutation in the MECP2 gene on the X chromosome (Xq28 location). Following normal development for 6 months the head growth slows down and severe mental retardation sets in. A severe neurodevelopmental disorder with ataxic gait, seizures, loss of speech, loss of hand control and impaired social interaction ensues. Autism has been estimated to occur with a frequency of 10 to 12 cases in 10,000 live birth. When all PPD cases are included, the frequency of occurrence is about 20 cases per 10,000 live births (Ref.2). Autism is challenging to diagnose accurately as there is a spectrum of severity with regard to symptom expression. There are, however, a number of autism testing procedures available as discussed further below. They are best used in combination by a team specializing in autism. It appears that autism can have various causes likely accounting for the various degrees of severity of symptoms. In addition there is a genetic component as well. It has been determined that most autism cases are unrelated to diseases of the brain, but certain conditions like rubella or cytomegaly virus infections during the pregnancy as well as the genetic enzyme defect phenylketonuria have been described to cause autism. There is a strong genetic component for autism as parents who have one child with autism (or PPD) have a 75-fold higher probability of getting another child with the same neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been further confirmed in twin studies where there is a high probability that a monozygotic twin will also have autism when the other twin has been diagnosed with this condition. Several genetic loci have been located on chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 15, 19 and X. Here is a reference that mentions these genes regarding autism in more detail. Some patients have structural abnormalities in the brain, which lead to a higher risk of seizure disorders in addition to autism. In the last few years evidence has been accumulating that indicates that heavy metal poisoning from the environment likely plays an important role in triggering symptoms of autism. Individuals who are more susceptible to heavy metals like mercury or lead may accumulate these metals in their brains causing the above mentioned problems. It may well be that patients with autism are the ones that may lack some of the enzymes in their system necessary to eliminate the heavy metals the way the normal metabolism is usually working. In other words, some people may genetically more vulnerable to pollution or contamination of the environment than others (see YouTube presentation by lead researcher Dr. Boyd Haley). Concerns about this have been voiced in the public for many years with regard to mercury compounds that has been used as a preservative in vaccines (thimerosal). Manufacturers in the US have already reacted to this type of information and quietly lowered or eliminated thimerosal from vaccines, but in other countries it is still used. Two observations are important in this context. First, when autism patients are treated with hyperbaric oxygen (HBOT), some remarkable cures have been observed. Here is a link regarding hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). Secondly, when this is combined with chelation treatments to remove mercury and lead from the system, cure rates for autism are even higher. This link explains the mercury connection in more detail. There is also some evidence that autism can develop in patients who have been infected at a very young age with herpes simplex virus. This can cause an encephalitis, which in turn can produce symptoms of autism. Symptoms: The symptoms of autism usually become apparent in the first year of life by not reaching some of the developmental milestones in time such as sitting, walking, making eye contact and talking. By the age of 3 all of the autistic signs and symptoms are present. The main symptom is that the child has difficulties interacting with key persons such as parents, siblings, friends and peers. The autistic person has a problem forming mutual relationships likely due to an inability of imagining how the other person might be thinking when behaving a certain way or as a reaction to saying something in particular. One of the hallmark symptoms in a 1 year-old child with autism is that the child is unable to point at an object communicatively. Poorly coordinated gait or stereotyped motions are also common. Most cases have some degree of mental retardation and when the intelligence quotient is less than 50 there is also a 25 to 35% chance of a seizure disorder. Some of the more severe cases (about 25%) experience a regression of previously acquired language skills and social skills between 18 and 24 months. Patients with autism resist change; they are attached to familiar objects and engage in rituals. They tend to have a marked difference with regard to intellectual performance in the sense that one part of the intellectual functioning is very limited, but other areas may be highly developed. The 1988 movie \ufffdRain Man\ufffd popularized the condition of autism and displayed many of the symptoms mentioned above. Diagnosis: The diagnosis is made clinically by examining the patient, looking for symptoms and by doing a number of tests that have been specifically developed to diagnose autism. Some of the medical screening tests are tests to rule out phenylketonuria (PKU) and chromosomal analysis to rule out fragile X syndrome. IQ tests help to determine how severe autism is as the more severe forms have a minimized IQ. In the case of seizure disorders EEG studies are done. CT or MRI scans are done to rule out tuberous sclerosis. In terms of psychological tests the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is a widely used test (Ref.1). This is a good test for initial screening. Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is a comprehensive test that will use life time skills and is done in an interview setting (Ref. 4); this is a test that can be used from age 18 months to adulthood. It also provides the exact diagnosis according to the DSM-IV manual and the ICD-10 criteria. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) test complements the ADI-R test, but requires comprehensive training to apply. There are several modules for different age groups and for different levels of sophistication. This tests communicative skills, social behaviors and play behavior. Together all of these tests will help to establish the diagnosis and also help to prepare the treatment planning process. Treatment: The following points regarding treatment of autism (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PPD) are noteworthy. 1. Autism and PPD are lifelong chronic disabilities. To the lay person it may be difficult to see why the patient would be disabled as it is a combination of physical, behavioral and mental signs. 2. In children treatment should start from the day that the condition is diagnosed as early intervention has been shown to be very successful. This may make the difference between being able to lead a relatively independent life as an adult versus a case of autism of PPD diagnosed in a delayed fashion. For the toddler and the preschool child treatment consists of focusing on language development, imitation skills, recognition skills, responding in a social manner and learning appropriate behavior. 3. School aged children need a highly structured supportive teaching environment. The emphasis is on early intervention, tailored to the needs of the person, intensive and stimulating all areas of need as previously identified through the testing methods. The progress should be monitored as the program goes on and typically should show improvements in all of the targeted areas. Children with autism need more input than children with less severe PPD or Asperger\ufffds syndrome. Autistic children would need a combination of a classroom program tailored to their needs as well private individualized instructions. This needs to be well structured, consistent and needs to contain a lot of repetition of what is taught. 4. Adolescents and adults need to be taught different social, behavioral and communicative skills. The complex life demands have to be addressed in the curriculum. This can be addressed by social skills groups, groups that engage in recreational activities, vocational coaching and individualized psychotherapy. The purpose is to integrate the affected person as much as possible into society and teach them how to lead a full adult life. 5. A lot depends on family support. Hopefully the healthy members of a family will find the most appropriate educational and psychological professionals with experience in autism and/or PPD. Speech and language therapy are also very important as they are necessary to be able to approach any interventional program effectively. There often are areas of strength, which should be particularly developed as this will be respected and valued by peers and could be useful in future job training. 6. Special techniques in treating autism are: cognitive and behavioral therapy; speech and language programs; concrete pragmatic approaches with an individualized comprehensive intervention plan; develop communicative skills to the fullest potential; occupational and physical therapy to overcome physical limitations and prevent work accidents; look after the mental well being of the family and the patient alike. 7. Refrain from popularized miracle cures for autism. Many of them are one-sided and have no proven benefit on the long term. On the other hand it appears that the combination of HBOT (hyperbaric oxygen treatment) with chelation therapy may be quite effective in Asperger's syndrome and mild to moderate cases of autism. However, these alternative treatments are not inexpensive. 8. Treatment providers would include a treatment team with a physician, psychologist, social worker and the supportive services mentioned. 9. Medication: The reason medication is mentioned towards the end of treatment is that medication is not a substitute for the other treatment steps, but should only be used in conjunction with the above described comprehensive treatment program. Antidepressants (particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can be used to help suppress ritualized behaviors and preoccupations, which often accompany autism. Stimulants that are normally used in ADHD children have sometimes also been used in autistic children, but critical reviews showed effectiveness only when there was an element of hyperactivity and lack of attention span present. Antipsychotic medication (most research done with haloperidol) has been used to treat the target symptoms of hyperactivity, agitation, aggression, stereotypic behaviors, and mood lability. There are significant side-effects with conventional antipsychotics and lately the newer atypical antipsychotic medications have been used as a substitute with some degree of success. Anticonvulsant medications has been found not only useful for treatment of concomitant seizures, but was also found to be useful in treating aggressive autistic patients and when there are episodes of behavioral outbursts, particularly in those patients who have seizures at the same time. Prognosis: Autism has a better prognosis when the child has adequate language skills by the age of 5 years and the IQ is 70% or higher. The better the cognitive functions are (language, emotional interaction, memory, reasoning), the better the long-term outcome. Studies have shown that about 15% of autistic children turn into independently functioning adults. Modern more intensive and comprehensive treatment protocols as described above likely have a higher success rate (perhaps 40 to 60% functionality). Home page Mental Health Organizer References: 1.

Several scientific studies have shown that the typed messages actually reflect the thoughts of the person providing the support. Holding Therapy, in which the parent hugs the child for long periods of time, even if the child resists. Those who use this technique contend that it forges a bond between the parent and child. Some claim that it helps stimulate parts of the brain as the child senses the boundaries of her own body. There is no scientific evidence, however, to support these claims. Auditory Integration Training, in which the child listens to a variety of sounds with the goal of improving language comprehension. Advocates of this method suggest that it helps people with autism receive more balanced sensory input from their environment. When tested using scientific procedures, the method was shown to be no more effective than listening to music. Dolman/Delcato Method, in which people are made to crawl and move as they did at each stage of early development, in an attempt to learn missing skills. Again, no scientific studies support the effectiveness of the method. It is critical that parents obtain reliable, objective information before enrolling their child in any treatment program. Programs that are not based on sound principles and tested through solid research can do more harm than good. They may frustrate the child and cause the family to lose money, time, and hope. Selecting a treatment program Parents are often disappointed to learn that there is no single best treatment for all children with autism; possibly not even for a specific child. Even after a child has been thoroughly tested and formally diagnosed, there is no clear right course of action. The diagnostic team may suggest treatment methods and service providers, but ultimately it is up to the parents to consider their child's unique needs, research the various options, and decide. Above all, parents should consider their own sense of what will work for their child. Keeping in mind that autism takes many forms, parents need to consider whether a specific program has helped children like their own. At the back of this pamphlet is a list of books and associations that provide more detailed information about each form of therapy and other resources. Exploring Treatment Options Parents may find these questions helpful as they consider various treatment programs: How successful has the program been for other children? How many children have gone on to placement in a regular school and how have they performed? Do staff members have training and experience in working with children and adolescents with autism? How are activities planned and organized? Are there predictable daily schedules and routines? How much individual attention will my child receive? How is progress measured? Will my child's behavior be closely observed and recorded? Will my child be given tasks and rewards that are personally motivating? Is the environment designed to minimize distractions? Will the program prepare me to continue the therapy at home? What is the cost, time commitment, and location of the program? Top What Medications are Available? No medication can correct the brain structures or impaired nerve connections that seem to underlie autism. Scientists have found, however, that drugs developed to treat other disorders with similar symptoms are sometimes effective in treating the symptoms and behaviors that make it hard for people with autism to function at home, school, or work. It is important to note that none of the medications described in this section has been approved for autism by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is the Federal agency that authorizes the use of drugs for specific disorders. Medications used to treat anxiety and depression are being explored as a way to relieve certain symptoms of autism. These drugs scientists believe that autism and these disorders may share a problem in the functioning of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which these medications apparently help. One study found that about 60 percent of patients with autism who used fluoxetine became less distraught and aggressive. They became calmer and better able to handle changes in their routine or environment. However, fenfluramine, another medication that affects serotonin levels, has not proven to be helpful. People with an anxiety disorder called obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), like people with autism, are plagued by repetitive actions they can't control. Based on the premise that the two disorders may be related, one NIMH research study found that clomipramine, a medication used to treat OCD, does appear to be effective in reducing obsessive, repetitive behavior in some people with autism. Children with autism who were given the medication also seemed less withdrawn, angry, and anxious. But more research needs to be done to see if the findings of this study can be repeated. Some children with autism experience hyperactivity, the frenzied activity that is seen in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Since stimulant drugs like Ritalin are helpful in treating many people with ADHD, doctors have tried them to reduce the hyperactivity sometimes seen in autism. The drugs seem to be most effective when given to higher-functioning children with autism who do not have seizures or other neurological problems. Because many children with autism have sensory disturbances and often seem impervious to pain, scientists are also looking for medications that increase or decrease the transmission of physical sensations. Endorphins are natural painkillers produced by the body. But in certain people with autism, the endorphins seem to go too far in suppressing feeling. Scientists are exploring substances that block the effects of endorphins, to see if they can bring the sense of touch to a more normal range. Such drugs may be helpful to children who experience too little sensation. And once they can sense pain, such children could be less likely to bite themselves, bang their heads, or hurt themselves in other ways. Chlorpromazine, theoridazine, and haloperidol have also been used. Although these powerful drugs are typically used to treat adults with severe psychiatric disorders, they are sometimes given to people with autism to temporarily reduce agitation, aggression, and repetitive behaviors. However, since major tranquilizers are powerful medications that can produce serious and sometimes permanent side effects, they should be prescribed and used with extreme caution. Vitamin B6, taken with magnesium, is also being explored as a way to stimulate brain activity. Because vitamin B6 plays an important role in creating enzymes needed by the brain, some experts predict that large doses might foster greater brain activity in people with autism. However, clinical studies of the vitamin have been inconclusive and further study is needed. Like drugs, vitamins change the balance of chemicals in the body and may cause unwanted side effects. For this reason, large doses of vitamins should only be given under the supervision of a doctor. This is true of all vitamins and medications. Top What are the Educational Options? The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990 assures a free and appropriate public education to children with diagnosed learning deficits. The 1991 version of the law extended services to preschoolers who are developmentally delayed. As a result, public schools must provide services to handicapped children including those age 3 to 5. Because of the importance of early intervention, many states also offer special services to children from birth to age 3. The school may also be responsible for providing whatever services are needed to enable the child to attend school and learn. Such services might include transportation, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and any special equipment. Federally funded Parent Training Information Centers and Protection and Advocacy Agencies in each state can provide information on the rights of the family and child. By law, public schools are also required to prepare and carry out a set of specific instructional goals for every child in a special education program. The goals are stated as specific skills that the child will be taught to perform. The list of skills make up what is known as an IEP -the child's Individualized Educational Program. The IEP serves as an agreement between the school and the family on the educational goals. Because parents know their child best, they play an important role in creating this plan. They work closely with the school staff to identify which skills the child needs most. In planning the IEP, it's important to focus on what skills are critical to the child's well-being and future development. For each skill, parents and teachers should consider these questions: Is this an important life skill? What will happen if the child isn't trained to do this for herself? Such questions free parents and teachers to consider alternatives to training. After several years of valiant effort to teach Alan to tie his shoelaces, his parents and teachers decided that Alan could simply wear sneakers with Velcro fasteners, and dropped the skill from Alan's IEP. After Alan struggled in vain to memorize the multiplication table, they decided to teach him to use a calculator. A child's success in school should not be measured against standards like mastering algebra or completing high school. Rather, progress should be measured against his or her unique potential for self-care and self-sufficiency as an adult. Adolescence For all children, adolescence is a time of stress and confusion. No less so for teenagers with autism. Like all children, they need help in dealing with their budding sexuality. While some behaviors improve in the teenage years, some get worse. Increased autistic or aggressive behavior may be one way some teens express their newfound tension and confusion. The teenage years are also a time when children become more socially sensitive and aware. At the age that most teenagers are concerned with acne, popularity, grades, and dates, teens with autism may become painfully aware that they are different from their peers. They may notice that they lack friends. And unlike their schoolmates, they aren't dating or planning for a career. For some, the sadness that comes with such realization urges them to learn new behaviors. Sean Barron, who wrote about his autism in the book, There's a Boy in Here, describes how the pain of feeling different motivated him to acquire more normal social skills. Top Can Autism be Outgrown? At present, there is no cure for autism. Nor do children outgrow it. But the capacity to learn and develop new skills is within every child. With time, children with autism mature and new strengths emerge. Many children with autism seem to go through developmental spurts between ages 5 and 13. Some spontaneously begin to talk-even if repetitively-around age 5 or later. Some, like Paul, become more sociable, or like Alan, more ready to learn. Over time, and with help, children may learn to play with toys appropriately, function socially, and tolerate mild changes in routine. Some children in treatment programs lose enough of their most disabling symptoms to function reasonably well in a regular classroom. Some children with autism make truly dramatic strides. Of course, those with normal or near-normal intelligence and those who develop language tend to have the best outcomes. But even children who start off poorly may make impressive progress. For example, one boy, after 9 years in a program that involved parents as co-therapists, advanced from an IQ of 70 to an IQ of 100 and began to get average grades at a regular school. While it is natural for parents to hope that their child will become normal, they should take pride in whatever strides their child does make. Many parents, looking back over the years, find their child has progressed far beyond their initial expectations. Can Adults with Autism Live Independent Lives? The majority of adults with autism need lifelong training, ongoing supervision, and reinforcement of skills. The public schools' responsibility for providing these services ends when the person is past school age. As the child becomes a young adult, the family is faced with the challenge of creating a home-based plan or selecting a program or facility that can offer such services. In some cases, adults with autism can continue to live at home, provided someone is there to supervise at all times. A variety of residential facilities also provide round-the-clock care. Unlike many of the institutions years ago, today's facilities view residents as people with human needs, and offer opportunities for recreation and simple, but meaningful work. Still, some facilities are isolated from the community, separating people with autism from the rest of the world. Today, a few cities are exploring new ways to help people with autism hold meaningful jobs and live and work within the wider community. Innovative, supportive programs enable adults with autism to live and work in mainstream society, rather than in a segregated environment. By teaching and reinforcing good work skills and positive social behaviors, such programs help people live up to their potential. Work is meaningful and based on each person's strengths and abilities. For example, people with autism with good hand-eye coordination who do complex, repetitive actions are often especially good at assembly and manufacturing tasks. A worker with a low IQ and few language skills might be trained to work in a restaurant sorting silverware and folding napkins. Adults with higher-level skills have been trained to assemble electronic equipment or do office work. Based on their skills and interests, participants in such programs fill positions in printing, retail, clerical, manufacturing, and other companies. Once they are carefully trained in a task, they are put to work alongside the regular staff. Like other employees, they are paid for their labor, receive employee benefits, and are included in staff events like company picnics and retirement parties. Companies that hire people through such programs find that these workers make loyal, reliable employees. Employers find that the autistic behaviors, limited social skills, and even occasional tantrums or aggression, do not greatly affect the worker's ability to work efficiently or complete tasks. Like any other worker, program participants live in houses and apartments within the community. Under the direction of a residence coach, each resident shares as much as possible in tasks like meal-planning, shopping, cooking, and cleanup. For recreation, they go to movies, have picnics, and eat in restaurants. As they are ready, they are taught skills that make them more personally independent. Some take pride in having learned to take a bus on their own, or handling money they've earned themselves. Job and residence coaches, who serve as a link between the program participants and the community, are the key to such programs. There may be as few as two adults with autism assigned to each coach. The job coach demonstrates the steps of a job to the worker, observes behavior, and regularly acknowledges good performance. The job coach also serves as a bridge between the workers with autism and their co-workers. For example, the coach steps in if a worker loses self-control or presents any problems on the job. The coach also provides training in specific social skills, such as waving or saying hello to fellow workers. At home, the residence coach reinforces social and self-help behaviors, and finds ways to help people manage their time and responsibilities. At present, about a third of all people with autism can live and work in the community with some degree of independence. As scientific research points the way to more effective therapies and as communities establish programs that provide proper support, expectations are that this number will grow. Top How Do Families Learn to Cope? The task of rearing a child with autism is among the most demanding and stressful that a family faces. The child's screaming fits and tantrums can put everyone on edge. Because the child needs almost constant attention, brothers and sisters often feel ignored or jealous. Younger children may need to be reassured that they will not catch autism or grow to become like their sibling. Older children may be concerned about the prospect of having a child with autism themselves. The tensions can strain a marriage. While friends and family may try to be supportive, they can't understand the difficulties in raising a child with autism. They may criticize the parents for letting their child get away with certain behaviors and announce how they would handle the child. Some parents of children with autism feel envious of their friends' children. This may cause them to grow distant from people who once gave them support. Families may also be uncomfortable taking their child to public places. Children who throw tantrums, walk on their toes, flail their arms, or climb under restaurant tables to play with strangers' socks, can be very embarrassing. Janie's mother found that once she became willing to explain to strangers that her child has autism, people were more accepting. Paul's mother has learned to remind herself, This is a public place. We have a right to be here. Many parents feel deeply disappointed that their child may never engage in normal activities or attain some of life's milestones. Parents may mourn that their child may never learn to play baseball, drive, get a diploma, marry, or have children. However, most parents come to accept these feelings and focus on helping their children achieve what they can. Parents begin to find joy and pleasure in their child despite the limitations. Support groups Many parents find that others who face the same concerns are their strongest allies. Parents of children with autism tend to form communities of mutual caring and support. Parents gain not only encouragement and inspiration from other families' stories, but also practical advice, information on the latest research, and referrals to community services and qualified professionals. By talking with other people who have similar experiences, families dealing with autism learn they are not alone. The Autism Society of America, listed at the close of this pamphlet, has spawned parent support groups in communities across the country. In such groups, parents share emotional support, affirmation, and suggestions for solving problems. Its newsletter, the Advocate, is filled with up-to-date medical and practical information. Coping Strategies The following suggestions are based on the experiences of families in dealing with autism, and on NIMH-sponsored studies of effective strategies for dealing with stress. Work as a family. In times of stress, family members tend to take their frustrations out on each other when they most need mutual support. Despite the difficulties in finding child care, couples find that taking breaks without their children helps renew their bonds. The other children also need attention, and need to have a voice in expressing and solving problems. Keep a sense of humor. Parents find that the ability to laugh and say, You won't believe what our child has done now! helps them maintain a healthy sense of perspective. Notice progress. When it seems that all the help, love, and support is going nowhere, it's important to remember that over time, real progress is being made. Families are better able to maintain their hope if they celebrate the small signs of growth and change they see. Take action. Many parents gain strength working with others on behalf of all children with autism. Working to win additional resources, community programs, or school services helps parents see themselves as important contributors to the well-being of others as well as their own child. Plan ahead. Naturally, most parents want to know that when they die, their offspring will be safe and cared for. Having a plan in place helps relieve some of the worry. Some parents form a contract with a professional guardian, who agrees to look after the interests of the person with autism, such as observing birthdays and arranging for care. Top What Hope Does Research Offer? Research continues to reveal how the brain-the control center for thought, language, feelings, and behavior-carries out its functions. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funds scientists at centers across the Nation who are exploring how the brain develops, transmits its signals, integrates input from the senses, and translates all this into thoughts and behavior. In recognition of growing scientific gains in brain research, the President and Congress have officially designated the 1990s as the Decade of the Brain. There are new research initiatives at NIH sponsored by NIMH, NICHD, NINDS, and NIDCD. As a result, today as never before, investigators from various scientific disciplines are joining forces to unlock the mysteries of the brain. Perspective gained from research into the genetic, biochemical, physiological, and psychological aspects of autism may provide a more complete view of the disorder. Every day, NIH-sponsored researchers are learning more about how the brain develops normally and what can go wrong in the process. Already, for example, scientists have discovered evidence suggesting that in autism, brain development slows at some point before week 30 of pregnancy. Scientists now also have tools and techniques that allow them to examine the brain in ways that were unthought of just a few years ago. New imaging techniques that show the living brain in action permit scientists to observe with surprising clarity how the brain changes as an individual performs mental tasks, moves, or speaks. Such techniques open windows to the brain, allowing scientists to learn which brain regions are engaged in particular tasks. In addition, recent scientific advances are permitting scientists to break new ground in researching the role of heredity in autism. Using sophisticated statistical methods along with gene splicing-a technique that enables scientists to manipulate the microscopic bits of genetic code-investigators sponsored by NIH and other institutions are searching for abnormal genes that may be involved in autism. The ability to identify irregular genes-or the factors that make a gene unstable-may lead to earlier diagnoses. Meanwhile, scientists are working to determine if there is a genetic link between autism and other brain disorders commonly associated with it, such as Tourette Disorder and Tuberous Sclerosis. New insights into the genetic transmission of these disorders, along with newly gained knowledge of normal and abnormal brain development should provide important clues to the causes of autism. A key to developing our understanding of the human brain is research involving animals. Like humans, other primates, such as chimpanzees, apes, and monkeys, have emotions, form attachments, and develop higher-level thought processes. For this reason, studies of their brain functions and behavior shed light on human development. Animal studies have proven invaluable in learning how disruptions to the developing brain affect behavior, sensory perceptions, and mental development and have led to a better understanding of autism. Ultimately, the results of NIMH's extensive research program may translate into better lives for people with autism. As we get closer to understanding the brain, we approach a day when we may be able to diagnose very young children and provide effective treatment earlier in the child's development. As data accumulate on the brain chemicals involved in autism, we get closer to developing medications that reduce or reverse imbalances. Someday, we may even have the ability to prevent the disorder. Perhaps researchers will learn to identify children at risk for autism at birth, allowing doctors and other health care professionals to provide preventive therapy before symptoms ever develop. Or, as scientists learn more about the genetic transmission of autism, they may be able to replace any defective genes before the infant is even born. Top What are Sources of Information and Support? Parents often find that books and movies about autism that have happy endings cheer them, but raise false hopes. In such stories, a parent's novel approach suddenly works or the child simply outgrows the autistic behaviors. But there really are no cures for autism and growth takes time and patience. Parents should seek practical, realistic sources of information, particularly those based on careful research. Similarly, certain sources of information are more reliable than others. Some popular magazines and newspapers are quick to report new miracle cures before they have been thoroughly researched. Scientific and professional materials, such as those published by the Autism Society of America and other organizations that take the time to thoroughly evaluate such claims, provide current information based on well-documented data and carefully controlled clinical research.

My approach to research indicates foods can contribute significantly or play an important role in autism or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is usually very serious and permanent. In the early 1970s, I received a research grant from NIMH to study autism and its relationship to food. The reviewers of the grant found the results to be too good to be believed and declined to publish the findings. The results showed that autism is curable by diet alone if caught early enough. As you have seen in your own experience, the medical community can be extremely close-minded when it comes to the treatment of autism. I have found that delayed food sensitivities in an autistic child are unique to each one as well as their dietary habits. With milk and wheat being among the most common problems, their limitation leads to success in a large number of cases. Those children who do not respond to the milk and wheat-free (GF/GC) diet probably have other foods contributing to ASD symptoms. Through very specialized testing (the Sage Complement Antigen Test) I have been able to accurately pinpoint other common foods that effect autism, ADHD, and hyperactivity in children. Early diagnosis of autism is extremely important if diet manipulation is to manage this problem. Since the medical community is extremely resistant to the concept that simple foods cause chronic diseases, pediatricians are reluctant to make an early diagnosis of any chronic disease. I just recently participated in the treatment of a young boy from Philadelphia whose mother knew he was autistic but his pediatrician refused to make a diagnosis until the child was three and a half years old. This particular child has made remarkable progress according to his mother in just six short months. Five years ago, I started working with the doctors at the Southwest Autism Research Center (SARC) in Phoenix, Arizona. One of the SARC founders (Dr. Cindy Schneider now at The Center for Autism Research and Education - CARE) confirmed that early diagnosis and elimination of all harmful foods works. One of her early patients, who had been diagnosed in another clinic and was reconfirmed as autistic by the UCLA Medical Center Pediatric Department, in now entirely normal after having been tested and treated under the Sage program. In addition, she said today no one would diagnose this boy as being autistic. Presently, he is in a regular first grade classroom and is doing exceptionally well. In 2001, I had the pleasure of meeting with a mother of a formerly autistic boy (now 18 years old) that we successfully treated by elimination of harmful foods 16 years ago. The doctors at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center had diagnosed her son as being autistic and offered her absolutely no hope. She heard about my research and believed that foods were hindering her son's development. After two months of the removal of specific foods from his diet, she reintroduced each food and then recorded his behavioral and bodily changes. The permanent elimination of those foods having an adverse effect on her son brought about great improvement in her son's behavior and bodily functions. Afterwards he went to a special center for rehabilitation at the DT Watson Center where they were successfully able to rectify his developmental deficiencies. He entered into a public school kindergarten class and has been in regular public schools ever since. He is now graduated from a small western Pennsylvania high school having a normal teenage life (played in the band and run cross-country) as a growing and very active teenager. He graduated in 2005 and now attends Pennsylvania State University. He didn't obtain his PA drivers license until age 18. Before he got the drivers license he stated to his mother, \"When I am willing to take on the responsibility of being a driver, I will get my drivers license.\" I cannot stress enough the importance of the early diagnosis of autism, the significance of testing for harmful foods, and the complete elimination of these foods from a child's diet. This early intervention will be the most critical intervention you will do for your autistic child, especially if the child is under the age of three years or before full brain maturation. Daniel C.

How is autism diagnosed? What causes autism? Are there accompanying disorders? Finding Help and Hope Is there reason for hope? Can social skills and behavior be improved? What medications are available? What medications are available? What are the educational options? Can autism be outgrown? Can adults with autism live independent lives? How do families learn to cope? What hope does reasearch offer? Autism Isolated in worlds of their own, people with autism appear indifferent and remote and are unable to form emotional bonds with others. Although people with this baffling brain disorder can display a wide range of symptoms and disability, many are incapable of understanding other people's thoughts, feelings, and needs. Often, language and intelligence fail to develop fully, making communication and social relationships difficult. Many people with autism engage in repetitive activities, like rocking or banging their heads, or rigidly following familiar patterns in their everyday routines. Some are painfully sensitive to sound, touch, sight, or smell. Children with autism do not follow the typical patterns of child development. In some children, hints of future problems may be apparent from birth. In most cases, the problems become more noticeable as the child slips farther behind other children the same age. Other children start off well enough. But between 18 and 36 months old, they suddenly reject people, act strangely, and lose language and social skills they had already acquired. As a parent, teacher, or caregiver you may know the frustration of trying to communicate and connect with children or adults who have autism. You may feel ignored as they engage in endlessly repetitive behaviors. You may despair at the bizarre ways they express their inner needs. And you may feel sorrow that your hopes and dreams for them may never materialize. But there is help-and hope. Gone are the days when people with autism were isolated, typically sent away to institutions. Today, many youngsters can be helped to attend school with other children. Methods are available to help improve their social, language, and academic skills. Even though more than 60 percent of adults with autism continue to need care throughout their lives, some programs are beginning to demonstrate that with appropriate support, many people with autism can be trained to do meaningful work and participate in the life of the community. Autism is found in every country and region of the world, and in families of all racial, ethnic, religious, and economic backgrounds. Emerging in childhood, it affects about 1 or 2 people in every thousand and is three to four times more common in boys than girls. Girls with the disorder, however, tend to have more severe symptoms and lower intelligence. In addition to loss of personal potential, the cost of health and educational services to those affected exceeds $3 billion each year. So, at some level, autism affects us all. This article is written by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the Federal agency that conducts and supports research on mental and brain disorders, including autism. NIMH is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is the Federal Government's primary agency for biomedical and behavioral research. Research on autism and related disorders is also sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). NIMH scientists are dedicated to understanding the workings and interrelationships of the various regions of the brain, and to developing preventive measures and new treatments for disorders like autism that handicap people in school, work, and social relationships. Up-to-date information on autism and the role of NIMH in identifying underlying causes and effective treatments are included in this pamphlet. Also described are symptoms and diagnostic procedures, treatment options, strategies for coping, and sources of information and support. The individuals referred to in this brochure are not real, but their stories are based on interviews with parents who have children with autism. Understanding the Problem Paul Paul has always been obsessed with order. As a child, he lined up blocks, straightened chairs, kept his toothbrush in the exact same spot on the sink, and threw a tantrum when anything was moved. Paul could also become aggressive. Sometimes, when upset or anxious, he would suddenly explode, throwing a nearby object or smashing a window. When overwhelmed by noise and confusion, he bit himself or picked at his nails until they bled. At school, where his schedule and environment could be carefully structured, his behavior was more normal. But at home, amid the unpredictable, noisy hubbub of a large family, he was often out of control. His behavior made it harder and harder for his parents to care for him at home and also meet their other children's needs. At that time-more than 10 years ago-much less was known about the disorder and few therapeutic options were available. So, at age 9, his parents placed him in a residential program where he could receive 24-hour supervision and care. Alan As an infant, Alan was playful and affectionate. At 6 months old, he could sit up and crawl. He began to walk and say words at 10 months and could count by 13 months. One day, in his 18th month, his mother found him sitting alone in the kitchen, repeatedly spinning the wheels of her vacuum cleaner with such persistence and concentration, he didn't respond when she called. From that day on, she recalls, It was as if someone had pulled a shade over him. He stopped talking and relating to others. He often tore around the house like a demon. He became fixated on electric lights, running around the house turning them on and off. When made to stop, he threw a tantrum, kicking and biting anyone within reach. Janie From the day she was born, Janie seemed different from other infants. At an age when most infants enjoy interacting with people and exploring their environment, Janie sat motionless in her crib and didn't respond to rattles or other toys. She didn't seem to develop in the normal sequence, either. She stood up before she crawled, and when she began to walk, it was on her toes. By 30 months old, she still wasn't talking. Instead, she grabbed things or screamed to get what she wanted. She also seemed to have immense powers of concentration, sitting for hours looking at a toy in her hand. When Janie was brought to a special clinic for evaluation, she spent an entire testing session pulling tufts of wool from the psychologist's sweater. What is Autism? Autism is a brain disorder that typically affects a person's ability to communicate, form relationships with others, and respond appropriately to the environment. Some people with autism are relatively high-functioning, with speech and intelligence intact. Others are mentally retarded, mute, or have serious language delays. For some, autism makes them seem closed off and shut down; others seem locked into repetitive behaviors and rigid patterns of thinking. Although people with autism do not have exactly the same symptoms and deficits, they tend to share certain social, communication, motor, and sensory problems that affect their behavior in predictable ways. Difference in the Behaviors of Infants With and Without Autism Infants with Autism Normal Infants Communication Avoid eye contact Seem deaf Start developing language, then abruptly stop talking altogether Study mother's face Easily stimulated by sounds Keep adding to vocabulary and expanding grammatical usage Social relationships Act as if unaware of the coming and going of others Physically attack and injure others without provocation Inaccessible, as if in a shell Cry when mother leaves the room and are anxious with strangers Get upset when hungry or frustrated Recognize familiar faces and smile Exploration of environment Remain fixated on a single item or activity Practice strange actions like rocking or hand-flapping Sniff or lick toys Show no sensitivity to burns or bruises, and engage in self-mutilation, such as eye gouging Move from one engrossing object or activity to another Use body purposefully to reach or acquire objects Explore and play with toys Seek pleasure and avoid pain NOTE: This list is not intended to be used to assess whether a particular child has autism. Diagnosis should only be done by a specialist using highly detailed background information and behavioral observations. Social symptoms From the start, most infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, endearingly grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most children with autism seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention and affection or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to anger or affection. Unlike other children, they rarely become upset when the parent leaves or show pleasure when the parent returns. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of response. Children with autism also take longer to learn to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues-whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace-may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, Come here, always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or squinting and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with autism have problems seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with autism may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. Some people with autism also tend to be physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. Some lose control, particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They are capable at times of breaking things, attacking others, or harming themselves. Alan, for example, may fall into a rage, biting and kicking when he is frustrated or angry. Paul, when tense or overwhelmed, may break a window or throw things. Others are self-destructive, banging their heads, pulling their hair, or biting their arms. Language difficulties By age 3, most children have passed several predictable milestones on the path to learning language. One of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it very clear that his answer is no. By age 2, most children begin to put together sentences like See doggie, or More cookie, and can follow simple directions. Research shows that about half of the children diagnosed with autism remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of autism do coo and babble during the first 6 months of life. But they soon stop. Although they may learn to communicate using sign language or special electronic equipment, they may never speak. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 8. Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. Some seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words. Others repeat the same phrase no matter what the situation. Some children with autism are only able to parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Without persistent training, echoing other people's phrases may be the only language that people with autism ever acquire. What they repeat might be a question they were just asked, or an advertisement on television. Or out of the blue, a child may shout, Stay on your own side of the road! -something he heard his father say weeks before. Although children without autism go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3. People with autism also tend to confuse pronouns. They fail to grasp that words like my, I, and you, change meaning depending on who is speaking. When Alan's teacher asks, What is my name? he answers, My name is Alan. Some children say the same phrase in a variety of different situations. One child, for example, says Get in the car, at random times throughout the day. While on the surface, her statement seems bizarre, there may be a meaningful pattern in what the child says. The child may be saying, Get in the car, whenever she wants to go outdoors. In her own mind, she's associated Get in the car, with leaving the house. Another child, who says Milk and cookies whenever he is pleased, may be associating his good feelings around this treat with other things that give him pleasure. It can be equally difficult to understand the body language of a person with autism. Most of us smile when we talk about things we enjoy, or shrug when we can't answer a question. But for children with autism, facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Their tone of voice also fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with autism are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, children with autism may simply scream or grab what they want. Temple Grandin, an exceptional woman with autism who has written two books about her disorder, admits, Not being able to speak was utter frustration. Screaming was the only way I could communicate. Often she would logically think to herself, I am going to scream now because I want to tell somebody I don't want to do something. Until they are taught better means of expressing their needs, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to others. The Story of Temple Grandin Temple Grandin, despite a lifelong struggle with autism, earned a doctoral degree in animal science. Today, she invents equipment for managing livestock and teaches at a major university. A woman of extraordinary accomplishments, she has also written several books on animal science, autism, and her own life. Yet at 6 months old, Temple had many of the full-blown signs of autism. When held, she would stiffen and struggle to be put down. By age 2, it was clear that she was hypersensitive to taste, sound, smell, and touch. Sounds were excruciating. Wearing clothes was torture: the feel of certain fabrics was like sandpaper grating her skin. Constantly buffeted by overpowering sensations, she screamed, raged, and threw things. At other times, she found that by focusing intently and exclusively on one item-her own hand, an apple, a spinning coin, or sand sifting through her fingers-she could withdraw into a temporary haven of order and predictability. As was customary at the time, a doctor advised that Temple be institutionalized. Her mother refused and placed her in a therapeutic program for children who were speech impaired. The classes were small and highly structured. Even though the program was not designed to treat autism, the methods worked for Temple. By age 4, she began to speak and by age 5 she was able to attend kindergarten in a regular school. Temple attributes her success to several key people in her life: her mother, who persisted in finding help; her therapist, who kept her from withdrawing into an inner world; and a high school teacher who helped transform her interest in animals into a career in animal science. Temple's insights into the needs of animals, a strongly developed ability to think visually in pictures, and an awareness of her own special needs led her to invent equipment that has helped both livestock and, remarkably, herself. After seeing a device used to calm cattle, she created a squeeze machine. The machine provides self- controlled pressure that helps her relax. She finds that after using the squeeze machine, she feels less aggressive and less hypersensitive. With her love of animals and her personal sensitivity as a guide, Temple has also designed humane equipment and facilities for managing cattle that are used all over the world. Her unusually strong visual sense allows her to plan and design these complex projects in her head. She can precisely envision new, complex facilities and how various pieces of equipment fit together before she draws a blueprint. Temple Grandin's story is a powerful affirmation that autism need not keep people from realizing their potential. Repetitive behaviors and obsessions Although children with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. A child might spend hours repeatedly flicking or flapping her fingers or rocking back and forth. Many flail their arms or walk on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position. Experts call such behaviors stereotypies or self-stimulation. Some people with autism also tend to repeat certain actions over and over. A child might spend hours lining up pretzel sticks. Or, like Alan, run from room to room turning lights on and off. Some children with autism develop troublesome fixations with specific objects, which can lead to unhealthy or dangerous behaviors. For example, one child insists on carrying feces from the bathroom into her classroom. Other behaviors are simply startling, humorous, or embarrassing to those around them. One girl, obsessed with digital watches, grabs the arms of strangers to look at their wrists. For unexplained reasons, people with autism demand consistency in their environment. Many insist on eating the same foods, at the same time, sitting at precisely the same place at the table every day. They may get furious if a picture is tilted on the wall, or wildly upset if their toothbrush has been moved even slightly. A minor change in their routine, like taking a different route to school, may be tremendously upsetting. Scientists are exploring several possible explanations for such repetitive, obsessive behavior. Perhaps the order and sameness lends some stability in a world of sensory confusion. Perhaps focused behaviors help them to block out painful stimuli. Yet another theory is that these behaviors are linked to the senses that work well or poorly. A child who sniffs everything in sight may be using a stable sense of smell to explore his environment. Or perhaps the reverse is true: he may be trying to stimulate a sense that is dim. Imaginative play, too, is limited by these repetitive behaviors and obsessions. Most children, as early as age 2, use their imagination to pretend. They create new uses for an object, perhaps using a bowl for a hat. Or they pretend to be someone else, like a mother cooking dinner for her family of dolls. In contrast, children with autism rarely pretend. Rather than rocking a doll or rolling a toy car, they may simply hold it, smell it, or spin it for hours on end. Sensory symptoms When children's perceptions are accurate, they can learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory information is faulty or if the input from the various senses fails to merge into a coherent picture, the child's experiences of the world can be confusing. People with autism seem to have one or both of these problems. There may be problems in the sensory signals that reach the brain or in the integration of the sensory signals-and quite possibly, both. Apparently, as a result of a brain malfunction, many children with autism are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin so disturbing that they can't focus on anything else. For others, a gentle hug may be overwhelming. Some children cover their ears and scream at the sound of a vacuum cleaner, a distant airplane, a telephone ring, or even the wind. Temple Grandin says, It was like having a hearing aid that picks up everything, with the volume control stuck on super loud. Because any noise was so painful, she often chose to withdraw and tuned out sounds to the point of seeming deaf. In autism, the brain also seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some children with autism seem oblivious to extreme cold or pain, but react hysterically to things that wouldn't bother other children. A child with autism may break her arm in a fall and never cry. Another child might bash his head on the wall without a wince. On the other hand, a light touch may make the child scream with alarm. In some people, the senses are even scrambled. One child gags when she feels a certain texture. A man with autism hears a sound when someone touches a point on his chin. Another experiences certain sounds as colors. Unusual abilities Some people with autism display remarkable abilities. A few demonstrate skills far out of the ordinary. At a young age, when other children are drawing straight lines and scribbling, some children with autism are able to draw detailed, realistic pictures in three-dimensional perspective. Some toddlers who are autistic are so visually skilled that they can put complex jigsaw puzzles together. Many begin to read exceptionally early-sometimes even before they begin to speak. Some who have a keenly developed sense of hearing can play musical instruments they have never been taught, play a song accurately after hearing it once, or name any note they hear. Like the person played by Dustin Hoffman in the movie Rain Man, some people with autism can memorize entire television shows, pages of the phone book, or the scores of every major league baseball game for the past 20 years. However, such skills, known as islets of intelligence or savant skills are rare. How is Autism Diagnosed? Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child. In many cases, their baby seemed different from birth-being unresponsive to people and toys, or focusing intently on one item for long periods of time. The first signs of autism may also appear in children who had been developing normally. When an affectionate, babbling toddler suddenly becomes silent, withdrawn, violent, or self-abusive, something is wrong. Even so, years may go by before the family seeks a diagnosis. Well-meaning friends and relatives sometimes help parents ignore the problems with reassurances that Every child is different, or Janie can talk-she just doesn't want to! Unfortunately, this only delays getting appropriate assessment and treatment for the child. Insert Table Here Diagnostic procedures To date, there are no medical tests like x-rays or blood tests that detect autism. And no two children with the disorder behave the same way. In addition, several conditions can cause symptoms that resemble those of autism. So parents and the child's pediatrician need to rule out other disorders, including hearing loss, speech problems, mental retardation, and neurological problems. But once these possibilities have been eliminated, a visit to a professional who specializes in autism is necessary. Such specialists include people with the professional titles of child psychiatrist, child psychologist, developmental pediatrician, or pediatric neurologist. Autism specialists use a variety of methods to identify the disorder. Using a standardized rating scale, the specialist closely observes and evaluates the child's language and social behavior. A structured interview is also used to elicit information from parents about the child's behavior and early development. Reviewing family videotapes, photos, and baby albums may help parents recall when each behavior first occurred and when the child reached certain developmental milestones. The specialists may also test for certain genetic and neurological problems. Specialists may also consider other conditions that produce many of the same behaviors and symptoms as autism, such as Rett's Disorder or Asperger's Disorder. Rett's Disorder is a progressive brain disease that only affects girls but, like autism, produces repetitive hand movements and leads to loss of language and social skills. Children with Asperger's Disorder are very like high-functioning children with autism. Although they have repetitive behaviors, severe social problems, and clumsy movements, their language and intelligence are usually intact. Unlike autism, the symptoms of Asperger's Disorder typically appear later in childhood. Diagnostic criteria After assessing observations and test results, the specialist makes a diagnosis of autism only if there is clear evidence of: poor or limited social relationships underdeveloped communication skills repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities. People with autism generally have some impairment within each category, although the severity of each symptom may vary. The diagnostic criteria also require that these symptoms appear by age 3. However, some specialists are reluctant to give a diagnosis of autism. They fear that it will cause parents to lose hope. As a result, they may apply a more general term that simply describes the child's behaviors or sensory deficits. Severe communication disorder with autism-like behaviors, multi-sensory system disorder, and sensory integration dysfunction are some of the terms that are used. Children with milder or fewer symptoms are often diagnosed as having Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD). Although terms like Asperger's Disorder and PDD do not significantly change treatment options, they may keep the child from receiving the full range of specialized educational services available to children diagnosed with autism. They may also give parents false hope that their child's problems are only temporary. What Causes Autism? It is generally accepted that autism is caused by abnormalities in brain structures or functions. Using a variety of new research tools to study human and animal brain growth, scientists are discovering more about normal development and how abnormalities occur. The brain of a fetus develops throughout pregnancy. Starting out with a few cells, the cells grow and divide until the brain contains billions of specialized cells, called neurons. Research sponsored by NIMH and other components at the National Institutes of Health is playing a key role in showing how cells find their way to a specific area of the brain and take on special functions. Once in place, each neuron sends out long fibers that connect with other neurons. In this way, lines of communication are established between various areas of the brain and between the brain and the rest of the body. As each neuron receives a signal it releases chemicals called neurotransmitters, which pass the signal to the next neuron. By birth, the brain has evolved into a complex organ with several distinct regions and subregions, each with a precise set of functions and responsibilities. Different parts of the brain have different functions: The hippocampus makes it possible to recall recent experience and new information The amygdala directs our emotional responses The frontal lobes of the cerebrum allow us to solve problems, plan ahead, understand the behavior of others, and restrain our impulses The parietal areas control hearing, speech, and language The cerebellum regulates balance, body movements, coordination, and the muscles used in speaking The corpus callossum passes information from one side of the brain to the other But brain development does not stop at birth. The brain continues to change during the first few years of life, as new neurotransmitters become activated and additional lines of communication are established. Neural networks are forming and creating a foundation for processing language, emotions, and thought. However, scientists now know that a number of problems may interfere with normal brain development. Cells may migrate to the wrong place in the brain. Or, due to problems with the neural pathways or the neurotransmitters, some parts of the communication network may fail to perform. A problem with the communication network may interfere with the overall task of coordinating sensory information, thoughts, feelings, and actions. Researchers supported by NIMH and other NIH Institutes are scrutinizing the structures and functions of the brain for clues as to how a brain with autism differs from the normal brain. In one line of study, researchers are investigating potential defects that occur during initial brain development. Other researchers are looking for defects in the brains of people already known to have autism. Scientists are also looking for abnormalities in the brain structures that make up the limbic system. Inside the limbic system, an area called the amygdala is known to help regulate aspects of social and emotional behavior. One study of high-functioning children with autism found that the amygdala was indeed impaired but that another area of the brain, the hippocampus, was not. In another study, scientists followed the development of monkeys whose amygdala was disrupted at birth. Like children with autism, as the monkeys grew, they became increasingly withdrawn and avoided social contact. Differences in neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system, are also being explored. For example, high levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin have been found in a number of people with autism. Since neurotransmitters are responsible for passing nerve impulses in the brain and nervous system, it is possible that they are involved in the distortion of sensations that accompanies autism. NIMH grantees are also exploring differences in overall brain function, using a technology called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify which parts of the brain are energized during specific mental tasks. In a study of adolescent boys, NIMH researchers observed that during problem-solving and language tasks, teenagers with autism were not only less successful than peers without autism, but the MRI images of their brains showed less activity. In a study of younger children, researcers observed low levels of activity in the parietal areas and the corpus callosum. Such research may help scientists determine whether autism reflects a problem with specific areas of the brain or with the transmission of signals from one part of the brain to another. Each of these differences has been seen in some but not all the people with autism who were tested. What could this mean? Perhaps the term autism actually covers several different disorders, each caused by a different problem in the brain. Or perhaps the various brain differences are themselves caused by a single underlying disorder that scientists have not yet identified. Discovering the physical basis of autism should someday allow us to better identify, treat, and possibly prevent it. Factors affecting brain development But what causes normal brain development to go awry? Some NIMH researchers are investigating genetic causes-the role that heredity and genes play in passing the disorder from one generation to the next. Others are looking at medical problems related to pregnancy and other factors. Heredity. Several studies of twins suggest that autism- or at least a higher likelihood of some brain dysfunction-can be inherited. For example, identical twins are far more likely than fraternal twins to both have autism. Unlike fraternal twins, which develop from two separate eggs, identical twins develop from a single egg and have the same genetic makeup. It appears that parents who have one child with autism are at slightly increased risk for having more than one child with autism. This also suggests a genetic link. However, autism does not appear to be due to one particular gene. If autism, like eye color, were passed along by a single gene, more family members would inherit the disorder. NIMH grantees, using state-of-the-art gene splicing techniques, are searching for irregular segments of genetic code that the autistic members of a family may have inherited. Some scientists believe that what is inherited is an irregular segment of genetic code or a small cluster of three to six unstable genes. In most people, the faulty code may cause only minor problems. But under certain conditions, the unstable genes may interact and seriously interfere with the brain development of the unborn child. A body of NIMH-sponsored research is testing this theory. One study is exploring whether parents and siblings who do not have autism show minor symptoms, such as mild social, language, or reading problems. If so, such findings would suggest that several members of a family can inherit the irregular or unstable genes, but that other as yet unidentified conditions must be present for the full-blown disorder to develop. Pregnancy and other problems. Throughout pregnancy, the fetal brain is growing larger and more complex, as new cells, specialized regions, and communication networks form. During this time, anything that disrupts normal brain development may have lifelong effects on the child's sensory, language, social, and mental functioning. For this reason, researchers are exploring whether certain conditions, like the mother's health during pregnancy, problems during delivery, or other environmental factors may interfere with normal brain development. Viral infections like rubella (also called German measles), particularly in the first three months of pregnancy, may lead to a variety of problems, possibly including autism and retardation. Lack of oxygen to the baby and other complications of delivery may also increase the risk of autism. However, there is no clear link. Such problems occur in the delivery of many infants who are not autistic, and most children with autism are born without such factors. Are There Accompanying Disorders? Several disorders commonly accompany autism. To some extent, these may be caused by a common underlying problem in brain functioning. Mental retardation Of the problems that can occur with autism, mental retardation is the most widespread. Seventy-five to 80 percent of people with autism are mentally retarded to some extent. Fifteen to 20 percent are considered severely retarded, with IQs below 35. (A score of 100 represents average intelligence.) But autism does not necessarily correspond with mental impairment. More than 10 percent of people with autism have an average or above average IQ. A few show exceptional intelligence. Interpreting IQ scores is difficult, however, because most intelligence tests are not designed for people with autism. People with autism do not perceive or relate to their environment in typical ways. When tested, some areas of ability are normal or even above average, and some areas may be especially weak. For example, a child with autism may do extremely well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low scores on the language subtests. Seizures About one-third of the children with autism develop seizures, starting either in early childhood or adolescence. Researchers are trying to learn if there is any significance to the time of onset, since the seizures often first appear when certain neurotransmitters become active. Since seizures range from brief blackouts to full-blown body convulsions, an electroencephalogram (EEG) can help confirm their presence. Fortunately, in most cases, seizures can be controlled with medication. Fragile X One disorder, Fragile X syndrome, has been found in about 10 percent of people with autism, mostly males. This inherited disorder is named for a defective piece of the X-chromosome that appears pinched and fragile when seen under a microscope. People who inherit this faulty bit of genetic code are more likely to have mental retardation and many of the same symptoms as autism along with unusual physical features that are not typical of autism. Tuberous Sclerosis There is also some relationship between autism and Tuberous Sclerosis, a genetic condition that causes abnormal tissue growth in the brain and problems in other organs. Although Tuberous Sclerosis is a rare disorder, occurring less than once in 10,000 births, about a fourth of those affected are also autistic. Scientists are exploring genetic conditions such as Fragile X and Tuberous Sclerosis to see why they so often coincide with autism. Understanding exactly how these conditions disrupt normal brain development may provide insights to the biological and genetic mechanisms of autism. Finding Help and Hope Paul Adolescence was a good time for Paul. He seemed to relax and become more social. He became more affectionate. When approached, he would converse with people. For several months, drugs were used to help him control his aggression, but they were stopped because they caused unwanted side effects. Even so, he now rarely throws or breaks things. Two years ago, Paul's parents were able to take advantage of new scientific understanding about autism, and they enrolled him in an innovative program that provides full-time support, enabling him to live and work within the community. Today, at age 20, he has a closely supervised job assembling booklets for a publishing company. He lives in an attractive apartment with another man who has autism and a residence supervisor. Paul loves picnics and outings to the library to check out books and cassettes. He also enjoys going home each week to visit his family. But he still demands familiarity and order. As soon as he arrives home, he moves every piece of furniture back to the location that is familiar to him. Alan The summer Alan was 6, after years with no apparent progress, his language began to flow. Although he reversed the meaning of pronouns, he began talking in sentences that other people could understand. Now age 13, Alan has lost his constant obsession with lights, returning to it only when he feels stressed. He often burrows under a heavy pile of pillows, which seems to relax and comfort him. His fits of anger occur less often, but because he is bigger, he reacts with more force. Every now and then, he goes out of control, kicking, hitting, and biting. Once, at a shopping mall, he threw a tantrum so severe that his mother had to hold him down to control him. At the same time, he has successfully made the transition to middle school and he is learning more quickly than before. He seems more aware of his surroundings and remembers people. He still doesn't play with other children, but often sits watching them from a window. It's as if he has become aware that he is different. He also seems more aware of his own emotions and at times he says quietly, You sad. Janie Today, at age 4, Janie is enrolled in an intensive program in which she is trained at home by her mother and several specialists. She is beginning to show real progress. She now makes eye contact and has begun to talk. She can ask for things. As a result, she seems happier, less frustrated, and better able to form connections with others. She's also begun to show some remarkable skills. She can stack blocks and match objects far beyond her years. And her memory is amazing. Although her speech is often unclear, she can recite and act out entire television programs. Her parents' dream is that she will progress enough to enter a regular kindergarten next year. Is There Reason for Hope? When parents learn that their child is autistic, most wish they could magically make the problem go away. They looked forward to having a baby and watching their child learn and grow. Instead, they must face the fact that they have a child who may not live up to their dreams and will daily challenge their patience. Some families deny the problem or fantasize about an instant cure. They may take the child from one specialist to another, hoping for a different diagnosis. It is important for the family to eventually overcome their pain and deal with the problem, while still cherishing hopes for their child's future. Most families realize that their lives can move on. Today, more than ever before, people with autism can be helped. A combination of early intervention, special education, family support, and in some cases, medication, is helping increasing numbers of children with autism to live more normal lives. Special interventions and education programs can expand their capacity to learn, communicate, and relate to others, while reducing the severity and frequency of disruptive behaviors. Medications can be used to help alleviate certain symptoms. Older children and adults like Paul may also benefit from the treatments that are available today. So, while no cure is in sight, it is possible to greatly improve the day-to-day life of children and adults with autism. Today, a child who receives effective therapy and education has every hope of using his or her unique capacity to learn. Even some who are seriously mentally retarded can often master many self-help skills like cooking, dressing, doing laundry, and handling money. For such children, greater independence and self-care may be the primary training goals. Other youngsters may go on to learn basic academic skills, like reading, writing, and simple math. Many complete high school. Some, like Temple Grandin, may even earn college degrees. Like anyone else, their personal interests provide strong incentives to learn. Clearly, an important factor in developing a child's long-term potential for independence and success is early intervention. The sooner a child begins to receive help, the more opportunity for learning. Furthermore, because a young child's brain is still forming, scientists believe that early intervention gives children the best chance of developing their full potential. Even so, no matter when the child is diagnosed, it's never too late to begin treatment. Can Social Skills and Behavior Be Improved? A number of treatment approaches have evolved in the decades since autism was first identified. Some therapeutic programs focus on developing skills and replacing dysfunctional behaviors with more appropriate ones. Others focus on creating a stimulating learning environment tailored to the unique needs of children with autism. Researchers have begun to identify factors that make certain treatment programs more effective in reducing- or reversing-the limitations imposed by autism. Treatment programs that build on the child's interests, offer a predictable schedule, teach tasks as a series of simple steps, actively engage the child's attention in highly structured activities, and provide regular reinforcement of behavior, seem to produce the greatest gains. Parent involvement has also emerged as a major factor in treatment success. Parents work with teachers and therapists to identify the behaviors to be changed and the skills to be taught. Recognizing that parents are the child's earliest teachers, more programs are beginning to train parents to continue the therapy at home. Research is beginning to suggest that mothers and fathers who are trained to work with their child can be as effective as professional teachers and therapists. Developmental approaches Professionals have found that many children with autism learn best in an environment that builds on their skills and interests while accommodating their special needs. Programs employing a developmental approach provide consistency and structure along with appropriate levels of stimulation. For example, a predictable schedule of activities each day helps children with autism plan and organize their experiences. Using a certain area of the classroom for each activity helps students know what they are expected to do. For those with sensory problems, activities that sensitize or desensitize the child to certain kinds of stimulation may be especially helpful. In one developmental preschool classroom, a typical session starts with a physical activity to help develop balance, coordination, and body awareness. Children string beads, piece puzzles together, paint and participate in other structured activities. At snack time, the teacher encourages social interaction and models how to use language to ask for more juice. Later, the teacher stimulates creative play by prompting the children to pretend being a train. As in any classroom, the children learn by doing. Although higher-functioning children may be able to handle academic work, they too need help to organize the task and avoid distractions. A student with autism might be assigned the same addition problems as her classmates. But instead of assigning several pages in the textbook, the teacher might give her one page at a time or make a list of specific tasks to be checked off as each is done. Behaviorist approaches When people are rewarded for a certain behavior, they are more likely to repeat or continue that behavior. Behaviorist training approaches are based on this principle. When children with autism are rewarded each time they attempt or perform a new skill, they are likely to perform it more often. With enough practice, they eventually acquire the skill. For example, a child who is rewarded whenever she looks at the therapist may gradually learn to make eye contact on her own. Dr. O. Ivar Lovaas pioneered the use of behaviorist methods for children with autism more than 25 years ago. His methods involve time-intensive, highly structured, repetitive sequences in which a child is given a command and rewarded each time he responds correctly. For example, in teaching a young boy to sit still, a therapist might place him in front of chair and tell him to sit. If the child doesn't respond, the therapist nudges him into the chair. Once seated, the child is immediately rewarded in some way. A reward might be a bit of chocolate, a sip of juice, a hug, or applause-whatever the child enjoys. The process is repeated many times over a period of up to two hours. Eventually, the child begins to respond without being nudged and sits for longer periods of time. Learning to sit still and follow directions then provides a foundation for learning more complex behaviors. Using this approach for up to 40 hours a week, some children may be brought to the point of near-normal behavior. Others are much less responsive to the treatment. However, some researchers and therapists believe that less intensive treatments, particularly those begun early in a child's life, may be more efficient and just as effective. So, over the years, researchers sponsored by NIMH and other agencies have continued to study and modify the behaviorist approach. Today, some of these behaviorist treatment programs are more individualized and built around the child's own interests and capabilities. Many programs also involve parents or other non-autistic children in teaching the child. Instruction is no longer limited to a controlled environment, but takes place in natural, everyday settings. Thus, a trip to the supermarket may be an opportunity to practice using words for size and shape. Although rewarding desired behavior is still a key element, the rewards are varied and appropriate to the situation. A child who makes eye contact may be rewarded with a smile, rather than candy. NIMH is funding several types of behaviorist treatment approaches to help determine the best time for treatment to start, the optimum treatment intensity and duration, and the most effective methods to reach both high- and low-functioning children. Nonstandard approaches In trying to do everything possible to help their children, many parents are quick to try new treatments. Some treatments are developed by reputable therapists or by parents of a child with autism, yet when tested scientifically, cannot be proven to help. Before spending time and money and possibly slowing their child's progress, the family should talk with experts and evaluate the findings of objective reviewers. Following are some of the approaches that have not been shown to be effective in treating the majority of children with autism: Facilitated Communication, which assumes that by supporting a nonverbal child's arms and fingers so that he can type on a keyboard, the child will be able to type out his inner thoughts. Several scientific studies have shown that the typed messages actually reflect the thoughts of the person providing the support. Holding Therapy, in which the parent hugs the child for long periods of time, even if the child resists. Those who use this technique contend that it forges a bond between the parent and child. Some claim that it helps stimulate parts of the brain as the child senses the boundaries of her own body. There is no scientific evidence, however, to support these claims. Auditory Integration Training, in which the child listens to a variety of sounds with the goal of improving language comprehension. Advocates of this method suggest that it helps people with autism receive more balanced sensory input from their environment. When tested using scientific procedures, the method was shown to be no more effective than listening to music. Dolman/Delcato Method, in which people are made to crawl and move as they did at each stage of early development, in an attempt to learn missing skills. Again, no scientific studies support the effectiveness of the method. It is critical that parents obtain reliable, objective information before enrolling their child in any treatment program. Programs that are not based on sound principles and tested through solid research can do more harm than good. They may frustrate the child and cause the family to lose money, time, and hope. Selecting a treatment program Parents are often disappointed to learn that there is no single best treatment for all children with autism; possibly not even for a specific child. Even after a child has been thoroughly tested and formally diagnosed, there is no clear right course of action. The diagnostic team may suggest treatment methods and service providers, but ultimately it is up to the parents to consider their child's unique needs, research the various options, and decide. Above all, parents should consider their own sense of what will work for their child. Keeping in mind that autism takes many forms, parents need to consider whether a specific program has helped children like their own. At the back of this pamphlet is a list of books and associations that provide more detailed information about each form of therapy and other resources. Exploring Treatment Options Parents may find these questions helpful as they consider various treatment programs: How successful has the program been for other children? How many children have gone on to placement in a regular school and how have they performed? Do staff members have training and experience in working with children and adolescents with autism? How are activities planned and organized? Are there predictable daily schedules and routines? How much individual attention will my child receive? How is progress measured? Will my child's behavior be closely observed and recorded? Will my child be given tasks and rewards that are personally motivating? Is the environment designed to minimize distractions? Will the program prepare me to continue the therapy at home? What is the cost, time commitment, and location of the program? What Medications are Available? No medication can correct the brain structures or impaired nerve connections that seem to underlie autism. Scientists have found, however, that drugs developed to treat other disorders with similar symptoms are sometimes effective in treating the symptoms and behaviors that make it hard for people with autism to function at home, school, or work. It is important to note that none of the medications described in this section has been approved for autism by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is the Federal agency that authorizes the use of drugs for specific disorders. Medications used to treat anxiety and depression are being explored as a way to relieve certain symptoms of autism. These drugs scientists believe that autism and these disorders may share a problem in the functioning of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which these medications apparently help. One study found that about 60 percent of patients with autism who used fluoxetine became less distraught and aggressive. They became calmer and better able to handle changes in their routine or environment. However, fenfluramine, another medication that affects serotonin levels, has not proven to be helpful. People with an anxiety disorder called obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), like people with autism, are plagued by repetitive actions they can't control. Based on the premise that the two disorders may be related, one NIMH research study found that clomipramine, a medication used to treat OCD, does appear to be effective in reducing obsessive, repetitive behavior in some people with autism. Children with autism who were given the medication also seemed less withdrawn, angry, and anxious. But more research needs to be done to see if the findings of this study can be repeated. Some children with autism experience hyperactivity, the frenzied activity that is seen in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Since stimulant drugs like Ritalin are helpful in treating many people with ADHD, doctors have tried them to reduce the hyperactivity sometimes seen in autism. The drugs seem to be most effective when given to higher-functioning children with autism who do not have seizures or other neurological problems. Because many children with autism have sensory disturbances and often seem impervious to pain, scientists are also looking for medications that increase or decrease the transmission of physical sensations. Endorphins are natural painkillers produced by the body. But in certain people with autism, the endorphins seem to go too far in suppressing feeling. Scientists are exploring substances that block the effects of endorphins, to see if they can bring the sense of touch to a more normal range. Such drugs may be helpful to children who experience too little sensation. And once they can sense pain, such children could be less likely to bite themselves, bang their heads, or hurt themselves in other ways. Chlorpromazine, theoridazine, and haloperidol have also been used. Although these powerful drugs are typically used to treat adults with severe psychiatric disorders, they are sometimes given to people with autism to temporarily reduce agitation, aggression, and repetitive behaviors. However, since major tranquilizers are powerful medications that can produce serious and sometimes permanent side effects, they should be prescribed and used with extreme caution. Vitamin B6, taken with magnesium, is also being explored as a way to stimulate brain activity. Because vitamin B6 plays an important role in creating enzymes needed by the brain, some experts predict that large doses might foster greater brain activity in people with autism. However, clinical studies of the vitamin have been inconclusive and further study is needed. Like drugs, vitamins change the balance of chemicals in the body and may cause unwanted side effects. For this reason, large doses of vitamins should only be given under the supervision of a doctor. This is true of all vitamins and medications. What are the Educational Options? The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990 assures a free and appropriate public education to children with diagnosed learning deficits. The 1991 version of the law extended services to preschoolers who are developmentally delayed. As a result, public schools must provide services to handicapped children including those age 3 to 5. Because of the importance of early intervention, many states also offer special services to children from birth to age 3. The school may also be responsible for providing whatever services are needed to enable the child to attend school and learn. Such services might include transportation, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and any special equipment. Federally funded Parent Training Information Centers and Protection and Advocacy Agencies in each state can provide information on the rights of the family and child. By law, public schools are also required to prepare and carry out a set of specific instructional goals for every child in a special education program. The goals are stated as specific skills that the child will be taught to perform. The list of skills make up what is known as an IEP -the child's Individualized Educational Program. The IEP serves as an agreement between the school and the family on the educational goals. Because parents know their child best, they play an important role in creating this plan. They work closely with the school staff to identify which skills the child needs most. In planning the IEP, it's important to focus on what skills are critical to the child's well-being and future development. For each skill, parents and teachers should consider these questions: Is this an important life skill? What will happen if the child isn't trained to do this for herself? Such questions free parents and teachers to consider alternatives to training. After several years of valiant effort to teach Alan to tie his shoelaces, his parents and teachers decided that Alan could simply wear sneakers with Velcro fasteners, and dropped the skill from Alan's IEP. After Alan struggled in vain to memorize the multiplication table, they decided to teach him to use a calculator. A child's success in school should not be measured against standards like mastering algebra or completing high school. Rather, progress should be measured against his or her unique potential for self-care and self-sufficiency as an adult. Adolescence For all children, adolescence is a time of stress and confusion. No less so for teenagers with autism. Like all children, they need help in dealing with their budding sexuality. While some behaviors improve in the teenage years, some get worse. Increased autistic or aggressive behavior may be one way some teens express their newfound tension and confusion. The teenage years are also a time when children become more socially sensitive and aware. At the age that most teenagers are concerned with acne, popularity, grades, and dates, teens with autism may become painfully aware that they are different from their peers. They may notice that they lack friends. And unlike their schoolmates, they aren't dating or planning for a career. For some, the sadness that comes with such realization urges them to learn new behaviors. Sean Barron, who wrote about his autism in the book, There's a Boy in Here, describes how the pain of feeling different motivated him to acquire more normal social skills. Can Autism be Outgrown? At present, there is no cure for autism. Nor do children outgrow it. But the capacity to learn and develop new skills is within every child. With time, children with autism mature and new strengths emerge. Many children with autism seem to go through developmental spurts between ages 5 and 13. Some spontaneously begin to talk-even if repetitively-around age 5 or later. Some, like Paul, become more sociable, or like Alan, more ready to learn. Over time, and with help, children may learn to play with toys appropriately, function socially, and tolerate mild changes in routine. Some children in treatment programs lose enough of their most disabling symptoms to function reasonably well in a regular classroom. Some children with autism make truly dramatic strides. Of course, those with normal or near-normal intelligence and those who develop language tend to have the best outcomes. But even children who start off poorly may make impressive progress. For example, one boy, after 9 years in a program that involved parents as co-therapists, advanced from an IQ of 70 to an IQ of 100 and began to get average grades at a regular school. While it is natural for parents to hope that their child will become normal, they should take pride in whatever strides their child does make. Many parents, looking back over the years, find their child has progressed far beyond their initial expectations. Can Adults with Autism Live Independent Lives? The majority of adults with autism need lifelong training, ongoing supervision, and reinforcement of skills. The public schools' responsibility for providing these services ends when the person is past school age. As the child becomes a young adult, the family is faced with the challenge of creating a home-based plan or selecting a program or facility that can offer such services. In some cases, adults with autism can continue to live at home, provided someone is there to supervise at all times. A variety of residential facilities also provide round-the-clock care. Unlike many of the institutions years ago, today's facilities view residents as people with human needs, and offer opportunities for recreation and simple, but meaningful work. Still, some facilities are isolated from the community, separating people with autism from the rest of the world. Today, a few cities are exploring new ways to help people with autism hold meaningful jobs and live and work within the wider community. Innovative, supportive programs enable adults with autism to live and work in mainstream society, rather than in a segregated environment. By teaching and reinforcing good work skills and positive social behaviors, such programs help people live up to their potential. Work is meaningful and based on each person's strengths and abilities. For example, people with autism with good hand-eye coordination who do complex, repetitive actions are often especially good at assembly and manufacturing tasks. A worker with a low IQ and few language skills might be trained to work in a restaurant sorting silverware and folding napkins. Adults with higher-level skills have been trained to assemble electronic equipment or do office work. Based on their skills and interests, participants in such programs fill positions in printing, retail, clerical, manufacturing, and other companies. Once they are carefully trained in a task, they are put to work alongside the regular staff. Like other employees, they are paid for their labor, receive employee benefits, and are included in staff events like company picnics and retirement parties. Companies that hire people through such programs find that these workers make loyal, reliable employees. Employers find that the autistic behaviors, limited social skills, and even occasional tantrums or aggression, do not greatly affect the worker's ability to work efficiently or complete tasks. Like any other worker, program participants live in houses and apartments within the community. Under the direction of a residence coach, each resident shares as much as possible in tasks like meal-planning, shopping, cooking, and cleanup. For recreation, they go to movies, have picnics, and eat in restaurants. As they are ready, they are taught skills that make them more personally independent. Some take pride in having learned to take a bus on their own, or handling money they've earned themselves. Job and residence coaches, who serve as a link between the program participants and the community, are the key to such programs. There may be as few as two adults with autism assigned to each coach. The job coach demonstrates the steps of a job to the worker, observes behavior, and regularly acknowledges good performance. The job coach also serves as a bridge between the workers with autism and their co-workers. For example, the coach steps in if a worker loses self-control or presents any problems on the job. The coach also provides training in specific social skills, such as waving or saying hello to fellow workers. At home, the residence coach reinforces social and self-help behaviors, and finds ways to help people manage their time and responsibilities. At present, about a third of all people with autism can live and work in the community with some degree of independence. As scientific research points the way to more effective therapies and as communities establish programs that provide proper support, expectations are that this number will grow. How Do Families Learn to Cope? The task of rearing a child with autism is among the most demanding and stressful that a family faces. The child's screaming fits and tantrums can put everyone on edge. Because the child needs almost constant attention, brothers and sisters often feel ignored or jealous. Younger children may need to be reassured that they will not catch autism or grow to become like their sibling. Older children may be concerned about the prospect of having a child with autism themselves. The tensions can strain a marriage. While friends and family may try to be supportive, they can't understand the difficulties in raising a child with autism. They may criticize the parents for letting their child get away with certain behaviors and announce how they would handle the child. Some parents of children with autism feel envious of their friends' children. This may cause them to grow distant from people who once gave them support. Families may also be uncomfortable taking their child to public places. Children who throw tantrums, walk on their toes, flail their arms, or climb under restaurant tables to play with strangers' socks, can be very embarrassing. Janie's mother found that once she became willing to explain to strangers that her child has autism, people were more accepting. Paul's mother has learned to remind herself, This is a public place. We have a right to be here. Many parents feel deeply disappointed that their child may never engage in normal activities or attain some of life's milestones. Parents may mourn that their child may never learn to play baseball, drive, get a diploma, marry, or have children. However, most parents come to accept these feelings and focus on helping their children achieve what they can. Parents begin to find joy and pleasure in their child despite the limitations. Support groups Many parents find that others who face the same concerns are their strongest allies. Parents of children with autism tend to form communities of mutual caring and support. Parents gain not only encouragement and inspiration from other families' stories, but also practical advice, information on the latest research, and referrals to community services and qualified professionals. By talking with other people who have similar experiences, families dealing with autism learn they are not alone. The Autism Society of America, listed at the close of this article, has spawned parent support groups in communities across the country. In such groups, parents share emotional support, affirmation, and suggestions for solving problems. Its newsletter, the Advocate, is filled with up-to-date medical and practical information. Coping Strategies The following suggestions are based on the experiences of families in dealing with autism, and on NIMH-sponsored studies of effective strategies for dealing with stress. Work as a family. In times of stress, family members tend to take their frustrations out on each other when they most need mutual support. Despite the difficulties in finding child care, couples find that taking breaks without their children helps renew their bonds. The other children also need attention, and need to have a voice in expressing and solving problems. Keep a sense of humor. Parents find that the ability to laugh and say, You won't believe what our child has done now! helps them maintain a healthy sense of perspective. Notice progress. When it seems that all the help, love, and support is going nowhere, it's important to remember that over time, real progress is being made. Families are better able to maintain their hope if they celebrate the small signs of growth and change they see. Take action. Many parents gain strength working with others on behalf of all children with autism. Working to win additional resources, community programs, or school services helps parents see themselves as important contributors to the well-being of others as well as their own child. Plan ahead. Naturally, most parents want to know that when they die, their offspring will be safe and cared for. Having a plan in place helps relieve some of the worry. Some parents form a contract with a professional guardian, who agrees to look after the interests of the person with autism, such as observing birthdays and arranging for care. What Hope Does Research Offer? Research continues to reveal how the brain-the control center for thought, language, feelings, and behavior-carries out its functions. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funds scientists at centers across the Nation who are exploring how the brain develops, transmits its signals, integrates input from the senses, and translates all this into thoughts and behavior. In recognition of growing scientific gains in brain research, the President and Congress have officially designated the 1990s as the Decade of the Brain. There are new research initiatives at NIH sponsored by NIMH, NICHD, NINDS, and NIDCD. As a result, today as never before, investigators from various scientific disciplines are joining forces to unlock the mysteries of the brain. Perspective gained from research into the genetic, biochemical, physiological, and psychological aspects of autism may provide a more complete view of the disorder. Every day, NIH-sponsored researchers are learning more about how the brain develops normally and what can go wrong in the process. Already, for example, scientists have discovered evidence suggesting that in autism, brain development slows at some point before week 30 of pregnancy. Scientists now also have tools and techniques that allow them to examine the brain in ways that were unthought of just a few years ago. New imaging techniques that show the living brain in action permit scientists to observe with surprising clarity how the brain changes as an individual performs mental tasks, moves, or speaks. Such techniques open windows to the brain, allowing scientists to learn which brain regions are engaged in particular tasks. In addition, recent scientific advances are permitting scientists to break new ground in researching the role of heredity in autism. Using sophisticated statistical methods along with gene splicing-a technique that enables scientists to manipulate the microscopic bits of genetic code-investigators sponsored by NIH and other institutions are searching for abnormal genes that may be involved in autism. The ability to identify irregular genes-or the factors that make a gene unstable-may lead to earlier diagnoses. Meanwhile, scientists are working to determine if there is a genetic link between autism and other brain disorders commonly associated with it, such as Tourette Disorder and Tuberous Sclerosis. New insights into the genetic transmission of these disorders, along with newly gained knowledge of normal and abnormal brain development should provide important clues to the causes of autism. A key to developing our understanding of the human brain is research involving animals. Like humans, other primates, such as chimpanzees, apes, and monkeys, have emotions, form attachments, and develop higher-level thought processes. For this reason, studies of their brain functions and behavior shed light on human development. Animal studies have proven invaluable in learning how disruptions to the developing brain affect behavior, sensory perceptions, and mental development and have led to a better understanding of autism. Ultimately, the results of NIMH's extensive research program may translate into better lives for people with autism. As we get closer to understanding the brain, we approach a day when we may be able to diagnose very young children and provide effective treatment earlier in the child's development. As data accumulate on the brain chemicals involved in autism, we get closer to developing medications that reduce or reverse imbalances. Someday, we may even have the ability to prevent the disorder. Perhaps researchers will learn to identify children at risk for autism at birth, allowing doctors and other health care professionals to provide preventive therapy before symptoms ever develop. Or, as scientists learn more about the genetic transmission of autism, they may be able to replace any defective genes before the infant is even born. What are Sources of Information and Support? Parents often find that books and movies about autism that have happy endings cheer them, but raise false hopes. In such stories, a parent's novel approach suddenly works or the child simply outgrows the autistic behaviors. But there really are no cures for autism and growth takes time and patience. Parents should seek practical, realistic sources of information, particularly those based on careful research. Similarly, certain sources of information are more reliable than others. Some popular magazines and newspapers are quick to report new miracle cures before they have been thoroughly researched.

Cave Federal agency West Susquehanna Avenue Suite www.crosscreekcounseling.com/autism.html diagnoses occupational therapy auditory integration training Autism147 http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2065.htm Recently, stories carried by the media have caused some parents to fear that the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) causes autism. This article provides a summary of the studies used to support the hypothesis that MMR causes autism, the studies that refute this hypothesis, and other investigations into the causes of autism. The Wakefield Studies: Studies Hypothesizing That MMR Causes Autism Two studies have been cited by those claiming that the MMR vaccine causes autism. This section summarizes those studies and lists their critical flaws. The first Wakefield paper In 1998, Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a paper in The Lancet titled Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children. (1) Wakefield's hypothesis was that the MMR vaccine causes a series of events that include intestinal inflammation, loss of intestinal barrier function, entrance into the bloodstream of encephalopathic proteins, and consequent development of autism. In support of his hypothesis, Dr. Wakefield described 12 children with neurodevelopmental delay (8 with autism). All of these children had gastrointestinal complaints and developed autism within 1 month of receiving MMR.Critical flaws About 90% of children in England received MMR at the time this paper was written. Because MMR is administered at a time when many children are diagnosed with autism, it would be expected that most children with autism would have received an MMR vaccine, and that many would have received the vaccine recently. The observation that some children with autism recently received MMR is, therefore, expected. However, determination of whether MMR causes autism is best made by studying the incidence of autism in both vaccinated and unvaccinated children. This wasn't done. Although the authors claim that autism is a consequence of gastrointestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms were observed after, not before, symptoms of autism in all eight cases. The second Wakefield paper In 2002, Wakefield and coworkers published a second paper examining the relationship between measles virus and autism.(2)The authors tested intestinal biopsy samples for the presence of measles virus genome from children with and without autism. Measles virus genome was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. Seventy-five of 90 children with autism were found to have measles virus genome in intestinal biopsy tissue as compared with only 5 of 70 control patients. On its surface, this was a concerning result. However, this paper was also critically flawed. Critical flaws Measles vaccine virus is live and attenuated. After inoculation, the vaccine virus probably replicates 15-20 times. Measles vaccine virus is likely to be taken up by specific cells responsible for virus uptake and presentation to the immune system (termed antigen-presenting cells or APCs). Macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells (DC) are different types of APCs. Because all APCs are mobile, and can travel throughout the body (including the intestine), it is plausible that a child immunized with MMR would have measles virus genome detected in intestinal tissues using a very sensitive assay (such as RT-PCR). To determine if MMR is associated with autism one must determine if the finding is specific for children with autism. Therefore, children with or without autism must be identical in two ways. First, children with or without autism must be matched for immunization status (i.e., receipt of the MMR vaccine). Second, children must be matched for the length of time between receipt of MMR vaccine and collection of the biopsy specimen. Although this information was clearly available to the investigators and critical to their hypothesis, it was specifically omitted from the paper. Because natural measles virus is still circulating in England, it would have been important to determine whether the measles virus genome detected in these samples was natural measles virus or vaccine virus. Although primers are available to distinguish these two types of virus, the authors chose not to use them. RT-PCR is a very sensitive assay. Laboratories that work with natural measles virus (such as the lab where these studies were performed) are at high risk of getting false positive results. No mention is made in the paper as to how this problem was avoided. As is true for all laboratory studies, the person who is performing the test should not know whether the sample is obtained from a case or a control (blinding). Because no statement is made in the method section, it is unclear that blinding of samples occurred. Studies Showing That MMR Vaccine Does Not Cause Autism Five major studies have been performed to refute a causal association between receipt of MMR and autism. 1. The first Taylor paper In 1999, Brent Taylor and coworkers examined the relationship between receipt of MMR and development of autism in an excellent, well-controlled study.(3) Taylor examined the records of 498 children with autism or autism-like disorder. Cases were identified by registers from the North Thames region of England before and after the MMR vaccine was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1988. Taylor then examined the incidence and age at diagnosis of autism in vaccinated and unvaccinated children. He found the following: 1) the percentage of children vaccinated was the same in children with autism as in other children in the North Thames region; 2) no difference in the age of diagnosis of autism was found in vaccinated and unvaccinated children; and 3) the onset of \"regressive\" symptoms of autism did not occur within 2, 4, or 6 months of receiving the MMR vaccine.2. The JAMA paper In 2001, Natalie Smith and coworkers examined the relationship between the increase in the number of cases of autism in California and receipt of the MMR vaccine.(4) The percentage of children immunized with MMR vaccine between 1980 and 1994 was compared with the incidence of autism during the same period. Although a dramatic increase in the incidence of children with autism was reported, the percentage of children that received MMR vaccine remained the same. 3. The British Medical Journal paper In a study that supported the findings in the JAMA paper, Hershel Jick and coworkers examined the incidence of autism in England between 1988 and 1993 and compared this with MMR immunization rates.(5) Although the incidence of autism increased, MMR immunization rates remained the same.4. The second Taylor paper A second study by Brent Taylor and coworkers examined the relationship between MMR vaccine and new variant autism (Wakefield's claim that autism is associated with inflammation of the small intestine).(6) Children with autism diagnosed between 1979 and 1998 were examined. The authors compared the number of children with autism and intestinal symptoms before 1988 and after 1988 (MMR was introduced into England in 1988). There was no difference. They concluded that there was, therefore, no evidence for new variant autism and provided further evidence that MMR vaccine was not associated with autism. 5. The Madsen paper Perhaps the best study was that performed by Madsen and colleagues in Demark between 1991 and 1998 and reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.(7) The study included 537,303 children representing 2,129,864 person-years of study. Approximately 82 percent of children had received the MMR vaccine. The group of children was selected from the Danish Civil Registration System, vaccination status was obtained from the Danish National Board of Health, and children with autism were identified from the Danish Central Register. The risk of autism in the group of vaccinated children was the same as that in unvaccinated children. Furthermore, there was no association between the age at the time of vaccination, the time since vaccination, or the date of vaccination and the development of autism.Studies On The Causes of Autism Studies have focused on the genetics of autism and the timing of the first symptoms of autism. Genetics of autism One of the best ways to determine whether a particular disease or syndrome is genetic is to examine the incidence in identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins. Using a strict definition of autism, when one twin has autism, 60% of identical and 0% of fraternal twins have autism. Using a broader definition of autism (i.e., autistic spectrum disorder), when one twin has autism, approximately 92% of identical and 10% of fraternal twins have autism. (8,9) Therefore, autism clearly has a genetic basis. Timing of development of autism Autism symptoms are present before 1 year of age Perhaps the best data examining when symptoms of autism are first evident are the home-movie studies. These studies took advantage of the fact that many parents take movies of their children during their first birthday (before they have received the MMR vaccine). Home movies from children who were eventually diagnosed with autism and those who were not diagnosed with autism were shown to blinded neurodevelopmental specialists. Investigators were, with a very high degree of accuracy, able to separate autistic from non-autistic children at 1 year of age.(10-14) These studies found that subtle symptoms of autism are present earlier than some parents had suspected, and that receipt of the MMR vaccine did not precede the first symptoms of autism. Autism symptoms are present before 4 months of age Other investigators extended the home-movie studies of 1-year-old children to include videotapes of children taken at 2-3 months of age. Using a sophisticated movement analysis, videos from children eventually diagnosed with autism or not diagnosed with autism were coded and evaluated for their capacity to predict autism. Children who were eventually diagnosed with autism were predicted from movies taken in early infancy.(15) This study supported the hypothesis that very subtle symptoms of autism are present in early infancy and argue strongly against vaccines as a cause of autism. Evidence that autism occurs in utero Toxic or viral insults in utero as well as certain central nervous system disorders are associated with an increase in the incidence of autism. For example, children exposed to thalidomide during the first or early second trimester were found to have an increased incidence of autism.(16) However, autism occurred in children with ear, but not arm or leg, abnormalities. Because arms and legs develop after 24 days gestation, the risk period for autism following receipt of thalidomide must be before 24 days gestation. In support of this finding, Rodier and colleagues(17) found evidence for structural brainstem abnormalities in children with autism. These abnormalities could only have occurred during brainstem development in utero. Similarly, children with congenital rubella syndrome are at increased risk for development of autism.(18-24) Risk is associated with exposure to rubella prenatally, but not postnatally. Finally, children with fragile X syndrome or tuberous sclerosis are also at increased risk of developing autism. Taken together, these findings indicate that autism is likely due to abnormalities of the central nervous system that occur in utero. Summing UpStudies of 1) the genetics of autism, 2) the timing of the first symptoms of autism (home-movie studies), 3) the relationship between autism and the receipt of the MMR vaccine, 4) the histopathology of the central nervous system of children with autism, and 5) thalidomide, natural rubella infection, fragile X syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis all support the fact that autism occurs during development of the central nervous system early in utero.Unfortunately, for current and future parents of children with autism, the controversy surrounding vaccines has diverted attention and resources away from a number of promising leads.

Autism J Autism Child Schizo 1980 and 1994 1988 and 1993 1979 and 1998 Child Without Limits Advisory Committee September 2009Autism is a severe developmental disability that generally begins at birth or within the first three years of life. It is the result of a neurological disorder that changes the way the brain functions -- causing delays or problems in many different skills from infancy to adulthood. For example, both children and adults with autism usually exhibit difficulties in social interaction as well as in verbal and non-verbal communication. They also tend to be interested in odd, repetitive, or restricted activities. While the majority of autistic children look completely normal, they differ from other children by engaging in perplexing and distressing behaviors. Why is Autism Called a Spectrum Disorder?Autism belongs to a collection of developmental disorders known as the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). A spectrum disorder is a group of disorders with similar features. While one person may have mild symptoms, another might have more severe ones. There also are differences in the nature of the symptoms themselves and when they are likely to first appear.The three different types of autism spectrum disorders are:Autistic disorder (also known as classic autism). This is the most common condition among the ASDs. It is marked by major delays in language, difficulties with social interactions, and unusual behaviors. Some people with autistic disorder also have impaired intellectual abilities.Asperger syndrome. People with this syndrome display some of the milder symptoms of autistic disorder -- such as social challenges and unusual behaviors. They generally do not have any delays in language or impaired intellectual abilities.Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PPD-NOS, also referred to as atypical autism ). Individuals may be diagnosed with PPD-NOS if they meet some of the criteria for either autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome but not all. They typically have milder and fewer symptoms than those with autistic disorder. Symptoms may be limited to problems with language and social interaction.Next:Who Gets Autism?

The number of children diagnosed with autism has increased consistently over the last twenty years. In fact, in the last six years, a study showed a 250% increase. In April, 2002, the U.S. Congress declared that autism was a national health emergency, and vowed to \"exponentially\" increase funding for research on preventing and treating autism. Is autism an epidemic that will explode if we don't find the source? And if so, what is that source? Viewed from an impassionate, statistical stance, it's still frightening. Autism diagnosis in the United States has increased by roughly 23% annually, for the past ten years. State-side, it is estimated that 1 in 110 children under the age of eleven has autism. This isn't restricted to the US, either. The Medical Research Council just recently reported that 1 in 166 children in the UK are autistic. These children have to be cared for by society, and the estimated cost to care for an autistic child for life is around four million dollars. Even ignoring the pain of a family coping with an autistic child, it's a terrifying result. Mercury Mercury poisoning has been shown by the CDC to affect neuro-development in children. Of course, nobody exposes their child to mercury, right? A few years ago, the FDA outlawed the use of Thimerosal in children's vaccines. You see, it was used as a preservative in multi-dose infant vaccines. Thimerosal is a derivative of mercury. In fact, nearly 50% of the weight of many of these vaccines was composed of ethyl mercury. Statistics over the last twelve years show that there is a perceived correlation between the rates in autism and the amount of mercury children are exposed to in vaccinations. Autoimmune System MMR vaccination is among the most common vaccines used in the world. It stands for Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. It is a vaccine that is given in multiple stages, over the growth of a child. Researchers at Utah State University analyzed the blood of 125 autistic children and 92 children without autism. They exposed the blood samples to the vaccine, and studied the results. 75 of the children with autism had \"unusual\" anti-measles reactions. None of the normal children had these reactions. Antibodies found to attack the brain of some autistic children, by damaging the glial cells which make up the myelin sheath of the neurons in the brain, were found in 90% of the 75 unusual reactions. \"Stemming from this evidence, we suggest that an inappropriate antibody response to MMR, specifically the measles component thereof, might be related to pathogenesis of autism.\" - Journal of Biomedical Science Regressive Autism Autism can start to develop in a seemingly normal child. This is often referred to as regressive autism. One of the more commonly talked about pieces of \"evidence\" linking autism and vaccination is that autism regression seems to spike at the times of the MMR vaccinations, including the one for five year old children. I have been unable to find any real data to validate or disprove this assertion. Exaggerated Epidemic? The statistics behind the increase in autism are interesting, if examined closely. The rates of increase vary by extreme amounts, from state to state, as well as over time. It is certain that some of the increase in diagnosis comes from better education and testing. How much of the increase it accounts for is hotly debated. There are also dramatically different autism rates reported in the different states. Very dramatically different. All of this lends a lack of credibility to the statistics about autism. CDC's Report on Autism In 1999, the CDC issued a report on autism, discussing the known causes, how it affects children, and very specifically, a discussion on the possibilities of the connection of autism with MMR and other vaccines. The CDC claims that the only real proof given by proponents of this connection can be traced to one study published in Lancet in 1998, and that the study is suspect. In fact, apparently there was an article within the very same issue questioning the validity of the results. They also cited studies showing that early vaccination does not cause earlier expression of autism. They also claim that statistical coincidences are easily explainable in that parents tend to round measuring the lifespan of their infants in terms of months, and 18 months is a very easy number to approximate to, which could account for the statistical abnormality around that region. Both the British government and the CDC recommend MMR vaccination with very little apparent reserve. And it is worth noting the millions of lives that have been saved by the vaccinations. In fact, Oolong points out that there has been a definite correlation between measles and autism for a couple of decades now, so it has probably prevented more cases of autism than it has caused, even if the vaccine does trigger it. The debate is really more strongly centered around the question, \"if MMR does sometimes cause autism, why haven't we improved or replaced the vaccine yet?\" As more parents refuse their children vaccination, the risk of an outbreak of one of these diseases grows. More Statistics, and Mudslinging... There are several reports conducted by other researchers which also search for connections between MMR vaccination and autism. Thus far, the bulk of them, particularly the ones cited most frequently by the government organizations, do not suggest a correlation between MMR immunization and an increase in autism. However, the camp promoting the MMR link claims that researchers with data that showed a correlation refused to hand over their data. Is this all misinformation, poorly collected information, or outright lies? And on which side? A parent unsure about whether to vaccinate can find enough \"data\" to support their decision right now, which ever way they decide they want to go. All is not hopeless, though. The removal of Thimerosal from children's vaccines is certainly encouraging. Hopefully the increase in government spending on autism will help to prove or disprove these correlations. Until then, it becomes a matter of faith.

Although British health officials deny a relationship of these conditions with the vaccines, Dawbarns has accounts of over 200 parents who believe that their children were normal before they were vaccinated, and who can point to nothing (other than the vaccine) which could account for the deterioration in their children's conditions.\" Dr. Michael E Dym \"Directly from human medical research, we have definitive proof of a linkage between polyvalent viral vaccines and inflammatory bowel disease, in particular the combination MMR vaccine and Crohn's disease and/or ulcerative colitis (the same thing?) in susceptible children. In his masterful research Andrew Wakefield, MD, a prominent British gastroenterologist, documented measles virus infection in the intestinal walls of nearly %100 of the autistic children he scoped and biopsied, who developed their disease within a short time after MMR vaccination. All of the normally developing children did not have any evidence of measles virus infection or histopathologic evidence of Crohn's or ulcerative colitis. I believe that he did actually document that the measles virus found in the intestinal walls of these autistic children who developed the disease was vaccine measles virus strain, which he showed via DNA analysis. According to his work, Dr. Wakefield theorizes that the measles virus infection and subsequent pathology in the gut walls leads to a leaky-gut like syndrome causing absorption of encephelopathic toxins which directly affects the developing brains of susceptible children leading to autistic like symptoms.\" Bernard Rimland, Ph.D. - \"The US Autism Epidemic is Out of Control - Over 100,000 children will be newly diagnosed with autism this year in the US.

Readers of the Autism Research Review International (ARRI) are well aware of the autism-vaccine controversy, but until now the mass media have been kept largely in the dark.

Oct 1, 2003 Congressman Dan Burton - \"Madam speaker, as we approach the flu season, many of my colleagues will visit the doctor's office here on Capitol Hill and receive a flu shot. Before they go, I think all of my colleagues ought to know tat the flu shot contains mercury, which is a substance that's toxic to the human brain. Now, that's not to say that you shouldn't get your flu shot if you want to, but there are a lot of neurological disorders that have been caused by mercury and I think everybody ought to know that there is mercury in that vaccine. Now, that's not the only vaccine that contains thimerosal. From anthrax to hepatitis to dtap, which is given to infants to protect them, numerous vaccines exist that contain mercury, a harmful preservative. Parents around this country I am sure would be very upset if they knew that. Scientific evidence continues to accumulate regarding the biologically plausible connection between mercury and thimerosal, autism and other neurological, developmental disorders. We have one in 10,000 children 10 years ago that were autistic. Now it's one in 150 and scientists before my committee say it's because in large part of the mercury in the vaccines\". Congressman Dan Burton Toxic Mercury and Autism Texas researchers have found a possible link between autism and mercury in the air and water. Studying individual school districts in Texas, the epidemiologists found that those districts with the highest levels of mercury in the environment also had the highest rates of special education students and autism diagnoses. \"Mercury is a known neurotoxin,\" said Dr. Isaac Pessah of UC Davis' MIND Institute, who was not involved in the study. \"It's rather intriguing that the correlation is so positive,\" meaning that there was a strong, direct relationship between mercury and autism levels. Glutathione Level and Autism Symptoms A study investigated the relationship of children's autism symptoms with their toxic metal body burden and red blood cell (RBC) glutathione levels. In children ages 3-8 years, the severity of autism was assessed using four tools: ADOS, PDD-BI, ATEC, and SAS. Toxic metal body burden was assessed by measuring urinary excretion of toxic metals, both before and after oral dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Multiple positive correlations were found between the severity of autism and the urinary excretion of toxic metals. Variations in the severity of autism measurements could be explained, in part, by regression analyses of urinary excretion of toxic metals before and after DMSA and the level of RBC glutathione (adjusted R2 of 0.22-0.45, p 0.005 in all cases). This study demonstrates a significant positive association between the severity of autism and the relative body burden of toxic metals. PDF file: Severity of Autism Is Associated With Toxic Metal Body Burden and Red Blood Cell Glutathione Levels Dr. Jimmy Gutman, MD - \"Clinical evidence links low glutathione levels to the most common illnesses of our time as well as newly emerging diseases. Glutathione levels diminish as we age and many diseases normally associated with aging have been linked to glutathione deficiency.\" Glutathione is a master antioxidant, an important line of defense against diseases, toxins, viruses, pollutants, radiation and oxidative stress. Low glutathione levels are linked to diseases such as Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, AIDS, Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s, Atherosclerosis, pregnancy complications, male infertility and Cataracts. A Glutathione deficiency can cause a lack of coordination, mental disorders, tremors, and difficulty maintaining balance.

In all, around 2,000 families have received compensation payments that have averaged $850,000 each. There are a further 700 claims that are going through the pipeline. None of the claims is for autism as medical researchers say they have failed to find a link between the disease and the MMR vaccine, despite the initial findings made by Dr Andrew Wakefield. Instead they are for a wide spectrum of physical and mental conditions that are likely to have been caused by one of the vaccinations. Around 7,000 parents have filed a claim of an adverse reaction with America's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). To win an award, the claimant must prove a causal link to a vaccine. As the medical establishment has refused to recognise any link to autism, the VICP has so far rejected 300 claims for this outright. (Source: New England Journal of Medicine, 2007; 357: 1275-9). Hepatitis B Vaccine Triples the Risk of Autism in Infant Boys Using datasets from 1997 to 2002, this latest study found that newborn boys more than tripled their risk of developing an autism spectrum disorder after receiving the Hepatitis B vaccine.

Children With Autism Get Day in Court The parents of 12-year-old Michelle Cedillo asked a federal court Monday to find that their child's autism was caused by common childhood vaccines, a precedent-setting case that could pave the way for thousands of autistic children to receive compensation from a government fund set up to help people injured by the shots. U.S. Government Concedes That Mercury Causes Autism Vaccine-Autism Question Divides Parents, Scientists Thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative in vaccines A study released today by an environmental organization offers support to the theory that a vaccine preservative called thimerosal may contribute to the cause of autism. The study has found a genetic flaw that sheds further light on how autistic children are metabolically different from healthy children. This may explain why autistic children may not be able to excrete mercury and other heavy metals. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin. Injecting it into a child, whose nervous system is rapidly developing, could have terrible consequences. So, before you decide to vaccinate your children, do them a favor and look into the many risks and side effects associated with common childhood vaccines. Doing so could mean the difference between life and death. Thimerosal has been gradually removed from vaccines since 1999, however it is still present in some vaccinations, including virtually all flu shots. During the review, medical experts discussed the results from a study that showed urinary mercury concentrations were six times higher in children with autism, as opposed to normal-age/vaccine matched controls. They also said that they found evidence that suggested the link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism had a higher risk than that between lung cancer and smoking cigarettes.

Law Suit Against Pharmaceutical Companies Citing Vaccines Contained Poisonous Mercury \"On July 7, 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued with the US Public Health Service (USPHS) a joint statement alerting clinicians and the public of concern about thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative used in some vaccines.The reason for the warning is that himerosal contains a related mercury compound called ethyl mercury. Mercury is a toxic metal that can cause immune, sensory, neurological, motor, and behavioral dysfunctions. The Food and Drug Administration suggested that some infants, depending on which vaccines they receive and the timing of those vaccines, may be exposed to levels of ethyl mercury that could build up to exceed one of the federal guidelines established for the intake of methyl mercury. Symptoms of mercury toxicity in young children are extremely similar to those of autism. This can explain the recent increase in the numbers of children diagnosed with autism since the early 1990's. The numerous amount of children diagnosed with autism seems to directly correlate with the recommendation of both the hepatitis B and HIB vaccine to infants in the early 1990s.\" Parents of now grown vaccine injured children, who warned pediatricians and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) officials in the 1980?s that their once healthy, bright children regressed mentally, emotionally and physically after reacting to DPT vaccine with fever, high pitched screaming (encephalitic cry), collapse/shock, and seizures, are grieving with a new generation of parents whose healthy, bright children suddenly regress after DPT/DTaP, MMR, hepatitis B, polio, Hib and chicken pox vaccinations. The refusal two decades ago by vaccine manufacturers, government health agencies and medical organizations to seriously investigate reports of vaccine-associated brain injury and immune system dysfunction, including autistic behaviors, is reaping tragic consequences today. U.S. Government Concedes That Mercury Causes Autism Autism and Vaccines: A New Look At An Old Story Deadly Immunity By Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Thursday 16 June 2005 - When a study revealed that mercury in childhood vaccines may have caused autism in thousands of kids, the government rushed to conceal the data - and to prevent parents from suing drug companies for their role in the epidemic. more Evidence of Harm: Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic: A Medical Controversy The pharmaceutical industry, the CDC, the FDA, and a host of other people do NOT want you to read this book - because they are afraid of it. And they should be. The CDC has already issued a statement on the book, fearing that it will lower vaccination rates. David Kirby is an independent journalist, not the parent of an autistic child, nor a biased observer from the medical, regulatory, public health, or pharmaceutical communities - trying to cover their a**es from lawsuits that could make the tobacco settlements look like pocket change. David Kirby's new explosive book, \"Evidence of Harm\" will no doubt be used for years to come as a historical account of the greatest iatrogenic (medically induced) epidemic in this nations history. David Kirby reveals in his book, the \"Toxic Truth\" that has been repeatedly covered up by the CDC, NIH, FDA,AAP and greedy politicians whose pockets are constantly lined by the pharmaceudical industry. \"Evidence of Harm\" is an accurate account of how the parents of autistic children realized their kids had received bolus doses of mercury in excess of 100 times over EPA safe limits through their vaccines. Once tests revealed the possibly of mercury toxicity, these parents of great courage and tenacity take their fight to Washington DC and take on government officials within the CDC. Documents and e-mails that where gathered through the Freedom of Information Act confirm their suspicions, there was indeed, evidence of harm! Tthis book is a factual account of the great lengths many have have taken in high places to cover-up the truth, and the lengths the parents will go, to reveal the truth, to help their damaged children, and to prevent further damage. This book confirms what we have been reading in the papers lately about the FDA, CDC and their ties to pharmaceutical companies!

The majority of these parents say their children were normal until getting the MMR ? another triple vaccine. Let me dispel several myths promoted by those who deny the autism-vaccine connection: 1. They claim the vaccines are safe, but physicians are indoctrinated to disbelieve claims of harm and are not trained to recognize nor required to report any adverse reactions.

Nancy Hallaway, RN, and author of the book Turning Lead into Gold - How Heavy Metal Poisoning Can Affect Your Child and How to Prevent and Treat It, found this out the hard way. Her twin boys were diagnosed as hyperactive with Attention Deficit Disorder and severe autistic tendencies. Her doctor found unacceptable levels of lead, arsenic, aluminum and cadmium in their bodies, and his treatments led to immediate and spectacular improvement in both children. These children were prescribed Ritalin, then Anafril, and then Clonidine at age three. Since their first treatment to remove the heavy metals, they have not needed any medications at all for their previously diagnosed disorders. According to Nancy Hallaway, their eye contact is great, their unusual agitation and anxieties have disappeared, and though Nancy was told that the twins might never talk, not only are they both talking now, but they attend regular classes in school. All this resulted from removing toxic metals from their body tissues. Whether the link to heavy metals, chemicals and vaccination toxins is causal or not, there is no question among many doctors, scientists and parents alike that children have regressed developmentally and/or shown signs of autistic spectrum disorders and ADD upon receiving the basic childhood vaccinations, such as MMR and DPT. more In addition, mercury and other heavy metals can accumulate in the body of the fetus, as these metals can and do cross over from the mother into the unborn baby via the placenta. Particularly implicated are iron, lead, mercury and copper. This may explain why some children who were not immunized nevertheless have autism or show autistic tendencies. The fact that heavy metals can and do build up in the body of unborn children echoes the findings of doctors Walsh and Usman: If these children are missing an enzyme to break down heavy metals, these metals that cross over from the placenta will accumulate in the tissues of the body and cause damage to the brain and immune system, even in unborn children.

Buttram, MD In 1993 Vijendra Singh, PhD University of Illinois, published a study in which they found antibodies to myelin basic protein in 50 to 60% of autistic children tested.4 Recently at a public meeting Dr. Singh presented information on an unpublished, preliminary study of 27 autistic children in which he found nearly 50% correlation between MMR antibodies and antibodies to myelin basic protein in serum drawn from the children.7 Dr. Singh emphasized that this study was very preliminary and that no conclusions could be drawn from it. However, it does raise a higher index of suspicion that the MMR vaccine may result in encephalitis and its various complications on a fairly large scale. Once again, this leads us to question whether or not many vaccine reactions are passing unrecognized and therefore unreported by the US medical community.

Along with many other groups throughout the world, the Autism Research Unit is committed to examining the nature of this association through scientific research. Due to the nature of our work conducted at the Unit and the strong contact established with parents of people with autism, we at theUnit, have become increasingly aware of the elevated incidence of parents claiming that their child's autism was the result of, or compounded by, vaccination. Many times each week, we are contacted by parents who talk about the effect they saw when their child was vaccinated, often describing harrowing scenes of extremely rapid regression, from perfectly ordinary children to children who exhibit very severe behavioural and physiological problems.\" more (more on the danger of vaccines) When Your Doctor is Wrong: Hepatitis B and AutismWere your child's developmental issues triggered by hepatitis B vaccine?

Los Angeles Times, April 26, 2000 Do Children's Shots Invite Autism? by Bernard Rimland Ph.D. First, do no harm. If the multibillion-dollar vaccine industry had heeded Hippocrates' ancient dictum and concentrated on making vaccines safe, the 300% to 500% nationwide increase in autism probably would not have occurred. Concern for vaccine safety might have prevented the simultaneous sharp rise in other chronic and debilitating diseases such as asthma, allergies, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities, arthritis and Crohn's disease. Vaccinations: The Overlooked Factors by Bernard Rimland, Ph.D director of the Autism Research Institute The routine administration of a live virus vaccine booster, during the postpartum period, to previously vaccinated women who have remained rubella-susceptible, should be reconsidered. It is likely that continued rubella susceptibility in these women, is not due to a problem with the vaccine, but with the woman herself, and therefore it seems reasonable not to attempt to correct it by the administration of more boosters. Some re-vaccinated mothers are developing unusual problems, and many remain rubella-susceptible. Their children also appear to have an inordinate number of difficulties of their own. Twenty out of twenty five families (80%) in this study have children with autism. more David Ayoub, M.D. goes through the relations of Mercury to Autism and other disease Do you have a question or need guidance?

Children With Starving Brains: A Medical Treatment Guide for Autism Spectrum by Jaquelyn McCandless, MD One of the best resources on autism that I have ever seen. If you want to know the most effective and up-to-date biomedical approaches for autistic spectrum disorders, then get this book. It provides a wealth of useful and easily understood information, and is recommended by the Director of the Autism Research Institute and the Founder of the Autism Society of America, Dr. Bernard Rimland, PhD. In the midst of a worldwide epidemic of autism, ADD, and ADHD, this book is a message of hope to parents embarking on the challenging journey of finding proper medical care for their Autism Spectrum Disorder children. Genetic susceptibility activated by \"triggers\" such as pesticides and heavy metals in vaccines can lead to immune system impairment, gut dysfunction, and pathogen invasion such as yeast and viruses in many children. This is the first book written by an experienced clinician that gives a step-by-step treatment guide for parents and doctors based on the understanding that ASD is a complex biomedical illness resulting in significant brain malnutrition. Dr. McCandless, whose grandchild with autism has inspired her \"broad spectrum approach,\" describes important diagnostic tools needed to select appropriate treatment programs. Her book explains major therapies newly available and identifies safe and effective options for parents and physicians working together to improve the health of these special children. Autism Recover - Testimonials Autism: Our Son's Amazing Improvement with Glyconutrients (saccharides) and Transfer Factor Nutritionals Our son Nason was born in November 2002 happy, healthy and beautiful. He developed normally and reached all of his milestones. After Nason received his 1st year immunizations, he completely withdrew from us and the rest of the world, spending the majority of his time staring at his fingers, spinning, or gazing into space. His preferred companion was a pen or any other vertical object he could find. He lost his ability to walk up and down the stairs, feed himself and began to self-select foods leaving him with a total of 2 foods in his diet. Nason also broke out with severe eczema all over his body and became irritable anytime we tried to cuddle with him. Auto-Immunity, Vaccines and Autism more Dr. Jennifer Reid, N.D. - \"As a naturopathic physician, I have been working with autistic children since 1997. I was introduced to these nutrients three years ago and was very skeptical even though the science looked good. I decided to try glyconutrients with five of my most extreme cases. One of these five patients was a severely autistic child. With this child, I saw what appears to be a recovery of all previous symptoms. I have worked with over 150 autistic children. All children are unique, but in general, what I am seeing is that within the first month, the child's verbal communication increases, their \"stimming\" decreases, and their color improves. As health continues to improve, behavior problems will diminish. The need for many additional supplements will also decrease after starting glyconutrients. Glyconutrients give the body the nutrients to naturally chelate itself of many toxic substances. Families using glyconutrients with their children are having amazing results with autistic characteristics. The results and improvements are definitely undeniable.\" Former Seattle Seahawks footall player find helps with Glyconutritionals for autistic twin boys How Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy's Son Recovered From Autism Carrey and McCarthy?s son, Evan, has been healed thanks to breakthroughs that may not be scientifically proven, but have definitely helped, such as a gluten-free, casein-free diet, vitamin supplementation, detox of metals, and anti-fungals for the yeast overgrowths that plagued his intestines.

Paolo?s mother reported that within 24 hours of the vaccination, he developed an inflamed lump at the site of the shot on his buttocks, and he limped around irritably for days. Paolo also appeared to be unhappy, screaming inconsolably. This shrieking continued with frequency, almost every day throughout his toddlerhood. Paolo lost nearly two years of language development?he could no longer speak Spanish at all (and he had not yet learned English). His motor skills and balance declined as well. He seemed to have lost his ability to play and, if given toys, didn?t seem to know what to do with them. Prior to the immunization, despite his having been raised in an orphanage, the boy?s development seemed normal.

Each child is different - Whatever may be the diagnosis or symptoms, each child is, of course, unique, and each child may need any one of the more than 2000 medicines in our homeopathic materia medica. It is only through an extensive understanding of each youngster through the process of homeopathic case-taking, that a homeopath can arrive at the indicated medicine. This process can be even more challenging with children on the autistic spectrum, especially when they cannot readily communicate; in these cases, the precise words of the child can be fascinating pointers to the correct medicine. Fortunately, there are other indicators as well to guide a homeopath to an effective prescription.

Disease labels are generally unhelpful in homeopathy, what is important is the characteristic symptoms the individual is exhibiting, the unique picture that person is presenting. HOMEOPATHY IS RENOWNED FOR ITS ABILITY TO REDUCE OR REPAIR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY VACCINES LIKE NOTHING ELSE CAN Homeopathy is noted for its success to antidote or remove the toxic effects of vaccines and to re-establish balance in the organism and restore health. Certain homeopathic remedies taken after vaccination can minimize vaccine damage. A professional homeopath should be consulted for more information. \"Once the diagnosis of The Post-Vaccination Syndrome (PVS) is considered a simple and efficient treatment can restore health by giving the vaccinations that caused the disease in homeopathic potencies. Even severe damage as paralysis, epilepsy, general decline, etc. can partially or completely be restored.\" Dr. Smits MD Many families are now using homeopathy as an alternative to vaccines Excerpts from Dr. Mercola's website Autism and Mercury by Tim O'Shea,DC Inquiry into vaccine safety is exploding like never before, even in the popular press. Research coming from dozens of mainstream medical studies can no longer be easily suppressed, as it has been in the past, especially with the prevalence of online information exchange. Last September, some 2,000 people, mostly MDs, assembled at the Town and Country resort in San Diego to hear the latest research on autism. Following the April 2000 Congressional hearings on autism and vaccines, this epidemic can no longer be ignored. The figure of one autistic infant for every 150 is now widely documented. Dr. Stephanie Cave presented enlightening data on mercury toxicity, drawn largely from the brilliant work of Sallie Bernard. Dr. Cave explained how: By age two, American children have received 237 micrograms of mercury through vaccines alone, which far exceeds current EPA \"safe\" levels of .1 mcg/kg. per day. That's one-tenth of a microgram, not one microgram. A few years ago, Bernard and her associates began to notice a striking similarity between the symptoms of autism and the symptoms of mercury poisoning. The more research she did, the more it seemed that these two diseases were virtually identical. Autism and mercury poisoning damage the: brain/nerve cells; eyes; immune system; gastrointestinal system; muscle control; and the speech center. Soaking up the Mercury In the San Diego conference on autism, Dr. Amy Holmes gave perhaps the only lucid presentation about treatment. She explained how chelating drugs alone, which go through the blood like Pac Man munching up mercury, don't do much good for autism. That's because most mercury clears from the blood very soon. Mercury in thimerosal is stored in the gut, liver and brain, and as previously mentioned, becomes very tightly bound to the cells. Once inside those cells, or inside the blood-brain barrier, the mercury is reconverted back to its inorganic form. Locked into these cells, the mercury can then do either immediate cell damage or become latent and cause the onset of autism, brain disorders, or digestive chaos years later. Dr. Holmes reported success using alphalipoic acid as an agent to cross the blood-brain barrier to soak up mercury. Once the mercury is brought back into the bloodstream, standard chelators like DMSA can then take it out. Dr. Holmes has used her protocol on about 300 autistics so far, and shows consistent increases in IQ scores. read the rest of this fascinating article Dr. Andrew Wakefield: The Origins of the Autism Epidemic F Yazbak MD - \"This report describes six mothers who received live virus vaccines and one who received a Hepatitis B vaccine during pregnancy after having received an MMR booster five months prior to conception. All the children who resulted from these pregnancies have had developmental problems, six out seven (85%) were diagnosed with autism, and the seventh seems to exhibit symptoms often associated with autistic spectrum disorders.\" Mary N. Megson, M.D. - \"Autism may be a disorder linked to the disruption of the G-alpha protein, affecting retinoid receptors in the brain. A study of sixty autistic children suggests that autism may be caused by inserting a G-alpha protein defect, the pertussis toxin found in the D.P.T. vaccine, into genetically at-risk children.\" Rebecca Carley, M.D. - \"Although the symptoms of mercury poisoning are identical to the symptoms of autism, it should be noted that most children who descend into the hellish state known as autism do so after the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine is one of the few vaccines that do not contain mercury. Thus, it is self-evident that the removal of mercury will not make vaccines \"safe\". (This is why the mercury is the only thing being addressed at all; because when the people reading this paper realize that the very mechanism by which vaccines corrupt the immune system means that NO vaccine is safe and effective; there will be an evolution of consciousness where the structure of lies telling us vaccines are safe and effective disintegrates.)

The first signs of this disorder typically appear by age 3 and continue through life. The cause of this disorder isn't clear, and there's no cure. But autism is a treatable condition. Children with autism benefit from early individualized, intensive interventions. Causes of autism still puzzle experts The scariest thing about autism is the uncertainties over the cause of the disorder. Even after almost 60 years since Dr. Leo Kanner a psychiatrist at John Hopkins University had defined the word in 1943, doctors and scientists have still failed to pinpoint the cause of autism. The symptoms of autism itself vary from case to case, of which impairments in social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and imagination, are most prominent. Although there is no known unique cause of autism, there is growing evidence that autism can be caused by a variety of problems. According to Stephen M. Edelson of the Center for the Study of Autism in Salem, Oregon, there is some indication of a genetic influence in autism, and that the genetic link to autism may be a weakened or compromised immune system. Other research shown that depression and or dyslexia were quite common in one or both sides of the family when autism was present, he said in his overview of autism found on the Internet. Depression Psychologist Adriana S. Ginanjar, however, downplayed genetic factors as the number of people affected by autism was growing each year. In the U.S. it is estimated that there were one in every 200 children with autism, while previously there had been one in every 1000 children. Autism is three times more likely to affect males than females, Edelson said, however this gender difference was not unique to autism since many developmental disabilities had a greater male to female ratio. In Indonesia, the number of children affected by Pervasive Development Disorder (PDD), including autism, had also been rising in the last few years by about 10,000 to 12,000 cases annually, accounting for between 0.15 percent to 0.2 percent of the total number of births annually, according to the Ministry of Health. Genes do not cause an outbreak, there's been a report from England that autism there is growing fast, and that couldn't be just because of genes,'' Adriana said in a one-day workshop on increasing communication abilities in autistic children here. She said that autism was more likely caused by the change in the environment, pollution, wider use of artificial fertilizers, and higher consumption of fast foods. As an example, Edelson cited the high prevalence of autism in the small town of Leomenster, Massachusetts, where a factory manufacturing sunglasses was once located. Interestingly, the highest proportion of autism cases were found in the homes down-wind from the factory smokestacks. There was also evidence that a virus can cause autism, and that there was an increased risk in having an autistic child after exposure to rubella during the first trimester of the pregnancy. Additionally, there were growing concerns that viruses associated with vaccinations, such as the measles component of the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine and the pertussis component of the DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis) shot, may cause autism. This is why many doctors now prefer to delay giving these shots to children under three years old,'' Adriana said. Diphtheria pertussis Tetanus Many autistic children also seemed to have an impairment in one or more of their senses, which could involve the auditory, visual, tactile, taste, vestibular, olfactory (smell), and proprioceptive senses. These senses may be hypersensitive, hyposensitive, or may result in the person experiencing interference, such as a persistent ringing or buzzing sound in the ears. As a result, it may be difficult for them to process incoming sensory information properly. Edelson said that about 10 percent of autistic individuals had savant skills, or remarkable abilities. These skills were often spatial in nature, such as a special talent in music and art, and mathematical abilities in which some can multiply large numbers in their head within a short period of time. Others could determine the day of the week when given a specific date in history, or memorize a complete airline schedule. Over the years, families have tried various types of traditional and non-traditional treatments to reduce autistic behaviors and to increase appropriate behaviors. Food intolerances and food sensitivities were receiving much attention as possible contributors to autistic behaviors, and many families had observed rather dramatic changes after removing certain food items from their children's diet. Edelson said that researchers had detected the presence of abnormal peptides in the urine of autistic individuals. It is thought that these peptides may be due to the body's inability to breakdown certain proteins into amino acids. These proteins were gluten such as wheat, barley, and oats; and casein found in human and cow's milk. Many parents had removed these substances from their children's diets and had, in many cases, observed dramatic, positive changes in health and behavior. genetic brain genetic U.S. depression PDD Internet Oregon social interaction MMR Leo Kanner England Pervasive Development Disorder Massachusetts Rubella Stephen M.

Several large-scale studies have failed to find a link between vaccines and autism. But that didn't stop parents from 5000 families who believe there is a link from seeking compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created to help the small number of children who have severe allergic reactions to vaccines. On 12 March, the judges overseeing the scheme declared there was no proof that the children's autism was caused by thimerosal (thiomersal outside the US), a mercury-containing preservative used in some vaccines. The same court had already thrown out claims that thimerosal plus the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism. \"The ruling supported the science,\" says Paul Offit of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. The families can appeal the decision, but it is unlikely to be reversed. This may not be the end of the anti-vaccine campaign, however. Campaigners have already started blaming the sheer number of vaccines a child receives, rather than a particular one or combination, for autism. \"They keep moving the goalposts,\" says Offit. \"It's the hallmark of pseudoscience.\" Like what you've just read?

Autism is one of the five disorders listed under the umbrella of Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Individuals with Autism have deficits in communication, both verbal and nonverbal, social interactions and pragmatics, lack of play skills, lack of flexibility in everyday routines and transitions and have a preoccupation with repetitive behaviors, such as spinning and lining up objects.

Behavior Analysis is different from the psychological sciences in that the behavior itself and its interactions in the immediate environment is the primary interest as opposed to the mental aspects of the behavior. Variations in behavior, defined as changes in the frequency or form of what we do or what we say, are understood in terms of relations with real-world events. Behavior analysts' main goal is to solve human problems by modifying environments in relation to behavior that causes difficulties. Behavior Analysis looks at a three-step contingency when studying behavior; A-B-C Contingency standing for Antecedent, Behavior and Consequence. Antecedents occur right before a behavior; Behaviors are the target behaviors being observed and Consequences occur immediately after the behavior. Learn more about ABA in the Resources section.

Researchers from the State Public Health Department found that the autism rates in children rose continuously during the study period from 1995 to 2007. The preservative, thimerosal, has not been used in childhood vaccines since 2001, except for some flu shots. The latest findings failed to convince some parents and advocacy groups, who have long blamed mercury, a neurotoxin, for the disorder. California Archives of General Psychiatry State Public Health Department (1229967720 1995 to 2007 topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/autism 122996772 Autism155 http://www.coastalbendautismadvocacy.org/ SITE NAVIGATION RESOURCES EVENTS ABOUT US LINKS CONTACT US JOIN NOW GALLERY ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS Hannah's Hope TAA Partners TX Autism.Speaks Focus Initiative ASA The Arc of Texas GRASP Texas Autism Advocacy Coastal Bend Council for Independent Living (CBCIL) Texas Parent to Parent Hannah Hope TAA Partners TX Autism.Speaks Focus Initiative The Arc of Texas GRASP Texas Autism Advocacy Coastal Bend Council for Independent Living CBCIL Texas Parent www.coastalbendautismadvocacy.org/ Autism156 http://www.wsbtv.com/health/22825130/detail.html WASHINGTON -- The vaccine additive thimerosal is not to blame for autism, a special federal court ruled Friday in a long-running battle by parents convinced there is a connection. While expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism. \"Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration,\" special master George Hastings Jr. wrote. But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case. The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court. The parents presented expert witnesses who argued mercury can have a variety of effects on the brain, but the ruling said none of them offered opinions on the cause of autism in the three specific cases argued. They testified that mercury can affect a number of biological processes, including abnormal metabolism in children. Special master Denise K. Vowell noted that in order to succeed in their action, the parents would have to show \"the exquisitely small amounts of mercury\" that reach the brain from vaccines can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts ... from other sources do not. The ruling said the parents were arguing that the effects from mercury in vaccines differ from mercury's known effects on the brain. Vowell concluded that the parents had failed to establish that their child's condition was caused or aggravated by mercury from vaccines. Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines. The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism. The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available. The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had \"already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.\" But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, \"it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them.\" On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. \"The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,\" Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement. SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling. \"The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology,\" the goup said. The advocacy group Autism Speaks said \"the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases.\" However, while research has found no overall connection between autism and vaccines, the group said it would back research to determine if some individuals might be at increased risk because of genetic or medical conditions. Meanwhile, in reaction to the concerns of parents, thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines in the United States. In Friday's action the court ruled in three different cases, each concluding that the preservative has no connection to autism. The trio of rulings can offer reassurance to parents scared about vaccinating their babies because of a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, are on the rise. The U.S. Court of Claims is different from many other courts: The families involved didn't have to prove the inoculations definitely caused the complex neurological disorder, just that they probably did. More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation through the government's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the rulings dealt with test cases to settle which if any claims had merit. Autism is best known for impairing a child's ability to communicate and interact. Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it's unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosis. Worry about a vaccine link first arose in 1998 when a British physician, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published a medical journal article linking a particular type of autism and bowel disease to the measles vaccine. The study was later discredited. Copyright 2010 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Kevin Healey, who has Asperger?s syndrome, decided to write a book based on his experiences and those of his identical twin brother Shaun, who has autism. The book, Twin Brothers Worlds Apart, was published 15 months ago with proceeds being split between the charity Kevin founded, Staffordshire Adults Autistic Society (SAAS) and the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge. Kevin, 35, said: ?As a person with autism, I feel that autism has never been portrayed correctly. ?All the autism films show adults on the high functioning end of the spectrum, and adults with genius savant abilities, like Dustin Hoffman in the film the Rain Man. ?My twin can?t communicate ? he is locked in a world of his own, he can?t even tell you if he feels ill, or if he is in pain. ?On one occasion we nearly lost my twin with double pneumonia because the health bodies thought and assumed he was OK. ?There have been other instances where people have not accepted my twin because of his condition, maybe because they don?t understand him. ?Even though I love my twin so dearly, I have never been able to communicate with him because he does not understand, and for a twin that is incredibly hard. ?Most twins grow up playing together and enjoy the social aspects of life such as going out, and we have not been able to do this. ?I didn?t get diagnosed until my late 20s and if it was not for Professor Baron-Cohen and his team at the Autism Research Centre, Cambridge, I wouldn?t be writing this today. ?At 26 I was contemplating suicide, because I was not understood or accepted in today?s society. ?People?s attitudes have moved forward slightly in the autism field, but more educating and understanding of the condition needs to be addressed. ?Hopefully this can be achieved with the film.? Kevin hopes to obtain funding for the film and find actors will play the roles. All the proceeds from the film would go to SAAS. SAAS aims to provide support to people with autism and Asperger in Staffordshire. It arranges activities and outings for adults the conditions. For more information visit www.saas.uk.com. Any director interested in making the film should contact the charity on 01782 617088 or email infosaas@ntlworld.com.

Autism (aw-tis-um) is a very serious brain disorder that affects how children communicate. Autism makes it hard for children to think, feel, play, or talk like other children. Autism effects every child differently. Some children are autistic from birth. Other children begin to show signs of autism by 3 years of age. Many autistic children are also mentally slow. Autism is seen about 4 times more often in boys than in girls. Your child may have signs of autism for the rest of his life. Some autistic children learn skills as they get older that help them work and live in their community. Other autistic children need to have someone care for them forever. Medicine and other treatments may be used to treat autism. Causes: It is not clearly known what causes autism. Scientists are beginning to understand that problems with how a baby's brain develops before and after birth may cause it. Autistic children have brains that look and work in a different way than normal children. Autism may run in families. Signs and Symptoms: Autistic children have many different signs and symptoms. Your child may have some or many of the following. Avoids looking at you or other people. Cannot sit still for any amount of time and moves quickly from one activity to the next. Cries all the time, or cried all the time when he was a baby. Does not like being touched. Does not understand or hear when you talk to him. Does the same thing over and over like head banging, body rocking, or hand twisting. Gets upset if his routine is changed, like changing what he usually eats or drinks. Has a bad temper tantrum because a change upsets him. Has problems talking and seems to have a language of his own. He may say the same words over and over in a high sounding voice. Seems not to know you from other people and strangers. Seems not to have fun when playing, and does not have normal friendships like other children. Seizures (convulsions). Sniffs or licks toys. Stiffens up when you pick him up. Tries to hurt himself or others by biting, hitting, or kicking. Very anxious (nervous) or changes moods quickly. Very quiet as a baby or did not want to be cuddled or held. Will not come to you to be comforted when he is ill, hurt, or tired. Or, does not seem to feel his injuries or pain at all. Care: Your child may need to be put in the hospital for tests and treatment. Caregivers may need to do many tests like blood tests, hearing tests, visual tests, a MRI or PET scan. There is no cure for autism, but treatment may help your child live a more normal life. Treatment is different for every autistic child. What treatment works for one child may not work for your child. It is best if treatment for your child's autism is started early. Caregivers may suggest one or more of the following treatments. Behavior (b-hav-yer) Modification (mah-duh-fuh-k-shun) Therapy. Counseling. Medicine. Occupational (ok-u-pa-shun-ull) therapy. Physical (fizz-ih-kull) therapy. Speech therapy. Coping: Your family may feel scared, confused, and anxious because of your child's autism. As parents you may blame yourself and think you have done something wrong. These feelings are normal. Talk about them with your child's caregiver or someone close to you. Ask your child's caregiver about support groups for children with autism. Such a group can give your child and the family support and information. You may want to write or call the following support groups.

Autism (sometimes called \ufffdclassical autism\ufffd) is the most common condition in a group of developmental disorders known as the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Autism is characterized by impaired social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and unusual, repetitive, or severely limited activities and interests. Other ASDs include Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (usually referred to as PDD-NOS). Experts estimate that three to six children out of every 1,000 will have autism. Males are four times more likely to have autism than females. What are some common signs of autism? There are three distinctive behaviors that characterize autism. Autistic children have difficulties with social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors or narrow, obsessive interests. These behaviors can range in impact from mild to disabling. The hallmark feature of autism is impaired social interaction. Parents are usually the first to notice symptoms of autism in their child. As early as infancy, a baby with autism may be unresponsive to people or focus intently on one item to the exclusion of others for long periods of time. A child with autism may appear to develop normally and then withdraw and become indifferent to social engagement. Children with autism may fail to respond to their name and often avoid eye contact with other people. They have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling because they can\ufffdt understand social cues, such as tone of voice or facial expressions, and don\ufffdt watch other people\ufffds faces for clues about appropriate behavior. They lack empathy. Many children with autism engage in repetitive movements such as rocking and twirling, or in self-abusive behavior such as biting or head-banging. They also tend to start speaking later than other children and may refer to themselves by name instead of \ufffdI\ufffd or \ufffdme.\ufffd Children with autism don\ufffdt know how to play interactively with other children. Some speak in a sing-song voice about a narrow range of favorite topics, with little regard for the interests of the person to whom they are speaking. Many children with autism have a reduced sensitivity to pain, but are abnormally sensitive to sound, touch, or other sensory stimulation. These unusual reactions may contribute to behavioral symptoms such as a resistance to being cuddled or hugged. Children with autism appear to have a higher than normal risk for certain co-existing conditions, including fragile X syndrome (which causes mental retardation), tuberous sclerosis (in which tumors grow on the brain), epileptic seizures, Tourette syndrome, learning disabilities, and attention deficit disorder. For reasons that are still unclear, about 20 to 30 percent of children with autism develop epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood. While people with schizophrenia may show some autistic-like behavior, their symptoms usually do not appear until the late teens or early adulthood. Most people with schizophrenia also have hallucinations and delusions, which are not found in autism. How is autism diagnosed? Autism varies widely in its severity and symptoms and may go unrecognized, especially in mildly affected children or when it is masked by more debilitating handicaps. Doctors rely on a core group of behaviors to alert them to the possibility of a diagnosis of autism. These behaviors are: impaired ability to make friends with peers impaired ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others absence or impairment of imaginative and social play stereotyped, repetitive, or unusual use of language restricted patterns of interest that are abnormal in intensity or focus preoccupation with certain objects or subjects inflexible adherence to specific routines or rituals Doctors will often use a questionnaire or other screening instrument to gather information about a child\ufffds development and behavior. Some screening instruments rely solely on parent observations; others rely on a combination of parent and doctor observations. If screening instruments indicate the possibility of autism, doctors will ask for a more comprehensive evaluation. Autism is a complex disorder. A comprehensive evaluation requires a multidisciplinary team including a psychologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, speech therapist, and other professionals who diagnose children with ASDs. The team members will conduct a thorough neurological assessment and in-depth cognitive and language testing. Because hearing problems can cause behaviors that could be mistaken for autism, children with delayed speech development should also have their hearing tested. After a thorough evaluation, the team usually meets with parents to explain the results of the evaluation and present the diagnosis. Children with some symptoms of autism, but not enough to be diagnosed with classical autism, are often diagnosed with PDD-NOS. Children with autistic behaviors but well-developed language skills are often diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Children who develop normally and then suddenly deteriorate between the ages of 3 to 10 years and show marked autistic behaviors may be diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder. Girls with autistic symptoms may be suffering from Rett syndrome, a sex-linked genetic disorder characterized by social withdrawal, regressed language skills, and hand wringing. What causes autism? Scientists aren\ufffdt certain what causes autism, but it\ufffds likely that both genetics and environment play a role. Researchers have identified a number of genes associated with the disorder. Studies of people with autism have found irregularities in several regions of the brain. Other studies suggest that people with autism have abnormal levels of serotonin or other neurotransmitters in the brain. These abnormalities suggest that autism could result from the disruption of normal brain development early in fetal development caused by defects in genes that control brain growth and that regulate how neurons communicate with each other. While these findings are intriguing, they are preliminary and require further study. The theory that parental practices are responsible for autism has now been disproved. What role does inheritance play? Recent studies strongly suggest that some people have a genetic predisposition to autism. In families with one autistic child, the risk of having a second child with the disorder is approximately 5 percent, or one in 20. This is greater than the risk for the general population. Researchers are looking for clues about which genes contribute to this increased susceptibility. In some cases, parents and other relatives of an autistic child show mild impairments in social and communicative skills or engage in repetitive behaviors. Evidence also suggests that some emotional disorders, such as manic depression, occur more frequently than average in the families of people with autism. Do symptoms of autism change over time? For many children, autism symptoms improve with treatment and with age. Some children with autism grow up to lead normal or near-normal lives. Children whose language skills regress early in life, usually before the age of 3, appear to be at risk of developing epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity. During adolescence, some children with autism may become depressed or experience behavioral problems. Parents of these children should be ready to adjust treatment for their child as needed. How is autism treated? There is no cure for autism. Therapies and behavioral interventions are designed to remedy specific symptoms and can bring about substantial improvement. The ideal treatment plan coordinates therapies and interventions that target the core symptoms of autism: impaired social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and obsessive or repetitive routines and interests. Most professionals agree that the earlier the intervention, the better. Educational/behavioral interventions: Therapists use highly structured and intensive skill-oriented training sessions to help children develop social and language skills. Family counseling for the parents and siblings of children with autism often helps families cope with the particular challenges of living with an autistic child. Medications: Doctors often prescribe an antidepressant medication to handle symptoms of anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anti-psychotic medications are used to treat severe behavioral problems. Seizures can be treated with one or more of the anticonvulsant drugs. Stimulant drugs, such as those used for children with attention deficit disorder (ADD), are sometimes used effectively to help decrease impulsivity and hyperactivity. Other therapies: There are a number of controversial therapies or interventions available for autistic children, but few, if any, are supported by scientific studies. Parents should use caution before adopting any of these treatments. genetic brain genetic depression sensitivity eye contact mental retardation routines add childhood disintegrative disorder social interaction seizures attention deficit disorder anxiety fragile x syndrome stimulant antidepressant cognitive rett syndrome Tourette \ufffdI\ufffd www.ccmentalhealth.org/more_information/autism.htm screening Autism161 http://www.edgarcayce.org/health/database/health_resources/autism.asp The Cayce Health Database - Printer friendly version of this article AUTISM The information contained in the Edgar Cayce Health database should not be regarded as a guide to self-diagnosis or self-treatment. The cooperation of a qualified health care professional is essential if one wishes to apply the principles and techniques described in this database. Autism is not a disease, but a developmental disorder of brain function. People with classical autism show three types of symptoms: impaired social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication and imagination, and unusual or severely limited activities and interests. Symptoms of autism usually appear during the first three years of childhood and continue throughout life. Although there is no cure, appropriate management may foster relatively normal development and reduce undesirable behaviors. People with autism have a normal life expectancy. Autism affects an estimated two to 10 of every 10,000 people, depending on the diagnostic criteria used. Most estimates that include people with similar disorders are two to three times greater. Autism strikes males about four times as often as females, and has been found throughout the world in people of all racial and social backgrounds. Autism varies a great deal in severity. The most severe cases are marked by extremely repetitive, unusual, self-injurious, and aggressive behavior. This behavior may persist over time and prove very difficult to change, posing a tremendous challenge to those who must live with, treat, and teach these individuals. The mildest forms of autism resemble a personality disorder associated with a perceived learning disability. The hallmark feature of autism is impaired social interaction. Children with autism may fail to respond to their names and often avoid looking at other people. Such children often have difficulty interpreting tone of voice or facial expressions and do not respond to others' emotions or watch other people's faces for cues about appropriate behavior. They appear unaware of others' feelings toward them and of the negative impact of their behavior on other people. Many children with autism engage in repetitive movements such as rocking and hair twirling, or in self-injurious behavior such as biting or head-banging. They also tend to start speaking later than other children and may refer to themselves by name instead of \"I\" or \"me.\" Some speak in a sing-song voice about a narrow range of favorite topics, with little regard for the interests of the person to whom they are speaking. People with autism often have abnormal responses to sounds, touch, or other sensory stimulation. Many show reduced sensitivity to pain. They also may be extraordinarily sensitive to other sensations. These unusual sensitivities may contribute to behavioral symptoms such as resistance to being cuddled. Autism is classified as one of the pervasive developmental disorders. Some doctors also use terms such as \"emotionally disturbed\" to describe people with autism. Because it varies widely in its severity and symptoms, autism may go unrecognized, especially in mildly affected individuals or in those with multiple handicaps. Researchers and therapists have developed several sets of diagnostic criteria for autism. Some frequently used criteria include: Absence or impairment of imaginative and social play Impaired ability to make friends with peers Impaired ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others Stereotyped, repetitive, or unusual use of language Restricted patterns of interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus Apparently inflexible adherence to specific routines or rituals Preoccupation with parts of objects Since hearing problems can be confused with autism, children with delayed speech development should always have their hearing checked. Children sometimes have impaired hearing in addition to autism. Autism has no single cause. Researchers believe several genes, as well as environmental factors such as viruses or chemicals, contribute to the disorder. Symptoms in many children with autism improve with intervention or as the children mature. Some people with autism eventually lead normal or near-normal lives. However, reports from parents of children with autism indicate that some children's language skills regress early in life, usually before age three. This regression often seems linked to epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity. Adolescence also worsens behavior problems in some children with autism, who may become depressed or increasingly unmanageable. Parents should be ready to adjust treatment for their child's changing needs. From a standard medical perspective, there is no cure for autism at present. Therapies, or interventions, are designed to remedy specific symptoms in each individual. The best-studied therapies include educational/behavioral and medical interventions. Although these interventions do not cure autism, they often bring about substantial improvement. (Note: The above information comes from National Institutes of Health Publication No. 96-1877) THE EDGAR CAYCE PERSPECTIVE OF AUTISM Edgar Cayce gave several readings for individuals exhibiting autistic features. Because Edgar Cayce was more interested in the uniqueness of each individual than in diagnostic labels, we cannot be certain as to whether these cases are representative of autism. The word autism was never used in any reading or correspondence. However, descriptions of behaviors and functioning do suggest that certain persons who received readings may have suffered from autism. Notably, three readings given for an eight-year-old girl (2253), are indicative of autism. (Q) Why does she not talk? (A) This reaction, or refractory reaction in system, prevents the contraction in the muscular forces that have to do with the plexus from the secondary cardiac to the central nerve system. This is directly to the vocal box. In the corrections in the 3rd and 4th dorsal, and the 2nd and 3rd cervical, this will be stimulated, see? as will necessary later to stimulate along the eustachian tube for the reaction there, see? This NOT in the beginning. The manipulations we would make at least three times each week, and ONE of the treatments and ADJUSTMENT treatment - the other the drainages set up and the muscular forces and tendons so relaxed as to make for the feeding out or building up of nerve impulses as between the sympathetic and cerebro-spinal system. (Q) Why does she wring her hands? (A) Nervous reaction. When these come, there is some form of expression - and in the attempt to find an outlet for that INNATELY felt, the lack of knowing WHAT to do - see? (Q) Will she ever be able to understand and carry out a spoken suggestion? (A) She will, if these [treatments] are carried out as has been outlined. (Q) Where will the first improvement be noticed? (A) The gradual relaxation, and NOT so nervous. (Q) Is her brain alright, or just dormant? (A) Just dormant. (2253-1) Edgar Cayce traced the cause of the condition to pressures along the spine where nerve plexus coordinate the functioning of the system. Nervous system incoordination resulted producing a disturbance to the \"imaginative nerve forces of the body\" causing the child to be \"over sensitive.\" The pressures, as we find, exist principally in those of the sacral, the lower dorsal, and the WHOLE of the cervical areas. These are especially seen in the 4th LUMBAR plexus, that prevents coordination in the sympathetic and cerebro-spinal impulses; while those of the central or lower dorsal, sympathetically with the upper or 4th and 5th dorsal, prevent those impulses to the central nerve force as to cause any reaction in this direction, and little or no response is seen in that of a refractory reaction, save as comes through impulses in the imaginative nerve forces of the body. Hence those tendencies of the body to be over sensitive to certain vibrations that may be set up, without the proper coordinating even to BRAIN impulses as to WHAT the reaction SHOULD be. Hence often the body responds in a manner as apparently directly opposite from that as would be, or should be, expected from voluntary or involuntary refractory, or refraction. (2253-1) Osteopathic manipulations to relieve the pressure were recommended. A mild, natural herbal formula (containing mayblossom and ginseng) was suggested to calm and sedate the child. An energy medicine device (Radial Appliance) was prescribed to assist in coordinating the system. Hypnotic suggestion was consistently recommended in such cases. Edgar Cayce sometimes used the expression \"suggestive therapeutics\" to describe a simple, natural form of suggestion to be used. Suggestion was recommended to address the habitual, involuntary hand wringing and lack of normal development: ...as the body sinks to sleep - the talk, the quieting effect, the improvements through the psychopathic effect that may be created by suggestion as the body goes to sleep. Something as this, though it may be altered according to that one giving same. Do not make same as rote, or as just something to be said, but with that intense desire to be a channel of aid and help TO the individual: AS YOU (calling the child by ITS OWN name, that it responds to even by any FORM of suggestion) AS YOU SINK INTO A QUIET RESTFUL SLEEP, THE ORGANS OF THE BODY WILL SO FUNCTION THAT THE VERY BEST WILL BE BUILDED IN THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL BEING, GIVING THAT RESPONSE THAT WILL BE A NORMAL ACTIVITY FOR THE ORGANS OF THE SENSORY SYSTEM. (2253-2) (Q) Is there anything we can do to get her to stop wringing her hands? (A) Only applying those things that will alter the present nervous reactions in the system will change same. THIS body, would be well for the suggestions to be made under the influence of hypnosis, or auto-suggestion to the body as it sleeps. This must be made by someone in sympathy with the activities of the body, and THIS would relieve such stress on the general system. (2253-3) Although we have no long-term documentation in this case, a letter from Mrs. Pope of the Rosehill School (where the child was staying) noted, \"I think she has improved noticeably and more so since she has had the battery although it has been used such a short time.\" Four readings were given for a nineteen year old male [2014] who had been \"abnormal about eleven years\" and who was exhibiting repetitious, involuntary movements and antisocial behaviors: (Q) What is the reason for, and what can be done for the habit reaction he has; such as the spitting, drawing of the mouth down, and waving of the fingers before his nose and mouth? (A) These, as indicated, are reflexes through the sensory nerve system; lack of coordination between impulses and the guided or directed forces in the mental reactions of same. Keep up the applications indicated for corrections, making the suggestions - and not attempting to control by violent means! (2014-3) (Q) Would you advise scolding or hitting him, when he is so uncontrollable? or what method would you advise? (A) Patience, kindness, gentleness, ever; not in that of scolding or tormenting at all. But in cajoling, and in kindness and in patience, these are the manners. Remember, these conditions are for purposes. While they become very trying to the individuals who attempt to administer to the needs of the body, know that these are purposeful in thine own experience also. (Q) Is this stubborn, fresh and disobedient attitude due to his ailment? (A) Due to the ailment; else there would be other measures indicated. And in the building up of the body, there must be the response to kindness and gentleness and love, - more than to force, power, might, hate or scolding. (2014-2) Again, this series of readings described nervous system incoordination involving the sensory nervous system. Pressures along the spine and in the abdominal nerve plexus associated with the digestive system were noted. Abdominal castor oil packs and spinal manipulations were suggested to relieve the pressures and coordinate the nervous systems. The Radial Appliance was also recommended to assist with the coordination. A mild laxative tea was prescribed to improve eliminations through the colon as chronic constipation was a problem. For the behavioral problems and general pathological conditions, suggestive therapeutics was recommended: (Q) What type of suggestion would you recommend? (A) As just indicated, the type that is to be given continually; of the creative forces or God, - love manifesting through the activities of the body. These as helpful forces will bring the bettered conditions for this body. (2014-3) The minimal follow-up correspondence does not indicate whether the recommendations were applied consistently or the eventual outcome in this case. A series of twelve readings were given for a young girl (1179) who was seven years old when she received her first reading. Her readings and follow up correspondence suggest possible mild autism. Her readings described a \"supersenstive\" system with psychic or imaginative tendencies: These conditions are rather of the unusual nature; or the body physically and mentally is supersensitive and the psychic forces are developing much faster than the bodily functionings. Or the body functionings are of such a nature that the sensitiveness of same precludes some activities through the nominal physical developments. (1179-1) There are periods when there are unusual activities in the psychic forces of the body. The imaginative reactions to the sensory and the external forces in the experience of the body at times find physical expression in moods. (1179-7) The child was somewhat withdrawn and difficult. Her mother's comment immediately following 1179-1: \"Now I know better how to cope with this child, who reacts so differently from my other children - she is so unusual in so many ways.\" The mother's difficulty in dealing with the child's antisocial behaviors was noted: DO NOT make it an issue with the body! Advise with, but do not rave at nor scold nor make the entity conscious of same by constant nagging, or insistency! And this will be better, it will be found, in ALL the ways of IMPRESSING the body in ANY manner for any activity. As has been indicated, the body is supersensitive, and is made aware of self's shortcomings or self's virtues by a continual impressing on same. Listen to the entity's arguments, always. Never tell her to shut up or stop, but hear it out! Then, parallel same by counsel as respecting what MIGHT be better if paralleled in THAT direction. (1179-6) Social withdrawal and interpersonal deficits were cited in the correspondence. The child also apparently had some difficulty with reading. Edgar Cayce described problems with the digestive system which were contributing to the difficult psychosocial development of this child. Various digestive aids and nutritional supplements were recommended, including Ventriculin, a dietary supplement made from the gastric tissue of hogs. As with the other cases cited above, the Radial Active appliance was suggested to assist with nervous system coordination. Spinal manipulations were recommended. A basic diet, focusing on body building foods, was emphasized. In one reading, when asked about substituting other grains for wheat, Edgar Cayce responded: (Q) Should the body discontinue the use of wheat products, substituting RYE BREAK, WHITE RICE, OATMEAL CEREAL, BUCKWHEAT AND CORNMEAL PANCAKES? (A) It would be well to discontinue the greater portion of the wheat products, if these others are used - and they are all very well to be used. (1179-5) Although suggestive therapeutics was not directly mentioned, the readings did insist on the importance of providing spiritual guidance to the child through Bible stories. According to correspondence from her mother, Ms. 1179 became a school teacher at age twenty-two and married thirteen years later. Although the above cases vary greatly with regard to symptoms and severity, some common themes are worth noting. In all these cases Edgar Cayce focused on nervous system incoordination involving the sensory nervous system. All these individuals were described as over sensitive (even \"super-sensitive\"). Nerve pressures were cited as causative factors. Spinal manipulation was consistently recommended, as was the use of the Radial Appliance to assist with balancing and coordinating the system. Problems with the digestive system and intestinal tract was significant in two of these cases (1179 and 2014). Therapies such as abdominal castor oil packs, diet, and dietary supplements were suggested. The mental and spiritual aspects of healing were prominent in all three cases. Suggestive therapeutics was usually recommended. The spiritual focus of the family and caregivers was strongly emphasized. Thus a blending of treatments into a well integrated treatment plan was often recommended by Edgar Cayce for the treatment of autism. Here is a summary of some of the most common treatment recommendations. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS Conceptually, the Cayce approach to autism focuses on assisting the body in healing itself by the application of a variety of therapies intended to address the underlying causes of the condition. The mental and spiritual aspects of healing are strongly emphasized. Here are some general therapeutic recommendations intended to address the underlying causes of autism: MANUAL THERAPY (SPINAL MANIPULATION): Cayce often recommended spinal manipulations to correct specific problems which may be a primary cause of autism. It is difficult to obtain the osteopathic adjustments specified by Cayce. However, a chiropractor may be of help. The frequency of the adjustments will depend on the recommendations of the individual chiropractor or osteopath. The use of an electric vibrator may also be helpful for individuals unable to obtain regular spinal adjustments. ELECTROTHERAPY: Regular use of the Radial Appliance to coordinate nerve functioning and circulation is recommended. INTERNAL CLEANSING: Because autistic symptoms were sometimes linked to problems with the alimentary canal resulting in poor eliminations, hydrotherapy is recommended to improve eliminations through the colon. Hydrotherapy includes drinking six to eight glasses of pure water daily and obtaining colonic irrigations to cleanse the bowel. Following the diet should also assist with internal cleansing. Hot castor oil packs applied over the abdomen are recommended to improve circulation (especially lymphatic) and eliminations through the alimentary canal. DIET: The Basic Cayce Diet is intended to improve assimilation and elimination. The diet focuses heavily on keeping a proper alkaline/acid balance while avoiding foods which produce toxicity and drain the system. Essentially, the diet consists mainly of fruits and vegetables while avoiding fried foods and refined carbohydrates (\"junk food\"). Certain food combinations are emphasized. SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS: The use positive suggestions during the presleep period and during therapy sessions (such as massage and the Radial Appliance) is recommended to awaken the inner healing response. The spiritual attunement of the caregiver is essential. MEDICATION: The use of a mild natural sedative (such as Passion Flower fusion) may be helpful for excitable children. Laxatives and dietary supplements may be helpful, particularly for individuals with significant gastrointestinal symptoms. Although Ventriculin is no longer available, similar products such as Secretin (made from hog gastric tissue and available only by physician's prescription) have proven helpful for some persons suffering from autism.

These signs all begin before a child is three years old. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. The two other autism spectrum disorders are Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and PDD-NOS, diagnosed when full criteria for the other two disorders are not met.Researchers identify autism genesPosted on 2009-04-29 13:10:46Autistic children have variations on genes that help neurons route themselves in the brain of a developing fetus, according to a new set of studies that provide evidence how the autistic minds structure may go awry.

The two groups generally activated the same corticalareas to similar degrees. However, there were three indications of underconnectivity in the groupwith autism. First, the degree of synchronization (i.e. the functional connectivity, or the correlationof the time series of the activation) between the frontal and parietal areas of activation was lowerfor the autistic than the control participants. Second, relevant parts of the corpus callosum, throughwhich many of the bilaterally activated cortical areas communicate, were smaller in cross-sectionalarea in the autistic participants. Third, within the autism group but not within the control group, thesize of the genu of the corpus callosum was correlated with frontal-parietal functional connectivity.These findings suggest that the neural basis of altered cognition in autism entails a lower degree ofintegration of information across certain cortical areas resulting from reduced intra-corticalconnectivity. The results add support to a new theory of cortical underconnectivity in autism,which posits a deficit in integration of information at the neural and cognitive levels. brain add cognitive neural Tower of London 1674788 www.scribd.com/doc/16747881/Functional-Underconnectivity-in-Autism 16747 Autism164 http://counsellingresource.com/distress/autistic/autism-research-1.html Home Mental Disorders and Psychological Distress Autistic Spectrum Disorders Autism Spectrum Disorders Research at the National Institute of Mental Health - Part 1 <!-- google_ad_client = National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) This overview summarizes research into the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. <!-- google_ad_client //--> Article Contents ...Part One Autism Spectrum Disorders Research at the National Institute of Mental Health Implementing the Children's Health Act of 2000 Public Input Brain Tissue and Genetics Resources Diagnosis, Training, and Early Identification Brain Imaging Animal Models Clinical Genetics ...Part Two Developmental Neurobiology Neuropsychology Co-occurring Disorders Treatment Services NIH Collaboration The Broad NIMH Research Program Key Areas of NIMH Research For More Information References Autism Spectrum Disorders Research at the National Institute of Mental Health Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), a broad continuum of brain illnesses that includes Asperger's syndrome, share common genetic roots and essential clinical and behavioral features, although they differ in severity and age of onset. Autism, the most severe of these pervasive developmental disorders, typically begins in early childhood and impairs thinking, feeling, language, and the ability to relate to others. From one to six in 1,000 Americans suffer from ASDs,1,2 with some recent studies citing dramatic apparent increases in prevalence in certain locales. Boys with the disorders outnumber girls three or four to one. Within the first few years of life, children with ASDs fail to develop normal social interaction and communication and show restricted, repetitive, or stereotyped behaviors and interests. Families coping with ASDs are searching for answers about causes, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) investment in autism-related science has quadrupled over the past 7 years from $9.4 million in FY 1997 to $36.2 million in FY 2002. The research is supported through grants and contracts with investigators at university medical centers and in the Institute's own laboratories in Bethesda, MD. In addition, new Institute initiatives aimed at advancing basic knowledge of brain development and genetics hold promise for understanding complex behavioral disorders like autism. NIMH's autism-related research ranges from efforts to improve awareness, diagnosis and treatment, to studies involving brain imaging, tissue banks, animal models, genetics, developmental neurobiology, and neuropsychology. Implementing the Children's Health Act of 2000 As part of the Children's Health Act of 2000,3 Congress designated the NIMH to take the lead in expanding, intensifying and coordinating NIH's expanding autism research effort, which totaled nearly $74 million in 2002. NIMH has implemented this landmark legislation, in collaboration with the four other Institutes represented on the NIH Autism Coordinating Committee (NIH/ACC): National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).4 NIMH, on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), also convenes the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC), which serves as a forum where Federal agencies and public members can share information about their autism-related activities. In addition to the NIH/ACC members, this panel includes representatives from several DHHS agencies and the Department of Education. The IACC also includes four public members, family members or guardians of people with autism or spectrum disorders.5 Studies to Advance Autism Research and Treatment (STAART) Network Foremost among the Children's Health Act's provisions is a collaborative effort to support development of several broadly based Centers of Excellence in Autism Research. In response, the five NIH/ACC Institutes have jointly established the Studies to Advance Autism Research and Treatment (STAART) Network. This project is building new infrastructure for autism research by bringing together critical masses of expertise and resources at eight dedicated research centers across the country. The Centers are conducting basic and clinical research, including investigations into causes, diagnosis, early detection, prevention, and treatment. They include research in the fields of developmental neurobiology, genetics, clinical developmental psychology, and psychopharmacology. Interdisciplinary collaborations, including the recruitment of outstanding investigators who had previously not worked in the autism field, are being funded in stages over the next several years. Grants totaling $65 million over five years were funded in Fall 2002 and Spring 2003 to support STAART Centers at the following sites:6,7 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Yale University University of Washington University of California, Los Angeles Mount Sinai Medical School Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore Boston University University of Rochester, New York Each center is pursuing its own particular mix of studies. For example, at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and four collaborating area institutions, a team of 27 researchers psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, psychologists, speech-language pathologists, developmental pediatricians and neuroscientists are examining motor and communication impairments in autism, to find out what goes wrong in the developing brain, with an eye to early identification and intervention. Spurred by evidence of a serotonin abnormality in autism, investigators are studying animals deficient in the chemical messenger to discover its role in establishing connections between neurons. Among other STAART Center studies currently underway, researchers at Yale University are examining eye tracking in children with autism age 5-12, as well in toddlers. They are studying how a child sees a social situation, relative to his or her level of social competence. Investigators there are also using functional brain imaging to assess the effectiveness of a computer-assisted intervention to improve facial identification and facial expression in autism. A study of relatives of individuals with autism and Down syndrome at the University of North Carolina is looking for patterns of thinking about social situations and executive functioning (planning, impulse control and reasoning) that might provide clues to psychological characteristics shared in common among families with these highly heritable disorders. A brain imaging study seeks to discover the neural roots of social and emotional processes as well as executive functioning and ritualistic-repetitive behaviors in adults and very young children with autism.8 Public Input The Children's Health Act of 2000 mandates that the NIH make available information about its autism activities and facilitate public feedback to the NIH. Communications Directors, Public Liaison Officers, and other staff from the NIH/ACC regularly engage with representatives of autism advocacy groups to exchange information and stay in touch via an internet web site and a list-serve. Members of the autism advocacy community also serve as public participants on NIMH scientific review committees. A searchable information clearinghouse for all NIH autism-related activities is posted on the National Library of Medicine's MedlinePlus Web site. This links to several resources within the DHHS, including NIMH's autism Web page. Brain Tissue and Genetics Resources The Children's Health Act of 2000 also calls on NIMH to take the lead in expanding a program under which samples of tissues and genetic materials are donated, collected, preserved, and made available for autism research. Post-mortem brain tissue, which has been very scarce for the study of autism, offers a unique, high-resolution window into the inner workings of brain cells. For example, by using radioactive tracers on thinly sliced sections of brain tissue, scientists can detect and pinpoint abnormal activity of genes within cells. Only with access to brain tissue can the underlying neuropathology of autism be uncovered. To take advantage of emerging opportunities for discovery in post-mortem tissue made possible by the new molecular methodologies, NIMH, in collaboration with the autism community and other NIH Institutes, is stepping up efforts to establish brain bank collections to study autism. For example, NIMH, NINDS and NIDCD are mounting a joint effort to develop a National Autism Brain Bank at the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, which is primarily funded by NIMH and NINDS. It will store and disseminate postmortem human brain specimens for the study of autism.9 Diagnosis, Training, and Early Identification People with ASDs show a broad range of impairment, with great variability in clinical symptoms and levels of functioning. For example, some people with autism have normal intelligence and develop good basic language skills, while others lag intellectually and develop little or no language. A common diagnostic scheme for assessing the complex social and communication deficits that constitute key features of the disorder has been a critical prerequisite to scientific progress. NIMH has supported research that has raised the quality and standardization of screening and diagnosis in autism. Standard diagnostic interviews and observational methods developed through this research have become a national and international gold standard, ensuring that what is diagnosed in one research center is comparable to that diagnosed in another. The Institute funds a series of annual workshops for training researchers in the use of these tools, and is funding further investigation of measurement tools.10,11 NIMH also supports research aimed at improving early diagnosis of autism. Institute-supported studies have demonstrated that a reliable diagnosis of autism spectrum can be made at age 2.12 Yet, the age of onset remains elusive. Some children seem to develop normally for a couple of years and then regress; for example, they may lose language skills after developing a small vocabulary. Others may be affected from birth, but in such subtle ways that diagnosis is delayed. Earlier identification of children destined to develop symptoms could hold clues to the underlying neuropathology and would also facilitate early intervention. NIMH is funding studies that focus on young children at heightened risk for the disorder, such as younger siblings of children with autism.13,14,15 Brain Imaging Non-invasive brain imaging techniques, such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), offer great potential for advancing understanding of the neural basis of emotional and intellectual deficits in autism and other childhood neuropsychiatric disorders. However, scientists currently have little data on normal brain function and development to compare with data from individuals with autism. Such norms have been lacking for brain imaging studies, leading to non-comparable findings and excessive duplication in scanning control subjects. Therefore, NIMH is co-sponsoring, with NICHD, NIDA and NINDS, a $28 million initiative that is using aMRI (anatomic magnetic resonance imaging), DTI (diffusion tensor imaging), and MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) to create the world's first such large-scale database on normal brain development in children.16 The NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development is cataloging the structural development of the brain, by age and sex, with seven major research centers scanning more than 500 infants, children, and adolescents. Children age five and older are being followed up with additional scans and clinical and behavioral reassessments at 2-year intervals. Younger children are being re-scanned at more frequent intervals 3-12 months to capture more rapid brain maturational changes occurring at these ages. This study will permit the normal growth curves of brain structures to be charted, revealing the development of circuitry for language, thinking, and other functions. Individual brains differ enough that only broad generalizations can be made from comparisons of different individuals at different ages. But following the same brains as they mature allows scientists a much more detailed view of developmental changes. By comparing scans of children with neuropsychiatric disorders with this normative data, researchers will be able to determine the timing and developmental course of brain structural changes in childhood disorders. These databases, being developed by an NIMH-funded data analysis center, will ultimately facilitate early diagnosis and differentiation of various forms of autism. It will also speed the development of targeted treatments and evaluations of their effects. The promise of such a normative brain database for turning up clues about childhood brain disorders was recently illustrated in a similar, but smaller-scale, NIMH intramural study.17 In this first longitudinal structural MRI study to track individual children's developing brains, the researchers were surprised to discover a second wave of overproduction of gray matter (neurons) just prior to puberty. Possibly related to the influence of surging sex hormones, this thickening peaks at around age 11 in girls, 12 in boys, after which the gray matter actually thins some. Prior to this study, scientists had thought that the brain overproduced gray matter for a brief period in early development (in the womb and for about the first 18 months of life) and then underwent just one bout of pruning. The gray matter growth spurt predominates in the frontal lobe, the seat of executive functions. This type of normative data will help researchers contrast typical growth with that in autism spectrum disorders. A wave of abnormal brain enlargement seen in MRI studies of young children with autism follows a back-to-front pattern, similar to a wave of abnormal gray matter loss seen in childhood onset schizophrenia. This may suggest a process in which the timing and trajectory of various abnormalities parallels clinical outcome.18,38 In other brain imaging studies, researchers using MRI and MRS are searching for brain anatomical and biochemical abnormalities that may underlie impaired social communication in children with autism. One fMRI study is looking for malfunctioning brain circuits associated with impaired thinking about human relationships, a problem seen in autism. While in the scanner, subjects view animated cartoons designed to challenge their ability to understand a social situation. High-functioning individuals with autism are being scanned to sort out the neural circuitry of social versus mechanical knowledge.19,20 Yet another series of MRI studies is pinpointing brain structural abnormalities associated with the severity of attention deficits in people with autism.21 For example, the researchers have shown that decreased volume in an area of the brain's parietal lobe correlates with the degree of behavioral impairment in detecting stimuli located outside a principal focus of visual attention. A project at the University of North Carolina has been assessing the relation between brain anatomy and autism through MRI scans of very young children with autism.22 The aim is to get a better picture of the development and timing of the brain enlargement that occurs in autism between 18 and 35 months. To relate these findings to another developmental disorder of known origin, the researchers have joined forces with colleagues at Stanford University to similarly follow the brain development of children with Fragile X syndrome.23,24 These studies will illuminate genetic and environmental factors that influence normal and abnormal brain development and may help to clarify subtypes of autism. Animal Models Studies in monkeys hold great potential for understanding autism, since their brains resemble those of humans thus offering valuable clues. For example, NIMH-funded investigators are continuing to examine monkeys in which early injury to the brain's limbic system, or emotional hub, interfered with the establishment of social and emotional bonds.25 Experiments in monkeys by NIMH intramural scientists found that loss in infancy of two key limbic structures, the amygdala and hippocampus, results in social and emotional abnormalities strikingly similar to autism, in both nature and time course, by 6 months of age. The monkeys with brain lesions, like some autistic children, showed an absence of social interactions, lack of normal facial expressions and body language, and stereotyped behaviors. Also as in autism, the problems emerged only after early infancy and remained permanent. Other monkeys in which a lower part of the temporal lobe was removed developed milder symptoms that substantially abated as they grew older. This study, combined with clinical findings, point to the limbic system structures as likely sites of damage in autism.26 Such behavioral and neuroanatomical research may help to pinpoint brain circuit abnormalities in autism and ultimately lead to intervention strategies. Findings relevant to autism may also emerge from planned studies of proteins in the animal brain. Assuming there is a developmental abnormality in autism, due to a gene defect or gene/ environment interaction, some genes are likely to turn on too much or too little or in the wrong place. This may interfere with the migration and wiring of embryonic brain cells during early development, or with the way cells function. In collaboration with other NIH Institutes and the private sector, NIMH is mounting efforts to expand the set of available tools for discovering such molecular mistakes. For example, studies in mice are identifying the neural basis of complex behaviors. The mouse has become a critical model in studying human disease because scientists have access to many specially bred strains each expressing distinctive physiological and behavioral characteristics and know an enormous amount about mouse genetics. Rapidly-evolving technologies now make it possible to insert, knock out, or mutate mouse genes, quickly breed a generation that expresses the change, and then see how it affects behavior. When autism-linked genes are discovered, they will be inserted and expressed in mice to find out what they do at the molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. Researchers will be able to track a wiring abnormality, a cell migration abnormality, or other anomaly that may lead to symptoms in humans. Clinical Genetics While it is known that heredity plays a major role in complex behavioral disorders like autism, the identification of specific genes that confer vulnerability to such disorders has proven extremely difficult. Detecting multiple genes, each contributing only a small effect, requires large sample sizes and powerful technologies that can associate genetic variations with disease and pinpoint candidate genes. And even after human disease vulnerability genes are found, sophisticated techniques will be needed to find out what turns them on, what brain components they code for, and how they affect behavior. Although by no means assured, the prospect of acquiring such molecular knowledge holds great hope for the engineering of new therapies. Evidence suggests that some family members of people with autism may share with them milder, but qualitatively similar, behavioral characteristics of autism.27 For example, they may have mild social, language or reading problems. A multi-site team of NIMH-supported investigators has been studying such families to characterize these behavioral traits in hopes of discovering sites in the genome associated with them. In the latest phase of these studies, neuropsychological characteristics of relatives of individuals with autism and autism spectrum will be compared with those of people with injuries to brain areas implicated in autism, such as the amygdala and frontal cortex. Patterns of co-occurrence of the characteristics will be examined in individuals and families.28 Four previously undetected chromosomal sites strongly linked to autism have been discovered by the largest and methodologically most sophisticated genome-wide screens to date, funded, in part, by NIMH. Two studies, led by investigators at Columbia University and the University of Oxford, add regions on chromosomes 2, 5, 8, and 17 to a growing list of areas likely harboring autism-predisposing genes. They also add to previous evidence implicating areas on chromosomes 7, 16 and 19.29,30 Although one chromosomal region, 7q, had turned up consistently in such screens, no specific candidate gene there had yet been pinpointed until NIMH-funded researchers, led by a team at the University of Iowa, discovered that variants of a particular gene in the 7q region, expressed in human thalamus, may be associated with autism susceptibility.31 It is a member of a family of genes that influences brain development. To increase the likelihood of finding genes for autism, researchers are increasing the statistical power of human data sets. One genome-wide screen of autism vulnerability genes in 110 families showed suggestive evidence for linkage to ASD on several chromosomes. In a follow-up analysis, the researchers increased the sample size threefold while holding the study design constant, so that 345 families (each with at least two siblings affected with autism or ASD), were included. The most significant findings were on chromosome 17q conspicuously near the gene that codes for the serotonin transporter and on 5p. Analyses from this largest data set studied to date implicate brain serotonin systems in autism. This finding is congruent with those from other studies which show evidence of elevated blood serotonin levels both in patients with autism and in their unaffected first-degree relatives. Studies also show that drugs that selectively target 5-HTT can ameliorate some autism-related symptoms. Serotonin-related neural circuits may thus provide targets for new drug development.32 Continued progress in molecular genetic studies of autism will require very large sample sizes, and the pooling of ever larger numbers of families. In addition, future studies likely will require the identification and characterization of autism-related traits correlated with liability to produce disease. NIMH is supporting efforts to reach out to families to build a library of DNA samples and clinical data that can be broadly distributed to researchers through the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative. For example, in March of 2002 NIMH announced the awarding of a grant totaling more than $6 million, over five years, to researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, for a major expansion of the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) gene bank, a collaborative effort with the citizens group Cure Autism Now (CAN). The goal is to add 300 more families to this resource, which conducts 2-hour in-home screenings of families that have more than one member diagnosed with autism, PDD or Asperger's syndrome.33 A similarly ambitious $5 million public/private collaboration between the National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR) and NIMH, NICHD, NINDS, NIDCD was recently announced. The NAAR Autism Genome Project is also focused on finding genes associated with the autism spectrum disorders. Using the AGRE data set, researchers at Rutgers University recently discovered a strong association between a gene in the 7q region and autism. Among 167 affected families, children with autism were twice as likely as unaffected children to have inherited a particular variant of a gene called ENGRAILED 2. The team is now attempting to replicate the finding in a much larger sample, using NIMH-funded data sets funded in part by NIMH.34 Continue to Part Two...

In 2005 Autism NT was kindly offered a shopfront office at Nightcliff Shopping Centre by Mr Tony Milhinhos. With the addition of an Autism Advisor position as part of the Helping Children with Autism package a second office was opened in 2009 in Winnellie. (This office is open by appointment. Please contact 0889474800). What is Autism? Autism is a life-long developmental disability that affects the individuals understanding of what he/she sees, hears and senses. This results in problems of social relationships, communication and behaviour. It is generally accepted that autism is an organic brain disorder. What causes Autism? The cause or causes of autism are, as yet, unknown. No factors in the child's psychological or family environment cause autism. The degree of severity of characteristics differs from person to person, but usually include disturbances in the following (including, but not limited to): delay or absence of language development. difficulties understanding speech. difficulties using language. difficulties understanding and using gesture.

Autism is not a disease, but a developmental disorder of brain function. People with classical autism show three types of symptoms: impaired social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication and imagination, and unusual or severely limited activities and interests. Symptoms of autism usually appear during the first three years of childhood and continue throughout life. Although there is no cure, appropriate management may foster relatively normal development and reduce undesirable behaviors. People with autism have a normal life expectancy. Autism affects an estimated two to 10 of every 10,000 people, depending on the diagnostic criteria used. Most estimates that include people with similar disorders are two to three times greater. Autism strikes males about four times as often as females, and has been found throughout the world in people of all racial and social backgrounds. Autism varies a great deal in severity. The most severe cases are marked by extremely repetitive, unusual, self-injurious, and aggressive behavior. This behavior may persist over time and prove very difficult to change, posing a tremendous challenge to those who must live with, treat, and teach these individuals. The mildest forms of autism resemble a personality disorder associated with a perceived learning disability. What are some common signs of autism? The hallmark feature of autism is impaired social interaction. Children with autism may fail to respond to their names and often avoid looking at other people. Such children often have difficulty interpreting tone of voice or facial expressions and do not respond to others' emotions or watch other people's faces for cues about appropriate behavior. They appear unaware of others' feelings toward them and of the negative impact of their behavior on other people. Many children with autism engage in repetitive movements such as rocking and hair twirling, or in self-injurious behavior such as biting or head-banging. They also tend to start speaking later than other children and may refer to themselves by name instead of \"I\" or \"me.\" Some speak in a sing-song voice about a narrow range of favorite topics, with little regard for the interests of the person to whom they are speaking. People with autism often have abnormal responses to sounds, touch, or other sensory stimulation. Many show reduced sensitivity to pain. They also may be extraordinarily sensitive to other sensations. These unusual sensitivities may contribute to behavioral symptoms such as resistance to being cuddled. How is autism diagnosed? Autism is classified as one of the pervasive developmental disorders. Some doctors also use terms such as \"emotionally disturbed\" to describe people with autism. Because it varies widely in its severity and symptoms, autism may go unrecognized, especially in mildly affected individuals or in those with multiple handicaps. Researchers and therapists have developed several sets of diagnostic criteria for autism. Some frequently used criteria include:1 Absence or impairment of imaginative and social play Impaired ability to make friends with peers Impaired ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others Stereotyped, repetitive, or unusual use of language Restricted patterns of interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus Apparently inflexible adherence to specific routines or rituals Preoccupation with parts of objects Children with some symptoms of autism, but not enough to be diagnosed with the classical form of the disorder, are often diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (PDD - NOS). The term Asperger syndrome is sometimes used to describe people with autistic behavior but well-developed language skills. Children who appear normal in their first several years, then lose skills and begin showing autistic behavior, may be diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). Girls with Rett's syndrome, a sex-linked genetic disorder characterized by inadequate brain growth, seizures, and other neurological problems, also may show autistic behavior. PDD - NOS, Asperger syndrome, CDD, and Rett's syndrome are sometimes referred to as autism spectrum disorders. Since hearing problems can be confused with autism, children with delayed speech development should always have their hearing checked. Children sometimes have impaired hearing in addition to autism. About half of people with autism score below 50 on IQ tests, 20 percent score between 50 and 70, and 30 percent score higher than 70. However, estimating IQ in young children with autism is often difficult because problems with language and behavior can interfere with testing. A small percentage of people with autism are savants. These people have limited but extraordinary skills in areas like music, mathematics, drawing, or visualization. What causes autism? Autism has no single cause. Researchers believe several genes, as well as environmental factors such as viruses or chemicals, contribute to the disorder. Studies of people with autism have found abnormalities in several regions of the brain, including the cerebellum, amygdala, hippocampus, septum, and mamillary bodies. Neurons in these regions appear smaller than normal and have stunted nerve fibers, which may interfere with nerve signaling. These abnormalities suggest that autism results from disruption of normal brain development early in fetal development. Other studies suggest that people with autism have abnormalities of serotonin or other signaling molecules in the brain. While these findings are intriguing, they are preliminary and require further study. The early belief that parental practices are responsible for autism has now been disproved. In a minority of cases, disorders such as fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, untreated phenylketonuria (PKU), and congenital rubella cause autistic behavior. Other disorders, including Tourette syndrome, learning disabilities, and attention deficit disorder, often occur with autism but do not cause it. For reasons that are still unclear, about 20 to 30 percent of people with autism also develop epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood. While people with schizophrenia may show some autistic-like behavior, their symptoms usually do not appear until the late teens or early adulthood. Most people with schizophrenia also have hallucinations and delusions, which are not found in autism. What role does genetics play? Recent studies strongly suggest that some people have a genetic predisposition to autism. Scientists estimate that, in families with one autistic child, the risk of having a second child with the disorder is approximately five percent, or one in 20, which is greater than the risk for the general population (see \"What is autism?\"). Researchers are looking for clues about which genes contribute to this increased susceptibility. In some cases, parents and other relatives of an autistic person show mild social, communicative, or repetitive behaviors that allow them to function normally but appear linked to autism. Evidence also suggests that some affective, or emotional, disorders, such as manic depression, occur more frequently than average in families of people with autism. Do symptoms of autism change over time? Symptoms in many children with autism improve with intervention or as the children mature. Some people with autism eventually lead normal or near-normal lives. However, reports from parents of children with autism indicate that some children's language skills regress early in life, usually before age three. This regression often seems linked to epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity. Adolescence also worsens behavior problems in some children with autism, who may become depressed or increasingly unmanageable. Parents should be ready to adjust treatment for their child's changing needs. How can autism be treated? There is no cure for autism at present. Therapies, or interventions, are designed to remedy specific symptoms in each individual. The best-studied therapies include educational/behavioral and medical interventions. Although these interventions do not cure autism, they often bring about substantial improvement. Educational/behavioral interventions: These strategies emphasize highly structured and often intensive skill-oriented training that is tailored to the individual child. Therapists work with children to help them develop social and language skills. Because children learn most effectively and rapidly when very young, this type of therapy should begin as early as possible. Recent evidence suggests that early intervention has a good chance of favorably influencing brain development. Medication: Doctors may prescribe a variety of drugs to reduce self-injurious behavior or other troublesome symptoms of autism, as well as associated conditions such as epilepsy and attention disorders. Most of these drugs affect levels of serotonin or other signaling chemicals in the brain. Many other interventions are available, but few, if any, scientific studies support their use. These therapies remain controversial and may or may not reduce a specific person's symptoms. Parents should use caution before subscribing to any particular treatment. Counseling for the families of people with autism also may assist them in coping with the disorder. What aspects of autism are being studied? The NINDS is the Federal Government's leading supporter of biomedical research on brain and nervous system disorders, including autism. The NINDS conducts research in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland, and supports research at other institutions through grants. NINDS-supported research includes studies aimed at identifying the underlying brain abnormalities of autism through new methods of brain imaging and other innovative techniques. Some scientists hope to identify genes that increase the risk of autism. Others are studying specific aspects of behavior, information processing, and other characteristics to learn precisely how children with autism differ from other people and how these characteristics change over time. The findings may lead to improved strategies for early diagnosis and intervention. Related studies are examining how the cerebellum develops and processes information, how different brain regions function in relation to each other, and how alterations in this relationship during development may result in the signs and symptoms of autism. Researchers hope this research will provide new clues about how autism develops and how brain abnormalities affect behavior. Where can I get more information?

Experts estimate that three to six children out of every 1,000 will have autism. What to Look For: Signs of Autism There are three distinctive signs (behaviors) that parents should be aware of: Difficulties with social interaction Problems with verbal and nonverbal communication Repetitive behaviors or narrow, obsessive interests Signs of autism can appear as early as infancy. The most common sign is unresponsiveness to people or focusing intently on one item for long periods of time. Parents are usually the first to notice signs of autism in their child. Children with autism may appear to develop normally, but they later withdraw and become indifferent to social engagement. Many children suffering from autism have reduced sensitivity to pain. However, they are abnormally sensitive to sensations such as sound and touch, and these sensitivities can contribute to behavioral symptoms such as resistance to being cuddled or hugged. Read more about symptoms Treatment Currently, there is no cure for autism. Treatment for autism includes therapy and behavioral interventions that are designed to remedy specific symptoms, and medications which handle symptoms of anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). depression sensitivity ocd social interaction anxiety www.msdh.state.ms.us/msdhsite/_static/41,0,170,244.html Autism17 http://cadef.org/ The Childhood Autism Foundation is an organization whose primary function is to fund programs which benefit individuals and families affected by autism.

It also found that mothers of young autistic children suffer more depression and stress than mothers without an autistic child. The study included 20 families with a preschooler (ages 2 to 5) diagnosed with autism and a typically developing older sibling (ages 6 to 10). It also included a control group of 23 families that did not have an autistic child. \"Contrary to what has been found by many researchers, we found that older siblings [of children with autism] were pretty well-adjusted, with no significant differences in parent-reported or teacher-reported social skills. These are all typically developing kids,\" Laura Lee McIntyre, director of the school psychology program at the University of Oregon, said in a news release. advertisement But teachers did report that older siblings of children with autism had slightly more fidgeting, movement and attention problems than older siblings in the control group. \"Children with siblings with autism may be experiencing some sub-clinical symptoms of hyperactivity or attention problems,\" McIntyre said. \"Parents didn't report seeing such things at home. Teachers see these children in a more structured environment. Siblings of children with autism may be at heightened risk for developing problems, especially over time.\" These children should be monitored and offered appropriate support. \"Our findings are rather positive overall, but these kids should be on our radar screens,\" McIntyre said. \"These kids may start school OK, at least those from healthy families, but they may demonstrate difficulties over time. However, it has been shown that around 30 percent of siblings of autistic children have some associated difficulties in behavior, learning or development.\" The findings that mothers of autistic children experience higher rates of stress and depression was no surprise because it's been well- documented, McIntyre said. The study appears in the March issue of the journal Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities. More information The Autism Society of America has more about sibling issues.

Many people have written to ask us: what is autism in India like ? Does it look the same as autism in other places? What kind of services are available? What do families do? Is the prevalence the same? These are all very intriguing and important questions. Some of these we can answer from our experience working with hundreds of families-- for example, we have a good idea of what the experience of autism is like for Indian families. However, without empirical research, there are many questions about autism in India (and other places in the world) that must remain unanswered. Recent estimates have placed the prevalence of autism in the U.S. at approximately 1 in 150 people. At India s current population, this means there are more than 2 million autistic persons in the country. Of course, this estimate assumes that there are no significant variations in this rate worldwide, which is a question that has not yet been addressed by epidemiologists outside the West. While the disorder is not rare, the majority of autistic people in India have not been diagnosed and do not receive the services they need. This problem occurs in many countries, but is especially true in India where there is a tremendous lack of awareness and misunderstanding about autism among the medical professionals, who may either misdiagnose or under diagnose the condition. One of the major difficulties faced by parents of children with autism in India is obtaining an accurate diagnosis. A parent may take their child to a paediatrician only to be reassured that their child is just slow. Unsatisfied, they may visit a psychologist, to be told their child is mentally subnormal. Convinced that their child does not fit the typical picture of mental retardation, they may visit a psychiatrist, to be told that their child has attention deficit disorder, and must be put on medication to control hyperactivity. After months of sedation and unsatisfactory progress, they may again begin a cycle of searching for the correct name for their child s problem.Some doctors may feel that nothing can be gained by a diagnosis of autism if the services are not there; yet, as more children are diagnosed as autistic and more awareness of the disorder spreads, there will be a demand for services. Schools will be forced to educate themselves if they find that more of the population they serve is autistic.

Do you remember how those words took your breath away, made your heart break? You d seen the symptoms for a while, but now, there was no doubt. What s the cure for it, were the next words you uttered after the bad news. There is no cure, said the doctor. The doctor is right about there being no cure, at least not by modern medicine. I d argue that this condition arises largely as a result of the actions of modern medicine and the effects of environmental toxins. These, in my view, are the primary culprits in causing autism and PDD, ADD, and ADHD. There are Thousands of Treatment Options, but You Should Know that Modern Medicine Contributes in Creating This Condition If this is the case, Modern Medicine can only give you more of the same and that won t help. After the diagnosis, the family works mostly with their physician, but many go out into the web and here they find thousands of treatment options. How can one make a choice? There is a ton of mainstream and alternative information for dealing with developmental delays. Most of the large support groups are committed to the model of health care provided by Modern Medicine. Drugs become the primary therapy. If you re dissatisfied with that option, where can you turn to get sound advice about alternative methods? It s important to understand that most children diagnosed with these conditions don t receive the diagnosis before they re 12 months old. Many children, in fact, were developing normally previous to the diagnosis. Many Parents Observed that Their Child Showed Signs of the Condition after an Anti-biotic Treatment or a Vaccination Many parents noticed a gradual breakdown after repeated vaccinations. The medical community rigorously denies any connection to vaccines. No matter, many parents just cannot accept the idea that this condition is incurable and they begin an arduous journey using various treatment strategies. These include those offered by Modern Medicine, few as they are. Others venture outside the mainstream into the world of alternative theories. They struggle to cope. In the alternative arena, the options and opinions are unlimited and parents with no training or background in these subjects start gathering information about what to do. They have no reliable guidance and confusion becomes the order of the day. Most often they turn to other parents that they find on the Internet who are struggling just as they are. There s Only One Solution: Restore Normal Function to Wipe Out Autism My work is all about strengthening people and ending the confusion. Throughout my own life, I ve worked with most alternative treatments, such as vitamins: you name it I ve done it. I found out early in my life that Modern Medicine has few options for the chronic diseases of our times. Sure, they re great in emergency care, but relatively useless for conditions such as autism. My forty-five year search has turned up some extraordinarily powerful methods to strengthen and increase healing power in people who become diseased. Because of my vast experience, I act as a guide for parents. I save people from wasting time going down the wrong road. You don t have one second to waste in fighting against autism.

With your support, we will be able to shed heartbreak and continue to put a smile on his face. Currently no province has funding available for autism treatment that is covered under our health plan. This is not acceptable and I urge you to contact your local MP and urge them to take a stand with you. OUR CHILDREN are worth standing up for and our members of parliament need to stand with us and FUND AUTISM TREATMENT NOW.. Q. How many children are affected by autism? A. The latest research suggests that up to 1 in 150 children will be affected by one of the disorders associated with autism. More children are affected by autism than by MS, Down's syndrome or childhood cancer combined and is the least funded..... Return to top Q. What does autism do to a child? A. It starts early on, as parents realize that their children aren't developing normal communication and interaction skills. Communication can become impossible. Some children with autism injure themselves. It takes special treatments, and special people, to make the world a brighter place for the children with autism and their families. Return to top What is autism? Autism is a brain disorder that affects development. People who have autism have trouble communicating and interacting with other people. A child who has autism may seem very withdrawn, may not make eye contact with people, may not talk or play the way other children do or may repeat certain motions and behaviors over and over again. Signs of autism can vary from person to person. They can also be worse in some people than in others. People can be said to have low-functioning autism or high-functioning autism, depending upon the severity of their symptoms and the results of an IQ (intelligence) test. High-functioning autism describes autism with less severe symptoms, while low-functioning autism describes autism with more severe symptoms. Some of the more common signs are listed in the box below. Return to top Common Signs of Autism - Avoids cuddling or making eye contact. - Does not respond to voices or other sounds. - Does not respond to his or her name. - Does not talk or does not use language properly. - Rocks back and forth, spins or bangs his or her head. - Stares at parts of an object, such as the wheels of a toy car. - Does not understand hand gestures or body language. - Does not pretend or play make-believe games. - Is very concerned with order, routine or ritual and becomes upset if routine is disturbed or changed. - Has a flat facial expression or uses a monotone voice. - Injures himself or herself or is unafraid of danger. Return to top What causes autism? Doctors aren't sure what causes autism. Some studies have shown that the cause is genetic (runs in families). Certain medical problems or something in your child's surroundings may also play a role. In many cases, the cause of a child's autism is never known. Boys are more likely than girls to have autism. As doctors continue to study autism, they may learn more about what causes it. Return to top Did you know - 1 in 150 children is diagnosed with autism. - 1 in 94 boys is on the autism spectrum. - 67 children are diagnosed per day. - A new case is diagnosed almost every 20 minutes. - More children will be diagnosed with autism this year than with AIDS, diabetes cancer combined. - Autism is the fastest-growing serious developmental disability in the U.S. - Autism costs the nation over $35 billion per year, a figure expected to significantly increase in the next decade. - Autism receives less than 5% of the research funding of many less prevalent childhood diseases. - Boys are four times more likely than girls to have autism. - There is no medical detection or cure for autism. Return to top How is autism diagnosed? There is no lab test that can detect autism. Autism is often diagnosed when a baby or toddler doesn't behave as expected for his or her age. If your doctor thinks your child has autism, he or she will probably suggest that your child see a child psychiatrist or other specialist. The specialist will probably test your child to see if he or she shows signs of autism. Return to top If my child has autism, does it mean that he or she is mentally retarded? Many children with autism are also mentally retarded, but others are not. It can be hard to test autistic children because they do not respond to questions in the same way other children do. An autism expert can give your child special tests that will tell you more about his or her condition. Some autistic children have special skills, such as the ability to do complex math problems in their heads. However, abilities like these are very rare. Return to top My baby seemed fine. Why does he or she seem to have autism now? We don't know why this happens, but approximately 20% of children with autism seem to develop normally for the first 1 to 2 years. Then, these babies experience what doctors call a regression. This means that they lose abilities that they had before, such as the ability to talk. Are there more cases of autism now than there used to be? More children are being diagnosed with autism. However, we're not sure if this really means that more children have autism. It may mean that parents, teachers and doctors are becoming better at recognizing the signs of autism Return to top How is autism treated? Several treatments for autism are available. Research has shown that very intense behavior and language therapy may help some children. There is no medicine that treats autism itself, but medicine may help with some of the symptoms of autism, such as aggressive behavior or sleeplessness. Talk to your doctor about what kind of treatment is best for your child. Children don't outgrow autism, and it cannot be cured. With therapy, some children may improve as they mature. The individual child's language skills and overall intellectual level may help predict what will happen with his of her case of autism. Return to top My baby seemed fine. Why does he or she seem to have autism now? We don't know why this happens, but approximately 20% of children with autism seem to develop normally for the first 1 to 2 years.

Vickery 2007 SuperNutrient Corporation Autistic children have been identified with high toxic metal levels, low levels of metallothionein (MT), metallothionein (MT) systems that don t work, low levels of glutathione and zinc, low levels of sulfur and malfunctioning digestive systems (including leaky gut and food allergies). Various different theories for the cause of these malfunctions are proposed: genetic predisposition, nutritional deficiencies in pregnancy or the toxic effects of infant immunizations. However this condition came about, the challenge remains to somehow enable these impaired systems to function normally. Many recent studies have confirmed that all types of autism involve a malfunction in the part of the body s system that deals with metal regulation. Certain metals such as iron, zinc and copper, are essential to the body, others such as cadmium, mercury, aluminum and lead are toxic. Too much or too little of any metal in the body will have a disrupting effect on the system. Not everything is understood about metal metabolism, but more studies are being done all the time that show the body s use of certain metals to have significant effects on the health of the entire system. Recent autism studies have focused on a certain metal binding protein, metallothionein, (MT) which occurs in critically low levels in autistic children. MT has been shown to be heavily involved in the metal regulation of zinc and copper as well as the chelation of toxic metals such as cadmuim, mercury and lead. MT proteins also assist in immune function, neuronal development, heart protective functions, brain cell protective functions, liver cell proliferation and the breakdown of casein and gluten in the small intestine. A huge component of the MT metal regulating system is the essential amino acid, cysteine. The entire MT is composed of sulfur and protein. One of the problems identified with autism is a digestive system that cannot fully break down all protein into its basic components, the amino acids; in turn, many necessary amino acids are unavailable to make systemic proteins such as MT. Remember also that essential amino acids cannot be made by the body, but must be obtained in the diet. MT manufacture requires sufficient methionine (also a sulfur containing amino acid). Exactly half of these are essential amino acids, and one third of the total number of amino acids is made up of the sulfur rich cysteine. Both glutathione and MT contain large amounts of sulfur. Sulfur is an essential mineral (meaning that it must be acquired through diet) that is necessary for many systemic functions. Sulfur is necessary for many enzyme reactions as well as modulation of the nervous system, maintenance and protection of the connective tissues, and support of liver detoxification. In order for the MT system to work optimally, glutathione (a sulfur rich tripeptide) must be present in both a reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) state. A well balanced redox ratio is important. For instance, in the case of the body being under high levels of oxidative stress, as is suspected in many autism cases, the GSSG levels rise causing a condition where too much zinc is released from the MT. The effect is the over inhibition of certain processes such as cellular respiration and the inhibition of certain enzymes in energy metabolism. Studies have shown that patients with depression, bipolar disorder, Parkinson s disease, Alzheimers, and autism are severely deficient in zinc. In a healthy system, zinc is the primary metal that is bound and released by MT. In a system challenged by too much copper, cadmium, mercury or lead, these metals will compete for the MT binding sites. Many of the current therapies for autistic children involve amino acid and glutathione supplementation. The amino acid supplementation is usually protein specific; the 14 different amino acids in MT along with GSH are given orally to the children. The problem with oral GSH supplementation is that reduced glutathione (GSH) has a very high redox potential; somewhere between the mouth and the specific site in the body where GSH is needed, it will oxidize leaving GSSG which is not helpful unless it is in proper ratio to GSH. Alpha lipoic acid is a more effective way to get the body to produce glutathione but it tends to cause an overgrowth of unfriendly bacteria in the gut. Glutathione and MT are systemic proteins and the best way to get the body to manufacture these is to enable it to fully digest its food, then it will create the proteins it needs, where it needs them, when it needs them. Autistic people also show low levels of secretin and one of the current popular theories is that orally administering this hormone could clear up the poor digestion issues that are characteristic of autism. The digestive system is supposed to secrete this hormone when the stomach empties. It helps the stomach to produce digestive enzyme (pepsin), the pancreas to produce alkaline digestive fluids, and the liver to produce bile. However, there has only been one very small study (three children) demonstrating the successful use of this hormone with autism and it is unknown whether supplementation of this hormone over long periods of time would be harmful to the body. Could it not be possible that the main problem in autism is a critical deficiency of systemic protein and sulfur in general? Secretin is a systemic protein. It is a polypeptide consisting of 27 amino acids. MT is a low molecular weight protein consisting of 61 amino acids, glutathione is a tripeptide of three amino acids, and sulfur is an essential mineral. In order for the proper components to be available for systemic proteins such as MT, glutathione and secretin, dietary protein must be completely broken down into amino acids. If this does not happen, the partially broken down proteins will simply irritate the system resulting in conditions such as diarrhea and allergic responses such as rashes, inflammation, and mood disorders. Partially broken down protein is not the same as amino acids and the body will not use it to make systemic protein. A body that cannot properly break down food will become protein deficient. If this protein deficiency continues then systemic malfunction will eventually occur. If food can be fully broken down then the systemic proteins will be available to create and support systemic proteins of all sorts. If the body is not digesting its dietary protein it is because the pancreas is not producing the necessary digestive enzymes Dr. Brice Vickery addressed this problem in the early 1980 s when he found that all his patients with degenerative disk disease were also deficient in systemic protein and sulfur. Years of testing produced a blend of essential amino acids that actually enable the pancreas to produce the enzymes to break dietary protein into amino acids. These amino acids then recombine into systemic proteins that not only rebuild damaged spinal disks, but when used along with the Vickery Protocol have proven to allow the body to fix many other problems as well, such as metal toxicity. Vickery added extra organic sulfur and molybdenum to his blend to support phase II liver detox pathways, helping the body to flush toxins such as heavy metals out of the system. At http://www.supernutrient.com , posted charts show how quickly Platinum Plus Essential Amino Acids enable the system to completely flush mercury, lead, and aluminum from the body. Use of the Vickery Protocol along with Platinum Plus will cause GSH levels to rise dramatically and all sorts of systemic proteins will become available to the system, including immune system proteins like MT and hormones like secretin. genetic brain genetic depression Parkinson GSH Brice E.

Autism is a lifelong, pervasive developmental disorder that affects the functioning of the brain. It is actually not one disorder, but a group of disorders, known as the autism spectrum, that affect a child\ufffds social interaction, communication, and behavior. Children with autism also may exhibit hypo- or hyper-sensitivity to sensory stimuli and/or problems with fine and gross motor skills. What is the autism spectrum? The autism spectrum is a group of five disorders: \ufffd Autistic Disorder Disorder \ufffd Asperger\ufffds Disorder For more information on the individual disorders on the spectrum, visit http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/overview_diagnostic_criteria.htm#Childhood What deficits in social interaction occur in autism? Deficits in social interaction may include: \ufffd Poor eye contact \ufffd Difficulty using and recognizing facial expressions, gestures, nonverbal cues \ufffd Difficulty establishing or maintaining peer relationships \ufffd Lack of spontaneous sharing of enjoyment or interest with another person \ufffd Preference to be alone What deficits in communication occur in autism? Deficits in communication may include: \ufffd Limited, delayed, or absent speech \ufffd Problems with personal pronouns \ufffd Stereotypic/repetitive use of language (e.g. echolalia) or idiosyncratic language \ufffd Poor conversational skills \ufffd Literal interpretation of language \ufffd Lack of imaginative or imitative play What behavioral characteristics are common in autism? Behavioral characteristics range widely and may include: \ufffd persistent preoccupation with or attachment to unusual objects or topics of interest \ufffd preoccupation with parts of objects \ufffd repetitive motor movements, such as body rocking, spinning, hand flapping or finger flicking \ufffd inflexible adherence to routines or rituals \ufffd transition \ufffd hyperactivity and/or impulsivity \ufffd aggression, self-injury, and/or tantrums Are there any physical characteristics associated with autism? No. There is no was to tell by a person\ufffds physical appearance that he or she may have an autism spectrum disorder. Do people with autism have normal life expectancies? Yes. With the exception of Rett\ufffds disorder, which is sometimes associated with premature death, life expectancy for individuals with autism spectrum disorder is normal. What causes autism? The cause of autism is not currently known. Genetic factors have been identified as playing a role, but cannot account for all cases. Some environmental factors likely contribute as well. Because autism is diagnosed clinically, and not through a medical test, it is likely that multiple causes exist. For more information on current research, click here. How prevalent is autism? The CDC estimates that autism occurs in 1 of every 150 individuals. Is autism more common in specific groups? Autism is approximately four times more common in boys than in girls. There are no known differences in prevalence between racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups.

The pathology underlying the condition is based in the brain, although the precise disease mechanism behind ASD has yet to be described. ASDs are typically diagnosed in early childhood with functional impairment persisting throughout life. What specific diagnoses are considered Autism Spectrum Disorders? ASDs include a number of specific diagnoses. Autistic Disorder (AD) is the best-described and most severe of these. Others include Asperger Syndrome, Pervasive Developmental Disability \ufffd Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), Rett\ufffds Syndrome, and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. The general term \ufffdautism\ufffd is often used either specifically to refer to AD or more generally to refer to ASD. Another term that is often used synonomously with ASD is Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). This term is the diagnostic category heading under which the five specific diagnoses mentioned above are listed. We prefer ASD over PDD because it emphasizes the common \ufffdautism-like\ufffd features of all of these specific diagnoses and, at the same time reflects the wide variation in the manner and severity that individuals are affected. What are the symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders?The main symptoms of ASD are particular social and language problems. Often, but not always, children with ASDs will have delays developing spoken language. Some individuals with ASD remain non-verbal throughout their life. Currently, language delays are the symptom that most commonly captures the attention of parents or pediatricians and, consequently, children are infrequently diagnosed before the age of 3 or 4 years. However, problems in other social and communication behaviors, such as imitation and use of gestures, may hold the key to being able to recognize the behavioral signs of ASD at earlier ages. The specialized interests that develop in persons with ASD can be quite varied. In young children this can first appear as constant lining up of, rather than playing with, toys or obsessive watching and re-watching of segments of a particular video/DVD. Older, verbal children with ASD may show a strong tendency to talk, regardless of the setting or context, about particular topics of interest. There are no definitive biologic signs or symptoms of ASD and it is diagnosed only based on careful observation/assessment of behavior and knowledge of the individual\ufffds developmental history. There is no medical test that can diagnose ASD. Children with ASD often have other associated problems that can include, sensory impairment, gastrointestinal problems, sleep disturbances, and seizure disorders, as well as often appearing to have cognitive impairment. At the same time, they may also show special skills in certain areas like drawing, math, music, or memory. It is unclear to what extent these problems or skills are caused by the same process that leads to ASD.What is the difference between Asperger Syndrome and PDD-NOS? There is still much confusion about the difference between Asperger Syndrome and PDD NOS. Individuals with both of these diagnoses are similar in that they do not have sufficient or severe enough impairment in each of the characteristic ASD areas (social, communication, specialized interests) to warrant an autistic disorder diagnosis. Children with Asperger Syndrome, however, typically do not have language delays and might read precociously or have extraordinarily rich vocabularies for their age. However, these children still struggle with the social aspects of language and nonverbal communication and can have all the other attendent problems of ASD. Children with Asperger Syndrome have normal or above normal IQ \ufffd but so too do many children with PDD NOS (although these children have typically had some language delay). Children with ASD who have normal to above normal IQ (which includes those with Asperger Syndrome, many with PDD NOS, and some with autistic disorder) and whose behaviors are less of an impediment in their daily activities are often referred to as having \ufffdHigh Functioning Autism.\ufffd While much time and effort can be spent sorting through the criteria for these different labels, it is still not clear to what extent these distinctions reflect important differences in the causes behind, or the interventions best suited for, the underlying disorder.Who is affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders? ASD affects persons of any race, socioeconomic status, and gender, although it is more prevalent in boys than in girls \ufffd for example, there are 4 boys for every 1 girl with autistic disorder.How common are Autism Spectrum Disorders?Better data are available on the prevalence of autistic disorder than other ASDs, or ASDs overall. That said, there are still many challenges to accurately measuring the prevalence of autistic disorder in populations. Most of the autistic disorder prevalence estimates coming from recent studies (those completed in the mid-to-late 1990s) fall between 15 and 30 per 10,000. Recent estimates for all ASDs combined tend to fall between 20 and 80 per 10,000. Most of these studies were more likely to be affected by challenges that would lead to under-, rather than over-estimation, of prevalence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes on its autism resource page, a prevalence estimate of 3-7 cases of ASDs per 1,000 children.Is the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders increasing? Unquestionably, there are more children being diagnosed with ASD today than ever before. This, in and of itself, presents a major public health challenge. It is, however, very difficult to determine why this is occurring. We know that there have been changes in diagnostic criteria and the manner and frequency with which criteria are applied. Consequently, there is no way of accurately determining how much of the increase in ASD prevalence seen over the last decade is attributable to diagnostic issues and how much is attributable to a real increase in risk.What causes Autism Spectrum Disorders?At present, we do not know exactly what causes ASD. It is certain that genetics plays a large role. However, we do not know what proportion of ASD cases have some inherited susceptibility nor do we know how large a proportion of autism cases are entirely caused by inherited genetic factors. Further, while genetic risk factors are important, this does not rule out a potential major role for non-heritable risk factors. That said, there is little conclusive evidence supporting a prominent role for any particular non-genetic risk factor. However, part of the reason why no other risk factors have been identified may be that genetic and non-genetic factors need to be studied together in order to get a clear picture. In other words, only when studying ASD cases with a certain genetic background may we be able to see that a particular non-genetic trigger was important. Studies like this are only just now getting underway.Do vaccines cause Autism Spectrum Disorders? There has been much recent discussion over a potential link between vaccines and ASD. Concern has been expressed over the MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) vaccine and vaccines that contain a preservative, thimerosal (which contains a form of mercury.) A number of epidemiologic studies of MMR vaccination and ASD have now been completed with none finding evidence of a link between MMR vaccination and ASD.Epidemiologic data has recently become available on the potential association between thimerosal and autism. These data do not support an association. While it appears that there is no link between thimerosal exposure and autism risk at the population level, there may still be small groups of individuals susceptible to neurodevelopmental effects of low-dose mercury. Research is underway exploring the possible mechanisms.In sum, the available epidemiologic data suggest no link between childhood vaccination and autism - these data offer no reason why immunization should be avoided or postponed.How long have Autism Spectrum Disorders existed? Dr. Leo Kanner, a physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital, published the first paper describing autism in 1943. At virtually the same time, an Austrian psychologist, Hans Asperger, described a similar group of patients. Although ASD has been recognized as a medical condition only in modern times, there are many historical accounts pointing to the existence of autism well before the 20th century.Is there a cure for Autism Spectrum Disorders? There is no known cure for autism. However, early behavioral-based interventions can help children to better develop the communication and social skills needed to improve their functional abilities. Although a number of different specific behavioral and educational techniques are currently used as part of interventions for individual children with autism, these techniques are grounded in a vast body of research based on a common set of behavioral and learning principles. Early intervention programs generally emphasize attending to social stimuli, imitation skills, language comprehension and usage, appropriate play skills, and social interaction. For certain subgroups of children with ASD, drug therapy may be available that reduce problematic behaviors. However, of the numerous other interventions that have been proposed over the years, none have been proven effective. pointing genetic brain genetic Autism Spectrum Disorders gastrointestinal Asperger Syndrome PDD ASD childhood disintegrative disorder social interaction MMR sleep Leo Kanner cognitive ASDs Pervasive Developmental Disorders Hans Asperger imitation Johns Hopkins Hospital Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PDD-NOS IQ Austrian ASDs Rett\ufffds Syndrome AD Pervasive Developmental Disability \ufffd Not \ufffdautism-like\ufffd \ufffdHigh Functioning Autism.\ufffd www.jhsph.edu/cadde/Facts/autism.html diagnoses Autism180 http://www.generationrescue.org/autism-facts-statistics.html 1 in 91 children (formally 1 in 150 up until 2009 and 1 in 10,000 in the early 1990s) 4:1 ratio of boys to girls 1 in 58 boys Fastest growing developmental disability More than 100 billion in estimated annual costs In ten years the annual costs are projected at 200-400 billion.

Individuals with autism also have repetitive behaviors and may have poor sensory integration. Autism affects one in 150 kids according to the Centers for Disease Control (Kalb 2008). According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Education and other governmental agencies (ASA, 2006), autism is growing at a startling rate of 10-17 percent per year. At this rate, ASA estimates that the prevalence of autism could reach 4 million Americans in the next decade. Autism falls under the umbrella of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) synonymous with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). Other disorders categorized under ASD or PDD are Asperger\ufffds Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD), Rett's Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). Autism is a spectrum disorder because no two people with autism are alike. The symptoms and characteristics of individual\ufffds with autism can occur in any combination and vary widely from mild to severe (Autism Society of America, 2005).

Sensory Integration Overly sensitive to certain sensor stimuli (e.g. covering ears and screaming when they hear thunder) Seemingly oblivious to some sensory input (e.g. does not notice if they are too hot or too cold) Poor fine and gross-motor skills. Not all individuals diagnosed with autism will display each characteristic. Additionally, the severity of each characteristic will vary from individual to individual The characteristics for diagnosis of autism are found in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorder (DSM \ufffdIV). Causes of Autism It was once held that autism was a psychological disorder caused by traumatic experiences that forced a child to retreat into a world of fantasy (Encarta, 2005). They believed it was an emotional illness caused by \"refrigerator mothers\" or emotionally unattached parents. This belief is credited to Bruno Bethleheim (Dyches, et. al., 2001). In 1964, Bernard Rimland, a psychologist and father of a son with autism, wrote the book Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implication for a Neural Theory of Behavior. In the book he made the case that autism is not an emotional illness but a biological disorder. The book is credited with changing the way autism was perceived (Cure Autism Now, 2005). Today it is widely believed that autism is the result of \"abnormalities in brain structure or function\" (Autism Society of America, 2005). Researchers may have narrowed this down to the amygdala - a part of the brain involved in emotional control.[[1]] What is not know is the underlying cause(s) of the abnormalities. There are several theories regarding the causes from genetics to environmental factors such as exposure to certain chemicals. Research in the area of genetics, developmental neurobiology, neuropsychology and brain imaging are investigating the causes as well as the development of individuals with autism and much is still being learned about the disorder (NIMH, 2005). Another theory is that the cause of autism is related to a mercury compound used as a preservative in some childhood vaccines. Some people refuse to believe the vaccines have anything to do with the increased rate of autism. Thimersal has now been banned by most states. If it was a cause we should start to see a decline in the number of cases. Recently a major study linking autism to vaccines was was retracted by the British medical publication The Lancet. While stopping short of refuting the link between vaccines and autism, the methodology of the study was found to be seriously flawed. Application in classrooms and similar settings Children with autism fall under the mandates of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which stipulates public schools must provide children a free, appropriate education to children with disabilities. The education must also meet their unique needs. It further requires that children with disabilities be placed in the \ufffdleast restrictive environment? meaning that children with disabilities be placed in the regular classroom setting to the extent that it is possible. This impact of IDEA is that schools must provide instruction and curriculum suited to the special communicative, social, sensory and behavior needs of students with autism. This will most likely require a coordination of services among several individuals for example a special education teacher, speech and language therapist, social worker or school counselor, occupational and/or physical therapist and regular classroom teacher. Strategies used to teach children with autism Many therapies and teaching strategies have been designed to meet the unique learning needs of children with autism. Most of the strategies described below have been research. However, the research is sometimes limited to a few studies and the number of children in each study is fairly small, usually less than 10 children. Additionally, because autism varies from child to child, a strategy that works for some children with autism might not work for all children with autism. Researchers also recommend considering several factors before implementing any strategy (Terpstra, et al., 2002, p. 3). Developmental level of the child Language abilities of the child Motivational techniques The type of setting The skills to be taught Pictorial or textual cues- These have been used to help children with autism communicate but also to keep children on a schedule, to provide instructions on how to complete an activity and to prompt appropriate behaviors. For example a picture cue with the text quiet voice may prompt a child to work quietly. In most instances picture cues are taught and reinforced (Bakken Brock, 2001). Augmented and Alternative Communication - This is a communication system for individuals who have little or not speech. Speech is replaced or augmented with such methods as sign language, gestures and body language, electronic voice output machine (VOCA), photographs or picture books (PECS), line drawings on a communication board, handwriting or miniature objects that denotes the real object (Mirenda, 2001). Computer assisted instruction (CAI) - A skill is reinforced or taught with a computer program (Coleman-Martin, et al., 2005). Social Stories- This technique was developed by Carol Gray and involves creating a story that describes the \ufffdindividual steps of a social situation? in order to teach the appropriate social skills and behaviors. For example, a social story may describe how to walk in a line in the hallway (The Gray Center, 2005). Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) - \ufffdApplied Behavior Analysis is the use of behavioral methods to measure behavior, teach functional skills, and evaluate progress? (Autistic Spectrum Therapies, 2005). Pivotal Response Training (PRT) - This is technique incorporates principles of ABA. It targets motivation because it seems to be pivotal and lots of behaviors can be modified at a time. The intervention is also used in a natural setting . (Autistic Spectrum Therapies, 2005). Critics and their rationale The medical definition of autism is a deficit model because autism is diagnosed as an impairment in social skills and communication. Also there is a notion that the symptoms of autism need to be cured. However, there is an alternative view that autism is not disorder but merely a different way of experiencing the world. Jane Meyerding, an individual with Asperger\ufffds, describes it as being \ufffddifferent brained? (Meyerding, 2005) It has been noted that individuals with autism have various strengths such as good rote memory skills, remembers information for a long time, good at rule governed abstract thought (such as math, engineering and computer science), visual thinkers, take in chunks of information quickly, and concentrate on narrow topics of interest (Autism Association of NSW, 2005). Individuals with autism advocate \ufffdautistic people have characteristically autistic styles of relating to others, which should be respected and appreciated rather than modified to make them \"fit in? (Autism Network International, 2005). Diversity considerations When Leo Kanner first described autism in 1943 he originally believed there might be a link between parental characteristics and children with autism. He had observed that all the parents were intelligent, professionals with high levels of education. Today it is commonly held that autism occurs across racial, ethnic, economic and social boundaries (Dyches, et al., 2001). Though some researchers challenge this notion and have reported \ufffdlow incidence of autism in many Latin American countries and in several developing countries such as Kenya, India, and Hungary (Dyches, et al, 2001, p. 154). There is very little research on multicultural issues and autism. It is important though that teachers consider multicultural issues when teaching students with autism for several reasons Possibility of misclassification because cultural behaviors are misinterpreted Cultural differences in the appraisal of autism (e.g. a Native American family may focus on what the child with autism is able to do rather than what the child is unable to do) Being able to honor the child\ufffds culture while teaching the child how to function in the dominant culture (Dyches, et al, 2001). Signed \"life experiences\", testimonies and stories I work at a school for students that have a primary disability of Mental Retardation but many of them also have secondary disability of autism. I feel that some of my students truly have autism which in turn brings their IQ score into the level of mental retardation because of their inability to express themselves or recall information needed to test their IQ. Many of my students, given different means of communication and allowed to use different strategies are able to function closer to their age equivalent peers. My goal is to use my graduate program based in technology to help me obtain the best from my students with disabilities, especially autism. -J. Melhouse (December 2008) This fall will be my first true experience with teaching students with autism. As of right now, I have two incoming Kindergarteners with autism. Though I am nervous and hope that I will serve their needs and teach them in a manner that is sensitive to those needs, I am quite excited about having them in my class. Most exciting is the fact that having these two students in my class is allowing me for summer writing and professional development opportunities with which I would not normally have been privilege. Right now, I am in the process of meeting with the special education teacher who also serves as their IEP case manager. These meetings have been extremely helpful in allowing me to delve into the subject of autism and the types of instructional strategies that work best with these two children. I have been able to meet with past teachers to discuss learning and behavior goals and strategies; to review the progress that has been made in terms of their IEP goals and where to go next; as well as given literature and video on such topics as using visual schedules and PECS to condition behaviors and learning. What is quite sad is that I would not have had these learning opportunities and collaboration meetings had I not been assigned these two students. I feel that all teachers would benefit from these learning opportunities and wonder why all classroom teachers are not given the opportunity to participate. -D. Jacob (June 2006). I have taught quite a few students with autism or some sort of autistic spectrum disorder. Most of these students have been challenging, but very rewarding. Being a music teacher, I get to see them in ways that not all teachers get to experience. Most autistic children love music and you can get them to interact in ways that traditional class room tactics can not. They also love to discuss specific topics and can become obsessive if not watched. The best way to handle this is to have a code word that only you two know what it means. One boy that I had was obsessed with 80's rock bands and so I would give him the opportunity to \"lecture\" the class on a specific band, but when he would start to go over board, I would quietly say \"nice job\" which was our code word for that is enough. It was our way of helping him to understand boundaries, which are not very evident to people with autism. A. Dorough I have taught a student with autism and try to keep the class as predictable as possible. I know that the student really doesn\ufffdt like change so I keep everything a routine as possible. When he gets over stressed, he like to flip through pages of a book and I let him to that when he needs to get himself calmed down. P Graham I teach a student with Asperger\ufffds syndrome (which from what I understand is a form of Autism). At any rate, many of the items you say here I can totally sympathize with. This young man scared all of the teachers when he came to be with us. He would have run roughshod over us if we had used traditional methods of discipline with him. However, using some alternative strategies and having a great deal of patience, we had a very successful year with him. The thing I found most helpful was that the other students were aware of his condition and were helpful in our dealing with him. As opposed to what we thought going into the year, they (the other students) did not question our discipline methods when he (the student with Asperger\ufffds) was given extra latitude that they were not privy to. Nick Chatterton As stated above, autistic students have difficulty interpreting facial cues or body language. This can be especially difficult when viewing a film in class, during which a student with autism may be unable to determine significant character development or emotional reactions, whereas he/she may have picked up on these cues if reading these in text. Giving a written summary of the scenes to these students may help them to properly interpret the movie. Daniel Kuglich I have had two experiences with students who have either had autism or Asperger's. These experiences have taught me that these children need consistency and predictability in the classroom routines. When the routines change without warning, it can possibly present great amounts of stress for the child. For example, one of my students would get very anxious and worried about fire and tornado drills. One of the things that frightened this child was the alarms that went off. Even though I would warn the child when we might have a drill, the sudden noise would cause him great distress. Prior to the drill and after it, we would talk about what we would do/did and how everything ended up to be fine. However, it was the suddenness of the situation and the quick response that he could not emotionally deal with. -Tricia Pearl This past school year I had the privilege of teaching a student who was labeled high functioning autistic. Now I was not informed of this until a couple of days before the school year started. His parents brought him in to meet me while I was decorating bulleting boards, and he made quite an impression on me in the first five minutes. I was often frustrated with my inability to read this students supposedly obvious autistic cues throughout the year, but his sense of humor kept all of us going and hoping to understand him more. The interesting thing about this student is that he could go through the entire list of behaviors in one afternoon, so there was no doubt that the diagnosis fit. I have learned quite a bit about inclusion and autism this school year and I hope to continue learning more. -Candace Hatchett I haven't had much experience with students with autism, but I've noticed so far, that all 3 have turned out to be brass players. When recruiting beginning band students, every student gets an opportunity to explore and play 3 instruments: one brass, one woodwind, and another of their choosing. Each student has had no interest in percussion and have not liked reed instruments due to texture. This was quite interesting to me, and I wonder if other students with autism will have a tendency towards brass...or if this was merely coincidental. -S.Scott This year I have had the oppotunity to work with an autistic student in my physical education class. I am always amazed at how stressed the child gets regarding change. He is very concerned about the color gymsuit he gets to wear and the team he is playing on. When he is forced to changed something about his routine, he asks many questions and repeats over and over the new directions he is given. I have been lucky tha the has adapted to the change so well. I have really enjoyed working with him this year. - Amy Neighbors As a principal of a catholic school, I have a parent who has 2 children in my school and her third child is autistic and wants to come to school with his brothers. I have spent a great deal of time with this family working on ways to get him to be able to come to my school. The biggest hurdle we have now is trying to the school district to fund a part time aide for him. He is a very smart child and he can hold conversations and he is very advanced on the computer and the computer programs we have he can understand and work on. I know in the next year or two I will have him at my school and between now and then I am going to continue my research on how to best prepare the teachers,students, and parents in the best way to work with this young man. Sue Whisson This year I have had the opportunity to have a student with autism in my class. This student enjoys his daily routines and can be upset when the class deviates from that routine. When he is in his routine he produces quality work and participates in class. His peers enjoy his company and when he is absent(which doesn't happen frequently)they are concerned about him. -R. Folkens I am teaching an 8th grade autism student who I have had for three years now. I started working with him in 6th grade. He has always been very quiet, but he has always been an extreme pleasure to work with in class. He is extremely bright and intelligent. I have watched him grow so much through these three years. In 6th grade, he would barely talk to anyone and you would never see him make any physical contact with anyone. When he came out on the playground, he would immediately go over to the wall of the school and be by himself. I had a hard time with this because he was such a great kid. I wanted everyone to experience the kindness from this boy, but I let him do as he pleased. I would always go and talk to him. He knew that I cared. During his seventh grade year, he didn't change much other than his height. He still stayed to himself and didn't talk to many people. However, this year there has been a total change in this young man. I see him playing on the playground with other students. He seems to really enjoy himself with other students now. Another great change is that he now comes up to me to give me a hug, give me a handshake, or tell me a joke. I just love it because he just doesn't seem to close himself off as much as he used to. His parents have told me for three years that I have been a major positive influence in his life. I truly hope this young man will someday come back to keep me up to date on what is going on in his life. Thanks to this young man for making a difference in my life. (R. Hayes, 2008) I am currently a PPCD (preschool program for children with disabilities) teacher with one class of four-year old students and one class with three-year old children. I have three autistic students in my morning (4's) class, one being severe. I've read about autism, I've watched movies.. and nothing prepares you for actually being in the classroom and working daily with these children. My heart has been completely stolen by these babies! One little girl who doesn't talk, doesn't want to play with other children and is generally very much by herself went outside to play with the rest of the class last week and, while running around, came up to me and kissed me on the cheek, smiled and ran away to play some more.

Poul Thorsen, a medical doctor and Ph.D., was an adjunct professor at the Drexel University School of Public Health for several months before resigning Tuesday. On Jan. 22, Aarhus University said that it had uncovered a considerable shortfall in grant money from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for a research program that Thorsen had directed. Police are investigating. Thorsen could not be reached for comment. Anti-vaccine groups seized on the allegations to contend that studies disproving the vaccine link to autism are wrong. Those groups have long argued that thimerosal, a preservative in some vaccines, can cause autism, as can the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella. I think it is quite significant, said Dan Olmsted of the Age of Autism. I think someone allegedly capable of ripping off his own university by forging documents from the CDC is capable of pulling off anything. The CDC and coauthors of the two studies published in major U.S. medical journals maintain the studies remain valid. CDC is aware of the allegations, agency spokesman Tom Skinner said. Federal authorities also are investigating. Skinner noted that Thorsen was one of many coauthors on peer-reviewed studies looking at autism, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and alcohol use in pregnancy. We have no reason to suspect that there are any issues related to the integrity of the science, he said. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed out that a dozen major studies show no link between MMR and autism.

Thanks for recommending The Daily Beast! X Close It's official: Vaccines don't cause autism, rules a special U.S. court. But will it put an end to parents dangerous fear of inoculating or only make them more skeptical? On Friday a special vaccine court charged with adjudicating claims against vaccine makers ruled that there was no causal connection between childhood vaccines and autism. The court formally known as the Office of Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims was created by Congress in the 1980s to centralize lawsuits brought for injuries resulting from vaccination. The court labored in obscurity until recently, when it began to hear cases involving autistic children whose condition, their parents alleged, was triggered by vaccines that contained thimerosal, a preservative that once was common many vaccines. In yesterday s ruling, the court definitively declared that there is no merit to the notion that thimerosal causes autism. As one of the court s Special Masters wrote, the parents claims were speculative and unpersuasive. To conclude that vaccines caused autism, the Special Master wrote, an objective observer would have to emulate Lewis Carroll s White Queen and be able to believe six impossible (or at least highly improbable) things before breakfast. One of the remarkable aspects of this story is how much ordinary people distrust the major medical associations and health organizations whose sole objective is to watch out for those people s health. For years parents have worried that vaccinating their children could lead to autism. The fear was sparked by a 1998 study by a British doctor named Andrew Wakefield. Wakefield s study, which was published in The Lancet, a British medical journal, suggested that children who received the MMR vaccine had higher rates of autism. Although Wakefield s study only involved a dozen children, it caused a major uproar. In country after country, parents stopped vaccinating their children. In England, inoculation rates dropped from 92% to 80%. Immediately, in the United States fingers began to be pointed at thimerosal, which was used in some vaccines administered to children. One of the ingredients in thimerosal is mercury, a known toxin. There were several major problems with Wakefield s study. The first was that it couldn t be replicated. Numerous researchers were inspired by the controversy to conduct their own studies on the effect of the MMR vaccine and of thimerosal. None found any statistically significant link. In fact, several of the studies found that children who received vaccines with thimerosal were less likely to develop autism. The second problem with Wakefield s study came when the vaccine makers stopped using thimerosal. Thimerosal was dropped as a preservative in MMR vaccines in 1999, but since then autism rates have skyrocketed. In 1999, the autism rate in the United States was just over one case per 1,000 children. Today, with no thimerosal used in vaccines, the autism rate is over five cases per 1,000 children. Clearly, something other than thimerosal is to blame for this troubling trend. This was enough for all the major medical and health associations to announce that thimerosal had no connection to autism. The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Medical Toxicology, the National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization all came out against the purported link between autism and vaccines. But the evidence was not enough to convince parents of autistic children. One of the remarkable aspects of this story is how much ordinary people distrust the major medical associations and health organizations whose sole objective is to watch out for those people s health. Many people feel these groups are beholden to pharmaceutical and other major corporations, promoting their interests over those of the common person. This is a worrisome phenomenon, especially as major health threats like avian and swine flu grow in importance. Ironically, it was Dr. Wakefield that people shouldn t have trusted. It turns out that Wakefield s study was financed by lawyers interested in bringing lawsuits on behalf of parents who were sure that vaccines caused their children s autism. The law firm involved paid Wakefield approximately $1 million to undertake his study, a conflict of interest that Wakefield failed to disclose. Investigators also found that Wakefield s study misrepresented the data upon which he based his findings. In 2004, ten of the doctors who co-authored Wakefield s paper issued a statement disassociating themselves from Wakefield and the conclusions reached in his study. The Lancet issued a formal retraction of the study soon after.

The study was published in the March issue of the journal Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities.Previous research projects have netted mixed findings, but many suggest that families dealing with autism -- especially brothers and sisters of an autistic child -- also experience symptoms similar to autism: widespread abnormalities of social interactions, communication and behavior.The new study gives a fresh look at autism's early effects on families by comparing control and experimental groups whose ages, education and socioeconomic situations were virtually identical. Twenty families had a preschooler (ages 2-5 years old) diagnosed with autism and a typically developing older elementary school sibling (6-10); the control group of 23 families did not have an autistic child. Older children with diagnosed learning or mental disabilities were excluded. GA_googleFillSlot(\"News_Science_300x250\"); We know there are risk factors, but we don't know if they result from having a child with autism, or if there are genetic predispositions as part of the broader autism picture, McIntyre said. Are these difficulties the result of child-rearing challenges, or are they negatively impacted because of shared genetic risks? Our sample was very clean, and that's good for science but not necessarily as good for generalizing our findings, but I'm confident with the results we found in this particular sample. McIntyre, while a professor at Syracuse University, and her doctoral student Nicole Quintero studied families chosen in New York. They looked closely at sibling adjustments, involving social, behavioral and academic performance as recorded by both parents and teachers, and at the well- being of the mothers, whose average age was 36 and 94-95 percent of whom were married. The median age of older siblings was seven and most were first- or second-graders. Contrary to what has been found by many researchers, we found that older siblings were pretty well adjusted, with no significant differences in parent-reported or teacher-reported social skills, said McIntyre, who joined the UO's department of special education and clinical sciences in 2009. These are all typically developing kids. Teachers, however, reported slightly more behavioral problems for the siblings of children with autism than control siblings. There was a trend toward significance, she said.The problems resembled hyperactivity but not at levels generally attributed to attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). Teacher reports noted that these children exhibited slightly more fidgeting, movement and attention problems. Children with siblings with autism may be experiencing some sub-clinical symptoms of hyperactivity or attention problems, noted McIntyre, an affiliate of the UO's Center for Excellence and Developmental Disabilities, Education, Research and Service. Parents didn't report seeing such things at home. Teachers see these children in a more structured environment. Siblings of children with autism may be at heightened risk for developing problems, potentially over time. Siblings of children with autism probably should be watched with appropriate academic supports in place, she said. Our findings are rather positive overall, but these kids should be on our radar screens. These kids may start school OK, at least those from healthy families, but they may demonstrate difficulties over time. However, it has been shown that around 30 percent of siblings of autistic children have some associated difficulties in behavior, learning or development. The finding that moms with children with autism were more stressed and depressed in comparison to moms of typically developing preschool children was not surprising at all, McIntyre said. That finding is robust in existing literature, so even though this sample involves highly organized, motivated and willing mothers, in comparison to other moms with two or more children, they are reporting more stress and more depression. Mothers of autistic children, she added, need assistance for day-to-day child-rearing activities to give them some time to be individuals. As part of her research and clinical work at UO's nationally recognized Child and Family Center, she is looking at interventions that support parents and help kids with their daily living skills and behavior management.---On the Net:University of Oregon More News in this Category genetic genetic New York depression Oregon ADHD adhd OK News_Science_300x250 Laura Lee McIntyre University of Oregon McIntyre Developmental Disabilities.Previous Syracuse University Nicole Quintero UO Center for Excellence and Developmental Disabilities Research and Service Family Center 1833266 8 March 2010 www.redorbit.com/news/science/1833266/study_examines_autisms_impact_on_older_siblings/index.html 18332 Autism187 http://www.mhnews-autism.org/ In the Winter 2010 Issue: Advances in Autism Science Lead Stories An Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) Update An Autism Spectrum News Interview with Margaret L.

While expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism. \"Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration,\" special master George Hastings Jr. wrote. But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case. The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court. The parents presented expert witnesses who argued mercury can have a variety of effects on the brain, but the ruling said none of them offered opinions on the cause of autism in the three specific cases argued. They testified that mercury can affect a number of biological processes, including abnormal metabolism in children. Special master Denise K. Vowell noted that in order to succeed in their action, the parents would have to show \"the exquisitely small amounts of mercury\" that reach the brain from vaccines can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts ... from other sources do not. The ruling said the parents were arguing that the effects from mercury in vaccines differ from mercury's known effects on the brain. Vowell concluded that the parents had failed to establish that their child's condition was caused or aggravated by mercury from vaccines. Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines. The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism. The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available. The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had \"already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.\" But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, \"it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them.\" On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. \"The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,\" Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement. SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling. \"The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology,\" the goup said. The advocacy group Autism Speaks said \"the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases.\" However, while research has found no overall connection between autism and vaccines, the group said it would back research to determine if some individuals might be at increased risk because of genetic or medical conditions. Meanwhile, in reaction to the concerns of parents, thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines in the United States. In Friday's action the court ruled in three different cases, each concluding that the preservative has no connection to autism. The trio of rulings can offer reassurance to parents scared about vaccinating their babies because of a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, are on the rise. The U.S. Court of Claims is different from many other courts: The families involved didn't have to prove the inoculations definitely caused the complex neurological disorder, just that they probably did. More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation through the government's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the rulings dealt with test cases to settle which if any claims had merit. Autism is best known for impairing a child's ability to communicate and interact. Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it's unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosis. Worry about a vaccine link first arose in 1998 when a British physician, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published a medical journal article linking a particular type of autism and bowel disease to the measles vaccine. The study was later discredited. Copyright 2010 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I was part of the Great Lakes Chelation Panel on mercury toxicity, and have co-authored one of the leading papers in clinical mercury detoxification, and have worked with hundreds of patients with mercury detoxification issues, so I have some experience in this area.In general, the panel's review of this subject is thorough and I would strongly recommend reading it if you have an interest in this area.However, I cannot endorse a number of the panel's recommendations and I will provide my objections to the protocol at the beginning.The major objection to the recommendation is the use of DMSA for mercury detoxification. My affinity for the use of DMPS is likely one of the reasons I was not invited to participate in this panel. However, one needs to know that in the overall treatment of this problem our approaches are very similar. The KEY strategy to improve children with brain injury is to optimize their gut flora and diet and this is something the panel makes very clear.Mercury detox with DMSA or DMPS is not a huge magic bullet, it is just one of many strategies that can be implemented to help these children. If one uses either of these chemicals without first properly preparing the child, there can be great harm and damage.The panel refuses to support the DMPS recommendation, despite the fact that it is, as they admit, a clearly more effective agent, due to DMPS's history of complications in adults and its lack of FDA approval in children.The issue of DMPS, and for that matter DMSA, toxicity, is not related to the direct toxicity of the drugs, but to the drug's ability to take the heavy metals out of the body. It is actually the heavy metals that cause the side effects. If one does not properly prepare the body to address these heavy metals then one will have complications from the chealting agent.DMPS was, and still is, frequently improperly used in many adults. Primarily by well-intentioned physicians who provide DMPS when the person still has amalgam fillings in their mouth. Because DMPS is so effective at removing mercury, it will actually pull the mercury right out of the fillings and cause huge problems in some patients.It is has been my and Dr. Klinghardt's combined thirty year experience that DMPS when used properly is far safer then DMSA. The other issue the panel raises of FDA approval is really moot as DMSA, although approved for lead chelation, clearly is not approved for removing mercury.Additionally, please pay special attention to the huge list of complications of DMSA that are listed in this protocol. They require that the child have regular blood draws for a chemistry profile and a CBC to monitor for these complications.This is not necessary for DMPS, which is another reason I prefer it. Through my use of IV secretin I have become very proficient in drawing blood from children. But after doing that for several years I realized that I was inflicting emotional trauma and scaring that was worsening their problem overall. For this reason, at this time I cannot endorse any protocol that requires regular blood draws on children below the age of 6.Other areas of disagreement are in the negative recommendation for chlorella. Their information on chlorella is seriously flawed. It is based on a small study done by Doctor's Data. They never demonstrated increased absorption of mercury from the chlorella, only that mercury was present in the chlorella. Since hundreds of tons of mercury are deposited into the oceans every year, this is not surprising. However, what the investigators failed to account for was that the binding coefficient of chlorella to mercury is far in excess of its potential to release mercury into the body. It only ABSORBS mercury, it does NOT release it into the body.The other issue of potential for contamination with toxic dinoflagellates is only true for blue green algae and NOT for chlorella since chlorella is a cultured product and is NOT contaminated with it.Mineral replacement is a critical element of mercury detoxification when using chelating agents. Monitoring the child's mineral status prior to and during chelation is essential.The panel recommends the use of the more expensive blood tests for monitoring mineral status. As I wrote in my letter in JAMA, I believe that hair analysis from specific labs is far less expensive, more clinically valid and clearly less traumatic on the child then the blood tests. With those objections aside, I invite you to review the Panel's outstanding compilation of an effective Autism Protocol.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Autism Panel ReportAn enormous, alarming, and unexplained increase in the prevalence of autism is being reported, on an almost daily basis, in the U.S., the U.K., and elsewhere. California maintains what is probably the world's best and most systematic database on autism and other developmental disabilities. In California the reported increase in the prevalence of autism over a 20-year period is over one thousand percent. Similar enormous increases have been reported from studies in New Jersey and elsewhere in the US, in the UK, in the Middle East, and in Asia. While the reality of the increase is beyond doubt, there is great controversy over the cause. Many experts believe the primary cause is the increase in the number of vaccines given to children from birth to age two, which has risen from 8 in 1980 to 22 in the year 2001. The increased number of vaccines has brought with it an increased exposure of young infants to mercury intoxication. The preservative thimerosal, which is used in many vaccines, consists of approximately 50% mercury. In 1998 the Food and Drug Administration requested the vaccine manufacturers to begin the process of removing thimerosal from the vaccines. Thimerosal containing vaccines are still being used in 2001. Mercury is highly toxic in even very small doses, and some individuals are exquisitely sensitive to mercury. Some infants have been given, in one day, as much as 100 times the maximum dosage of mercury permitted by the Environmental Protection Agency's standards, based on the weight of an adult. An infant's system is much less capable of dealing with toxins than an adult's. In early 2000, parent Sallie Bernard and several other concerned and inquisitive parents began looking into the mercury issue. They learned that thimerosal was used in most vaccines at levels that greatly exceeded the upper limits decreed safe by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The scientific paper by Bernard et al. may be found on the website of the Autism Research Institute (www.autismresearchinstitute.com). In her testimony before the US House of Representatives in July, 2000, Sallie, the primary author of the report, testified: \"The symptoms which are diagnostic of or strongly associated with autism itself are found to arise from mercury exposure, as described in available literature on past cases of mercury poisoning.\" \"These similarities,\" she testified, \"include the defining characteristics of autism - and they include traits strongly associated with autism and found in nearly all cases of the disorder - sensory disturbances such as numbness in the extremities and mouth, aversion to touch, and unusual response to noise; movement disorders like toe-walking, hand flapping, clumsiness, and choreiform movements; and cognitive impairments in specific domains like short-term, verbal and auditory memory and in understanding abstract ideas.\" In addition, she noted, mercury poisoning can cause many of the same biological abnormalities as are seen in autism, including immune system dysfunction and anomalies in the cerebellum, amygdala, and hippocampus. Bernard noted that the growing prevalence rate of autism closely matches the introduction and spread of thimerosal-containing vaccines and that autistic symptoms generally emerge at the time the child is given these vaccines. She added \"Our group has also documented a number of cases of autistic children with toxic levels of mercury in hair, urine and blood.\" In addition, she noted, mercury is more toxic to males than to females, and the male-to-female ratio in autism is 4 to 1. Noting that low doses of mercury tend to harm genetically susceptible individuals, Bernard pointed out that \"autism has been recognized as one of the most heritable of all neurological disorders and is strongly associated with familial autoimmune disorders.\" Bernard and her colleagues called for an immediate ban on thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines in October 2000. The meeting was attended by a number of physicians and scientists. One of the physicians, Dr. Stephanie Cave of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told the group that in her experience over a number of years in treating over 400 autistic children with various modalities, she had found no modality which was more effective in a great many autistic children than mercury detoxification. Other physicians who also had experience with mercury detoxification in autistic children, including several who were themselves parents of autistic children, strongly supported Dr. Cave's remarks. The Autism Research Institute convened a weekend Consensus Conference on the Detoxification of Autistic Children in Dallas, Texas in February, 2001. The attendees were 25 carefully selected physicians and scientists knowledgeable about mercury and mercury detoxification. The 15 physicians present included 7 who were parents of autistic children and who had detoxified their own children with good results. The physician attendees present had treated well over 3,000 patients for heavy metal poisoning, about 1,500 of them being autistic children. The chemists, toxicologists and other scientists present had a combined total of almost 90 years of experience in research on the toxicology of mercury. The purpose of the meeting was to arrive at a consensus document that would delineate the safest and most effective methods of detoxifying autistic children. Nine candidate detoxification protocols, including five submitted by non-attendees, were considered in detail by the conferees. James R. Laidler, M.D. The DAN! mercury detoxification consensus group met in Dallas, Texas on February 9 - 11, 2001 to gather some of the top scientists and practitioners in the field to develop a protocol for mercury detoxification in the autistic child. Rationale Many of the features of autism bear striking similarity to certain features of mercury poisoning, especially the immune dysfunctions1,2, visual disturbances3,4, and motor/coordination defects5 seen in a growing number of autistic children. Treating autistic children with agents to remove mercury and/or other heavy metals has brought about significant improvement in many of them, sometimes dramatic improvement. This improvement is coincident with increased excretion of mercury and/or other metals in most but not all patients. Some have theorized that those who improve without increased mercury excretion are suffering from some other metal toxicity. Another possibility, which also explains those patients who improve without significant heavy metal excretion, is that the chelating agents are working in some other fashion and that the heavy metal excretion is coincidental to this other effect. For example, there are clinical studies showing that autistic children with significant allergy problems have elevated cysteine/sulfate ratios in their blood, and there are other indications of disordered sulfur amino-acid chemistry. Sulfhydrylbearing agents, such as DMSA and others, remove cysteine6 and thereby improve some sulfur amino acid imbalances. Yet another possibility under investigation is the anti-oxidant effect of the drugs and supplements used and their ability to compensate for deficiencies in the native anti-oxidant systems. Quite a few autistic children have laboratory evidence of anti-oxidant deficiency; low intracellular glutathione is commonly found in these children. What may be happening in these children is that the DMSA7 and other agents \"put out the fire\" of intracellular oxidation and help restore the 7 normal anti-oxidant functions. Whatever the action may be, DMSA therapy has been shown to help a large number of autistic children. It is important to remember that autism is a syndrome, not a disease. The \"diagnosis\" of autism covers a wide spectrum of children, many as different from each other as they are different from \"typical\" children. No one causative factor has been identified for autism and the possibility exists that autism is not a single disease but several individual diseases that share a similar presentation. With that in mind, it is not surprising that no single treatment has been found that works for all children with autism. Preparatory treatment Many, if not most, autistic children suffer from some degree of intestinal dysbiosis, abnormal intestinal permeability and nutritional derangements which must all be corrected as much as possible prior to any attempt at detoxification. Without this preparatory treatment, the adverse side effects of therapy may be magnified. Without the correction of their intestinal dysfunctions, any improvement from the treatment may be hard to detect. Many of the drugs and supplements used for mercury detoxification are rich sources of nutrition for bacteria and fungi. If treatment is started while the child is suffering from overgrowth of abnormal or pathogenic organisms, they will experience explosive growth of these organisms with subsequent worsening of their symptoms. This monograph is but a part of the DAN! treatment protocol for autistic children, so this is not the place for a detailed discussion of how to correct their intestinal problems. However, a brief outline of the process is included (Appendix B) to help practitioners who are not familiar with the process. Inclusion testing Urine, blood and hair mercury are typically normal or negative unless the mercury exposure has been fairly recent. On occasion, urinary mercury will be elevated if the child is in a catabolic state due to growth or malnutrition. In these situations, the mercury stored in tissues may be released as those cells are broken down. Provoked excretion of mercury and heavy metals is the only accurate way to estimate the total body burden of heavy metals. This is performed by administering a chelating agent prior to collection of urine for heavy metal analysis. The usual provoking agents are 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 2,3-dimercapto-propane-sulfonate (DMPS). Of these two, DMSA is safer, but DMPS is somewhat more effective8,9. The usual way to gather a provoked urine specimen is to administer the chelating agent and then to collect the next six to twelve hours of urine produced. The usual DMSA dose for a single-dose provocation is 10 mg/kg. No reference ranges exist for provoked urinary heavy metal excretion, so the interpretation of the results is problematic. Given that the problem in autistic children may be excessive sensitivity to mercury or other heavy metals, any level over the reference range for unprovoked urine heavy metals may be sufficient indication for a trial of therapy. In addition to mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic, antimony and many other metals are extracted by DMSA10, so the urine metal analysis may show a number of toxic metals. 8 Other than looking for the heavy metals directly, one can look for evidence of their effects. Mercury and other heavy metals suppress the effect of a number of enzymes, some of which can be easily tested. The most commonly available of these is glucose-6 phosphodiesterase (G-6PD); a quantitative G-6PD activity may reveal levels intermediate between normal and deficient in heavy metal poisoning11. Of note, there has been one report of hemolysis in a patient with absolute G-6PD-deficiency12, but DMSA has been used extensively in populations with a high incidence of G-6PD deficiency and sickle cell disease without problems. Less commonly available is glutathione reductase, which is also reduced in heavy metal poisoning13. Low glutathione levels in the red cells are not specific for heavy metal toxicity, but may be supporting evidence. Another commonly available test is blood or urine pyruvic acid. Pyruvic acid can be elevated for a number of reasons, but mercury is notorious for interfering with the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, where it binds to and deactivates the lipoic acid coenzyme, resulting in elevated pyruvic acid. Mercury and other heavy metals interfere with heme synthesis, leading to urinary excretion of uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin. Mercury also causes production of pre-coproporphyrin, which may be considered a specific marker for mercury poisoning14,15. Analysis of uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin can be done at most clinical laboratories; pre-coproporphyrin analysis can also be done, but most laboratories do not routinely have that test available. Mercury and other heavy metals (such as lead) can cause progressive myelin degeneration with the development of antibodies to myelin basic protein (MBP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)16,17. While these changes are not diagnostic of mercury intoxication, they point to ongoing degeneration in the central nervous system. Depletion or deficiency of the cellular antioxidant systems is seen in a number of autistic children. A common finding in autistic children is an abnormally low erythrocyte glutathione level. The potential causes for this deficiency in cellular antioxidant substances are myriad, ranging from congenital deficiency to toxins; heavy metals are well-documented causes of intracellular antioxidant depletion. Whether the cause is too little production, rapid consumption or a combination of the two, many of these children can benefit from exogenous antioxidant support. Since DMSA and many of the other supplements used to treat mercury and heavy metal intoxication are powerful antioxidants, this may be mechanism of action in some children who improve, especially those who show little excretion of toxic metals. Since it is possible that neither removal of metals nor supplementing cellular antioxidants are the mechanism of action, an empiric trial of DMSA therapy may be warranted. This trial should be done for a limited time and without changing any other therapy, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, etc. If no definitive results are seen in four to six weeks, discontinue therapy and look again for any changes. Pre-treatment testing DMSA can cause bone marrow suppression and is potentially hepatotoxic18. There have been no reports yet of permanent bone marrow suppression or liver damage, but the literature has many case reports of significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia during therapy with DMSA. Prior to starting therapy, it is important that a complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count be 9 checked, both to provide a baseline as well as to detect any pre-existing abnormalities. Blood levels of liver transaminases (ALT and AST) are also important for the same reasons. DMSA is primarily excreted in the urine19, so kidney dysfunction will cause it to accumulate in the blood. To prevent serious toxicity, it is important to detect any decreased renal function prior to starting therapy. In the absence of any signs or symptoms of renal insufficiency, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels should be adequate to document normal renal function. If there are any reasons to suspect renal insufficiency, creatinine clearance should be measured. Periodic checks of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine should also be performed when other blood studies are done. Several investigators have found that autistic children are typically low in blood zinc and high in blood copper. Many other minerals, such as selenium and magnesium, are often low as well. The body stores of these minerals can be estimated by measuring the red blood cell mineral content. Serum copper and plasma zinc levels are considered to be the most accurate reflections of total body content of these two minerals, but not many laboratories can perform this assay consistently. Other options are platelet and erythrocyte copper and zinc levels. Practitioners who decide to use copper and zinc levels routinely are advised to closely monitor their analytical laboratory and to perform periodic quality-control checks with known samples. Detoxification Of the chelating agents available at present, DMSA (succimer, Chemet\ufffd) provides the optimal combination of safety and efficacy. DMSA has been used extensively for nearly fifty years and is approved by the USFDA to treat lead poisoning in children; its safety record is exemplary20. There is far less experience using DMPS, especially in children, and the adult experience with it has shown that it is significantly more toxic than DMSA. DMPS is currently not approved for any use by the USFDA. Several animal studies have shown that DMSA is capable of removing a portion of the mercury bound in the brain21,22. Some of these studies have also shown that, months after exposure, mercury still moves between the blood and brain in both directions23. It should be noted that, to date, no studies have definitively shown any chelating agent capable of removing mercury from the human brain, no doubt due to the reluctance of human subjects to have their brains removed for analysis. One autopsy study has demonstrated that, despite urine and blood mercury levels in the normal range, mercury will persist in the brain and other organs for many years without adequate chelation therapy24. DMSA should be given in doses of no more than 10 mg/kg/dose and no more than 30 mg/kg/day with a maximum dose of 500 mg (1500 mg/day maximum). Exceeding these limits has been associated with a significantly higher incidence of side effects and toxicity. The dosing interval can be any convenient period, as long as the dose limits are not exceeded. There is no convincing evidence to suggest that dosing intervals shorter than eight hours provide any inherent benefit, although a lower dose given more frequently may help to reduce troublesome side effects. In addition, the subset of children who experience improvement only while receiving DMSA may benefit from more frequent dosing. Clinical experience supporting 3- or 4-hour dosing intervals is matched by equally good results with 8-hour dosing. As always, the dosing interval should be based on the clinical response of the individual patient. 10 DMSA is usually given orally but it can, if necessary, be given intravenously. There is also some experience with rectal administration via suppository. Despite the sulfurous smell, most children will take it if it is mixed with a suitable masking liquid, such as orange juice or other sweet beverage. One study has shown that mercury-intoxicated rats prefer water containing DMSA to pure water, while the control animals would shun the water with DMSA25; this phenomenon has been seen in some children as well. Acidic or neutral liquids are best to maintain the activity of the DMSA while in solution. DMSA will retain approximately 80% of its activity after 24 hours in solution, but prolonged storage in solution may result in significant degradation and loss of effectiveness26. If the child will swallow capsules, the whole issue of taste and smell can be neatly bypassed. The treatment period can last from three to five days with a \"rest period\" of at least as long as the treatment period. A treatment of three days followed by a rest period of eleven days provides adequate time for bone marrow suppression to resolve and yet is short enough for rapid removal of tissue mercury. A three-day treatment period allows the drug to be administered over the weekend (Friday evening through Monday morning), which can be a tremendous convenience. Common side effects of DMSA are nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, flatulence and fatigue. If these become serious enough, reducing the dose will usually make the symptoms tolerable. Occasionally, patients develop a maculopapular rash during treatment; this should not to be confused with an allergic reaction27. Some autistic children are reported to experience a transient regression in language and behavior during and shortly after treatment. Reducing the dose may also make these symptoms less bothersome. Clinical experience suggests that most children who experience regression at the start of therapy will have less regression with each subsequent cycle of treatment. Serious side effects of DMSA are extremely rare and include allergic reaction, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and erythema multiforme and thrombocytopenia may also occur28. While reducing the dose may reduce the severity of the neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, truly dangerous reductions in cell count are a contraindication to continued therapy without a compelling reason to do so. Obviously, allergic a No cross-sensitivity between DMSA and the sulfa antibiotics has been reported. If the patient has a history of sensitivity or allergy to other dithiol chelating agents (e.g. DMPS, DMPA, dimercaprol/BAL), they may not be a candidate for DMSA therapy, depending on the severity of the reaction. If the reaction was mild or ambiguous, a small test dose can help resolve the issue. Toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme occur without predictable pattern and their etiologies are poorly understood. Both may occur with the initial treatment or may appear after several months of therapy. Both have been reported only a few times in connection with DMSA even though tens of thousands of children have received the drug. Erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) is a selflimited inflammatory disorder of the skin and mucous membranes. It is thought to be induced by immune complexes and mediated by lymphocytes. It is characterized by distinctive target-shaped skin lesions, sore throat, mucous ulcers and fever. It usually begins a week or more after therapy starts and will usually resolve spontaneously if the inciting medication is stopped. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is the most serious cutaneous drug reaction and may be fatal if not recognized. Its onset is generally very acute and characterized by epidermal necrosis without significant dermal inflammation. Its pathology is poorly understood but it also usually resolves when the inciting agent is stopped. There are no other specific treatments other than supportive therapy and symptom relief. 11 reaction, TEN and Stevens-Johnson syndrome are absolute contraindications to continued therapy. More beneficial \"side effects\" reported with DMSA therapy in autistic children include rapid progression of language ability, improved social interaction, improved eye contact, and decreased self-stimulatory behaviors (\"stimming\"). Children with motor problems have experienced significant improvement in both strength and coordination. Mineral supplements Because of poor nutrition (often due to idiosyncratic food preferences), poor absorption, and other, poorly understood factors, autistic children usually have numerous mineral deficiencies. Chief among these deficiencies is zinc. Zinc supplements should be given prior to, during and after detoxification therapy. Zinc given with DMSA will complex with it and will be more readily absorbed as a consequence29,30. Supplementation with 1 - 2 mg/kg/day of zinc is recommended (maximum of 50 mg/day unless guided by laboratory evidence of marked deficiency); more may be needed and plasma, erythrocyte or platelet zinc levels can be used to guide doses higher than this. Autistic children are also often deficient in selenium. Since this mineral is one of the few that can cause a significant toxicity if it is present in excess, caution should be exercised. In the absence of laboratory evidence of a profound deficiency, selenium supplementation should be limited to 1 - 4 mcg/kg/day. Magnesium, molybdenum, manganese, vanadium and chromium are all among the minerals that are deficient in autistic children; these can be supplied by a multi-mineral supplement. Be sure that this supplement does not contain copper. Copper is the one mineral that autistic children often have in excess and additional supplements will only worsen the excess. Vitamin supplements Although the conventional wisdom is that the \"average American\" receives all the vitamins and nutrients they require in a balanced diet, there are several reasons why this is not true in autistic children. First, autistic children rarely eat a balanced diet. They often have an extremely limited number of foods they will accept and these rarely encompass all of the major food groups. Additionally, some of the vitamins are anti-oxidants and are depleted in autistic children. Finally, many autistic children are deficient in vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folate and niacin, either from poor diet, poor absorption or both. Vitamin C: An important anti-oxidant, vitamin C can be a great benefit to autistic children. Since it is a water-soluble vitamin, it is rare to see true toxicity, although ascorbic acid crystals in the urine (and the potential for renal stones) will result from sustained use of extremely high doses. More commonly (and usually at doses over 2000 mg/day), gastrointestinal distress and diarrhea are the only side effects from vitamin C. Using the buffered preparation or vitamin C esters can significantly reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, as will dividing the dose. Vitamin C supplementation should start at 5 -10 mg/kg/day and gradually increase to tolerance. Some may tolerate and, in fact, need more than 50 mg/kg/day. Vitamin E: Another of the anti-oxidant vitamins, vitamin E has received more press lately than vitamin C. Since it is fat soluble, it can accumulate if given to excess. Dosing in the range of 2 - 4 12 mg/kg/day (3 - 6 IU/kg/day) is within safe limits. Mixed tocopherols are the preferred preparation. Many vitamin E supplements are prepared from soybeans and may be a problem in children who are sensitive to soy products. Since vitamin E is important in preventing fatty acid oxidation and peroxidation, more may be needed if the child is also receiving essential fatty acid supplements. Vitamin B6: Vitamin B6 can be found as B6 (pyridoxine), pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P5P), or a mixture of the two (rare). Up to 15 mg/kg/day of B6 or 3 mg/kg/day of pyridoxal-5-phosphate should be used (to a maximum of 500 mg B6 or 100 mg P5P). Be aware that many of the pyridoxal-5-phosphate preparations contain supplemental copper to prevent pyridoxal retinopathy in copper-deficient people. Since autistic children are typically high in copper, be sure to use a copper-free preparation. Other supplements Alpha-Lipoic acid: A dithiol fatty acid, alpha-lipoic acid is a native chelating agent but is also a powerful anti-oxidant. It has been extensively used in Germany to treat diabetic neuropathy with excellent results31. Its anti-oxidant effects may be particularly helpful in autistic children, since many of them show clear evidence of anti-oxidant depletion. Start with 1 - 3 mg/kg/day of alpha-lipoic acid and increase to 10 mg/kg/day as tolerated. Alphalipoic acid is a natural product of human cells and so has minimal toxicity; doses of up to 25 mg/kg/day given over more than three years have been studied in adults with no detectable toxicity32. There is a theoretical concern that alpha-lipoic acid may bind to DMSA and reduce the availability of both, but this has not been seen clinically. Another concern is that alpha-lipoic acid reduces the removal of methyl-mercury by glutathione, which is a reason why it should be given with DMSA. There is also evidence that alpha-lipoic acid reduces copper excretion33. Since DMSA increases copper excretion34 (it has been used to treat the copper intoxication of Wilson's disease35), this should not be a problem if alpha-lipoic acid is used with DMSA. A serious concern with alpha-lipoic acid is that it can facilitate the movement of mercury out of and into the cells. It can be very useful in mobilizing mercury from within the cells and making it available for DMSA to chelate. Without the DMSA to \"grab\" the mercury from lipoic acid, it may readily enter other tissues. Melatonin: The pineal hormone that helps to regulate the sleep/wake cycle, melatonin is also an anti-oxidant. It is relatively unique among natural anti-oxidants in that it is a terminal antioxidant: once oxidized, it cannot be reduced36. This characteristic means that melatonin cannot participate in destructive redox cycling, where an oxidized compound is reduced by oxidizing another compound. One study has found that neurons are protected from mercury damage by hormonal levels of melatonin37. Melatonin is also concentrated in the mitochondria and protects them from oxidative damage.38 Aside from its anti-oxidant properties, melatonin helps to regulate the sleep/wake cycle, which is often seriously deranged in autistic children. Its long-term use in institutionalized children has established its safety39.Doses of up to 0.1 mg/kg at bedtime should be adequate to help with sleep disturbances. Some clinicians have noted that smaller doses of melatonin (0.3 mg in adults) are just as effective for sleep and may cause fewer problems with nightmares and/or night terrors. A sustained release form of melatonin is currently under development and should help with those children who awaken four to six hours after the dose of melatonin. 13 Taurine: Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid which is important in the production of bile salts and, therefor, in the native excretion of toxins and absorption of fats and fat-soluble substances. Many autistic children are deficient in taurine and benefit from a supplementation of 250 - 500 mg/day. A maximum dose of 2 grams/day in adults and adult-sized children is recommended. Glutathione: Glutathione is the keystone of the cellular anti-oxidant system and is often deficient in autistic children. Despite numerous rodent studies that show good systemic absorption of oral glutathione, the two human studies looking at oral absorption have shown it to be nil40. In humans, oral glutathione is readily absorbed by the gut mucosa, repleting its glutathione supply; the mucosa then breaks down the remaining glutathione. This may explain why oral glutathione has been of help to autistic children even when there is apparently no systemic absorption. Given the gut dysfunction found in many autistic children, oral glutathione 250 - 500 mg/day may be of significant help. Supplements to be wary of Cysteine/cystine: As sulfur-containing amino acids (cystine is the dimer of cysteine), both can bind to and mobilize mercury. Like alpha-lipoic acid, cysteine and cystine may worsen mercury intoxication by spreading it to other tissues. Furthermore, cysteine and cystine are excellent culture media for the Candida genus of yeast and can promote or worsen intestinal candidiasis. In addition, many autistic children have high blood levels of cysteine. N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC): NAC should not be used initially or by itself with anyone suspected of having a significant body burden of mercury. Like alpha-lipoic acid, cysteine and cystine, NAC can bind with mercury and carry it across cell membranes. NAC is also a good culture medium for yeast, like its parent molecule, cysteine. Since many autistic children also have high cysteine levels, giving them NAC will only exacerbate this problem. NAC is often recommended because it can rapidly increase intracellular glutathione levels41,42. For that reason, it can be tremendously useful in treating the antioxidant deficiencies seen in so many autistic children. NAC should be used either in conjunction with DMSA or after mercury detoxification is well under way. In addition, NAC should be used with extreme caution in children with elevated cysteine levels. Chlorella/other algae: Often touted as an herbal remedy for mercury poisoning, chlorella has a great affinity for mercury and other heavy metals. Unfortunately, it will also readily extract mercury from the water it is grown in. Analysis of at least one specimen of commercially available chlorella has shown high levels of mercury. Other unicellular algae preparations are available on the market, advertised as a remedy for a variety of problems. They should also be viewed with caution, not only because of possible mercury content but also because of the potential for contamination with toxic dinoflagellates.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note from Dr. Mercola: This information on chlorella is seriously flawed. It is based on a small study done by Doctor's Data. They NEVER demonstrated increased absorption of mercury from the chlorella, only that mercury was present in the chlorella. Since hundreds of tons of mercury are deposited into the oceans every year, this is not surprising. However, what the investigators failed to account for was that the binding coefficient of chlorella to mercury is far in excess of its potential to release mercury into the body. It only ABSORBS mercury it does NOT release it into the body.The other issue of potential for contamination with toxic dinoflagellates is only true for blue green algae and NOT for chlorella since chlorella is a cultured product and is NOT contaminated.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Concurrent testing Since DMSA has been reported to cause elevations in hepatic transaminases, serum ALT and AST should be monitored during therapy. Likewise, white cell and platelet counts should be followed. Both elevation of liver enzymes and bone marrow suppression are dose-related and 14 have been, to date, completely reversible. Also, review of the literature indicates that, while some patients are more sensitive, sensitivity appears to remain constant. This would suggest that patients who tolerate DMSA well initially will rarely, if ever, develop sensitivity later in therapy. Complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count and liver enzymes should be checked after the first or second cycle and, assuming no abnormalities are found, rechecked periodically while therapy continues. If elevated liver enzymes or depressed cell counts are found, the DMSA should be stopped and the laboratory tests followed until the values return to baseline. If the abnormalities were not too severe and they return to baseline promptly, the DMSA can be resumed at a lower dose with careful monitoring. Urine metal analysis for mercury and other toxic metals may help direct the duration of therapy. The optimum time for collecting the urine specimen is after the second dose of the cycle and within six hours of the last dose of the cycle. Timed specimens are best, but may not be practical in children who are not toilet-trained. When a 24-hour specimen is not possible, 12- or 6-hour specimens are completely acceptable. In children who are continent at night, the first morning urine represents an 8-hour collection, on average. Random or spot urine specimens are problematic, as they may miss the time of peak excretion, especially when DMSA is given every eight hours. One way to overcome this problem is to obtain two or more random specimens and combine them. This will \"average\" the mercury excretion over several samples. The best time to get a spot urine sample is two to four hours after a dose. Some practitioners have found stool mercury analysis to be helpful, as much of the mercury excreted with alpha-lipoic acid will be found in the bile. The major limitation to stool mercury is that the stool contains both mercury excreted in the bile as well as any mercury ingested in the diet and not absorbed. Without knowing the amount of mercury in the diet, it is impossible to accurately interpret stool mercury levels. The best way to use stool mercury levels is to obtain a level before treatment. Assuming that the dietary mercury remains relatively constant, this will provide a baseline for subsequent measurements. End-of-treatment indications If one could assume that the benefits seen in autistic children were exclusively due to mercury detoxification, then treatment could stop when mercury excretion dropped below detectable limits. Since this may not be the sole mechanism of action, the decision to end treatment needs to be based on both laboratory and clinical evidence. One obvious indication to stop treatment is when improvement ceases. Halt therapy when the child reaches a \"plateau\" and watch for any indication of regression. Some parents and practitioners may want to continue treatment for a few months after reaching a \"plateau\" in the hopes that a small amount of additional progress may occur. Also, the possibility of a \"false plateau\" due to illness or other stress should be considered. Obviously, if the child shows no significant progress during therapy or experiences regression, this would be another indication to stop treatment. Keep in mind that a significant number of autistic children will undergo some degree of regression during initial treatment with DMSA while later experiencing significant gains. If intestinal dysbiosis is not adequately treated prior to 15 starting DMSA, any improvement from the DMSA may be masked when the intestinal dysbiosis worsens on exposure to a rich culture medium. A number of children have shown significant improvement while taking the DMSA, which regresses when they stop, even for the \"rest period\" of each cycle. These children need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, since there is insufficient clinical experience so far to recommend a course of action. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimers:1. The therapies outlined in this monograph should not be used except by and under the supervision of a physician. 2. This is not a \"stand-alone\" protocol and must be preceded by correction of intestinal dysbiosis and nutritional deficiencies. 3. These therapies may not help all autistic children and may potentially make some autistic children significantly worse. Even those children who will ultimately benefit from these therapies may show transient deterioration during treatment. 4. The drugs and nutritional supplements discussed in this monograph, with the exception of DMSA (Succimer, Chemet\ufffd), antibiotics and antifungals, are not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). DMSA is currently approved by the USFDA only for lead poisoning.5. The quality and purity of drugs and supplements that are not FDA approved will vary with different suppliers. All such drugs and nutritional supplements mentioned are allowed by the USFDA, but it does not guarantee their safety, purity or effectiveness. 6. The theories and medical models on which these therapies are based are not universally accepted in the medical community and are being vigorously studied by a number of researchers. The clinical evidence supporting these therapies is compelling but no wellcontrolled outcome studies have yet been performed; the evidence is largely based on clinical experience at this point. 7. The theories and therapies discussed in this monograph are subject to change without notice if significant clinical or research data indicates a need for change. Disclaimers for medical practitioners: 1. Attempting mercury or other heavy metal detoxification before the patient's underlying gastrointestinal and nutritional problems are corrected will likely be disappointing to you and to the patient's family. 2. The dosing of the drugs and nutritional supplements in this monograph is within the limits supported by the majority of the peer-reviewed literature published as of January 2001. The maximum limits should be exceeded only if you have good reasons to do so. 3. At the present, it is impossible to determine which patients will benefit from these therapies with great accuracy. Some patients who seem to be perfect candidates will have no improvement and others who seem to have little to recommend the therapy will show marked improvement4. The treatment of autism is in a state of continual flux. 16 Disclaimers for parents and family members: 1. Many families are treating their autistic children with therapies similar to those listed in this monograph without involving a physician or other health care provider. That most of them do so without any adverse consequences is a testament to the safety of the drugs and supplements used. However, DMSA and some of the supplements present a small but nonzero risk of serious side effects. Life, in general, is a series of risks; the risk of serious side effects can be reduced by careful medical monitoring during treatment. 2. Not every physician is able or willing to carry out the therapies described in this monograph. Have a frank and open discussion with your physician or other medical practitioner before embarking on these treatments. 3. Despite miraculous case reports heard on the grapevine and on the Internet, these therapies will not work for every autistic person. Even those who do improve may have slow or incremental improvement4. In general, younger patients appear to respond more quickly than older patients, but this has not yet been adequately investigated.Autism Research InstituteReferences Autism Home Remedies We Cured Our Son's Autism By Karyn SeroussiCopyright \ufffd 2000 Karyn Seroussi When the doctors said our son would be severely disabled for life, we set out to prove them wrong. When the psychologist examining our 18-month-old son told me that she thought Miles had autism, my heart began to pound. I didn't know exactly what the word meant, but I knew it was bad. Wasn't autism some type of mental illness -- perhaps juvenile schizophrenia? Even worse, I vaguely remembered hearing that this disorder was caused by emotional trauma during childhood. In an instant, every illusion of safety in my world seemed to vanish.Our pediatrician had referred us to the psychologist in August 1995 because Miles didn't seem to understand anything we said. He'd developed perfectly normally until he was 15 months old, but then he stopped saying the words he'd learned -- cow, cat, dance -- and started disappearing into himself. We figured his chronic ear infections were responsible for his silence, but within three months, he was truly in his own world. Suddenly, our happy little boy hardly seemed to recognize us or his 3-year-old sister. Miles wouldn't make eye contact or even try to communicate by pointing or gesturing. His behavior became increasingly strange: He'd drag his head across the floor, walk on his toes (very common in autistic children), make odd gurgling sounds, and spend long periods of time repeating an action, such as opening and closing doors or filling and emptying a cup of sand in the sandbox. He often screamed inconsolably, refusing to be held or comforted. And he developed chronic diarrhea. As I later learned, autism -- or autistic spectrum disorder, as doctors now call it -- is not a mental illness. It is a developmental disability thought to be caused by an anomaly in the brain. The National Institutes of Health estimates that as many as 1 in 500 children are affected. But according to several recent studies, the incidence is rapidly rising: In Florida, for example, the number of autistic children has increased nearly 600 percent in the last ten years. Nevertheless, even though it is more common than Down syndrome, autism remains one of the least understood developmental disorders. We were told that Miles would almost definitely grow up to be severely impaired. He would never be able to make friends, have a meaningful conversation, learn in a regular classroom without special help, or live independently. We could only hope that with behavioral therapy, we might be able to teach him some of the social skills he'd never grasp on his own. I had always thought that the worst thing that could happen to anyone was to lose a child. Now it was happening to me but in a perverse, inexplicable way. Instead of condolences, I got uncomfortable glances, inappropriately cheerful reassurances, and the sense that some of my friends didn't want to return my calls. After Miles' initial diagnosis, I spent hours in the library, searching for the reason he'd changed so dramatically. Then I came across a book that mentioned an autistic child whose mother believed that his symptoms had been caused by a \"cerebral allergy\" to milk. I'd never heard of this, but the thought lingered in my mind because Miles drank an inordinate amount of milk -- at least half a gallon a day. I also remembered that a few months earlier, my mother had read that many kids with chronic ear infections are allergic to milk and wheat. \"You should take Miles off those foods and see if his ears clear up,\" she said. \"Milk, cheese, pasta, and Cheerios are the only foods he'll eat,\" I insisted. \"If I took them away, he'd starve.\" Then I realized that Miles' ear infections had begun when he was 11 months old, just after we had switched him from soy formula to cow's milk. He'd been on soy formula because my family was prone to allergies, and I'd read that soy might be better for him. I had breast-fed until he was 3 months old, but he didn't tolerate breast milk very well -- possibly because I was drinking lots of milk. There was nothing to lose, so I decided to eliminate all the dairy products from his diet. What happened next was nothing short of miraculous. Miles stopped screaming, he didn't spend as much time repeating actions, and by the end of the first week, he pulled on my hand when he wanted to go downstairs. For the first time in months, he let his sister hold his hands to sing \"Ring Around a Rosy.\" Two weeks later, a month after we'd seen the psychologist, my husband and I kept our appointment with a well-known developmental pediatrician to confirm the diagnosis of autism. Dr. Susan Hyman gave Miles a variety of tests and asked a lot of questions. We described the changes in his behavior since he'd stopped eating dairy products. Finally, Dr. Hyman looked at us sadly. \"I'm sorry,\" the specialist said. \"Your son is autistic. I admit the milk allergy issue is interesting, but I just don't think it could be responsible for Miles' autism or his recent improvement.\" We were terribly disheartened, but as each day passed, Miles continued to get better. A week later, when I pulled him up to sit on my lap, we made eye contact and he smiled. I started to cry -- at last he seemed to know who I was. He had been oblivious to his sister, but now he watched her play and even got angry when she took things away from him. Miles slept more soundly, but his diarrhea persisted. Although he wasn't even 2 yet, we put him in a special-ed nursery school three mornings a week and started an intensive one-on-one behavioral and language program that Dr. Hyman approved of. I'm a natural skeptic and my husband is a research scientist, so we decided to test the hypothesis that milk affected Miles' behavior. We gave him a couple of glasses one morning, and by the end of the day, he was walking on his toes, dragging his forehead across the floor, making strange sounds, and exhibiting the other bizarre behaviors we had almost forgotten. A few weeks later, the behaviors briefly returned, and we found out that Miles had eaten some cheese at nursery school. We became completely convinced that dairy products were somehow related to his autism. I wanted Dr. Hyman to see how well Miles was doing, so I sent her a video of him playing with his father and sister. She called right away. \"I'm simply floored,\" she told me. \"Miles has improved remarkably. Karyn, if I hadn't diagnosed him myself, I wouldn't have believed that he was the same child.\" I had to find out whether other kids had had similar experiences. I bought a modem for my -- not standard in 1995 -- and discovered an autism support group on the Internet. A bit embarrassed, I asked, \"Could my child's autism be related to milk?\" The response was overwhelming. Where had I been? Didn't I know about Karl Reichelt in Norway? Didn't I know about Paul Shattock in England? These researchers had preliminary evidence to validate what parents had been reporting for almost 20 years: Dairy products exacerbated the symptoms of autism. My husband, who has a Ph.D. in chemistry, got copies of the journal articles that the parents had mentioned on-line and went through them all carefully. As he explained it to me, it was theorized that a subtype of children with autism break down milk protein (casein) into peptides that affect the brain in the same way that hallucinogenic drugs do. A handful of scientists, some of whom were parents of kids with autism, had discovered compounds containing opiates -- a class of substances including opium and heroin -- in the urine of autistic children. The researchers theorized that either these children were missing an enzyme that normally breaks down the peptides into a digestible form, or the peptides were somehow leaking into the bloodstream before they could be digested. In a burst of excitement, I realized how much sense this made. It explained why Miles developed normally for his first year, when he drank only soy formula. It would also explain why he had later craved milk: Opiates are highly addictive. What's more, the odd behavior of autistic children has often been compared to that of someone hallucinating on LSD. My husband also told me that the other type of protein being broken down into a toxic form was gluten -- found in wheat, oats, rye, and barley, and commonly added to thousands of packaged foods. The theory would have sounded farfetched to my scientific husband if he hadn't seen the dramatic changes in Miles himself and remembered how Miles had self-limited his diet to foods containing wheat and dairy. As far as I was concerned, there was no question that the gluten in his diet would have to go. Busy as I was, I would learn to cook gluten-free meals. People with celiac disease are also gluten-intolerant, and I spent hours on-line gathering information. Within 48 hours of being gluten-free, 22-month-old Miles had his first solid stool, and his balance and coordination noticeably improved. A month or two later, he started speaking -- \"zawaff\" for giraffe, for example, and \"ayashoo\" for elephant. He still didn't call me Mommy, but he had a special smile for me when I picked him up from nursery school. However, Miles' local doctors -- his pediatrician, neurologist, geneticist, and gastroenterologist -- still scoffed at the connection between autism and diet. Even though dietary intervention was a safe, noninvasive approach to treating autism, until large controlled studies could prove that it worked, most of the medical community would have nothing to do with it. So my husband and I decided to become experts ourselves. We began attending autism conferences and phoning and e-mailing the European researchers. I also organized a support group for other parents of autistic children in my community. Although some parents weren't interested in exploring dietary intervention at first, they often changed their mind after they met Miles. Not every child with autism responded to the diet, but eventually there were about 50 local families whose children were gluten- and casein-free with exciting results. And judging by the number of people on Internet support lists, there were thousands of children around the world responding well to this diet. Fortunately, we found a new local pediatrician who was very supportive, and Miles was doing so well that I nearly sprang out of bed each morning to see the changes in him. One day, when Miles was 2 1/2, he held up a toy dinosaur for me to see. \"Wook, Mommy, issa Tywannosauwus Wex!\" Astonished, I held out my trembling hands. \"You called me Mommy!\" I said. He smiled and gave me a long hug. By the time Miles turned 3, all his doctors agreed that his autism had been completely cured. He tested at eight months above his age level in social, language, self-help, and motor skills, and he entered a regular preschool with no special-ed supports. His teacher told me that he was one of the most delightful, verbal, participatory children in the class. Today, at almost 6, Miles is among the most popular children in his first-grade class. He's reading at a fourth-grade level, has good friends, and recently acted out his part in the class play with flair. He is deeply attached to his older sister, and they spend hours engaged in the type of imaginative play that is never seen in kids with autism. My worst fears were never realized. We are terribly lucky. But I imagined all the other parents who might not be fortunate enough to learn about the diet. So in 1997, I started a newsletter and international support organization called Autism Network for Dietary Intervention (ANDI), along with another parent, Lisa Lewis, author of Special Diets for Special Kids (Future Horizons, 1998). We've gotten hundreds of letters and e-mails from parents worldwide whose kids use the diet successfully. Although it's best to have professional guidance when implementing the diet, sadly, most doctors are still skeptical. As I continue to study the emerging research, it has become increasingly clear to me that autism is a disorder related to the immune system. Most autistic children I know have several food allergies in addition to milk and wheat, and nearly all the parents in our group have or had at least one immune-related problem: thyroid disease, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, or allergies. Autistic children are probably genetically predisposed to immune-system abnormalities, but what triggers the actual disease? Many of the parents swore that their child's autistic behavior began at 15 months, shortly after the child received the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. When I examined such evidence as photos and videotapes to see exactly when Miles started to lose his language and social skills, I had to admit that it had coincided with his MMR -- after which he had gone to the emergency room with a temperature of 106\ufffdF and febrile seizures. Recently, a small study was published by British researcher Andrew Wakefield, M.D., linking the measles portion of the vaccine to damage in the small intestine -- which might help explain the mechanism by which the hallucinogenic peptides leak into the bloodstream. If the MMR vaccine is indeed found to play a role in triggering autism, we must find out whether some children are at higher risk and therefore should not be vaccinated or should be vaccinated at a later age. Another new development is giving us hope: Researchers at Johnson and Johnson's Ortho Clinical Diagnostics division -- my husband among them -- are now studying the abnormal presence of peptides in the urine of autistic children. My hope is that eventually a routine diagnostic test will be developed to identify children with autism at a young age and that when some types of autism are recognized as a metabolic disorder, the gluten and dairy-free diet will move from the realm of alternative medicine into the mainstream. The word autism, which once meant so little to me, has changed my life profoundly. It came to my house like a monstrous, uninvited guest but eventually brought its own gifts. I've felt twice blessed -- once by the amazing good fortune of reclaiming my child and again by being able to help other autistic children who had been written off by their doctors and mourned by their parents.Adapted from the book Unraveling the Mystery of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder: A Mother's Story of Research and Recovery by Karyn Seroussi. Published by Simon & Schuster February 2000. Autism Diet Let's start with most simple part of this program: Autism diet. When it comes to diet, it is very important to avoid eating Toxins and Foods that Kill. Please follow those links and learn what are The Toxins I am talking about and what are those Foods that Kill . Now, important part of your diet should also be Water Cure. Please, become familiar with Water Cure. Your Diet should contain: Foods That Heal, Vegetable juices, Fats that Heal, Unrefined Sea Salt. Also, try to understand food tolerance. You can not find the right Autism diet, unless you fully understand and learn about food tolerance.

The term spectrum refers to the fact that some people have a few mild symptoms while others have severe symptoms that are disabling. There are several types of ASD; the most common include:Autistic disorder (classic autism, sometimes called early infantile autism, childhood autism, or Kanner's autism)Asperger disorder (also known as Asperger syndrome)Pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), including atypical autismThese disorders share some of the same symptoms, but differ in the age at which symptoms begin, the severity of the symptoms, and how the symptoms are expressed. This topic will discuss general information about autism spectrum disorders, as well as the signs and symptoms of the most common type of ASD, autistic disorder.How does autism develop? \u2014 It is not clear how or why autism develops. The general consensus is that autism spectrum disorders are a genetic disorder that affects brain development and impairs the development of social and communication skills. This, in turn, leads to the typical symptoms of ASD. (See 'Symptoms of autistic disorder' below.)Environmental factors such as toxic exposures before or after birth, complications during delivery, and infections before birth may be responsible for a small percentage of cases. In children with a genetic predisposition, environmental factors may further increase the child's risk of developing autism spectrum disorder. It is not currently possible to test a child's genes to determine if he or she is at risk for ASD.Some authors have attributed autism to vaccine exposure (particularly measles vaccine and thimerosal, a mercury preservative used in vaccines). However, the overwhelming majority of scientific studies do not support an association between immunizations and autism. (See \"Patient information: Childhood immunizations\".)How common is autism? \u2014 The number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in the United States and other countries has increased since the 1970s, and particularly since the late 1990s. It is not clear if the increase is related to changes in the criteria used to diagnose ASD or if the condition has become more common over time. Most experts agree that increased awareness of autism and changes in the definition of ASD account for much of the apparent increase in the prevalence of autism.Between 2 and 6.7 children per 1000 have autism spectrum disorder, and it affects more boys than girls (approximately four boys for every one girl). Approximately 2 to 8 percent of siblings of children with ASD also have the condition.Medical conditions associated with autism \u2014 There are a number of medical conditions associated with autism.Between 45 and 60 percent of children with autism are mentally retarded.Seizures occur in 11 to 39 percent of children with ASD. The risk of seizures is higher in individuals with more severe intellectual disability (mental retardation). (See \"Patient information: Seizures in children\".)A minority (fewer than 10 to 25 percent) of cases of ASD are associated with a medical condition or syndrome, such as phenylketonuria, fetal alcohol syndrome, tuberous sclerosus, fragile X syndrome, or Angelman syndrome. These syndromes are usually diagnosed at or shortly after birth.SYMPTOMS OF AUTISTIC DISORDERSymptoms of autistic disorder are usually recognized between two and three years of age, although they may be present earlier. By definition, symptoms must be present by three years of age.In approximately two-thirds of children with autism, the first sign is a lack of communication skills by two years of age. The remaining children have relatively normal development during the first 12 to 24 months of life, followed by a period of regression (when the child loses skills he or she had previously attained). Reasons for parents to seek help are discussed below. (See 'When to seek help' below.)Social interaction \u2014 Difficulty with or lack of interaction with family and friends is a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder. Components of social interaction include nonverbal behaviors, peer relationships, joint attention, and social reciprocity (which are explained below).Nonverbal behaviors \u2014 Individuals with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty using and interpreting nonverbal behaviors such as eye contact, facial expression, gestures, and body postures. For example, a child may not be able to understand the facial expressions associated with anger or annoyance.During infancy, parents may notice that the baby resists cuddling, avoids eye contact, or does not spread the arms in anticipation of being picked up; however, these behaviors are not universal.Peer relationships \u2014 Individuals with autism spectrum disorder often have a hard time learning to interact with other people. Younger children may have little or no interest in developing friendships. They may prefer to play alone rather than playing with others, and may involve others in activities only as tools or mechanical aids (ie, using the hand of a parent to obtain a desired object without making eye contact).Older children may become more interested in talking or socializing with other people, but may not understand social conventions or the needs of others. As an example, the child may continue talking about a topic of their own interest with complete disregard for the interests of the listener.Joint attention \u2014 Individuals with autism spectrum disorder are not interested in sharing activities, interests, or achievements; this is referred to as impaired joint attention.Joint attention is a normal behavior in which an infant or toddler tries to share interest, amusement, or fear with a caretaker. The child does this by purposefully looking back and forth between an object and the eyes of the caretaker (usually by eight to 10 months of age), or by pointing to the object (usually by 14 to 16 months of age). Older children with ASD may not show or bring an object to the caretaker.Social referencing \u2014 Individuals with autism spectrum disorder are sometimes not able to share a pleasurable activity with others. As an example, the child may prefer to play alone amidst a crowd of children engaged in the same activity.Communication \u2014 The second hallmark of autism spectrum disorder is significant difficulty with communication. This is the most common concern of parents, which often leads the parent to seek medical attention. The child may lack the ability to speak or understand and/or may show no interest in communicating.Language \u2014 A delayed or absent ability to speak is a feature of autism. Unlike children with a hearing impairment, children with autism spectrum disorder do not try to compensate for their lack of speech by using alternate means of communication, like gesturing or miming. In most individuals with ASD, the ability to understand is delayed even more than the ability to speak. Children may not respond to their name, and the parent may initially be concerned that the child has a hearing problem. A child may not be able to understand simple questions or directions.There is wide variability in the severity and quality of language problems in children with autism. The ability to speak never develops in approximately one-half of affected children. In others, the child is able to speak, but language is not used as a tool for communication (eg, it consists of repeating phrases or words spoken by others, called echolalia).Those who are able to speak may have difficulty starting or sustaining a conversation with others. Their language may have meaning only to people who are familiar with the autistic individual's communication style.Play \u2014 Lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or imitation is a characteristic feature of autism. Children with autism spectrum disorder may line up an exact number of playthings in the same manner, without awareness of what the toys represent. They may focus on parts of toys rather than the function of the toy. They may not engage in pretend play, which usually develops by two years of age. Even if pretend play develops, the child may simply be mimicking what has been seen on television or in books.Behavior \u2014 The third hallmark of autism spectrum disorder is repetitive behaviors and interests.Preoccupations \u2014 Younger children may be preoccupied with peculiar sensory objects or experiences, such as spinning objects, shiny surfaces, the edge of objects, lights, odors, or sniffing or licking nonfood objects.Older children may be preoccupied with the weather, dates, schedules, phone numbers, license plates, cartoon characters, or other items (eg, dinosaurs, dogs, planes). Rituals \u2014 Many children with autism spectrum disorder have specific routines or rituals that must be followed exactly. These may occur as a part of daily life, such as the need to always eat particular foods in a specific order, or to follow the same route from one place to another without deviation. Changes in routine can be upsetting or frustrating, even causing the child to have a tantrum or meltdown.Motor mannerisms \u2014 Another behavioral feature of autism spectrum disorder is repetitive body movements, such as hand or finger flapping or twisting, rocking, swaying, dipping, or walking on tip-toe. These behaviors are seen in 37 to 95 percent of individuals with ASD, and commonly begin during the preschool years. These behaviors are often lifelong.Cognitive skills \u2014 Cognitive skills include the ability to think, remember, and process information. In children with autism, these skills are often uneven, regardless of the child's level of intelligence. The ability to speak clearly is usually not as good as nonverbal skills. The person can often perform tasks that require memorization or putting things together (eg, puzzles), but may have difficulty with tasks that require higher-level skills, such as reasoning, interpretation, or abstract thinking.Some individuals have special skills (ie, savant skills) in memory, mathematics, music, art, or puzzles, despite significant difficulties in other areas. Other special skills can include calendar calculation (determining the day of the week for a given date) and hyperlexia (the ability to read written words that are far above the person's reading level). However, the person does not usually understand what is being read or the purpose of reading.Sensory perception \u2014 Many people with autism spectrum disorder perceive sounds, tastes, or touch abnormally. For example, the person may be overly sensitive to normal noise levels or have no response to loud noises.Other examples include:Refusal to eat foods with certain tastes or textures, or eating only foods with certain tastes and textures. These dietary obsessions can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, such as weight loss, diarrhea, or constipation. Malnutrition can also occur, even if the child eats an adequate number of calories per day. This can lead to serious deficiencies of important vitamins such as calcium, vitamin D, and/or vitamin C.Resistance to being touched or increased sensitivity to certain kinds of touch; light touch may be experienced as painful, whereas deep pressure may provide a sense of calm. This may include resistance to the feel of certain clothing textures or colors next to the skin.Apparent indifference to pain.Hypersensitivity to certain frequencies or types of sound (eg, distant fire engines) and lack of response to sounds close by or sounds that would startle other children (eg, firecrackers).Macrocephaly \u2014 Approximately one-fourth of children with autism spectrum disorder have a larger than normal-size head. The medical term for this is macrocephaly. This may be related to abnormalities in early brain development, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of autism discussed above.AUTISM DIAGNOSISIf a child has symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, s/he is usually evaluated by a team that has expertise in diagnosing and managing the condition. This team often includes a child psychologist, developmental-behavioral pediatrician, neurologist, psychiatrist, speech therapist, and other professionals.The evaluation usually includes a complete medical history (of the child and family), physical examination, neurologic examination, and testing of the child's social, language, and cognitive skills. In addition, the parent(s) will have time to discuss the child's behavior and any other concerns.The purpose of the evaluation includes the following:Determine if the child has ASD or if another condition could be causing the child's symptoms.Determine if the child has any ASD-associated medical problems that should be evaluated or treated.Determine the child's strengths, weaknesses, and level of functioning.WHEN TO SEEK HELPSome common symptoms of autism spectrum disorder are listed in table 1 (table 1).Parents who notice that their child has one or more symptoms of autism spectrum disorder should talk the child's healthcare provider. The provider should screen the child for ASD according to the American Academy of Pediatrics algorithm (algorithm 1).If the provider's evaluation raises red flags for autism, the child should be referred for a complete evaluation for autism spectrum disorder. Early diagnosis and treatment of ASD can modify some autistic behaviors and improve socialization. (See 'Autism diagnosis' above.)Even before the complete evaluation, the child should be referred for a hearing test (if not done previously) and for early intervention services. Early intervention is a support system that provides appropriate therapies for children with disabilities. It can help to minimize delays and maximize the child's chance of reaching normal milestones in development. Even if the child is not diagnosed with autism, early intervention services can help to address parents' concerns (eg, delayed language skills, temper tantrums).AUTISM TREATMENTAutism cannot be cured. However, a healthcare provider can work with parents to develop a treatment plan to help the child reach his or her full potential. The optimal treatment plan depends upon the child's age, diagnosis, underlying medical problems, and other individual factors.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a plan that provides structure, direction, and organization for the child [1]. In the United States, services are often provided through an early intervention program, administered by the individual states. Information about services for children with autism is available through the National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities (www.nichcy.org).Other resources for parents and providers are listed below. (See 'Where to get more information' below.)WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATIONYour child's healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your child's medical problem. Because no two people are exactly alike and recommendations can vary from one person to another, it is important to seek guidance from a provider who is familiar with your child's situation.This discussion will be updated as needed every four months on our web site (www.uptodate.com/patients).

Students with autism have unique abilities and needs which require special considerations in designing, implementing and evaluating their educational programs. Educators need a better understanding of the educational approaches and program structures that are effective for these students. The prevalence of autism has been steadily increasing, from 3,443 school age students identified with autism in 1995 to 5,142 in 1998. This increase may be due to a number of factors, including but not limited to better diagnostic procedures and earlier diagnosis and greater awareness of the autism disorders. While much is now known about autism and the benefits of early diagnosis and appropriate education, widespread practice of effective educational interventions has yet to follow. In New York State, significant efforts are being made to address the unique needs of children with autism.

Peer Sensitivity and Anti-Bullying Program NFAR recently awarded a first-of-its-kind Peer Sensitivity and Anti-Bullying grant for a middle school campaign designed to teach awareness and understanding of autism among mainstream students. Noting a 1000% increase in students with autism in their school district since 2001, educators at Eastlake Middle School developed a program that will involve six general education English and two Video Production classrooms with the goal of teaching all students the value of each individual and the importance of creating a culture where bullying in any form is not tolerated. NFAR looks forward to following the school's progress and believes this grant will help create an environment of greater awareness, sensitivity and opportunity for students with autism. sensitivity English Autism Taught Her Lesson By Jennifer Havlat NFAR Autism Teachers Grant READ MORE..

(via) Over the years, it has been debated whether or not factors other than neurological ones have anything to do with Autism and other\ufffd Neurological Disorders. Studies have found that many ND s begin in the stomach and can be results of a poor or lacking diet. Gluten has been one of the things connected to Autism, and many parents adopt a no bread - no dairty - all gluten free diet for their children. Also, it is believed that the bodies of children are often overwhelmed with heavy metals, toxins, viruses (from vaccines), and bacteria.\ufffd These factors often cause a slower or even stopped biochemical pathways to the body. Biomedical Treatments is based upon the belief that the neurological symptoms experienced are the direct result of the physical ailments that children are having, and if the physical is treated, a great deal of symptoms can be alleviated. The main steps in a Biomedical Treatment are: 1. Decrease the level of toxins 2.Help the stomach to heal 3. Increase nutrients 4. Get rid of metals and other toxins. It is believed that once these things are achieved, the neurological impairments will greatly improve. The most important and in depth step is the first step Decrease the level of toxins.There are numerous things that are toxic to the body, and as many, if not all must be removed in order to achieve the greatest results. The things that can and should be removed are both dietary and environmental. From a diet aspect:\ufffd gluten, dairy, allergens, and bad sugars should all be removed from the diet. Household cleaners should be removed and replaced with natural forms. If your child needs dental work, be sure not to have silver fillings put in their mouths, as they contain mercury. Add a Hepa Air Filter to your child s room. Ensure that any vaccinations that need to be given are Thimerosal free. Use a fluoride-free toothpaste From here, it s necessary to allow and assist the damages already infringed on the body to heal. This is often helpful if a combination of\ufffd vitamins are used. Cod Liver Oil, for example has a necessary level of Vitamin A and also aids in the repairing of intestinal walls. It s also essential to use digestive enzymes and Colostrum (a stomach healing natural supplement) to better help in the body s repair. Also important is to keep the level of nutrients up by giving a sufficient level of Vitamins (A, D, B, Zinc, etc.) in order for the body to not only heal, but become stronger. To restore your child to good health, getting the toxins out via detoxification is helpful. There are natural detoxifires as well as medicinal (Chelation). Bottom line, Biomedical Treatment is still being tested among Autism and Neurological Disorder patients. There\ufffd are many success stories. There are also doctors who believe that this method does not work, as they had no success with it. It s important to keep in mind that the diets of children are traditionally very poor due to the Americanized diet. With that in mind, the removal of the poor diet and repairing of the body may take a little longer than expected due to the damages in the body.

Richard Burr (R-NC) has introduced the Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005, S1873, that would create a new agency in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to research and develop strategies to combat bioterrorism and natural diseases. While Congress has created several agencies recently in response to homeland security concerns, most notably the Department of Homeland Security, Burr proposes for the first time ever to completely exempt this new agency from all open government laws. The legislation has already passed out of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and is now before the full Senate.The Act creates the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA) to work on countering bioterrorism and natural diseases. Apparently in an attempt to protect any and all sensitive information on U.S. counter-bioterrorism efforts or vulnerabilities to biological threats, Burrs has included in the legislation the first-ever blanket exemption from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The legislation states that, \"Information that relates to the activities, working groups, and advisory boards of the BARDA shall not be subject to disclosure\" under FOIA \"unless the Secretary [of HHS] or Director [of BARDA] determines that such disclosure would pose no threat to national security.\"Neither the CIA nor the Defense Department has such an exemption. Burr\ufffds spokesperson argues that the exemption is necessary to protect national security claiming that \"there will be times where for national security reasons certain information would have to be withheld.\" For instance, the BARDA should not, according to the spokesperson, be required to publicly disclose information pertaining to a deadly virus.FOIA, however, already includes an exemption for national security information, as well as eight other exemptions ranging from privacy issues to confidential business information and law enforcement investigations. If the public disclosure of information would threaten national security, then the government may withhold the requested information. \"The well-established and time-tested FOIA provisions already address Burr's concerns,\" explains Sean Moulton, OMB Watch senior policy analyst, \"thereby making the blanket exemption for BARDA unnecessary and unwise.\"Congress established and strengthened FOIA over the years to create a reasonable, consistent level of accountability among government agencies. Under FOIA, when the public requests agency records, the agency is compelled to collect and review the requested information. The only decision for the agency is whether specific records can or can not be released under the law based on the exemptions from disclosure written into the law. However, the Burr legislation reverses the process: it does not require BARDA to collect or review the requests for disclosure. Instead, the agency can automatically reject requests. Still more troubling, the law prohibits any challenges of determinations by the Director of BARDA or Secretary of HHS, stating that the determination of the Director or Secretary with regards to the decision to withhold information \"shall not be subject to judicial review.\"Mark Tapscott at the Heritage Foundation writes that \"BARDA will essentially be accountable to nobody and can operate without having to worry about troublesome interference from courts or private citizens like you and me.\"This move to restrict the reach of FOIA appears in stark contrast to the recent Senate vote to strengthen open government. Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) co-sponsored FOIA reform legislation, passed by the Senate in June, that \"will bring additional sunshine to the federal legislative process, and was another step toward strengthening the Freedom of Information Act.\"The Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act also exempts BARDA from important parts of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires public disclosure of advice given to the executive branch by advisory committees, task forces, boards and commissions.Other provisions of the bill compound the troubling secrecy provisions. They include:Giving BARDA the authority to sign exclusive contracts with drug manufacturers and forbidding the agency from purchasing generic versions of these drugs or vaccines.Authorizing BARDA to issue grants and rebates for drug companies to produce vaccines.Providing liability protection to drug manufacturers for drugs and vaccines not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, by requiring the secretary of HHS find that a drug company willfully caused injury. The FOIA exemption in combination with these provisions would prevent the public from knowing whether BARDA is effectively completing these duties. Only information on agency actions could establish if the new agency is protecting the public from bioterrorism and infectious disease or if it is simply providing handouts to drug companies that creates no added security.\"It is essential that open government safeguards remain in place for all agencies,\" Moulton continues. \"It is extremely important to ensure that the nation is protected against pandemics and bioterrorist attacks, but such efforts must not be excluded from open government. By providing the mechanisms for government accountability, these safeguards ensure that the government meets its responsibility to protect the public. In the end, an accountable government is a stronger government which acts to effectively meet all threats, including pandemics and bioterrorism.\"Burr is still in the process of revising the Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act, and, with the Senate's incredibly tight schedule, the timing of the bill's introduction on the floor remains uncertain. In the meantime, supporters are rumored to be seeking out a Democratic cosponsor to give it momentum.

With autism, the different areas of the brain fail to work together. Most people with autism will always have some trouble relating to others. But early diagnosis and treatment have helped more and more people with autism to reach their full potential.What causes autism?Autism tends to run in families, so experts think it may be something that you inherit. Scientists are trying to find out exactly which genes may be responsible for passing down autism in families. Other studies are looking at whether autism can be caused by other medical problems or by something in your child?s surroundings.Some people think that childhood vaccines cause autism, especially the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine. But studies have not shown this to be true. It?s important to make sure that your child gets all childhood vaccines. They help keep your child from getting serious diseases that can cause harm or even death. What are the symptoms? Symptoms almost always start before a child is 3 years old. Usually, parents first notice that their toddler has not started talking yet and is not acting like other children the same age. But it is not unusual for a child to start to talk at the same time as other children the same age, then lose his or her language skills.Symptoms of autism include:A delay in learning to talk, or not talking at all. A child may seem to be deaf, even though hearing tests are normal.Repeated and overused types of behavior, interests, and play. Examples include repeated body rocking, unusual attachments to objects, and getting very upset when routines change.There is no \"typical\" person with autism. People can have many different kinds of behaviors, from mild to severe. Parents often say that their child with autism prefers to play alone and does not make eye contact with other people. Autism may also include other problems:Many children have below-normal intelligence. Teenagers often become depressed and have a lot of anxiety, especially if they have average or above-average intelligence. Some children get a seizure disorder such as epilepsy by their teen years. How is autism diagnosed?There are guidelines your doctor will use to see if your child has symptoms of autism. The guidelines put symptoms into three categories:Social interactions and relationships.For example, a child may have trouble making eye contact. People with autism may have a hard time understanding someone else?s feelings, such as pain or sadness.Verbal and nonverbal communication.For example, a child may never speak. Or he or she may often repeat a certain phrase over and over.Limited interests in activities or play.For example, younger children often focus on parts of toys rather than playing with the whole toy. Older children and adults may be fascinated by certain topics, like trading cards or license plates.Your child may also have a hearing test and some other tests to make sure that problems are not caused by some other condition.How is it treated?Treatment for autism involves special behavioral training. Behavioral training rewards good behavior (positive reinforcement) to teach children social skills and to teach them how to communicate and how to help themselves as they grow older. With early treatment, most children with autism learn to relate better to others. They learn to communicate and to help themselves as they grow older.Depending on the child, treatment may also include such things as speech therapy or physical therapy. Medicine is sometimes used to treat problems such as depression or obsessive-compulsive behaviors.Exactly what type of treatment your child needs depends on the symptoms, which are different for each child and may change over time. Because people with autism are so different, something that helps one person may not help another. So it?s important to work with everyone involved in your child?s education and care to find the best way to manage symptoms.How can your family deal with having a child with autism? An important part of your child's treatment plan is making sure that other family members get training about autism and how to manage symptoms. Training can reduce family stress and help your child function better. Some families need more help than others.Take advantage of every kind of help you can find. Talk to your doctor about what help is available where you live. Family, friends, public agencies, and autism organizations are all possible resources.Remember these tips:Plan breaks. Daily demands of caring for a child with autism can take their toll. Planned breaks will help the whole family.Get extra help when your child gets older. The teen years can be a very hard time for children with autism.Get in touch with other families who have children with autism. You can talk about your problems and share advice with people who will understand.Raising a child with autism is hard work. But with support and training, your family can learn how to cope.

Symptoms may include: Significant problems developing nonverbal communication skills, such as eye-to-eye gazing, facial expressions, and body posture.Failure to establish friendships with children the same age. Lack of interest in sharing enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people.Lack of empathy. People with autism may have difficulty understanding another person's feelings, such as pain or sorrow.Verbal and nonverbal communication. Symptoms may include: Delay in, or lack of, learning to talk. As many as 40% of people with autism never speak.1Problems taking steps to start a conversation. Also, people with autism have difficulties continuing a conversation after it has begun.Stereotyped and repetitive use of language. People with autism often repeat over and over a phrase they have heard previously (echolalia).Difficulty understanding their listener's perspective. For example, a person with autism may not understand that someone is using humor. They may interpret the communication word for word and fail to catch the implied meaning.Limited interests in activities or play. Symptoms may include: An unusual focus on pieces. Younger children with autism often focus on parts of toys, such as the wheels on a car, rather than playing with the entire toy. Preoccupation with certain topics. For example, older children and adults may be fascinated by video games, trading cards, or license plates.A need for sameness and routines. For example, a child with autism may always need to eat bread before salad and insist on driving the same route every day to school.Stereotyped behaviors. These may include body rocking and hand flapping.Symptoms during childhood Symptoms of autism are usually noticed first by parents and other caregivers sometime during the child's first 3 years. Although autism is present at birth (congenital), signs of the disorder can be difficult to identify or diagnose during infancy. Parents often become concerned when their toddler does not like to be held; does not seem interested in playing certain games, such as peekaboo; and does not begin to talk. Sometimes, a child will start to talk at the same time as other children the same age, then lose his or her language skills. They also may be confused about their child's hearing abilities. It often seems that a child with autism does not hear, yet at other times, he or she may appear to hear a distant background noise, such as the whistle of a train.With early and intensive treatment, most children improve their ability to relate to others, communicate, and help themselves as they grow older. Contrary to popular myths about children with autism, very few are completely socially isolated or \"live in a world of their own.\"Symptoms during teen yearsDuring the teen years, the patterns of behavior often change. Many teens gain skills but still lag behind in their ability to relate to and understand others. Puberty and emerging sexuality may be more difficult for teens who have autism than for others this age. Teens are at an increased risk for developing problems related to depression, anxiety, and epilepsy. Symptoms in adulthoodSome adults with autism are able to work and live on their own. The degree to which an adult with autism can lead an independent life is related to intelligence and ability to communicate. At least 33% are able to achieve at least partial independence.2Some adults with autism need a lot of assistance, especially those with low intelligence who are unable to speak. Part- or full-time supervision can be provided by residential treatment programs. At the other end of the spectrum, adults with high-functioning autism are often successful in their professions and able to live independently, although they typically continue to have some difficulties relating to other people. These individuals usually have average to above-average intelligence.Other symptomsMany people with autism have symptoms similar to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). But these symptoms, especially problems with social relationships, are more severe for people with autism. For more information, see the topic Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.About 10% of people with autism have some form of savant skills?special limited gifts such as memorizing lists, calculating calendar dates, drawing, or musical ability.1Many people with autism have unusual sensory perceptions. For example, they may describe a light touch as painful and deep pressure as providing a calming feeling. Others may not feel pain at all. Some people with autism have strong food likes and dislikes and unusual preoccupations. Sleep problems occur in about 40% to 70% of people with autism.3Other conditionsAutism is one of several types of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), also called autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is not unusual for autism to be confused with other PDDs, such as Asperger's disorder or syndrome, or to have overlapping symptoms. A similar condition is called pervasive developmental disorder-NOS (not otherwise specified). PDD-NOS occurs when children display similar behaviors but do not meet the criteria for autism. It is commonly called just PDD. In addition, other conditions with similar symptoms may also have similarities to or occur with autism. Exams and Tests The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening children for autism during regularly scheduled well-child visits. This policy helps doctors identify signs of autism early in its course. Early diagnosis and treatment can help the child reach his or her full potential.When a developmental delay is recognized in a child, further testing can help a doctor determine whether the problem is related to autism, another pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), or a condition with similar symptoms, such as language delays or avoidant personality disorder. If your primary care provider does not have specific training or experience in developmental problems, he or she may refer your child to a specialist?usually a developmental pediatrician, psychiatrist, speech therapist, or child psychiatrist? for the additional testing.Behavioral assessments. Various guidelines and questionnaires are used to help a doctor determine the specific type of developmental delay a child has. These include:2Medical history. During the medical history interview, a doctor asks general questions about a child's development, such as whether a child shows parents things by pointing to objects. Young children with autism often point to items they want, but do not point to show parents an item and then check to see if parents are looking at the item being pointed out. Diagnostic guidelines for autism. The American Association of Childhood and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) has established guidelines for diagnosing autism.2 The criteria are designed so a doctor can assess a child's behavior relating to core symptoms of autism. The criteria are designed for children age 3 and older.Other behavioral questionnaires. Additional diagnostic tests focus on children younger than age 3. Clinical observations. A doctor may want to observe the developmentally delayed child in different situations. The parents may be asked to interpret whether certain behaviors are usual for the child in those circumstances.Developmental and intelligence tests. The AACAP also recommends that tests be given to evaluate whether a child's developmental delays affect his or her ability to think and make decisions.Physical assessments and laboratory tests.Other tests may be used to determine whether a physical problem may be causing symptoms. These tests include: Physical examination, including head circumference, weight, and height measurements, to determine whether the child has a normal growth pattern.Hearing tests, to determine whether hearing problems may be causing developmental delays, especially those related to social skills and language use.Testing for lead poisoning, especially if a condition called pica (in which a person craves substances that are not food, such as dirt or flecks of old paint) is present. Children with developmental delays usually continue putting items in their mouth after this stage has passed in normally developing children. This practice can result in lead poisoning, which should be identified and treated as soon as possible.Additional laboratory tests may be done under specific circumstances. These tests include:Chromosomal analysis, which may be done if mental retardation is present or there is a family history of mental retardation. For example, fragile X syndrome, which causes a range of below-normal intelligence problems as well as autistic-like behaviors, can be identified with a chromosomal analysis. An electroencephalograph (EEG), which is done if there are symptoms of seizures, such as a history of staring spells or if a person reverts to less mature behavior (developmental regression).A magnetic resonance image (MRI), which may be done if there are signs of differences in the structure of the brain.Early detectionAll doctors who see infants and children for well-child visits should watch for early signs of developmental disorders. Developmental screening tools, such as the Ages and Stages Questionnaire or the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), can help assess behavior. If a doctor discovers the following obvious signs of developmental delays, the child should immediately be evaluated:4No babbling, pointing, or other gestures by 12 monthsNo single words by 16 monthsNo 2-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months, with the exception of repeated phrases (echolalia)Any loss of any language or social skills at any ageIf there are no obvious signs of developmental delays or any unusual indications from the screening tests, most infants and children do not need further evaluation until the next well-child visit.But children who have a sibling with autism should continue to be closely monitored, because they are at increased risk for autism and other developmental problems. In addition to the evaluations at well-child visits, these children should undergo testing for language delays, learning problems, poor socialization skills, and any symptoms that might suggest they have anxiety or depression.4When socialization, learning, or behavior problems develop in a person at any time or at any age, he or she should also be evaluated.Treatment OverviewEarly diagnosis and treatment helps young children with autism develop to their full potential. The primary goal of treatment is to improve the overall ability of the child to function.Symptoms and behaviors of autism can combine in many ways and vary in severity. In addition, individual symptoms and behaviors often change over time. For these reasons, treatment strategies are tailored to individual needs and available family resources. But, in general, children with autism respond best to highly structured and specialized treatment. A program that addresses helping parents and improving communication, social, behavioral, adaptive, and learning aspects of a child's life will be most successful. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends the following strategies for helping a child to improve overall function and reach his or her potential:5Behavioral training and management. Behavioral training and management uses positive reinforcement, self-help, and social skills training to improve behavior and communication. Many types of treatments have been developed, including Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), and sensory integration. Specialized therapies. These include speech, occupational, and physical therapy. These therapies are important components of managing autism and should all be included in various aspects of the child's treatment program. Speech therapy can help a child with autism improve language and social skills to communicate more effectively. Occupational and physical therapy can help improve any deficiencies in coordination and motor skills. Occupational therapy may also help a child with autism to learn to process information from the senses (sight, sound, hearing, touch, and smell) in more manageable ways.Medicines. Medicines are most commonly used to treat related conditions and problem behaviors, including depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors.Community support and parent training. Talk to your doctor or contact an advocacy group for support and training. Many people with autism have sleep problems. These are usually treated by staying on a routine, including a set bedtime and time to get up. Your doctor may try medicines as a last resort.3Stories about alternative therapies, such as secretin and auditory integration training, have circulated in the media and other information sources. When you are considering any type of treatment, it is important to know the source of information and to ensure that studies are scientifically sound. Accounts of individual success are not sufficient evidence to support using a treatment. Look for large, controlled studies to validate claims. Experts have not yet identified a way to prevent autism. Public concern over stories linking autism and childhood vaccines has persisted. But numerous studies have failed to show any evidence of a link between autism and the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.6, 7 If you avoid having your children immunized, you put them and others in your community at risk for developing serious diseases, which can cause serious harm or even death.Home Treatment Having a child with autism requires taking a proactive approach to learning about the condition and its treatment while working closely with others involved in your child's care. You also need to take care of yourself so that you are able to face the many challenges of having a child with autism.Educate yourself about autism Ask your doctor or contact autism organizations to find training about autism and how to manage symptoms. Parent and family education has been shown to reduce family stress and improve a child's functioning.5 Understanding the condition and knowing what to expect is an important part of helping your child develop independence. Become informed about your child's educational rights. Federal laws require services for handicapped children, including those with autism. In addition, there may be state and local laws or policies to aid children with autism. Find out what services are available for your child in your area.Learning about autism will also help prepare you for when your child reaches adulthood. Some adults with autism can live by themselves, work, and be as independent as other people their age. Others need continued support. Work closely with others who care for your child Close communication with others involved in your child's education and care will help all concerned. The best treatment for children with autism is a team approach and a consistent, structured program. Everyone involved needs to work together to set goals for:Education.Identifying and managing symptoms of autism and any related conditions. Behavior and interactions with family and peers, adjustment to different environments, and social and communication skills.Work closely with the health professionals involved in your child's care. It is important that they take time to listen to your concerns and are willing to work with you.Take care of yourself Learn ways to handle the normal range of emotions, fears, and concerns that go along with raising a child with autism. The daily and long-term challenges put you and your other children at an increased risk for depression or stress-related illnesses. The way you handle these issues influences other family members.Get involved in a hobby, visit with friends, and learn ways to relax. Seek and accept support from others. Consider using respite care, which is a family support service that provides a break for parents and siblings. In addition, support groups for parents and siblings are generally available. People who participate in support groups can benefit from others' experiences. For more information on support groups in your area, contact the Autism Society of America at www.autism-society.org.Talk with a doctor about whether counseling would help if you or one of your children is having trouble handling the strains related to having a family member with autism.Other Places To Get HelpBooksEducating Children With AutismAuthor/Editor: Committee on Educational Interventions for Children With AutismPublisher: National Academies Press\ufffdWashington, DC\ufffd\ufffd20055Publication Date: 2001\ufffdThis book is a summary of research by the Committee on Educational Interventions for Children with Autism.

It is difficult to understand the behaviour of people with autism, and the world is confusing for the child who suffers from it. Autism affects approximately one in 1,000 Australians. Boys are more likely to be affected than girls. Autism is a developmental disability thought to be a brain disorder. A person with autism has difficulties in some areas of their development, but other areas may be unaffected. The areas most affected are communication, social interaction and behaviour. Signs of autism Communication is difficult. People with autism often have difficulty understanding the meaning and purpose of body language and the spoken and written word. They may misunderstand words, interpret them literally or not understood at all. Other people s feelings and emotions can also be difficult to understand. Social interaction is confusing Social interaction is an essential part of life for most people. People with autism find being sociable difficult, scary and confusing. Some people appear to withdraw and become isolated; others try very hard to be sociable but never seem to get it right. People with autism can find friendships difficult. Behaviours linked with autism Difficulties with communication and social interaction produce a range of behaviours that have become linked with autism. These may include: Speech - absent, delayed or abnormal patterns. Play - isolated, repetitive, unimaginative, destructive and obsessive. Body movements - stereotypical behaviour (such as flapping and toe walking) and other behaviours that may cause self-injury (such as hand biting). Obsessional behaviour - with favourite topics, objects, places, people or activities. Rituals - rituals and routines bring some order to chaos and confusion. A change to routine can be very difficult to cope with. Tantrums - can be a way to express extreme confusion and/or frustration. Sensory sensitivities - to certain sounds, colours, tastes, smells and textures. Type of help available Assessment - a detailed, multidisciplinary assessment should ensure a proper diagnosis. Some children show signs of autism by the age of two, but a firm diagnosis may not be possible until three or older. Education programs - the educational needs of each child vary. Intensive, specialised programs may be desirable for some children with autism while the needs of other children may be met by non-specialist early intervention or mainstream services depending on the child s level of functioning and need. Children may benefit greatly from being with their peers, and parents will need to choose between regular or specialist schools for their child to attend. Parent support - the family is likely to need some support. Parents may need specialised services, such as respite and residential care (child care help), social skills training and living skills training.

Since we first launched OAARSN in early 2000, this question is asked much more frequently, as popular interest and research have increased. But it is no easier to answer in 2009 than it was then. Autism is a very confusing diagnostic label. The term is used both for a more specific syndrome of abnormal development and also for a much broader range of related disorders. As their causes are not yet known, these disorders are defined in terms of sets of behavioural symptoms which are not the same in every affected person. If we were to enter a room full of persons who had been diagnosed with Autism, we would be struck far more by the differences than by the similarities among them. Websites concerned with Autism usually present some information about the disorders, though some do not make clear the distinction between the more specific Autistic Disorder and the whole spectrum of autism disorders. A great deal of research into Autism that has been reported since the early 1990s helps us to understand several features more clearly. There is general agreement that, in its full-blown form, Autism involves a triad of impairments-in social interaction, in communication and the use of language, and in limited imagination as reflected in restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour and activities. People who combine all three impairments to a marked degree have the classic form of Autism, so named by Leo Kanner, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University, in 1943, and termed Autistic Disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (1994). But much larger numbers of people may have some of the traits of Autism. The idea of a spectrum or continuum of autistic disorders is helpful to include persons who have some if not all the symptoms of Autism, sometimes in combination with other disabilities. Asperger\ufffds Syndrome, defined in 1944 but not widely used as a diagnostic label until the mid-1990s, may affect seven times as many people as Autistic Disorder (classic Autism). We now know that Autism involves disorders of development of brain functions. It is not a mental illness. Nor is it psychogenic, caused by anything in a child\ufffds psychological environment. Earlier notions, that Autism was caused by emotional deprivation or emotional stress, have long been discredited. Autism affects families in all races, cultures and socioeconomic groups and is found everywhere in the world. More males than females are affected, the ratio being 4:1 with Autistic Disorder (classic autism), 9:1 with Asperger\ufffds Syndrome. For a diagnosis of Autism, the main symptoms must be clear before the age of 3 years. The disabilities are lifelong and there is no known cure, though careful training and sensitive support can bring improvements. The autistic impairments may be associated with cognitive disabilities. Two-thirds of those with Autistic Disorder (classic Autism or Kanner syndrome) have been assumed to be mildly handicapped in cognition and intellect. Most people with Asperger\ufffds have average to higher IQ. Across the autistic spectrum, perhaps 10 per cent have distinctive abilities\ufffdin such fields as art, music, mathematics or memory\ufffdand may be called autistic savants. (The proportion of people with such special abilities in the whole population is only one per cent). How many people have Autism? Key studies in the 1960s, in sample regions in different parts of the world, found a ratio of 4.5 per 10,000 of the child population to have Autistic Disorder (classic Autism or Kanner\ufffds syndrome). By around 1990, a further 15 in every 10,000 were estimated to have what are sometimes called, in North America, other pervasive developmental disorders. Research in the 1990s developed the concept of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with the aim of including people who might have some but not all of the key diagnostic features. British studies of sample regions estimated that 71 in every 10,000 have a milder form of ASD, mainly affecting social relationships rather than communication and language. About half of this larger number (36 in every 10,000 of the population) is estimated to have Asperger\ufffds Syndrome. These figures add up to 91 persons in every 10,000, nearly one per cent of the total population, which is the prevalence usually cited for the United Kingdom. At this rate, more than 60 million people around the world have some form of Autism. In whole countries, such data are estimates rather than actual counts of people diagnosed. It is likely that many on the Autism spectrum have not been formally identified, especially adults. Prevalence figures of one person in 150 or one in 166 are quoted in North America. Applying the rate of one in 150 to age-groups of Ontario\ufffds population at the 2001 census, we find the numbers in the following table, which may be compared with numbers for the narrower definition of Autistic Disorder. Ontario: Estimates of Autism Numbers (2001 Census) Age group Autistic Disorder (\ufffdClassic) 1 in 2,222 Autism Spectrum Disorder 1 in 150 0 \ufffd 4 years 302 4,473 5 \ufffd14 years interesting and important question is: Is the prevalence of Autism increasing? Some people, notably advocates for services to young children, describe the increased diagnoses of some form of Autism during the past 15 years as an explosion, even a pandemic. In part, this probably reflects an enormous increase in awareness of Autism, so that professionals and parents recognize the symptoms of ASD much more readily than they did a generation ago. Another factor is the widening of criteria from Autistic Disorder or classic Autism, to include the much broader concept of an Autism spectrum including Asperger\ufffds Syndrome as well as people who combine Autism with some other disability. Perhaps there has also been a real increase in the numbers and proportions of affected people\ufffdrelated to a wide range of environmental toxins and viral infections. Another question is: \ufffdDoes the prevalence of autism vary from place to place?\ufffd Autism has been found all over the world, in all societies and cultures, and in people of all ethnic and socio-economic groups. Some localities have been found to have very high concentrations of ASD diagnoses. Since 2000, the volume of funded research into genetic, environmental and biomedical factors in Autism has increased enormously, but we are not yet able to answer these questions with any certainty. What causes Autism? Although they are not yet known, there are strong indications that the causes of Autism Spectrum Disorders are biological. The evidence includes the following observations. Autism is often accompanied by other neurological symptoms and associated with other learning difficulties. By adulthood, about one in three persons with Autism will have had at least two epileptic seizures. Most autistic children show unusual responses to sensory stimuli of any kind and have what have been called movement differences. Brain autopsies have shown abnormalities in the frontal lobes, limbic system, brain stem and cerebellum. Some 30 to 50 per cent of autistic children have abnormally high levels of serotonin, the chemical that transmits signals in nerve cells. The higher incidence of Autism in families points to a genetic aspect. There is evidence that at least one type of Autism is an immune-system dysfunction, its onset triggered by viral infections, or by antibiotics and vaccines. Some autistic children and adults are unable properly to digest certain foods or may have paradoxical reactions to medications. It is extremely unlikely that Autism is caused by a single factor. It is most likely that certain people are genetically predisposed to be sensitive to any of various environmental insults that actually trigger the symptoms that we call Autism. Genetic research has identified several genes that may be mutated or damaged. And all kinds of environmental insults may be involved-from the myriad chemicals used in agriculture, forestry, industry and our homes to substances taken into our bodies as medicines or food. It is likely that Autism may be triggered in different people by varying combinations of genetic and environmental factors. This variability is reflected in the huge variety of particular symptoms and the differences that are so evident among people diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Since the late 1990s, there has been a major push to promote research into the causes of Autism, with commitments by governments and charitable foundations to fund research. Various research centres have been set up, often as consortia of teams at several universities. Research findings are published at a quickening pace, in popular media as well as scientific journals. Research on autism is welcomed as one sign of increased awareness of very challenging disabilities, after decades of neglect. However, we may be concerned if specialized genetic research may not take enough account of various causes that are needed to explain the distinct types of autism. Or if it is at the expense of study of approaches to treatments, interventions or services that could make help people already living with Autism. How is Autism diagnosed? Autism cannot be diagnosed by a simple blood test or brain scan, as some disorders may be. Diagnosis depends on a professional assessment of specific behaviours, usually in the first three years of life. When children are not identified till they are older, diagnosis may rely on parents\ufffd memories, records and videotapes. Adults, not identified when they were children for various reasons, may find that some degree of Autism Spectrum Disorder explains their lifelong sense of being different and perhaps some learning and social diffierences. Autistic Disorder, as defined by the World Health Organization\ufffds ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders (1992), is distinguished into: a) Childhood Autism, a pervasive developmental disorder defined by the presence of impaired development before the age of 3 years, with abnormal functioning in all three areas of social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive behaviour. b) Atypical Autism, which differs from Childhood Autism in later age of onset or in insufficient clear evidence of abnormalities in one or two of the areas of impaired development. North American professionals follow the American Psychiatric Association\ufffds Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the 4th edition (DSM IV, 1994) still being the current authority. DSM IV distinguishes five subtypes within the broader category it calls Pervasive Developmental Disorders, and prescribes the diagnostic criteria and associated features for each type: a) Autistic Disorder or classic Autism, for children with severe qualitative deficits in all three areas. b) Rett\ufffds Syndrome (see section on Types of Autism below). c) Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (or Heller\ufffds Syndrome) which affects previously normal children who undergo massive regression between 2 and 10 years, resulting in severe acquired Autism, usually with loss of cognitive skills\ufffdbut not because of schizophrenia or degenerative disease of the brain. d) Asperger\ufffds Syndrome (see section on Types of Autism below). e) PDDNOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorders Not Otherwise Specified) including Atypical Autism\ufffdthe label for children with autistic behaviour who do not fit any of the other specific types in the spectrum. To be diagnosed with Autistic Disorder, a child should show the following behaviours: I: A total of six (or more) items from (A), (B), and (C), with at least two from (A), and one each from (B) and (C) (A) Qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: 1. Marked impairments in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body posture, and gestures to regulate social interaction. 2. Failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level. 3. Lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people, (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest to other people). 4. Lack of social or emotional reciprocity ( note: in the description, it gives the following as examples: not actively participating in simple social play or games, preferring solitary activities, or involving others in activities only as tools or mechanical aids). (B) Qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: 1. Delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime). 2. In individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others. 3. Stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language. 4. Lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level. (C) Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests and activities, as manifested by at least two of the following: 1. Encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus. 2. Apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals. 3. Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g. hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements). 4. Persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. (II) Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (A) Social interaction. (B) Language as used in social communication. (C) Symbolic or imaginative play. (III) The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. The term Pervasive Developmental Disorders was adopted by some Canadian professionals in the 1990s to include all variants and degrees of Autism recognized then. But other professionals as well as parents and caregivers are not satisfied with some of the labels and language of DSM IV, preferring the term Autism Spectrum Disorder (first used in Britain) which is now more commonly used. Types of Autism Several types have been defined along the Autism spectrum, differing in the severity of the symptoms and in the combinations of autistic impairments with other disabilities. We present brief accounts of some of these. Classic Autism, Autistic Disorder or Kanner\ufffds Syndrome The psychiatrist Leo Kanner of John Hopkins University first described and named this syndrome based on 11 of his child patients between 1932 and 1943. He noted the following common features: a profound lack of affect or emotional contact with others. an intense wish for sameness in routines. muteness or abnormality of speech. fascination with manipulating objects. high levels of visuo-spatial skills, but major learning difficulties in other areas. attractive, alert and intelligent appearance. Kanner\ufffds observations became the criteria for early studies of the prevalence of Autism. Children (and adults) with these features have the full triad of impairments and represent the most severely disabled end of the autism spectrum of disorders. Autism organizations were first formed in the 1960s and 1970s by the parents of children with classic Autism. More recently these organizations have been enlarged in scope and functions to serve all those with a wider range of symptoms on the Autism Spectrum. Asperger\ufffds Disorder First described by Hans Asperger of Vienna in 1944, whose work was not generally known in English translation until 1981, the disorder was not listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) until 1994. Asperger\ufffds Disorder shares with Autistic Disorder a severe and sustained impairment in social interaction, and restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour and interests. But people with Asperger\ufffds do not have the significant delays in language, cognition, self-help skills or adaptive behaviour that are typical in Autistic Disorder. They may be physically clumsy and awkward, more obviously than children with classic Autism. Asperger\ufffds is often not recognized easily or early, and may be misdiagnosed as Tourette\ufffds Syndrome, Attention Deficit Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiance Disorder, or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. As with Autism, the disorder is lifelong and no complete cure is known. Asperger\ufffds Disorder may be the largest type on the autism spectrum, affecting 35 in every 10,000 people. Some people with Asperger\ufffds may have an exceptional talent or skill with which they are preoccupied. It is conjectured that several people of remarkable genius may have had Asperger\ufffds--including Albert Einstein, Vladimir Nabokov, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bela Bartok and Andy Warhol. Of Canadian interest is the possibility that Asperger\ufffds Syndrome could explain Glenn Gould\ufffds social deficiencies, obsessive perfectionism and intolerance of change. This idea was raised in the 1996 biography by psychiatrist Peter Oswald, Glenn Gould: The Ecstasy and Tragedy of Genius and later elaborated by the musicologist Timothy Maloney. Gould was acutely sensitive to light, sound and temperature, and had a phobia about shaking hands as well as a limited range of preferred foods. His bizarre mannerisms as a concert performer could be understood as uncontrollable expressions of Asperger\ufffds. Rett\ufffds Syndrome First identified by the Australian Dr Andreas Rett in 1965, Rett\ufffds is a complex neurological degenerative disorder that affects only girls. It is rarer than some of the types on the Autism spectrum, affecting one in every 10,000 girls. From onset at about 18 months of age, its victims become profoundly and multiply disabled, and dependent on others for all their needs. Key symptoms include hypotonia (reduced muscle tone) and such autistic-like behaviours as wringing and waving hands. The discovery of the gene for Rett\ufffds syndrome was reported in October 1999. Autism in adulthood How relevant is diagnosis to our focus on adult Autism? For a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder (classic Autism) at least, the behavioral symptoms must be present before age three. Age of onset may be later for some of the rarer forms of Autism. And critical symptoms of some higher functioning forms of Autism, notably Asperger\ufffds, may not become clear until adolescence or adulthood. Pediatricians and psychiatrists, in the past and perhaps sometimes today, may have been reluctant to pronounce a diagnosis of Autism out of consideration for the parents\ufffd feelings or because such a label was thought to close doors to service rather than open them. So many of today\ufffds adults who probably had key symptoms of Autism in early childhood were given other labels or described as having autistic tendencies . Autistic traits usually persist into adulthood, but with a wide range of outcomes. Some adults with ASD achieve college degrees and function independently. Most diagnosed with classic Autism may not develop functional language and communication and may have poor daily living skills throughout their lives. Some adults with Autism who live without support may be reclusive or eccentric. Some may be labeled with obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizoid personality, simple schizophrenia, affective disorder, mental retardation or brain damage. Those who probably had classic Autism as children may suffer from general assumptions that they have a poor prognosis as adults. It may not seem to professionals and policy-makers that they are worth much in resources. In recognizing other subtypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder, we may tend to overlook the needs of adults with the most distinctive and severe forms of the disorder. By adulthood, in any case, the original symptoms of Autism may be masked by the person\ufffds life and treatment experiences, the effects of drugs, and her/his own efforts to cope with the disorder. Each person of whatever age should considered as a unique individual. This is especially true of adults who were diagnosed with Autism as children. Their challenges cannot be understood purely and simply in terms of Autism. On the other hand, knowledge of the Autism and past treatments may help in assessing their abilities and challenges as adults and in considering helpful approaches\ufffdincluding adult versions of therapies and strategies that may have been mainly designed for children, but too recently for today\ufffds adults. In our view, far too little attention is paid to adult Autism as a general category of disability or to individual adults who have the symptoms of Autism. Yet adults with Autism are said to have normal life expectancy. It would be prudent as well as humane to assess each person\ufffds needs and abilities as part of individual plans for supports that will enable them to use their abilities, realize their dreams, and attain the best possible quality of life. OAARSN\ufffds website is dedicated to the exchange of information about the needs and abilities of adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders, and about the most effective ways to support them to lead good whole lives.

He noted that \"the condition differs markedly and uniquely from anything reported so far...\"(1) This condition soon became known as autism. What is autism? Autism (often referred to as autistic spectrum disorder, Asperger's syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder) is a complex developmental disability -- a neurological derangement that affects the functioning of the brain. This condition usually appears during the first three years of life and often strikes following an early childhood of apparently normal development. Mental and social regression are not uncommon. Although the severity of the affliction varies from child to child, the following symptoms are typical: inadequate verbal and social skills, impaired speech, repetition of words, bizarre or repetitive behavior patterns, uncontrollable head-banging, screaming fits, arm flapping, little or no interest in human contact, unresponsiveness to parents and other people, extreme resistance to minor changes in the home environment, self-destructive behavior, hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, and an inability to care for oneself.(2-4) How common is autism? According to several researchers who investigated Kanner's claims, autism was extremely rare prior to 1943.(5) Using Kanner's own case definition of autism, Dr. Darold Treffert calculated a rate in Wisconsin (from 1949-1969) of less than 1 in 10,000 (.00007).(6) In 1966, Dr. Victor Lotter published the first epidemiological study of autism in England and found the rate to be 4.1 per 10,000 children.(7) However, by the 1980s over 4500 new cases were being reported every year in the United States alone.(8) In 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 1 of every 500 children is autistic (20 per 10,000).(9) Ten years later, in February 2007, the CDC released the results of its new analysis confirming that autism is more prevalent than ever before estimated, affecting about 1 of every 150 American children (67 per 10,000).(10,11) In some states the figures are even worse. For example, in New Jersey 1 in 60 boys are diagnosed with autism and in Utah about 1 in 79 boys have the disorder.(12) \"We have an epidemic on our hands,\" exclaimed Congressional representative Christopher Smith.(13) Congressman Chip Pickering described the epidemic in more sobering terms: \"More children will be diagnosed with autism this year than AIDS, diabetes and cancer combined.\"(14) What causes autism? When the first cases of autism began to appear in the 1940s, researchers were puzzled by the high incidence of autistic children being born into well-educated families. Over 90 percent of the parents were high school graduates. Nearly three-fourths of the fathers and one-half of the mothers had graduated from college. Many had professional careers. As a result, scientists unsuccessfully tried to link autism to genetic factors in upper class populations.(15) Meanwhile, psychiatrists, unaware of the neurological basis of the illness, sought psychological explanations. The mother was accused of not providing an emotionally secure home environment, and therefore presumed to be the cause of her afflicted child's ailment.(16,17) Today, researchers have discounted these earlier notions but still do not have a complete understanding of this condition. Although autism has been linked to biological and neurological differences in the brain, and genetic factors appear to play a role in the etiology of this disease, no single cause has been identified.(18) However, recent dramatic increases in the number of children stricken with this debilitating ailment -- coincident with the introduction of new vaccines -- may shed some light on this medical mystery.

(All citations are included in the book.) ADVERSE REACTION REPORTS This section contains unsolicited adverse reaction reports showing a link between vaccines and autism. They are typical of the daily emails received by the Thinktwice Global Vaccine Institute. I feel that my country is letting me down. My daughter developed early with her speech at under six months old. She was such a happy baby who loved nothing more than physical contact. And then came the imminent choice of the MMR. After much deliberation, I decided to vaccinate our daughter. How I wish I could turn back time. Her speech disappeared, her early skills had also gone, and suddenly it seemed as if she had forgotten everything she once knew. It was as if someone had stolen my daughter away from me. Of course, physically she looked the same, but the baby I knew was locked inside her own mind. We are now awaiting diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder, and while the doctors are fine talking about her condition, the room falls silent at the mention of MMR. We know what that shot has done to our child. Isn't it blatantly obvious to the rest of the world? I've come to the conclusion that the world has gone mad, but amongst the madness I'm focused on staying sane and being the voice of my daughter. One day our silent children will speak for themselves. My beautiful, four-year-old grandson is not talking, and showing signs of autism. He was a vibrant, healthy baby, and was growing well until his baby shots at the age of 14 months. Within a two-week period after receiving his shots, he stopped giving eye contact and seemed to turn inward. He has never been the same since the series of shots he got. He is developing well physically, but mentally and emotionally he is very delayed. My daughter suffers daily from his emotional and mental disability. It breaks my heart to see this. I don't know if he will ever be able to live a normal life. Someone has committed a horrible crime against these young children. I am the mother of a 4 1/2 year old boy who is now in the process of being tested for autism. My son was a happy and carefree little boy until he went in for his four-year well-check to receive his booster shots. My son changed -- his smile, his speech regressed, he seemed withdrawn and not like the little boy I knew. I was scared and confused, so I called his doctor. We told her how our son changed suddenly and drastically after his shots. Of course, I was told that there is no link between his behavior and the vaccinations, that this is the age when children are usually diagnosed -- it is just a coincidence that the vaccines that are given at his well-check is usually the time when a child is diagnosed. Hello, I am a mother of 6 children. All of them have been immunized. All of them have one sort of learning disorder or another, from ADHD to oppositional defiance disorder (ODD), to speech regression. The ODD, I believe, was misdiagnosed and should have been autism, but because he is older and already on medications I am not pursuing a change in diagnosis. I want to share my story about my daughter. Christina is my only girl after five boys. She was talking early, and was very much a bright and happy baby. She received many shots during a period of a few months. I don't know for sure which one caused the problem, but Christina quit talking after being able to speak clearly for six full months. Her first word was Eddie (favorite older brother). Her second word came the same day, Dada, and in a few days came Mama. This was at six months old. By nine months old she could say \"Hi Eddie\" or \"Bye Dada\". This was even noted in her chart at the doctor's office because she had been in there the day she started putting two words together. Around one year old she received her MMR, but she was also receiving other shots every few weeks since I would not allow them to give them all to her at once the way they try to force you to. By her 15-month checkup I began to question why she had stopped talking. Every time after that I kept questioning. The answer was always the same: She is letting her siblings do all her talking. She started to use Mama again, but that is all for about nine months. The doctor kept denying there was anything wrong. By two years old, I was fed up with their excuses and began to do research on the internet. What I found was astonishing and shocking! I was blessed, though, to find info on a diet used for autistic children. Christina had also been hitting frequently, and even headbutting, and she had never slept thru the night. She also seemed to be pulling into herself and was less interactive with us. She was lining up her dolls and tiptoe-walking. All these, I had learned, were signs of autism, and there were other signs as well. After implementing the gluten- and casein-free diet, she began to sleep more peacefully; she had previously jerked in her sleep, though it was not seizures. She quit headbutting and gradually quit hitting, except for the occasional sibling rivalry. All other signs of autism are gone, except the speech. She is three years old now and still has trouble with her speech. She is probably on an 18-month level. She has been receiving speech therapy now for about eight months. She had constant ear infections and had to have tubes put in as well. I am thankful that my child is alive and that I was able to find help for her. The doctor kicked me out of the practice, when at her two-year checkup I mentioned that I thought the vaccines had caused her speech problem, and I refused to give my five-year-old his MMR booster since he is already severely ADHD with signs of autism as well. I am thankful for your site. It helped me to decide never to vaccinate again! I wanted to tell my story BECAUSE it is less dramatic. However, there are so many ADHD/ADD/speech problems/various learning disorders, etc. kids out there, that I thought that it would be good to have a story like mine posted on your site. Even though it is not the worst, it is still a life-altering result to \"doing the right thing\" -- vaccinating. I refer people to your site all the time. I watched my normal son regress into autism two weeks following his MMR shot at 15 months. His pediatrician failed us. The government failed us. The Institute for Health, the FDA, and the CDC failed us. They all lie and deceive and are motivated by money. Autism doesn't run in my family. My daughter, age 5, is completely normal and healthy. My son stopped talking since that vaccine. It's no coincidence that he became very sick and visitied the doctor 7 times following the MMR. Nobody helped us. Nobody helped our son. Two years later his school district is failing us, lying to us, doctoring his educational records. Since autism has entered my life, I have given up support for this country and our school system. I don't wave the flag and it's very sad that the U.S. doesn't have any choice but to focus on terrorism rather than our forgotton learning-disabled children. We live in a greedy country where the rich get richer and the poor and disabled are forgotton. Smart kids are encouraged to be smarter. Challenged learners are forgotten. Nobody tells the truth. Thinktwice.com is a rare exception. Thank you for your website. I hope it angers a lot of those who deserve to be exposed. Hah hah. If you're a parent reading this, sue your school district if they don't provide a free and appropriate education for your learning-disabled child. Sue for what you legally are entitled to. Sue the government, the pharmaceutical company -- sue everyone if you need to. You deserve financial reimbursment for the harm vaccines have caused your child. Wave that flag in disgust. Go ahead and let the foolish, ignorant parents continue to mass-vaccinate their children. Maybe, just maybe, and only then, will things get so bad that change will happen: where every 1 in 10 kids become autistic instead of 1 in 150. It's a sad thought, but that's how disgusted I am.

Disability and Special Educational Needs LISTEN:A special connection: donkeys and children with special needs BOO: Have you met your Green Ghost? Typically, kids with autism even find it difficult to communicate the way other kids do. They usually keep to themselves as they struggle to use words to express. Normal sounds may bother them. A gentle touch may make them uncomfortable. They may not even be able to connect a smile with a state of happiness. [edit] Usually lasts a lifetime Autism usually lasts throughout a person's lifetime. It is a complex neurobiological disorder which today affects, 1 in 150 individuals, making it more common than pediatric cancer, diabetes, and AIDS combined. The last 15 years have seen tremendous rise in the number of autism patients in the industrialized nations, with the sharpest rise seen in the US and UK. Some autism patients display certain unusual skills. Certain children are known to draw realistic pictures in three-dimensional perspectives at an age when other children can barely draw lines. Others can put complex jigsaw puzzles together even from the time they are toddlers. Though they may not be able to speak properly, many begin to read well much earlier than normal. There are cases of some children playing musical instruments though they have not been taught, or sing a song accurately after hearing it once. [edit] All about Autism Autism is part of a group of disorders known as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) which can usually be reliably diagnosed by age 3. New research, however, puts the age to as early as 6 months. Infants with autism symptoms will not display behavior typical of their age, like endearingly grasping a finger, turning and gazing, responding to sound etc. They may even resist affection and attention. [edit] Interpret language literally Kids with autism interpret language literally. A phrase like \ufffdpouring cats and dogs,\ufffd instead of \ufffdit\ufffds raining very hard\ufffd can make them see pets coming out of a pitcher. The fluorescent light is not only too bright for them, it also buzzes and hums. [edit] Shows in a person\ufffds behavior Autism shows in a person\ufffds behavior. A person with autism is almost oblivious to social nuances. He may not wait patiently in a line. He may talk above an appropriate volume. He may not respect others\ufffd personal space. He may draw unwanted attention by his hand-flapping, screaming and tantrums. Autism is four times more likely to affect boys than girls and is diagnosed among all racial, ethnic, and social groups. [edit] No single diagnostic test It is not possible to detect autism at birth or through any prenatal screening. But research has confirmed that if you have one child with autism, there is a 10% chance of having another child with autism or a similar disorder. As there is no single diagnostic test for autism, different tests are carried to rule out other problems and come to a conclusion about autism. During diagnosis stage it may be necessary to refer to a developmental pediatrician, a pediatric psychiatrist, or a pediatric neurologist. [edit] Causes and cure Researchers have not been able to establish the cause of the disease. And treatments are also unknown. Different studies suggest the cause as genetic, exposure to a virus before birth or a problem with the immune system. Drugs don\ufffdt help much in the treatment of autism, though antipsychotic drugs, lithium, and beta-blockers may be required to control instances of violence. The child with autism is likely to display his frustration through self-injurious behaviors, aggression, or tantrums that threaten the safety of others. Appropriate education measures under the care of a child and adolescent psychiatrist can help control the disease to some extent. [edit] Autism and diet Specialized diet is one of the least recognized ways of dealing with autism. Some parents have reported a strong connection between diet and autism and there is a growing body of research in support of this. Research has found that gluten and casein affect children with autism as some autistic people may have difficulty processing these two proteins. Gluten is found in wheat, barley, and oats, and casein is a type of milk protein. The breakdown of these foods in the body causes opiates to be produced, which addict some autism patients to food containing gluten and casein and affect their behavior. In view of this researchers have recommended gluten and casein free diet for those with autism. There are reports of children making improvements after change of their diet. However, it is not easy to follow a gluten and casein free diet, because often they are not clearly mentioned on the labels. A nutritionist can suggest a healthy diet which can reduce the symptoms of autism. [edit] What can I do? For parents autism is a particularly tough condition to deal with. They are deprived of the joy of cuddling, teaching or playing with their children because of their lack of response. Parents of children with autism have to play multiple roles of teacher, advocate, loving parent, and family member. They must find a suitable program and services for their child. Parents need to develop specialized knowledge so that they can teach their children at home what they are taught at school. They should develop special coping skills to deal with the stress of bringing up a child with autism. In their role as advocates for their children, they need to have knowledge of special education law and the available services. Parents are usually correct in noticing abnormal behavior in their children. Pediatricians are likely to dismiss early signs as normal developmental problems. This could turn risky. The moment you have concerns about your child insist on having him screened for autism. Diagnosis of autism is purely based on the child's behavior as there is no definitive brain scan or blood test. Keep a watch and observe if your child is showing any of the following signs: [edit] Social interactions Not displaying normal eye contact, facial expression, and gestures Unable to develop peer relationships Unable to enjoy, share interests or achievements with others Not able to reciprocate emotionally Does not cuddle or respond to affection and touching Does not show a preference for parents over other adults [edit] Communication Delays learning or fails to learn the spoken language Unable to hold sustained conversation, though possessing speech ability Becomes repetitive in words or action Avoids imitative or make-belief play [edit] Atypical activities or interests Shows obsessive preoccupation with some particular interests Compulsively follows unimportant routines Repetitive mannerisms May find odd objects like a piece of paper fascinating Finds great interest in moving objects, like a fan [edit] 90 degrees A study by Australia's, Macquarie University Department of Psychology suggested that siblings of children with autism can feel lonely and neglected, but at the same time some of the siblings display higher maturity and better social skills. Other siblings tend to display other behavior problems, including acting out, aggressive behavior and disobedience. As the main role of bringing up the child falls on the mother, she feels additional emotional stress. This can not only affect relationship between parents but also performance at work. [edit] Yet there is a future Having autism is like living in a foreign country, or learning the rules of a very different game. The rules can be learnt and the children can grow up to be just like you and me. Ongoing research is hopeful of finding a solution to the problem. There are also enough therapies \ufffd speech, occupational etc to ensure that autism need not be a death sentence on your child. Like all problems, here too there is a need to plan. There is no reason to believe that the task is too overwhelming to plan. Many new methods and strategies to teach children with autism have been developed. They include Applied Behavior Analysis, Discrete Trial Instruction, Picture Exchange Communication System, TEACCH, Floortime, RDI, Social Stories, and Sensory Integration. They all help in the long run in reducing family stress and enhancing the family\ufffds quality of life.

Publishing in the April issue of Pediatrics (and online March 15), the authors urge that CMA become part of the first-line genetic work-up zu:> ASD > Autism > autism spectrum disorders > CMA > developmental disorder > Diagnostic > DNA > DNA sequence > genetic changes > genetic diagnosis > genetic testing > Genetics > Medical Wellness > Medicine > microarray analysisExpectant parents who have family members with ASDs, as well as families who already have an affected child, often request genetic testing. However, there is still only limited knowledge about actual causative genes. The currently recommended tests (karyotyping to look for chromosomal abnormalities and testing for Fragile X, the single largest known genetic cause of ASDs) often come up negative. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is a genome-wide assay that examines the chromosomes for tiny, sub-microscopic deletions or duplications of DNA sequences, known as copy-number variants. CMA offers about 100-fold greater resolution than standard karyotyping. However, since it is new, it is often considered a second-tier test. Depending on where a person lives, or what insurance they have, CMA may not be covered by health insurance. Based on our findings, CMA should be considered as part of the initial clinical diagnostic evaluation of patients with ASDs, says Bai-Lin Wu, PhD, Director of Children s DNA Diagnostic Lab in the Department of Laboratory Medicine, which has offered CMA to families since 2006.The research team, led by co-senior authors Wu (heading the Children s team), and David Miller, MD, PhD, of Children s Division of Genetics and Department of Laboratory Medicine (heading the Autism Consortium team), assessed the diagnostic value of CMA in the largest cohort to date -- 933 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (by DSM-IV-TR criteria) who received clinical genetic testing in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Half were Children s patients who had their samples submitted to the hospital s DNA Diagnostic Laboratory, and the others were recruited through the Autism Consortium, a research and clinical collaboration of five Boston-area medical centers. Nearly half of the patients were diagnosed with autistic disorder, nearly half with PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder ? not otherwise specified) and about 3 percent with Asperger disorder. Ages ranged from 13 months to 22 years. Testing included the two currently used tests (G-banded karyotype and fragile X), as well as CMA. When the researchers compared the tests diagnostic yield, they found: Karyotyping yielded abnormal results in 2.23 percent of patients Fragile X testing was abnormal in 0.46 percent CMA results were judged to be abnormal in 7.3 percent of patients when the entire length of the chromosomes (the whole genome) was sampled.Extrapolating from these results, the researchers estimate that without CMA, genetic diagnosis will be missed in at least 5 percent of ASD cases. CMA performed best in certain subgroups, such as girls with autistic disorder, and past studies indicate that it also has a higher yield in patients with intellectual disability (who constituted only 12 percent of this sample). CMA clearly detects more abnormalities than other genetic tests that have been the standard of care for many years, says Miller. We re hoping this evidence will convince insurance companies to cover this testing universally. In all, roughly 15 percent of people with autism have a known genetic cause. Establishing a clear genetic diagnosis helps families obtain early intervention and services for autism, and helps parents predict the possibility of having another child with autism. In addition, by pinpointing bits of chromosomes that are deleted or duplicated, CMA can help researchers zero in on specific causative genes within that stretch of DNA. They can also begin to classify patients according to the type of deletion or duplication they have, and try to find specific treatment approaches for each sub-type of autism. Just in the last two years, a number of studies have revealed the clinical importance of ever smaller chromosome deletions and duplications found with advanced microarray technology, says Wu. These new, highly-efficient tests can help in the evaluation or confirmation of autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disorders, leading to early diagnosis and intervention and a significantly improved developmental outcome. Two known chromosome locations ? on chromosome 16 (16p11.2) and chromosome 15 (15q13.2q13.3) accounted for 17 percent of abnormal CMA findings. Both chromosome abnormalities were initially linked with ASDs by Children s Hospital Boston and collaborators in The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of Medical Genetics, respectively, in 2008. Children s now offers specific tests targeting both of these hot spots. However, the researchers note that most copy-number changes were unique or identified in only a small number of patients, so their implications need further study. Many of them are presumed to be related to ASDs because they involve important genes, cover a large region of the chromosome, or because the child is the first person in that family to have the change. Some deletions and duplications are rare and specific to one individual or one family, says Miller. Learning about them is going to be an evolving process. There won t be one single test that finds all genetic changes related to autism, until we completely understand the entire genome.

This story is adapted from a broadcast audio segment; use audio player to listen to story in its entirety. New studies are often released -- and retracted -- on what causes autism spectrum disorder and what cures it. For example, the British medical journal, \"The Lancet\" recently retracted the frequently cited Wakefield study from 1998 which linked MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccines to autism.Just a few days later, the journal \"Autism Research\" published a study that said advanced maternal and paternal age is a risk factor for autism. So what does the latest data really say about autism causes and cures?Dr. Perri Klass and Dr. Eileen Costello are pediatricians and co-authors of \"Quirky Kids: Understanding and Helping Your Child Who Doesn't Fit In -- When to Worry and When Not to Worry.\" They've spent a good deal of time looking into what distinguishes autism facts from autism fiction.Autism is complicated because it encompasses an entire \"spectrum\" of behaviors and levels of function, according to Dr. Klass. \"That's kind of new. That wasn't around when I was in medical school, let alone when I was a child,\" she said.The behaviors can include difficulty with social cues and communication, repetitive acts and obsessional interests, among other things.In terms of the supposed causes of autism, vaccines are no longer on the list. This is something Dr. Costello is happy to see.\"I think the Wakefield study ... really caused a lot of fear and panic around the world, and caused a lot of parents to have anxiety about immunizing their children,\" she said. \"And it's a real blessing that the paper was retracted.\" What can cause autism are viruses, like influenza and herpes, that can affect pregnant women; as well as parental age. \"There is growing data that advanced parental age is a factor,\" said Costello.For autistic children, says Klass, behavior therapies can be more effective than looking for a cure in special diets and/or vitamin dosing. Costello confirmed this on a blog post for \"The Takeaway\": \"Although the autistic disorders are generally considered lifelong conditions, many children with mild symptoms to begin with will make significant progress with intensive behavioral therapies, the only approach to date with evidence to support it.\" \"That urge to get children looked at and diagnosed earlier rather than later, and get them help early, is where a lot of our attention and efforts should be going,\" said Klass.Read more of Costello's thoughts in \"The Top Five Autism Myths.\" \"The Takeaway\" is a national morning news program, delivering the news and analysis you need to catch up, start your day, and prepare for what s ahead. The show is a co-production of WNYC and PRI, in editorial collaboration with the BBC, The New York Times Radio, and WGBH.

It is one of five pervasive development disorders (PDDs) that also include Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett disorder, and pervasive development disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Autism is usually diagnosed by the age of 3. Autism causes impaired social interaction, communication difficulties, and restricted or repetitive activities and interests. People with autism often exhibit abnormal responses to sensory stimulation (e.g., touch, sound, light), usually have moderate mental retardation, and have a higher risk for developing epilepsy. Some autistic patients exhibit aggression and self-injurious behavior (e.g., head banging, biting themselves). About one-third of patients with autism have normal or nearly normal intelligence quotients (IQs). Many are able to display emotion and affection and respond to their environment. Terms used to describe patients with the disorder include autistic-like, autistic tendencies, autism spectrum, and high-functioning or Advertising Disclaimer High-functioning patients may have minor delays in language and development and difficulty with social interactions. They may have problems initiating and maintaining conversation and efforts may be described as \"talking at others\" (e.g., may talk incessantly about a favorite subject despite attempts by others to speak). With early intervention and appropriate treatment, some autistic patients are able to learn and function productively. There is no cure for the disorder and most patients require lifelong care. Incidence and Prevalence Autism affects 1 to 2 out of every 1000 people and as many as 1.5 million adults and children in the United States have some form of the disorder. The overall incidence increases by about 10 17% each year. The disorder occurs about 4 times more often in boys. 1998-2010 Healthcommunities.com, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Autism and vaccine fight: Healy, Offit, Wakefield and more Was it payment or reward for children in Wakefield's autism study Autism and vaccines: halo or horns for Dr. Andrew Wakefield Attacks and criticisms in the autism world Parents of two autistic sons vaccinated one but not the other View all The diagnosis of autism is a bombshell for many families. Recent news disclaiming vaccine injury has enraged parents who believe otherwise (CBS video here). The debate is counterproductive at best. It is human nature to bristle when we are told to calm down, while our inner cry is screaming why my child! . We will stop at no roadblock to make a difference, to find a cure or an intervention that will temper the behaviors that autism presents. However, this feverish pitch can render parents vulnerable and willing to buy anything from snake oil to shaman ritual. Autism awareness prompts a kaleidoscope of interventions. What disturbs me is the relationship between those receiving remuneration and those vulnerable parents who simply want to believe .Navigating the journey through accessing clinical treatment for autism is a daunting task. Unguarded parents are not prepared for the onslaught of opportunists. There is money in autism, and it is not unreasonable to advise the buyer beware policy.Nevertheless, parents have to start somewhere, and it is advisable to ask as many questions as you deem necessary. I have worried about the criticism of conventional medicine. It is the tease for truth from fact that begs reprimand. The notion of a one stop shop to tempt parents living with autism is seductive. I bear no umbrage toward individuals who integrate hands on therapy with a data- taking trial process for behavioral intervention. I worry about the potions and anecdotal testament of success. Conflicts of interest is the operative term. We know the obvious answer to who benefits from vaccine sales, and drug sales. The next question is who benefits from book sales and bio medical sales, and vitamin sales, and hypberbaric sales etc. A few short years ago the touted cure was a series of secretin injections that cost parents thousands of dollars. Ultimately, it proved no more effective than placebo. We need to be educated consumers. Be pro-active! 1. Make a list-create a hierarchy of what about autism impedes the lives of your child and your family. Establish your priority needs. 2. Look for resource websites (example, Autism Speaks resource guide : http://www.autismspeaks.org/community/fsdb/search.php) 3. Investigate services within your state and what are your child s rights. 4. Ask questions about success with evidence (data), inquire about references. 5. Remember, no question is too insignificant.

Being an older mother significantly increases the risk of having a child with autism, but being an older father only increases the risk when the mother is under the age of 30, U.S. researchers said on Monday.They found that a 40-year-old woman's risk of having a child later diagnosed with autism was 50 percent greater than that of a woman between 25 and 29.But being an older father -- 40 or older -- only contributes significantly to autism risk when the mother is under 30. The older the mother, the more the risk that the child will develop autism, regardless of whether the father is young or old, said Irva Hertz-Picciotto of the University of California Davis MIND Institute, who worked on the study published in the journal Autism Research.The findings contradict a 2006 study of children born in Israel that suggested paternal age played a much larger role. There has been a debate over whether it is maternal or paternal risk. A lot of people were thinking it's not really mom's age, Hertz-Picciotto said in a telephone interview.Researchers and policymakers are increasingly looking for causes to explain the growing numbers of children diagnosed with autism, which affects 1 percent of U.S. children.There is no cure for autism, a spectrum of diseases ranging from severe and profound inability to communicate and mental retardation to relatively mild symptoms such as with Asperger's syndrome.The current study, which incorporates data on 4.9 million births and 12,159 autism cases in California, helps to clarify the contribution of age from both parents. We have such a very large database we were really able to disentangle the mother's age very well, Hertz-Picciotto said. This can be a challenge because older mothers and fathers tend to have children together. We found it does vary for the father, but not for the mother, she said.For example, among babies born to mothers under 25, children whose father was over 40 were twice as likely to develop autism as those whose father was between 25 and 29.This could be because when both parents are older, the risk conferred by the father is outweighed by the risk from the mother, Hertz-Picciotto said.OLDER PARENTSShe said the point of the study is not to blame parents, but to gain clues about what is going on in older parents that could increase a child's risk of developing autism.Older parents, for example, are more likely to have infertility problems and have used fertility treatments; the mothers are more likely to have autoimmune conditions, including gestational diabetes; and both have accumulated more toxins over their lifetimes, so the sperm and egg are more likely to have some changes that could increase risk. We see these age findings as clues for where to look next, Hertz-Picciotto said.Autism researchers are looking at a broad range of potential environmental factors, including household products, medical treatments, diet, food supplements and infections.And the National Institute of Mental Health, one of the National Institutes of Health, is looking at potential genetic causes of autism and has plans to sequence the entire genomes of hundreds of children and their parents to gain a better understanding of the role genes play.\ufffd Copyright (c) Reuters genetic genetic U.S. mental retardation National Institute of Mental Health National Institutes of Health California Asperger Israel Reuters Irva Hertz-Picciotto Hertz-Picciotto CHICAGO University MIND Institute 2541593 www.canada.com/health/sexual-health/mother+affects+child+autism+risk+Study/2541593/story.html 25415 Autism211 http://autism-counselor.com/ Autism Confusion Is the Most Common Problem Affecting Parents Who Have a Child with Autism I m afraid the diagnosis for your child is autism, said the doctor. Do you remember how those words took your breath away, made your heart break? You d seen the symptoms for a while, but now, there was no doubt. What s the cure for it, were the next words you uttered after the bad news. There is no cure, said the doctor. The doctor is right about there being no cure, at least not by modern medicine. I d argue that this condition arises largely as a result of the actions of modern medicine and the effects of environmental toxins. These, in my view, are the primary culprits in causing autism and PDD, ADD, and ADHD. There are Thousands of Treatment Options, but You Should Know that Modern Medicine Contributes in Creating This Condition If this is the case, Modern Medicine can only give you more of the same and that won t help. After the diagnosis, the family works mostly with their physician, but many go out into the web and here they find thousands of treatment options. How can one make a choice? There is a ton of mainstream and alternative information for dealing with developmental delays. Most of the large support groups are committed to the model of health care provided by Modern Medicine. Drugs become the primary therapy. If you re dissatisfied with that option, where can you turn to get sound advice about alternative methods? It s important to understand that most children diagnosed with these conditions don t receive the diagnosis before they re 12 months old. Many children, in fact, were developing normally previous to the diagnosis. Many Parents Observed that Their Child Showed Signs of the Condition after an Anti-biotic Treatment or a Vaccination Many parents noticed a gradual breakdown after repeated vaccinations. The medical community rigorously denies any connection to vaccines. No matter, many parents just cannot accept the idea that this condition is incurable and they begin an arduous journey using various treatment strategies. These include those offered by Modern Medicine, few as they are. Others venture outside the mainstream into the world of alternative theories. They struggle to cope. In the alternative arena, the options and opinions are unlimited and parents with no training or background in these subjects start gathering information about what to do. They have no reliable guidance and confusion becomes the order of the day. Most often they turn to other parents that they find on the Internet who are struggling just as they are. There s Only One Solution: Restore Normal Function to Wipe Out Autism My work is all about strengthening people and ending the confusion. Throughout my own life, I ve worked with most alternative treatments, such as vitamins: you name it I ve done it. I found out early in my life that Modern Medicine has few options for the chronic diseases of our times. Sure, they re great in emergency care, but relatively useless for conditions such as autism. My forty-five year search has turned up some extraordinarily powerful methods to strengthen and increase healing power in people who become diseased. Because of my vast experience, I act as a guide for parents. I save people from wasting time going down the wrong road. You don t have one second to waste in fighting against autism.

In contrast, these children were highly interested in unusual aspects of the inanimate environment. For several decades after the initial description of autism, research on this and related conditions was impeded by a lack of consensus on aspects of syndrome definition, as well as by assumptions of continuity between these conditions and severe forms of mental illness in adults, particularly schizophrenia. The idea that autism was the earliest form of schizophrenia reflected an awareness of the severity of both conditions, the then-current extremely broad views of schizophrenia, and Kanner's use of the word autism, which had previously been used to describe the self-centered quality of thinking in schizophrenia, not a relative absence of social relatedness. It took many years before researchers and clinicians could be sure that autism and schizophrenia were indeed different conditions. As part of this confusion, some early clinicians thought that perhaps autism could be caused by negative experience; we now know that this is not in fact the case. Autism is associated with various kinds of neurobiological symptoms, which range from the persistence of unusual reflexes, the high rates of seizure disorder in persons with autism (25 percent in most cases), and increased frequency of the condition in identical twins. Autism has its origins in the first weeks or months of life. It is characterized by marked problems in social interaction (autism), as well as by delayed and deviant communication development (speech is absent in about 50 percent of cases) and various other behaviors which are usually subsumed in the term 'insistence on sameness.' Such behaviors include stereotyped motor behaviors (hand flapping, body rocking), insistence on sameness and resistance to change. Both categorical and dimensional approaches to diagnosis have been used, as for instance in the DSM-IV Worldwide Field Trial. Many individuals with autism exhibit mental retardation on the basis of their full-scale (or averaged) IQ score; however, unlike most people with primary mental retardation, those with autism often have marked scatter in their development, so that some aspects of the IQ, particularly nonverbal skills, may be within the normal range. Autism is sometimes observed along with other medical and psychiatric conditions such as Fragile X syndrome. Current research on autism at the Child Study Center includes an ongoing study of longitudinal development and of molecular genetics in muliple-incidence families, and also a study of High-Functioning Autism and Asperger Syndrome. Asperger Syndrome mental retardation social interaction fragile x syndrome Leo Kanner Kanner DSM-IV Worldwide Field Trial Child Study Center info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/autism.html Autism213 http://www.doctorjackson.org/health/adhd.cfm I have ADHD and Autism together because they are both personality disorders. Our personalities, our consciousness, what makes us unique as humans and individuals is a function of the structure and function of the brain cells. Our personality is physiology. To be precise, it is the physiology of the cell membranes of each cell. Every cell in our body has a double layer of mostly fat and protein called a membrane which protects the cell and is what the cell uses to communicate with the outside world(other cells, blood, lymph, etc.) The cell membrane is where nutrients are let in and wastes are let out and where messages originate as nerve transmission or hormones that are sent into the bloodstream carrying messages to other cells in the body. So when the cell membranes of our brain cells are functioning normally, our personality, our feeling of wellbeing, our feelings of happiness;our entire perception of life is able to proceed as it should. We see, we recognize, we hear, we feel, we respond. We know that under certain conditions our perception of our interaction with the outside world can be altered. The drug LSD is essentially a poison that dissolves in the fat of the cell membranes and changes the normal function or ability of the brain cells to perceive reality. There is no increase of perception as is claimed by users, but an alteration of perception. The outside is perceived as different, because the cells can no longer process information as they would normally. In other words, under certain conditions, the persons ability to interact with his/her environment is impaired. In effect, ADHD and Autism are normal brain cell physiology gone wrong. What makes the physiology go wrong? As stated above about LSD, any toxic substance(most, if not all are fat soluble they dissolve in fat and not water) gaining access to the cell membrane will dissolve in and lodge in the fat(cell membranes are 50-60% fat) and in the brain cells the synapses, or where brain cells touch and communicate messages to each other, is 80% fat. In the case of autism, it is known that many in many cases, children were immunized with vaccines containing thimersal, a mercury containing preservative. Mercury is a very toxic metal that dissolves in the cell membrane and changes the membranes ability to function normally by changing the structural properties of the fats. It is the structural characteristics of the fats that allow the fats to function in such a way as to make normal physiology possible. Change the fats and you change function. Change the fats and you change physiology. Change the fats and you change perception. Change perception and you change reaction. In other words, you have inappropriate response to a normal input because the input is perceived as different than it really is. To an outside observer, the response is labeled ADHD or Autism. In the case of ADHD there is evidence that the strep bacteria may be a primary cause in many cases. The bacteria, if present, would cause disrupted function through toxic waste products dissolving in the cell membranes. How else can the structural /functional fats in the cell membranes be changed? So-called good fats are good because they possess the characteristics necessary to be incorporated into the body s anatomy(structure) that is able to function in normal body physiology. In fact, it is these characteristics, that made human physiology possible. In other words, good fats make thinking possible! These good or essential fats have the correct length and shape and correct location of special connections(bonds) between the carbon building blocks(atoms) of the fat. Conversely, bad fats , including the trans fats , as popularized in the media, have the wrong shape they are either too long, odd shaped or have the incorrect location of bonds between the carbon atoms. Good fats can be thought of as round pegs that fit the round holes of the body. Bad fats can be thought of as square pegs that don t fit the body s round holes. Good fats must be eaten to provide the building blocks essential to normal physiology and in the case of ADHD and Autism, to normal thinking. If you eat bad fats, the body has no choice but to take the bad fats and try to fit them into the cell membranes with disastrous effects. The body can t make good fats out of bad fats. The body makes good fats out of good fat building blocks. You can t think straight without good fats!!! Also, there are vitamins and minerals like B6 and zinc and magnesium that the body requires to properly use fats. So, Proper diet and toxins are essential factors in ADHD and Autism. Toxins must be located and eliminated if present. The diet must provide the essential building blocks and avoid items that contain bad fats and deplete minerals and or vitamins. Grains and soy products deplete minerals and contain proteins that irritate the cell membranes. Eating too many carbohydrates and sugars causes hormone imbalance and leads to irritation of the cell membranes.

Many of these children have also been diagnosed with Lyme Disease/borrelia related complex, but most remain undiagnosed. It is estimated that up to 90% of children with autism may be also infected with Lyme Disease/Borrelia however, since testing is difficult, current research shows that 20-30% of these children harbor this bacteria. This number would represent over 150,000 children in the United States alone. Most of these children have never even been bitten by a tick. Parents have no idea how their child would have contracted this bacteria. However, it is important to note that borrelia is not the only infection that autistic children have. Many children also have Mycoplasma, Herpes, Chlamydia, Babesia, Bartonella and many more. In addition, this is a family disease. We intend to educate parents on their own health and how this is not just \"autism\" we are looking at, we are looking at a multi-faceted disorder which affects both the young, the old and all of us in-between. Although our goal started out to look at just Lyme disease and autism...we have evolved to include other such infections, therefore looking at an infection based cause to autism. The goal of this organization is to provide education, awareness and research into an infectious based cause of autism. Yes..Lyme/borrelia is our PRIME suspect, but we realize that this is multiple infections happening on a disabled immune system and these infections can be triggered by many factors including but not limited to vaccines, chemicals/pesticides, electromagnetic frequency and a whole host of environmental factors. When we consider all options, only then will our kids be able to begin improving. United States Autism Spectrum Disorder Lyme Disease/borrelia Resources for People with Autism provides support, information, and practical help for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders and their families living in Western Massachusetts.Community Resources was founded in 1989 by parents of children with autism. Their goal was to help families, schools, professionals, agencies and communities understand autism, promote the well-being of individuals with autism, and foster their inclusion in the community.Our goal today remains to help famlies build on their strengths, work together to create a positive vision for the future, and help their children learn, grow, and be welcomed, fully included members of their communities.Community Resources continues to be directed by parents and other family members in partnership with autism professionals and other concerned citizens.Research and experience indicate:having a positive vision for your child's future and building relationships is a key to success. early diagnosis, intervention, and support are important. services are most effective when tailored to the needs of the child and family, and delivered in a consistent, comprehensive, and coordinated fashion. inclusion of children and adults with autism with typical peers in all activities using appropriate supports benefits all.By providing information, advocacy, training and education, and family support in Western Massachusetts, Community Resources for People with Autism echoes the mission of its parent organization -- The Association For Community Living.20th Annual Conference<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" 2010 Speakers:Brenda Smith Myles, Ph.D.Valerie Ph.D. for more information andto download a registration form,click here.

Autism is a developmental delay that includes symptoms such as speech difficulties, lack of eye contact, isolation and no fear of danger. Autistic children act and sound like much younger children. What causes autism specifically is not known. Some experts believe there are bio-chemical reasons for autism; others suspect that it is a psychiatric disorder. Some believe that a combination of the wrong foods and too many antibiotics and environmental toxins can damage the colon and lead to physical and behavioral problems, including autism. The behavioral syndrome of autism includes abnormalities of language and thinking skills; repetitive behavior such as rocking; abnormal responses to sensations, people, events and objects; and self-injurious behavior. New Note: Before going on to explore this in-depth section concerning the theories of autism, you may want to read a summary overview article by Dr. Lewis Mehl-Madrona, \"Effective Therapies for Autism and Other Developmental Disorders\", recently published in Autism/Asperger's Digest Magazine.

Opioids and opioid-like substances, especially when in excess, have many effects upon hormones and hormonal regulation. Among humans, opioids stimulate diminish both ACTH and corticosterone 1. Naloxone, an opiate antagonist, stimulates the release of ACTH. Both types of action are probably mediated within the hypothalamus. Lutenizing Hormone (LH), important in reproduction, is decreased by opioids, while opiate antagonists stimulate LH, both apparently by modulating LHRH release. Opioids affect the regulation of other gonadotropins (sex potently stimulate prolactin and gonadotropin hormone secretion. Opiate antagonists do not affect these hormones. In rats, opiate antagonists decrease basal and stress-induced secretion of prolactin. Data regarding Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) are quite contradictory. Both inhibitory and stimulatory effects have been described. Oxytocin and vasopressin release are inhibited by opioids at the posterior pituitary level. There is good evidence for an opioid inhibition of suckling-induced oxytocin release. Opioids also seem to play a role in the regulation of vasopressin under some conditions of water balance. The pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon, are elevated by opioids apparently by an action at the islet cells. Somatostatin, on the contrary, is inhibited. An effect of naloxone on pancreatic hormone release has been observed after meals which contain opiate active substances. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Opioid-like substances: Dr. Alan Friedman, a physical chemist at Johnson and Johnson, has isolated and identified peptides in urine or serum using a single and triple electrospray quadropole mass spectrometer. The \"MassSpec\" sprays the material into a chamber, where it is spun by electromagnetic forces, and followed sequentially into two more chambers. The materials can then be charted by atomic weight. Dr. Friedman contrasted the samples of normal children with autistic children. The amount and volume of particles in the autistic children was an order of magnitude more in volume and in number of them. Some of these particles include Casomorphine, A-Glaidin, Desmorphin, Deltophin II, Morphine modulating peptide, Novel Autism Peptide I, and Novel Autism Peptide III. These peptides have interaction with other neuro-peptides. Desmorphin is only found in Autistic Children and on the backs of non-captive poison dart frogs. These opioid-like molecules are thought to cause the symptoms of autism. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Dipeptydal peptidase deficiency: Alan Friedman and colleagues have pioneered the potential role of DPP IV deficiency in autism. Some have gone so far as to suggest that DPP-IV deficiency may explain all of the abnormalities seen in autism. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is N-termini provided the penultimate residue is proline. The only known enzyme to break down casomorphine, dipeptidyl peptidase IV or DDP-IV, appears to be absent or reduced in autistic children. The gene for this enzyme is distal to other suspected autism genes on 2 and Q of 7 and is expressed in the kidney, the small intestine, the liver, the blood-brain barrier, and has involvement in T-Cell activation. Also found in the urine were undigested food particles, suggesting a leaky gut syndrome. Mice with the a defective casomorphine enzyme gene will die if not on a gluten free diet. Later we will discuss the possible role of glutein and cassein in autism, and the elimination of these substances from the diet as a treatment. The toxicity of gluten and cassein may result from the lack of DPP IV. Thus, DPP deficiency may be important in explaining opioid excess. DPP IV has a number of different names. When it is present on the surface of a T-cell it is called CD26. Dr. Friedman postulates that DPP-IV is either absent via a genetic mechanism (probably through two recessive genes) or that the enzyme has been inactivated, possibly through autoimmune mechanisms (a theory of autism which we will cover later). It has been postulated that people, autistic from birth, produce no DPP-IV, and those who developed normally and then regressed, had their DPP-IV inactivated through an acquired mechanism (such as auto-immunity). One such compound is dermorphin, a mu-opioid agonist that acts as an hallucinogen. Another is deltorphin II. Some researchers theorize that these compounds appear because the enzyme which cleaves certain peptide bonds (DPP IV) is either missing or inactivated. Gluten and casein are two of the proteins from which these opioids can be produced. There may be additional proteins for which this is true as well. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Theories of Potential Therapies for DPP IV Deficiency [Unevaluated]: If DPP IV deficiency results in autism, what can be done? If the enzyme is missing, replacing it should solve the deficiency. DPP IV is found on intestinal mucosal cells, epithelial cells in the GU tract, and on the surface of T-cells. It might be possible to hook the DNA sequence coding for DPP IV onto some type of delivery mechanism (such as a plasmid) and infuse the plasmids into the patient so that the desired sequence would be incorporated into the patient's DNA. Another alternative is stem cell therapy or live cell therapy. Injected cells might produce DPP IV which would migrate to areas in which it is needed. If the enzyme is inactivated by an autoimmune mechanism, replaced enzyme would probably be inactivated as well. Here is a the skeleton for a future treatment: Drucker, et al. 2 studied DPP-IV deficicient rats. Administration of GLP-2 to these rats was associated with a markedly increased bioactivity of rat GLP-2 resulting in a significant increase in small bowel weight. A synthetic GLP-2 analog, r[Gly2]GLP-2, with an alanine to glycine substitution at position 2, was resistant to cleavage by both DPP-IV and rat serum in vitro. Treatment of wild-type rats with r[Gly2]GLP-2 produced a statistically significant increase in small bowel mass. DPP-IV-mediated inactivation of GLP-2 is a critical determinant of the growth factor-like properties of GLP-2. The possibility exists that treatment of autistic people with sufficient quantities of GLP-2 or with synthetic r[Gly2]GLP-2 which cannot be cleaved by DPP-IV would alleviate symptoms associated with autism. Drucker DJ, DeForest L, and Brubaker PL have shown that GLP-2-like compounds have potential use for enhancement of mucosal regeneration in patients with intestinal disease 3. This may relate to autistic children who have gastrointestinal symptoms. Findings such as these may explain the usefulness of hormonal therapies for autistic children's gut problems. GLP-2 is part of proglucagon, which also contains GLP-1. Proglucagon is secreted from enteroendocrine cells of the small and large intestine. GLP-1 lowers blood glucose in both NIDDM and IDDM patients and may be therapeutically useful for treatment of patients with diabetes. GLP-1 regulates blood glucose via stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibition of gastric emptying, and inhibition of secretion. GLP-1 may also regulate glycogen synthesis in adipose tissue and muscle; however, the mechanism for these peripheral effects remains unclear. GLP-1 is produced in the brain, and intracerebroventricular GLP-1 in rodents is a potent inhibitor of food and water intake. The short duration of action of GLP-1 is accounted for in part by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 which cleaves exendin-4 resistant cleavage are more potent GLP-1 molecules in vivo. GLP-2 has recently been shown to display intestinal growth factor activity in rodents, raising the possibility that GLP-2 may be therapeutically useful for enhancement of mucosal regeneration in patients with intestinal disease. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Dermorphin and Sauvagine: The abnormal opioid peptides found in the urine of autistic children are known to have a number of important effects, many of which may relate to the symptoms of autism. Some of these effects may relate to other gut disorders, especially the so-called hollow organ dysmotility syndromes, in which pain arises from uncoordinated electrical activity and peristalsis in the gut, including the production of spasm and chronically elevated gut wall muscle tension. Some of the gastrointestinal disorders of autistic children (especially their abdominal pain) may be explainable on this basis. Dermorphin consists of the amino acid sequence Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Gly-Tyr-Pro-Ser-NH2 30. It is a mu-opioid agonist and is displaced by naloxone or morphine; hence, the justification for using naloxone with autistic children to block the effects of dermorphin and its relatives. The D-configuration of the amino acid residue in position 2 is of crucial importance for its binding ability. Replacing the D-Ala2 with L-Ala makes a compound that is only 1/5000th as potent in binding to the receptor. Shorter dermorphin homologs, dermorphin-(1-4)-NH2 and dermorphin-(1-3)-NH2, are 20 and 40-fold less potent, respectively, than dermorphin. The C-terminal carboxamide function is of significant importance for manifestation of the full intrinsic binding potency of dermorphin. Deamidated dermorphin has 1/5th the potency of the parent peptide. While the whole dermorphin sequence is required for expression of its full binding activity, the N-terminal tripeptide contains the features which allow receptor recognition. 30. Amiche M, Delfour A, Nicolas P. Structural Requirements for Dermorphin Opioid Receptor Binding. Int J Pept Protein Res 1988 Jul 32:1 28-34 Dermorphin and other opioid-like peptides can affect stomach acid output, and therefore, digestion 31. Intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected dermorphin suppresses the stimulation of gastric acid output by water distension of the stomach in a dose-dependent manner. Insulin stimulated gastric secretion is also partially blocked. Subcutaneous injections of dermorphin inhibite basal and and are by subcutaneous naloxone (at a dose of 1 mg/kg). Injections (i.c.v.) of dermorphin have no effect on histamine-induced gastric secretion, but a close relative, Dermorphin N-terminal-tetrapeptide-amide (NTT), does [3]. secretion. The opioid antagonist, N-methyl-levallorphan-methanesulphonate also blocks this effect. Thus, the brain plays a role in regulating gastric secretion. Can these abnormal peptides explain many of the increased gastrointestinal problems of autistic children, or even of other patients with intestinal motility and spastic disorders? Time will tell, but the presence of increased intestinal permeability may explain how these molecules pass into the bloodstream from the gut to affect adults with gastrointestinal disorders. In support of these ideas is the finding that a premature phase III of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) in the duodeno-jejunum is triggered by NTT 32. The activity of the gastic antrum is not significantly modified. NTT also increased the contractile activity of both proximal and distal portions of the colon, including a long-lasting period of increased muscle tone in the distal colon. Either naloxone or N-methyl-levallorphan-methanesulphonate completely prevented these motor effects of NTT on gastrointestinal tract. This opiate-like activity on gastric acid secretion and intestinal motility of the dog is thought to occur through the activation of peripheral mu opioid receptors. Certainly justification exists for treatment of autistic children with gastrointestinal disturbances with naloxone. 31. Improta G, Broccardo M, Lisi A, Melchiorri P Neural Regulation Secretion Regul Peripheral and Motor Effects of Dermorphin N-terminal tetrapeptide the Dog. Neuropeptides 1987 Jul 10:1 67-76 Intravenous infusion of dermorphin significantly increases plasma levels of prolactin, human growth hormone, thyrotropin stimulating hormone (TSH) and plasma renin activity, but decreased plasma levels of cortisol. Dermorphin produced a small decrease in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and a small increase in plasma aldosterone. Pretreatment with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone suppressed the prolactin and TSH response, blunted the human growth hormone and plasma renin activity increase, completely prevented the plasma cortisol decrease, and enhanced plasma cortisol and ACTH levels. These actions are thought to be mediated through opioid receptors. Dermorphin is thought to increase plasma renin levels through stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Dermorphin does suppress plasma cortisol levels by affecting ACTH secretion, potentially explaining altered pituitary-adrenocortical axis function found among developmental delayed children. Reference: Degli Uberti EC, Trasforini G, Salvadori S, Pansini R The Effects of Dermorphin on the Endocrine System in Man. Peptides 1985 6 Suppl 3 171-5 Abstract Sauvagine is another opioid-like peptide found in higher concentrations among autistic children. It and dermorphin affect both ACTH and beta-endorphin release from pituitary cells, inhibit prolactin and human growth hormone release. When dermorphin is administered by intracerebroventricular injection, it induces analgesia and catalepsy, along with conspicuous EEG and behavioral changes and a sharp reduction in gastric emptying time and gastric acid output. Prolactin release is stimulated. Reference: Erspamer new Peptides 2 Suppl 2 7-16 Dermorphin and deltorphin are opioid-like substances which elicit acute and chronic activation of of mu- and delta-opioid receptors, thereby affecting the functional activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, both in basal conditions and in response to acute stress. Acute administration of dermorphin (a mu-receptor agonist) increases basal and stress induced plasma levels of corticosterone and beta-endorphin. These effects are antagonized by pretreatment with naloxone, a specific mu-opioid receptor antagonist, but not by naltrindole, a delta-opioid receptor antagonist. Long-term administration of dermorphin does not alter resting plasma levels of corticosterone and beta-endorphan, but does reduce stress-induced increases of these hormones. Both the acute and chronic administration of the delta-opioid receptors agonist, failed to modify resting and stress induced hormone levels. Thus, mu-opioid receptors, but not delta-opioid receptors modulate the response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to acute stress. Reference: Degli Uberti EC, Petraglia Bondanelli Salvadori S, Criscuolo M, Nappi RE, Genazzani AR Involvement of Mu-Opioid Receptors in the Modulation of Pituitary-Adrenal Axis in Normal and Stressed rats. J Endocrinol Invest 1995 Jan 18:1 1-7 Intravenous dermorphin injection decreases the levels of thryotropin releasing hormone in the hypothalamus. Plasma TSH levels decreased significantly in a dose-related manner with a nadir at 40 min after the injection. The plasma thyroid hormone levels were not changed significantly. The plasma TRH and TSH responses to cold were inhibited by dermorphin, but the plasma TSH response to TRH was not. Naloxone partially blocked the inhibitory effect of dermorphin on TSH levels. In the para-chlorophenylalanine or pimozide pretreated groups the inhibitory effect of dermorphin on TSH levels was prevented, but not in the groups pretreated with 5-hydroxytryptophan or L-DOPA. These drugs alone did not affect plasma TSH levels in the dose used. Dermorphin is thought to act on the hypothalamus to inhibit TRH release, its effects being mediated through mu-opioid receptors and modified by central nervous system amines. Reference: Mitsuma T, Nogimori T, Secretin: Opioids decrease gastric acid secretion. One theory as to the apparent \"secretin deficiency\" seen in many autistic patients is that the pH of the contents in the upper duodenum never gets low enough to cause the mucosal cells to release secretin. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Glutathione: Opioids have been shown to decrease hepatic glutathione. Low levels of glutathione have been demonstrated in autism. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Opioids and immunosuppression: Many autistic people demonstrate a mild immunosuppression which could be accounted for by the actions of opioids on T-cells. Opioids decrease T-cell proliferation via to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Gluten/Casein Theories and Relation to Celiac Disease Dr. Paul Shattock, of Sunderland,England is doing work on the casein free/gluten free diet connections to autism and is studying the development of caso-morphine and gluteo-morphine in autistic children. In some individuals who cannot metabolize gluten, a-gliadin is produced. The body cannot metabolize A-gliadin, which binds to opiod receptors C D. These receptors are associated with mood and behavior disturbances. A strict gluten and casein-free diet does appear to reduce the level of opioid peptides and improve autism for some people. The earlier the implementation of the diet, the better the chance of recovery. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Opioid receptors: There are at least 3 different opioid receptors - mu, delta, and kappa. When an opioid molecule attaches to a receptor in which it fits\", adenylate cyclase is inactivated, leading to a decrease in intracellular cAMP. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is an important messenger system in the brain and body. Opioid theory. In keeping with the opioid theory of autism, some children are given naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) with reported benefit. An example would be a small dose of 10 mg every 2-3 days [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Urinary IAG: The increase in urinary IAG levels among autistic people observed by Paul Shattock may be explained in this manner. Tryptophan hydroxylase (the rate-limiting step in the conversion of tryptophan to serotonin) must be phosphorylated in order to be active. Cyclic AMP is required for phosphorylation. If intracellular cAMP levels have been lowered because of constant (inappropriate) stimulation of opioid receptors on the cell surface, less tryptophan hydroxylase is phosphorylated, and therefore more of the enzyme is inactive. When this happens, tryptophan is not converted into serotonin, but is shunted down alternate pathways, eventually leading to urinary IAG and Fatty Acids: Another abnormality observed in autism is the long-chainand very-long-chain fatty acids in cell membranes. Carnitine palmitolytransferase is essential in the steps responsible for the transport of Long Chain Fatty Acids (LCFA) and Very Long Chain Fatty Acids (VLCFA) across the mitochondrial membrane so these fatty acids can be broken down and metabolized. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase synthesis and half-life are dependent on the presence of cAMP. There is evidence that cAMP levels may be reduced in autism (see other sections). One theory for the action of secretin is that it raises cAMP levels. Carnitine has also helped some autistic children,and, in fact, there is a glycogen storage disease that is a carnitine deficiency syndrome which presents like autism. There are 12 types of glycogen storage disease, including carnitine deficiency syndrome, and defects of Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center s Department of Enzymology has identified two patients with the\"carbohydrate deficient glycoprotein syndrome\" through alpha-1-antitrypsin phenotyping. The carbohydrate deficient glycoprotein in the serum of these patients produces a band on polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing that moves cathodally of the Z-band. In the area of carnitine deficiency, there is, for example, less than 5% of normal muscle carnitine concentration. After carnitine supplementation, patients unable to talk or walk, with hypotonic musculature and symptoms of autism, can became able to walk with the help of a walker, can stand alone for short periods, and can acquired an interest in their surroundings. The common findings of carnitine deficiency were an impaired ability to walk, muscular hypotonia, reduced muscle carnitine concentration and an improvement in locomotion while on carnitine. Among a family with recessive X-linked cardiomyopathy, affected patients used to die before age 2 yrs. Early carnitine supplementation has greater improved survival. The clinical picture of this disease resembles Barth Syndrome, the gene for which has a location near the marker DXS52 on the X chromosome (Bolhuis et al., 1991). This carnitine deficiency syndrome is also related to the DXS52 marker (Bione, et al., 1996). The banding pattern of cDNA from a patient's liver differs from that of normal liver and that sequencing of cDNA from a patient's heart shows that exon 7 has been eliminated. Vitamin B12 therapy is based in part upon the role of vitamin B12 in synthesizing essential fatty acids. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Gamma Interferon Theory Dr. Vijendra Singh has found elevated levels of interleukin-12 and gamma interferon in autistic patients. Opioids can increase levels of gamma interferon. [More information on this topic coming soon!] [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Free Sulphate Theory Dr. Rosemary Waring has demonstrated low levels of free sulfate in the plasma of autistic people. Free sulfate homeostasis is regulated by reabsorption in renal tubules primarily. Opioids change sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride reabsorption in the kidney, but no work has been done on sulfate reabsorption. Waring (1993) has demonstrated deficiencies in the sulphur-transferase capabilities of people with autism. This inadequacy is not the consequence of a missing enzyme (sulphur transferase) but of insufficient sulphate ions for the sulphation to be accomplished. Sulphur transferase activity is important for many biological reactions in the body, some of which may be relevant to autism. These reactions include the breakdown of bilirubin and biliverdin, which are the breakdown products of haemoglobin; as well as the breakdown and removal of phenolic compounds. The tests used to estimate sulphur-transferase activity rely upon the conversion of paracetamol to its sulphate. An inadequately functioning sulphur-transferase system will also affect the metabolism of some neurotransmitters. Serotonin (5-HT) metabolism will be affected, and the appearance of unusual metabolites (such as the hallucinogen bufotenin) could be predicted. Himwich (1972) has reported this, but the significance is uncertain. Foods with high phenolic content should exacerbate symptoms since the overtax the available sulphur resources of the body. Anecdotal reports abound about the adverse effects of apples, oranges and other citrus fruits, chocolate (possibly on account of the phenol flavoring vanillin) and other phenolic foods on behavior in children with autism. Interestingly, two parents (who must remain anonymous). Cranberry juice has been anecdotally reported to reduce or even eliminate these effects. Whether this due to the sulphur content of the juice or some other mechanism including placebo remains to be determined. Sulphate ions are not absorbed from the gut so this route is not a possibility for replenishment. The main source of free sulphate in the body is the amino acid \"cysteine\" which is obtained from the breakdown of protein. Some parents have attempted to combat this by feeding their children large doses of cysteine in tablet or powder form with mixed results reported. Other parents have introduced other sulphur containing amino-acids and claim this therapy beneficial. One of the sulphur containing amino-acids used for this purpose is \"taurine,\" which is reported to have an anti-opioid effect (Braverman 1987). Parents have also been experimenting with alternative routes of administration. One popular route is percutaneous, in which magnesium sulphate (Epsom Salts) are placed in the bath water in the hope that the sulphate will enter the body through the skin. Anecdotal benefits are claimed from this therapy, though increased irritability has also been reported. Similar sulphate deficiencies have been reported in people with migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, jaundice and other allergic conditions all of which are anecdotally reported as common in the families of people with autism. More information on Rosemary Waring s work is available at the Autism, Intolerance & Allergy Network (AIA). Dr. Robert Sinaiko has also written an interesting paper, The Biochemistry of Attentional/Behavioral Problems, in this area. Also, see Paul Shattock's discussion of Waring's work, Back to The Future: An assessment of some of the unorthodox forms of biomedical intervention currently being applied to autism, at The Autism Research Unit's Website. Sulfated glycosoaminoglycans are critical to the formation of the neuromuscular junction and the development of appropriate motor control and function. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Other Sulfation Problems in Autism \ufffdSulfation problems have been described by Rosemary Waring at the University of Birmingham in autism which could lead to an inability to handle virus infections, with a disruption of cell-mediated immunity\ufffd as well as an impairment of natural killer cell function.\ufffd Unlike the situation with type I interferons, which are released by infected cells, interferon gamma (a type II interferon) is released by T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but that happens not when they themselves have been activated, but rather, when they are alerted to the presence of infection by other immune cells or by a superantigen or a chemical mitogen. Sulfate also plays an important role in initiating interferon gamma's signal.\ufffd [ Reference:\ufffd Benito A. Yard, Christian Der Woude.\ufffd Sulfation-dependent Down-Regulation I Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 Expression on Tubular and Endothelial Cells Transplantation Vol.66(9), November 15, 1998, pp. 1244-1250]. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are sulfated sugars, involved with great deal of the action on the cell surface.\ufffd They also have activity in their \"shed\" form, where they act in the extracellular matrix, external to the cell.\ufffd All cells make GAGs, and shed GAGs continuously, but to properly assemble these sulfated GAGs, each cell has to be supplied with adequate sulfate, which is low in autism.\ufffd When these sugars are not sufficiently populated with sulfate, they will not behave normally, and their interaction with other chemistry can be hampered.\ufffd If sulfated GAGs are required for the proper action of interferon gamma, then a problem with sulfation may indeed be able to explain why so many autistic children have a hampered cell-mediated immunity and poor natural killer cell function. Sulfated GAGs on the cell surface appear necessary for interferon gamma to generate a signal through its receptors on the cell surface.\ufffd More highly sulfated GAGs do indeed bind interferon and prevent it from binding to its receptors and generating its signal into the cell.\ufffd This varies in a dose-dependent manner. Sulfated cell surface GAGs are required to dimerize, or assemble, two different components of receptors. Also, in the extracellular matrix around the cell, sulfated GAGs have been found to provide an escort for the GAG-binding chemical to get to the cell surface, actually protecting it from degradation as it wends its way to its cell-bound GAG/receptor complex.\ufffd Another example of this process is seen in chylomicron metabolism, where sulfated GAGs in most pathways are necessary for helping the cells in the liver to \"eat\" and process cholesterol-laden fatty particles. There is another article from the May 1994 Scientific American: \"How Interferons Fight Disease\", by Howard M. Johnson et al., that gives a particularly valuable review of what a problem with the interferon gamma signal would be expected to produce.\ufffd Even though this article does not even mention GAGs, it does say that in order to activate its receptor, some part of the interferon gamma molecule which is coming from the outside of the cell has to associate with a part of its receptor that is actually underneath the cell membrane and in the cytosol, so the authors speculate that the whole complex has to at least be partially endocytosed (taken inside the cell) before this could happen.\ufffd That may be where these GAGs are functioning, as they are recognized in the liver also as being involved with the endocytosis of ligand/receptor complexes. But, if this process were inhibited by poor sulfation what would be the consequences? [Exerpts from the article in Scientific American]: \"Interferons activate pathways that cause cells to transcribe, or copy, certain genes into molecules of messenger RNA.\ufffd The RNA transcripts, in turn are translated into proteins that interfere with viral replication or produce other effects... Interference with viral protein translation: For example, one of the best-studied proteins (the eIF-2-alpha protein kinase) interferes with the cellular machinery that viruses exploit in order to reproduce themselves.\ufffd Viruses trick the protein-making machinery of host cells into translating viral messenger RNA into the proteins needed to make new infectious particles.\ufffd Messenger RNA, viral or otherwise, is translated by ribosomes.\ufffd These structures travel down the length of the RNA strand, linking one specified amino after another to a growing protein chain. First, however, each ribosome has to be built.\ufffd Several molecules join together to form the smaller of two ribosomal subunits, and then the larger subunit comes on board. All three interferons can precipitate the production of the eIF-2-alpha protein kinase, the active form of which phosphorylates one component required for forming the smaller ribosomal unit.\ufffd Such phosphorylation blocks further construction of the subunit and thus stalls protein synthesis.\ufffd The newly made kinase becomes active only when it encounters double-stranded RNA.\ufffd Such RNA appears in a cell only when a virus replicates its genetic material.\ufffd Consequently, the enzyme blocks protein synthesis in infected cells but not in healthy ones. Destruction of viral RNA: Among other groups of proteins induced by both type I and type II interferons is the family consisting of the 2',5'-oligo (A) synthetases. These enzymes, too, interfere with the production of viral proteins, but they do so by activating enzymes that break down RNA before it can be translated into protein. ... Enhancement of macrophage function: Interferon gamma can induce macrophages to kill tumor cells and cells infected by parasites, bacteria or viruses.\ufffd It can also prod macrophages ot destroy pathogens that have colonized the scavengers themselves.\ufffd And interferon gamma stimulates macrophages to produce what are called class II MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules.\ufffd After macrophages ingest pathogens, they break up several of the microbes and fit the fragments into grooves on the MHC molecules, which are then transported to the cell surface.\ufffd There they display the antigenic fragments to what are called CD4 T cells.\ufffd (These lymphocytes can \"see\" antigens only if the foreign fragments are complexed with a class II MHC molecule.)\ufffd Having recognized particular antigens, the CD4 cells proliferate and release chemicals that help other immune system cells to fight off infection.. Interferon gamma...serves as a kind of immunologic switch.\ufffd The protein helps to turn on the cell-mediated arm of the immune system, consisting of macrophages, various kinds of T cells and other cells that respond to microbes inside the cells of other tissues.\ufffd At the same time, interferon gamma may dampen the production of antibodies.\ufffd Antibodies are better suited to eradicating pathogens that establish colonies outside of cells.\" The article does not really talk about natural killer cells, but it would make sense if they are the other cell type besides macrophages that release interferon gamma, that their effectiveness would be greatly reduced if their signal from interferon was lost because of poor reception by the recipient cell. All in all, these two articles go far in explaining the possible cause of the particular weaknesses we've found in some children's immune system with both poor cell-mediated immunity and impaired function of natural killer cells that go along with their sulfation problems. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Cholecystokinin and Autism Rats born without a functional CCKA receptor developed a type II (adult onset) like diabetes (insulin resistant type). Insulin and insulin-like growth factor, can both engage each other s receptors, so a process affecting the function of one, may influence the other. IGF (insulin-like growth factor) is important for cell growth. IGF also regulates the sulfate uptake in glycosaminoglycans in cartilage and potentially other tissues. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Oxytocin and Vasopressin in Autism Oxytocin is produced through the influence of the cholecystokinin-A (CCKA) receptor, which requires its substrate, cholecystokinin, to be sulfated (see the free sulfate theory of autism). If there is insufficient ability to sulfate compounds (a finding in some autistic people), the receptor will not work well, and many CCKA mediated functions will be afffected. There is an argument that pitocin (oxytocin) might cause some cases of autism since so many mothers of autistic children had to have pitocin to induce labor. Others have suggested that the association was more likely caused by the mother/childunit having sulfation problems which made it difficult for mom's oxytocin to be produced in sufficient quantity to move labor along, necessitating a jumpstart with exogenous oxytocin (pitocin). The theory is that mothers with sulfation problems would have a higher likelihood for delayed or desultory labor. A literature is developing to support a role for oxytocin in autism 4. Coexisting with oxytocin or vasopressin in the cell bodies and nerve terminals of the hypothalamic-neurohypophysial system are smaller amounts of other peptides 5. For a number of these ''copeptides'' there is strong evidence of corelease with the major magnocellular hormones. The effects on secretion oxytocin is coreleased with vasopressin from lobe nerve terminals and acts on neural lobe kappa-opiate receptors to inhibit the electrically stimulated Naloxone augments oxytocin release from the neural lobe in a manner directly proportional to the amount of vasopressin (and presumably dynorphin) released. Cholecystokinin, coreleased with oxytocin by lobe (NL) terminals, has been shown to have high-affinity receptors located in the NL and to stimulate secretion of both oxytocin and vasopressin. CCK's secretagogue effect is independent of electrical stimulation and extracellular Ca2+ and is blocked by an inhibitor of protein C. CRH, coreleased with oxytocin from the neural lobe, has receptors in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary, but not in the neural CRH but not from isolated neural lobes. Intermediate lobe peptides, alpha and gamma melanocyte stimulating hormone, induces secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin from isolated neural lobes. Their effect is, like that of CCK, independent of electrical stimulation and extracellular Ca2+ and is blocked by an inhibitor of protein kinase C. Among the CRH-producing parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus, in the normal rat, approximately half also produce and store vasopressin. After removal of glucocorticoid influence by adrenalectomy, virtually all of the CRH neurons contain vasopressin. The two subtypes of CRH neurosecretory cells found in the normal rat possess different topographical distributions in the paraventricular nucleus, suggesting the possibility of differential innervation. Stress selectively activates the vasopressin containing subpopulation of CRH neurons, indicating that there are separate channels of regulatory input controlling the two components of the parvocellular CRH neurosecretory system. The presence of opioid peptides and opiate receptors in the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system, as well as the inhibitory effects of enkephalins and beta-endorphin on release of oxytocin and vasopressin has been well documented 6. Opioid peptides inhibit oxytocin release and thereby promote the preferential secretion of vasopressin when it is of functional importance to maintain homeostasis during dehydration and hemorrhage. Both neuromodulators and a neurohormones co-exist in the same neuron, as demonstrated for vasopressin with dynorphin or leucine-enkephalin, which serves to regulate the differential release of two biologically different, yet evolutionarily-related, neurohormones, e.g. oxytocin and vasopressin, from the same neuroendocrine system. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Autism and Amino Acids Many autistic people have low levels of specific amino acids, despite a diet sufficient to support normal levels. DPP IV is found on epithelial cells in the kidney and is responsible for breaking down peptides into amino acids which are then reabsorbed. An absent or non-functioning enzyme could explain lowered levels of amino acids. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Methylation Theory of Autism Methylation is an important metabolic process, possibly defective in autism, and pertaining to the control of histamine excess, protection of DNA, promotion of serotonin production, and other brain functions. A number of experiments have suggested a relationship between methyl group metabolism and the exocrine secretion of the pancreas 32. These included nutritional studies which showed that ethionine, the ethyl analog of methionine which inhibits cellular methylation reactions, is a specific pancreatic toxin. Other studies indicated that protein carboxymethylation might be involved. Capdevila, et al. 32 showed that in vivo ethionine inhibits amylase secretion from freshly isolated ethionine inhibits amylase secretion from AR42J pancreatic cell line. S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is an inhibitor of all methyltransferase reactions involving S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). Treatments that elevate cellular levels of SAH such as inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and the in vitro addition of adenosine and homocysteine result in the inhibition of amylase secretion in both isolated pancreatic acini and AR42J cells. Measurement of SAMe and SAH levels in AR42J cells shows that inhibition of secretion is more closely related to elevation of SAH levels than to a decrease in the SAMe/SAH ratio. Small G-proteins are carboxymethylated on cells. N-Acetylgeranylcysteine is not an inhibitor of the methyltransferase and does not inhibit amylase secretion. FTA inhibits membrane-associated prenylcysteine methyltransferase from AR42J cells. These results suggest that a methylation event is needed for pancreatic exocrine secretion which may be the reversible methylation of a G-protein involved in signal transduction or membrane trafficking. One theory of action of secretin revolves around restoration of normal methylation in the pancreas, and thereby normalizing pancreatic exocrine secretion. exocrine [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Stress and Immunity The experience of stress affects cellular immunity, an important aspect of many medical problems, including controlling/curing cancer and the immunobiology of autism. Treating disease with immunological components means also treating and managing psychological stress. Human immune function is mediated by the release of cytokines, nonantibody messenger molecules, from a variety of cells of the immune system, and from other cells, such as endothelial cells. There are Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Autoimmune and allergic diseases involve a shift in the balance of cytokines toward Th2. The autoimmune aspect of autism has been related to excessive Th2 cytokines resulting, in part, from vaccination. Gulf War syndrome and asthma have been similarly linked to excess immunization in the presence of increased environmental toxins and pollutants (high antigenic load). Cytokines stimulate cellular release of specific compounds involved in the inflammatory response. Stress-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the sympathetic-adrenal medullary and hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axes lead to the release of cytokines 1. Blocking the response of the sympathetic nervous system by pre-treating subjects in stressful experiments with adrenergic antagonists can reduce this release of cytokines and decrease the resulting inflammatory response 2, 3. Discrete areas of the brain (for example, the hypothalamus and the locus coeruleus) regulate the sympathetic nervous system and therefore the levels of circulating adrenergic stress hormones, thereby influencing the activity of the immune system 4, 5. Adrenergic stress hormones alter the synthesis and release of cytokines by white blood cells (leukocytes). The effects of stress on immunity has been experimentally studied in animals. The stress of crowding prior to and following tuberculosis infection affects the outcome of the infection in mice 6. Social disruption in mice causes reactivation of latent herpes simplex virus 7. Stress enhances the reactivation of latent herpes viruses including the Epstein-Barr virus in humans 8. Psychological stress inhibits many aspects of the immune response including innate immunity (eg, natural killer cell lysis), T-cell responses, and antibody production [1]. Caregivers of parents with Alzheimers disease along with matched noncaregivers received influenza vaccine. All subjects had similar vaccine histories, rates of chronic illnesses, and medication usage, but caregivers showed poorer cellular and humoral immune responses to the vaccine than controls 9 - 12. Their less robust response was thought to relate to the chronic stress of caregiving. Acute stress can suppress the virus-specific antibody and T-cell responses to hepatitis B vaccine 2, 13-15. People who show poorer responses to vaccines have higher rates of clinical illness including influenza virus infections 16, so these findings are clinically relevent. Stress influences host resistance to upper respiratory tract infections produced by exposure to five different strains of rhinovirus, to a strain of coronavirus, and to respiratory syncytial virus. After inoculation, subjects were quarantined and monitored for 5 or more days to assess whether they developed infections and cold symptoms. Approximately one third of those subjects exposed to one of these viruses developed a serologically verified clinical illness 17. Higher scores on a questionnaire for stressful life events, higher perceptions of stress, and more negative emotional experiences were associated with a greater likelihood of developing a clinical illness defined as cold symptoms concomitant with isolating an infectious virus or developing a 4-fold increase in antibody titers 18. In a second study, a life-stress interview replaced the questionnaire. This technique allowed the specification of the types of stressful events that increase risk. These included chronic events (lasting a month or longer), especially chronic social conflicts and underemployment or unemployment 18. Other plausible factors that might be the cause of both changes in stress and greater susceptibility to disease, such as age, sex, education, and personality characteristics including self-esteem and personal control, were unable to account for these results. The results demonstrated a relationship between psychological stress and susceptibility to several cold viruses. Attempts to find an association between stress and disease progression in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have met with conflicting results 19. Among a cohort of San Francisco AIDS patients, depression predicted CD4+ T-lymphocyte decline 20 and mortality 21. Analysis of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study failed to observe an association between depression and the decline of CD4+ T lymphocytes, disease progression, or death 22, but others have found significant associations between immunological parameters reflective of HIV progression and psychosocial factors, particularly denial and distress 23 and concealment of homosexual identity 24. Outside of proven clinical interventions, there is reason to think that certain changes in lifestyle might increase host resistance to infectious diseases. These include broadening one's social involvements (eg, joining social or spiritual groups, having a confidant, spending time with supportive friends) and being more careful to maintain healthful practices such as proper diet, exercise, and sleep, especially under stressful conditions 26.

Brain autoantibodies to myelin basic protein (anti-MBP) and neuron-axon filament protein (anti-NAFP) have been found in autistic children 8. Among 33 autistic children (less than or equal to 10 years of age) compared to 18 age-matched normal children, antibodies to myelin basic protein were found in 19 of 33 ( 58%) sera from autistic children as compared to only 7 of 50 ( 7% ) sera from control children 9. The diagnosis of autism was made by at least one pediatric psychiatrist and one clinical child psychologist using the DSM-III-R guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C. Since nearly 60% of autistic children show mental retardation ( MR ) (IQ of 70 or lower ), 20 children with MR due to unknown causes and 12 children with Down syndrome ( DS ) were also studied as the disease controls. The testing for serum antibodies to MBP was performed with the technique of protein-immunoblotting. This result indicated that the autistic children have about 8.3 times greater incidence of antibodies to MBP than the control children. Since none of the 12 DS children and only 3 of 20 MR children showed this antibody- positive reaction, the authors concluded that the mental retardation in autistic children was not related to the production of antibodies to MBP. Singh, et al. (1998), examined the associations between virus serology and autoantibody by simultaneous analysis of measles virus antibody (measles-IgG), human herpesvirus-6 antibody (HHV-6-IgG), They found that measles-IgG and HHV-6-IgG titers were moderately higher in autistic children but did not significantly differ from normal controls. They found that a vast majority of virus serology-positive autistic sera was also positive for brain autoantibody: (i) 90% of measles-IgG-positive autistic sera was also positive for anti-MBP; (ii) 73% of measles-IgG-positive autistic sera was also positive for anti-NAFP; (iii) 84% of HHV-6-IgG-positive autistic sera was also positive for anti-MBP; and (iv) 72% of HHV-6-IgG-positive autistic sera was also positive for anti-NAFP. Their study was the first to report an association between virus serology and brain autoantibody in autism. They authors believed that their data supported the hypothesis that a virus-induced autoimmune response may play a causal role in autism. Immunological testing of autistic children has shown certain features that are also found in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus ( These are: ( a ) genetic predisposition -- autism shows a greater concordance rate in monozygotic twins than in the normal population; ( b ) gender factor -- autism is 4 or 5 times more common in boys than in girls; ( c ) triggering by microorganisms -- rubella virus and cytomegalovirus infections have been indirectly linked to autism; ( d ) maternal factors --maternal antibodies in 10; (e ) major histocompatibility ( MHC ) association -- autism displays genetic linkage with immunogenetic factors located on chromosome six 11; and ( f ) immune activation 12. The parallels between autism and other autoimmune diseases suggest that autoimmunity may be a critical factor in the cause of autism. An essential part of the autoimmune mechanism should involve antibody-mediated immune response or antibodies against brain, the affected organ in autism. In this respect, a few recent studies in autism have found evidence of antibodies to brain tissue antigens, e.g., MBP, neurofilament proteins, and serotonin receptor 13. Antibodies to MBP may have some pathological relevance since abnormal cell-mediated immune response ( involving a soluble factor but not antibodies ) to this protein was previously detected, suggesting that autistic children somehow develop inappropriate immune responses to this brain protein 14. Brain-reactive antibodies and the increased serum levels of IgG3 antibody, which selectively activates complement function via classical pathway ( another type of immunity ), could be an important first step in the activation of complement-mediated nerve cell damage, thereby altering their ability to perform normal function of nerve impulse transmission 15. Despite numerous behavioral problems, research into the brains of autistic children has been hampered by the lack of available brain biopsies or autopsies. Based on a very limited number of case studies, anatomical abnormalities in certain parts of the brain have been found, but the findings are not suffiently consistent to permit any firm conclusion. While the pathological data are scarce, we know virtually nothing about the neurochemistry ( neurotransmitter function ) of the autistic brain. Whatever the pathological abnormalities might be, it is generally believed that the anatomical defects are the results of abnormal development rather than damage following full development of the brain in autistic children 16. At present, the relationship between antibodies to MBP and autism is not understood. However, the development of this immune response may be the basis of autoimmune pathogenesis in some cases of autism. At birth, there is very little myelin in the brain, and the synthesis of myelin may not be complete until the age of 10 years or older in the normal child 17. Moreover, it has been suggested that some children with learning disabilities ( LD ) may have delayed or incomplete myelin development 18. In light of the above, it is conceivable that if an immunological assault were to occur before birth or during infancy or childhood, it could lead to poor myelin development or abnormal function of the nerve fiber myelin. This line of thinking may be an important step in the future understanding of the pathological basis of autism. For more information about immunology and autism see the following sites: Immune Panels for Autism Spectrum Children The Autism Autoimmunity Project: Addressing Autism Through Immunology Altered Immunity & The Leaky Gut Syndrome Immune Response to Brain Myelin in Autistic Children [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Antibodies to Myelin Basic Protein found in Autistic Children: The theory of an autoimmune cause for autism rests upon studies that find antibodies to myelin basic protein (anti-MBP) in the sera of children with autism. A study of children under age 11, reported in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity (Volume 7, pp 97-103, 1993) compared 33 autistic children, with 18 normal children, 20 children with idiopathic mental retardation, 12 children with Down's syndrome, and - as a separate control - 38 normal adults in the age range of 20 to 40 years. Anti-MBP antibodies were found in 19 of 33 (58%) autistic children, but only in 8 of 88 (9%) control subjects. Among the controls, 15% were positive among mentally retarded children, 22% among normal children, less than 3% among normal adults, and none among Down's syndrome children. Neither seizure activity nor antipsychotic drugs were related to the production of anti-MBP since there was neither the history of seizures nor the intake of antipsychotic drugs among autistic or retarded children. Immunological studies of autistic patients have revealed features also found in patients with other autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases, including Grave's thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and insulin-dependant diabetes, show some genetic predisposition. Similarly, autism shows a greater concordance rate in monozygotic twins than in the normal population. Autism is four to five times more prevalent in boys than in girls \ufffd a gender factor also found in systemic lupus erythematosus, Grave?s disease, and ankylosing spondylitis. Autoimmune disease may be triggered by infections with bacteria or viruses. In autism, coincidental findings indicate infections with congenital rubella and cytomegalovirus. Certain soluble antigens of immunocyte activation are elevated in the sera of autistic children, similar to findings in other autoimmune diseases, like lupus and multiple sclerosis. Lymphocyte proliferation by phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and pokeweed mitogens are generally depressed in 40 to 50% of autistic patients. The blood proportions of CD4+ T helper cells and a suppresor-inducer (CD4CD45RA+) subset are significantly depressed in autistic patients. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Viral Infection Theory The viral theory of autism relies upon a relative immunosuppression, often thought to be in the intestinal tract, and a viral infection to produce the central nervous system symptoms of autism. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is an important defense in the intestines against viral infections and is often postulated to be deficient in autism. Viral encephalitis is known to give rise to autistic-like disorders, particularly when it occurs early in life.30 31 Among the viruses that can invade the gastrointestinal tract is herpes simplex (HSV), which has been shown in the human enteric nervous system, from which it can migrate into the CNS, including into the central amygdala (RM Gesser at al, series of studies). Other studies have shown that HSV (i) tends to migrate towards the cerebellum and temporal lobe, (ii) is capable of affecting language, (iii) can migrate intra-neuronally without causing encephalitis, and (iv) once within the CNS can remain hidden from view for long periods of time (ie, no peripheral signs, no detectable CSF markers (Dr. Snyder; Myron Levin et al). Some investigators speculate about an autism-spectrum subgroup wherein the infant or child's gastrointestinal pathology provides the route by which herpes simplex virus migrates into the central nervous system to produce the autistic symptoms. The major immunoglobulin (Ig) present in human secretions is a dimeric IgA covalently bound to an epithelial glycoprotein of about 80 kD, now called the secretory component (SC). IgA protects against viral infection from the gut. Secretory IgA and secretory IgM are the products of two cell types: plasma cells synthesise IgA dimers and IgM pentamers which, by non-covalent association, become complexed with the secretory component (SC) which is synthesized by serous-type glandular cells. The adsorption of the Ig polymers to the SC-expressing epithelial cells depends on J-chain-determined binding sites. This fact gives biological significance to the striking J chain expression shown by mucosal immunocytes regardless of the Ig class they produce. The immunocytes populating the gut mucosa apparently belong to relatively early memory B cell clones. The obvious functional goal of J chain expression at this stage of clonal differentiation is local generation of SC-binding IgA and IgM polymers. In various gut diseases, altered immune regulation results in a disproportionately increased number of J chain-negative IgG-producing cells in the mucosa. Such altered immunological homeostasis may contribute to perpetuation of inflammatory bowel diseases. Pentameric IgM is likewise actively enriched in most exocrine fluids (like gut excretions) and is associated with SC, although not in a covalently stabilized complex. Three findings explain the selective translocation of polymeric Ig (pIg) into exocrine fluids: (1) preferential local production; (2) J-chain-expressing capacity of pIg-producing immunocytes; and (3) SC-mediated epithelial transport. The J chain of pIg and the epithelial SC represent the \"lock and key\" in the glandular transport of secretory IgA (SIgA) and SIgM. It has recently been shown that SC is synthesized as a transmembrane protein of about 95 kD and constitutes the actual pIg surface receptor. Complexing between ligand and receptor in the plasma membrane is followed by endocytosis. The completed SIgA and SIgM molecules are then translocated in cytoplasmic vesicles through the epithelial cell to the gland lumen along with an excess of free SC. The main function of SIgA is to exert immune exclusion; that is, by intimate cooperation with innate nonspecific defense factors it decreases penetration of soluble antigens and inhibits epithelial colonization of bacteria and viruses. Especially in selective IgA deficiency, SIgM may exert a similar protective function since its synthesis is markedly increased in the intestinal mucosa, especially in selective IgA deficiency. IgG should not be considered a secretory immunoglobulin because its external translocation depends on passive intercellular diffusion. By activating complement, antibodies of this isotype may cause increased mucosal permeability and tissue damage. By activating complement, IgG antibodies may at the same time be phlogistic and accelerate mucosal penetration of antigens. IgG may thus contribute to persistent immunopathology in mucosal disease. The same is true for IgE antibodies which, in atopic individuals, may be carried into the gut mucosa by mast cells and cause their degranulation with histamine release. Leakage of IgG into exocrine fluids is enhanced by mucosal irritation. Although IgG should not be considered as a SIg, it may contribute to immune exclusion. This is seen especially in the respiratory tract where IgG is less easily subjected to proteolytic degradation than in the intestinal juice. Traces of IgD may likewise be found in the secretions but without obvious biologic significance. Regulation of secretory immunity takes place both in organized lymphoepithelial structures in the gut, such as the Peyer's patches, and adjacent to the glands in the lamina propria of the gut 19 20. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Vaccinations and Autism Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a Gastroenterologist at the Royal Free Hospital in London, England, discovered a possible connection between autism and viral infection associated with the MMR vaccination. The damage from autism is thought to be provoked by the an allergic type reaction initiated by the body s reaction to the vaccine. This auto-immine response could also affect DPP-IV, reducing its levels, thereby connecting vaccines to the opioid theory of autism. For more information, please see The Mechanism of Encephalitic Damage from Vaccines by Val Valerian. Myelination is an essential part of human brain development. Nerves can only conduct pulses of energy efficiently if it is covered with myelin. Like insulation on an electric wire, the fatty coating of myelin helps keep the pulses confined and maintains the integrity of the electrical signal so that it has a high signal-to-noise ratio. When the insulation on a wire is damaged or destroyed, the flow of electrical current may be interrupted and a short-circuit occurs. See Colorado Health Net's MS Definitions, Facts, and Statistics for more information. Oligodendrocyte cells give white matter its color by manufacturing myelin. If myelin falls into disrepair, nerve axons cease to function, even though they themselves aren't damaged. Protecting oligodendrocytes after brain or spinal cord injury might keep nerve cells intact.\" See Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine's article on new findings on nervous system damage for more information. At birth, relatively few pathways have myelin insulation. Myelination in the human brain continues from before birth until at least 20 years of age. Up until the age of 10 or so, vast areas of the cortex are not yet myelinated, and up to the age of 20, large areas of the frontal lobes are not yet myelinated 21. Myelination begins in the developmentally oldest parts of the brain, like the brain stem, moving to the areas of the nervous system that have developed more recently, like the prefrontal lobe and cortex. Myelin spreads throughout the nervous system in stages which vary slightly in each individual. Impairment of myelination can alter neural communication without necessarily causing severe CNS damage. The prefrontal portions of the cerebrum have a profound influence on human behavior 22. If an individual is injected with vaccines,most of which have adjuvants like mercury and aluminum compounds, as well as foreign proteins (some from other species in which the vaccines were grown) and biological organisms, unprotected nerves may be impacted. The argument for a role of vaccines in the development of autistic disorders hinges on these biological effects upon nerves, damaging them in a way that influences behavior and learning patterns. The history of studies on vaccines began in 1922 when a smallpox vaccination program caused an outbreak of encephalitis, with a secondary result of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, an ascending paralysis ending in death. The polio virus produces a breakdown of the myelin shealth, called poliomyelitis, which results in paralysis. Encephalitis, whether caused through disease or as a result of vaccination, can cause demyelination of the nerves. For more information, see again The Mechanism of Encephalitic Damage from Vaccines. \"In regions in which there is no organized vaccination of the population, general paralysis is rare. It is impossible to deny a connection between vaccination and the encephalitis which follows it. 23\" In 1935, Thomas Rivers discovered \"experimental allergic encephalomyelitis,\" or (EAE). Until then, it was assumed that encephalitis was caused by a viral or bacterial infection of the nervous system. Rivers was able to produce brain inflammation in laboratory monkeys by injecting them repeatedly with extracts of sterile normal rabbit brain and spinal cord material, which made it apparent that encephalitis was an allergic reaction. EAE can explain the association of allergies and autoimmune states with encephalitis. In 1947, Isaac Karlin suggested that stuttering was caused by \"delay in the myelinization of the cortical areas in the brain concerned with speech.\" In 1988, research by Dietrich and others using MRI imaging of the brains of infants and children from four days old to 36 months of age have found that those who were developmentally delayed had immature patterns of myelination. In 1953 it was realized that some children's diseases, measles in particular, showed an increased propensity to attack the central nervous system. This indicated a growing allergic reaction in the population to both the diseases and the vaccinations for the diseases. In 1978, British researcher, Roger Bannister, observed that the demyelinating diseases were getting more serious \"because of some abnormal process of sensitization of the nervous system.\" Some investigators believe that this increased sensitization of the population is being enhanced by vaccination programs. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] DPT and Brain Damage: In 1948, Randolph Byers and Frederick Moll , of Harvard Medical School and the Federal Drug Administration carried out tests on DPT vaccines at Children's Hospital in Boston and concluded that severe neurological problems could follow the administration of DPT vaccines. The results of the tests were published in Pediatrics. In 1976, Dr. Charles Manclark, an FDA scientist, remarked that \"the DPT vaccine had one of the worst failure rates of any product submitted to the Division of Biologics for testing.\" According to the testimony of the Assistant Secretary of Health, Edward Grant, Jr., before a U.S. Senate Committee on May 3rd, 1985, every year, 35,000 children suffer neurological damage related to the DTP vaccine. See \"Vaccinations\", by Alex Logia, for more information. In 1992, the Institute of Medicine concluded that \"the evidence is consistent with a causal relation between DPT vaccine and acute encephalopathy, defined in the studies reviewed as encephalopathy, encephalitis, or encephalomyelitis, and the evidence indicates a causal relation between DPT vaccine and anaphylaxis, between the pertussis component of DPT vaccine and protracted, inconsolable crying.\" For more information, see the Leading Edge Master Analysis of the Vaccination Paradigm. Like the material used to produce experimental allergic encephalitis, vaccines contain substances which qualify as \"adjuvants. These substances initiate reactionary antibody formation. Common adjuvants used in vaccines are aluminum hydroxide and aluminum potassium sulfate. In the body, formalin coating around the injected material dissolves, releasing all bacterial and viral particles from animal culture sources. Substances such as thimerosal and these adjuvant chemicals irritate body tissues and increase the action of accompanying bacteria and viruses, as well as the reaction of the immune system to the foreign protein antigens, potentially damaging neurological membranes where the myelin sheath has only partially protected the nervous system. This can result in mild to severe neurological damage, leading to learning disabilities and other nervous system disorders, or death, especially upon subsequent injections, since body has already been sensitized, promoting allergic reactions of increasingly severe nature. For more information, see again the Leading Edge Master Analysis of the Vaccination Paradigm. Dr. Charles M Poser has drawn the link between the vaccines and demyelination: \"Almost any... vaccine can lead to a non infectious inflammatory reaction involving the nervous system 24. The common denominator consists of a vasculopathy that is often... associated with demyelination.\" For more information, see the Society For The Autistically Handicapped (S.F.T.A.H.)'s Vaccines: Fact Sheet. Jonas Salk, the developer of the vaccine, wrote in 1975, \"Live virus vaccines against influenza or poliomyelitis may in each instance produce the disease it intended to prevent . . . . the live virus against measles and mumps may produce such side effects as encephalitis 25. \" Post-vaccinal pathology of the central nervous system (CNS) is a topic deserving further investigation (An Italian Study Finding Biochemical Markers of Vaccine Damage, \ufffd 1996, Harris L. Coulter, Ph.D.). Observation of 30 patients of Italian nationality, observed between April, 1994, and October, 1995, showed that clinical signs of CNS pathology, along with associated dermatitis, food allergies, constipation, and leaking from the anus, emerged concomitantly or immediately after vaccination with the Salk or Sabin polio vaccine, DT, measles, DPT, anti-tuberculosis, or Hepatitis-B vaccines 26. These 30 patients from various regions of Italy, all presented with a clinical history of convulsions concomitant with, or immediately after, vaccinations. Patients whose clinical history was not referable to a vaccination were excluded from the study. Accepted patients received tissue typing for HLA (A, B, C) and HLA DR-DQ. Various immune functions: were also studied, including lymphocyte subpopulations, serum immunoglobulin content, and presence of viruses (CMV, EBV, HSV-1 and HSV-2, VZV). Patients had earlier with epilepsy, myoclonic epilepsy, evoving epilepsy, epileptigenic encephalopathy, autism, West Syndrome, and Angelman's Syndrome. All the patients had presented with the first symptoms shortly after receiving a vaccination. The first symptoms were convulsions, high fever, or diarrhea immediately following vaccination. The parents had told their physicians about this; then, after taking EEGs and visiting neuropsychiatric specialists or pediatricians without conclusion, the physicians had administered the recall shots of the vaccines leading to stabilization of the condition with progressive clinical deterioration. Children were 3 to 9 months old. All patients were studied for the presence of metabolic diseases with negative results; then chromosomal mapping was done, also with negative results; encephalic TAC and RMN were performed at first appearance of the symptomatology, also with negative results. The EEG performed at first appearance of the symptomatology gave a negative result in 92% of the patients. Serologic investigations for herpetic virus (IgG and IgM) were positive in all for IgG and negative for all for IgM, leading to an estimate of seropositivity (IgG) for Epstein-Barr virus of 73.8%; Herpes virus, of 47.6%; and for Varicella-Zoster Virus of 21.4%. In all the patients they observed diminished sideremia and a deficit of IgA and IgG with a slight increase of SGOT and SGPT. None of the patients had maternally transmitted viral encephalopathy, and in all the patients the vegetative and relational life was quite normal prior to administration of the first dose of vaccine. Again, see An Italian Study Finding Biochemical Markers of Vaccine Damage, for more information. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] MMR Vaccine and Autism: The following news release appeared in the popular media in 1998, and was a major television news item: Cleveland, Ohio, Posted 4:00 p.m. November 20, 1998: \"Studies Suggest the Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine Is a Possible Cause of Autism\" NewsChannel5 reports hundreds of thousands of children receive the MMR vaccine every year, but now studies show a tiny percentage of cases may cause autism. Since the MMR vaccine was introduced about 35 years ago,the incidents of autism in children have increased by 1,000 percent, from two or three in 10,000 to one in 500. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Pro & Con Research on MMR, Autism Connection Compared: The publications of Dr. Andrew Wakefield in March 1998 and of Dr. Brent Taylor in June 1999 share only two important features, they both originated from The Royal Free Hospital in London, and they both appeared in Lancet. Andrew Wakefield did his first colonoscopy on an autistic child, because the anguished mother begged him to find the reason why her son had such terrible gastro-intestinal problems. When he found some very specific pathology, Dr. Wakefield proceeded to investigate several more autistic children, identifying and documenting, again and again, the same very unusual findings. A particular aspect of the history intrigued Dr. Wakefield. Many parents adamantly stated that their children's autistic symptoms appeared shortly after they received the MMR vaccine. One ten year old boy's story was probably the most striking This child was fine, and absolutely normal in every respect, as per his doctor, parents, and teachers. Shortly after he received the MMR vaccine, he started exhibiting symptoms of autistic behavior, and within three months, he was severely damaged. Dr. Wakefield, in his very professionally written article, described each case carefully, history, blood work, colonoscopy findings, and histo-pathological reports, etc. He went on to review the work of several distinguished researchers in different fields, who were also looking at the causes of Autism, and had developed tests, or suggested therapies. Dr. Wakefield had no choice but to mention that many parents reported some temporal relationship between the MMR vaccine administration, and the onset of their children's autistic symptoms. As an ethical researcher he could not in all conscience, \"bury\" such a frequently reported association, and he urged other disciplines to study the problem. Although full of medical terms, Dr. Wakefield's paper was clear, and easy to understand, even by a lay person. Findings were factual, and all conclusions were justified, logical, and fully supported by the evidence presented. The immediate result of Dr.Wakefield's paper was a vitriolic attack from every front. A flood of opposing articles appeared in the same issue of Lancet, and systematic criticism, nearing persecution, of this decent researcher began, and is still going on. Distraught parents of affected children have become even more confused, because no one has been able to prove conclusively to them yet, that an MMR vaccine-Autism connection does not really exist. There have been no safety follow-up studies looking beyond four weeks post vaccination, and many studies quoted, have been partially funded by vaccine manufacturers, with obvious commercial interests. Indeed, no serious researcher has looked at a large sample, three to nine months post MMR vaccination, when auto-immune diseases usually would occur. When some parents in England became vocal, the pro-vaccine authorities in the UK reacted forcefully, to protect their MMR vaccination program. The single measles, mumps and rubella vaccines effectively became unavailable, and every effort was made to prove Dr. Wakefield wrong. The Medicines Control Agency and The Public Health Laboratory Service supported a study, to be carried out by the Department of Community Child Health Royal Free, Dr. Wakefield's own institution, and University College Medical School, London. Again, it is important to repeat here, that Dr. Wakefield never said there was a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. The just published study by Taylor et al was hailed by everyone as the definitive work on the subject, .......but is it?. I personally believe it has raised more questions than it has answered. Dr. Taylor's paper seems difficult to read and understand. The summary findings are confusing, and the whole report is full of statistics, symbols and figures, clearly for the purpose of proving that the conclusions are unquestionably true. Case series analysis is a very weak statistical approach, and can only reliably suggest or refute relationships in very large samples. The samples in this case are small. The methodology used is therefore of marginal quality, and the authors readily acknowledge its limitations. Dr. Taylor and associates also present some data as graphs, without text support. This makes it impossible for the reader to check said graph data for accuracy, and tends to disguise the very small sample size used. It is customary that study results are written as a text, and then, a chart or a graph can be added, to emphasize a point. The authors report numbers clearly indicating a massive and persistent increase in autism over the years. They then do not offer any sensible cause for that increase to negate an MMR connection, and choose to conclude simply that their study fails to prove any causal relationship. Elsewhere, Dr. Taylor and associates, state that the age of diagnosis was the same before and after the introduction of the MMR vaccine, and then go on to deduct, that this is proof that the MMR vaccine therefore does not have a causative role, a conclusion I have difficulty with. On page 6, Dr. Taylor states in his discussion, in the last paragraph, that \"There is uncertainty about whether the prevalence of autism is increasing\". This totally contradicts all what he reported through the article, and particularly the statement which immediately followed, \"Our study is consistent with an increase in autism in recent birth cohorts.\" It also contradicts the most impressive California report to the legislature. and my own, Autism 99, A National Emergency, in which I have clearly demonstrated a four to seven fold increase in the incidence of Autism in the last seven years. On page 7, third paragraph, Dr. Taylor states: \"For age at first parental concern, no significant temporal clustering was seen for cases of core autism and atypical autism, with the exception of a single interval within six months of MMR vaccine associated with a peak in reported age of parental concern at 18 months.\" In the next paragraph, Dr. Taylor states, \" Our results do not support the hypothesis that MMR vaccination is causally related to autism \". I am personally unable to understand how he can make such a deduction after he himself reported a peak. But by far, the most serious problem I have with this study, is the case selection, ie the very data on which the paper is based. The MMR vaccination was started in the UK in 1988. The vaccine was originally administered around age fifteen months to avoid its neutralization by maternal antibodies. ( Lately, this has been changed to twelve months of age.) By selecting children born \"after 1987\", Dr. Taylor does not include in the post- MMR series, all children born in 1986 and 1987, who reached the age of 15 months in 1988, and received the vaccine at some time that year or later. Also not included were the 2, 3 and 4 year old children, whose parents had not immunized pre 88, and who received the MMR vaccine when it became available, or when the requirement was enforced. Finally, also excluded from the sample were many children who had received one of the single vaccines (Measles, Mumps or Rubella) from 1983 on, and who were given a booster of MMR in 88 or later. By excluding ALL these children, Dr. Taylor not only removes them from the after 1988 group, but indeed adds them to the pre-1988 statistics. I believe this flaw alone may compromise the whole study. In the first paragraph, Dr. Taylor and associates state that \"we undertook the study to investigate whether the MMR vaccine may be causally associated with autism\". It rather seems to me that this study was undertaken to prove that there was no causal association between the two. Similarly, Dr. Taylor states in the last paragraph that his results \"will reassure parents and others, who have been concerned about the possibility that the MMR vaccine is likely to cause Autism, and that they will help restore confidence in MMR vaccine\". To my knowledge no one has ever said that the MMR vaccine is \"likely\" to cause autism. Concerned parents have only requested that independent researchers investigate why certain somehow predisposed children exhibit autistic symptoms shortly after they receive the MMR vaccine. It also seems unlikely to me, that Dr. Taylor's work has helped restore the confidence of those parents in this vaccine. It may soon be apparent that in spite of all the publicity that surrounded the publication of this study, it somehow \"has missed the mark\". I do not believe Dr. Taylor and associates have significantly changed the picture. The following facts remain: The incidence of Autism has increased significantly in the last decade. There is every reason to believe that this trend will continue. No one has proved that MMR vaccine plays a role in autism. No one has proved conclusively that it does not. Serious studies by independent researchers are desperately needed, to look into all aspects of this dreadful disease. - F. Edward Yazbak, MD, FAAP [Note: Dr. Yazbak is one of the collaborating physicians of the Autism Autoimmunity Project.] The above article originally appeared in the June 24, 1999 issue of the FEAT Daily Online Newsletter. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Elevated Rubeola Autistic Children and MMR vaccine: T. Zecca , et al. at the New Jersey Medical School's Children's Hospital of New Jersey in Newark compared rubeola virus in autistic and normal children. Among 16 children diagnosed with autism followed in their clinical practice, they found a 3-fold increase in rubeola titers over expected normal range. A Wilcoxon Kruskal Wallas test comparing 13 rubeola titers from normal children revealed a statistically significant p-value of 0.005. Subjectively, parents have stated that their children's developmental milestones deteriorated following MMR vaccination. Neurological sequelae following MMR are widely reported. The authors suggested that elevated titers of anti-measles antibodies in autistic children could signify a chronic activation of the immune system against this neurotropic virus, which may play a role in the pathogenic sequences of events leading to autism. They emphasized the need for further studies. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Vaccination During Pregnancy and Risk for Autism: F. Yazbak describes six mothers who received live virus vaccines and one received a Hepatitis B vaccine during pregnancy after having received an MMR booster five months prior to conception. All the children who resulted from these pregnancies have had developmental problems, six out seven (85%) were diagnosed with autism, and the seventh seems to exhibit symptoms often associated with autistic spectrum disorders. Since we do not know from this data how many women received vaccines during pregnancy and had entirely normal children, Yazbak's observations may be spurious. Nevertheless, the observation could be important. For a copy of this observation, see: Autism: Is There a Vaccine Connection? Part I: Vaccination after Delivery and Autism: Is There a Vaccine Connection? Part II: Vaccination During Pregnancy. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Vaccination and the Risk for Autism: Do vaccines contribute to autism? A February 28, 1998, report in The Lancet suggested an association among inflammatory bowel disease, autism, and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine based on 12 cases. Dozens of heart-rending anecdotal accounts link permanent neurologic disability or death to vaccine use. One of the leading sites in the anti-immunization field is the National Vaccine Information Centre (NVIC). Some information about the risks and side effects of vaccines on the NVIC site is accurate in spite of its overwhelming emphasis on the risks of vaccination. Nevertheless, as the site states, \"Vaccination is a medical procedure which carries a risk of injury or death. As a parent, it is your responsibility to become educated about the benefits and risks of vaccines in order to make the most informed, responsible vaccination decisions.\" A similar statement can be made about any medical procedure. There area also possible, but unproven links between MMR vaccine and juvenile diabetes, multiple vaccines and autism, and OPV and Gulf War syndrome. Time and further research will tell if these proposed relationships are real. In the Lancet report, Dr. Wakefield and team from Royal Free Hospital and School of Medicine in London reported a case series of 12 children, referred to their pediatric gastroenterology clinic with a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder and intestinal symptoms. These children had lost acquired skills, including communication, after a period of apparent normality. Among eight of the children, the onset of behavioral problems had been linked, either by the parents or the child's physician, with MMR vaccination. Five had an early adverse reaction to immunization (rash, fever, delirium, and seizures in 3). The average interval from exposure to first behavioral symptom was 6.3 days (range 1-14). Among the remaining 4 children, one received monovalent measles vaccine at 15 months, after which his development slowed. A striking deterioration then occurred in his behavior at age 4.5 years, the day after he received an MMR vaccine. A second child received the MMR vaccine at 16 months, developing at 18 months a combination of recurrent, antibiotic resistant, otitis media, along with his first behavioral symptoms (lack of interest in siblings and lack of play). A third child received an MMR at 15 months, experienced recurrent \"viral pneumonia\" for the next 8 weeks, and developed behavioral symptoms 4 weeks after the MMR ( loss of speech development and deterioration in language skills). The fourth child developed self- injurious behavior 2 month after the MMR. Urinary methylmalonic - acid excretion was significantly raised in all children tested (8 of the 12). Ten of the twelve children showed lymphoid nodular hyperplasia of the terminal ileum on endoscopy. The eleventh child had prominent luteal lymph nodes and the ileum was not reached in the twelfth (who had an ulcer in the rectum along with chronic colitis). Other studies have suggested a link between autism and vaccination. H.H.Fudenberg reported that the first symptoms of autism among 15 of 20 children developed within a week of vaccination. S.Gupta commented on the striking association between MMR vaccination and the onset of behavioral symptoms in all the children he investigated for regressive autism. The MMR vaccine is all live virus. Disintegrative psychosis is recognized as a sequela of measles encephalitis. Viral encephalitis can give rise to autistic disorders, particularly when it occurs early in life. A genetic association for autism is represented by a null allele of the complement C4B gene located in the class III region of the major histocompatibility complex. The C4B-gene is also crucial for protection against viruses. Affected individuals may not handle certain viruses appropriately; even the attenuated ones used in vaccines. In an addendum to the paper, the authors noted that their sample size had increased to 40 children by Jan 28,1998, with 39 of those showing similar findings. These studies raise an important provocative point. MMR vaccine may trigger a cascade of events leading to autism in genetically susceptible children. The possibility must be further studied. Unfortunately vaccination among public health and medical practitioners has become almost sacred. Questioning the wisdom of vaccination for certain children is seen as professional heresy. Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be ignored. Could killed MMR accomplish the same task? Should measles be administered separately from mumps? We know that the combination of chicken pox and measles dramatically increases the risk for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Perhaps other mixed viral infections are also clinically significant. More important is the science we must use to explore this. Simply correlation analysis and comparison studies will not suffice. If autism is linked to MMR vaccine in genetically susceptible individuals, unless these individuals are selected from the larger pool, the statistical significance will cancel out. Medical research suffers from a failure to consider interactions and synergy in the disease process. Simple epidemiology will not suffice, since we are not even sure what the potential genetic defect is in autism or if autism is one syndrome or many. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Action of Secretin Theories The improvement of some autistic people on secretin has been dramatic. No one knows how secretin brings about behavioral changes. A good review of Secretin can be found at The National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR) Website increases intracellular cAMP in certain brain regions. One thought is that secretin administration reverses the lowering of cAMP brought about by opioids. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Lectins Lectins are able to bind to cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors and other glycosylated membrane proteins 27. germ agglutinin (WGA) Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA-I), the highly glycosylated CCK-A receptor of pancreatic acinar cells. In CCK-8-induced alpha-amylase secretion over strong inhibitory effect on amylase secretion, approximately 40%, in vitro. UEA-I caused a smaller, but significant decrease, approximately 20%, in enzyme secretion of isolated cerulein-induced pancreatic secretion of rats in vivo, but not after secretin alone. The results are discussed with respect to a possible influence of both lectins on the interaction of CCK or cerulein with the CCK-A receptor. There are two divergent opinions on secretin--one that high dose secretin is necessary to obtain CNS binding of secretin to receptors in the brain as opposed to the concept that secretin is a neuropeptide and only small concentrations are required (as per oral secretin administration). [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] The Concept of Increased Intestinal Permeability The concept of increased intestinal permeability is key to many theories of autism. Just how important is the integrity of the intestine's mucosal lining to good health? In children in remote tropical regions without access to adequate medical care, progressive damage to the gut's barrier function can eventually lead to life-threatening conditions, requiring them to be airlifted for emergency medical treatment. Aboriginal children in Australia, for example, have high rates of severe intestinal diseases, or enteropathies, that cause chronic diarrhea. These conditions can lead to dehydration, acidosis, and hypokalaemia - serious complications associated with central nervous system damage and even death. To shed more light on how these conditions develop, researchers from Australia evaluated intestinal permeability (IP) in Aboriginal children, measuring the rate that two nondigestible sugars are excreted in urine after ingesting a challenge drink. This noninvasive test indicates the gut's ability to absorb nutrients and to block toxins, bacteria, allergens, and other potentially harmful molecules from penetrating into the systemic circulation. The IP ratio for Aboriginal children with diarrhea was, on average, more than twice as high as that found in their healthy Aboriginal peers. When compared with healthy non-Aboriginal children, these Aboriginal children with diarrhea showed an IP ratio over three times higher than normal. An elevated ratio of larger molecules such as lactuolose to smaller sugar molecules such as mannitol or rhamnose, recovered in the urine sample, indicates increased permeability and mucosal damage. This value is known as the IP ratio. Surprisingly, a higher IP ratio was found even in healthy Aboriginal children without diarrhea. Researchers speculated that this increased permeability - double that normally found in healthy non-Aboriginal children - was \"consistent with an underlying partial villous atrophy,\" a wearing down of the finger-like projections on the intestine's mucosal layer, caused by environmental factors. For this reason, the Aboriginal children were more susceptible to gastrointestinal diseases and their complications. How does this all happen? One possible mechanism involves the body's digestion of milk products. Increased IP may reflect damage to the microvilli, which can reduce levels of lactase, the enzyme needed to digest milk sugar, eventually triggering osmotic diarrhea. Once this disease process starts, small bowel mucosal damage, indicated by higher IP ratios, remains \"an important factor\" associated with increased acidosis, hypokalaemia, iron deficiency, dehydration, and parasitic infection. Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory offers an Intestinal Permeability Assessment. This test is a noninvasive and convenient way to evaluate gut mucosal barrier function in patients with chronic gastrointestinal disorders or in those individuals with a higher likelihood of developing such problems, including patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, especially those using NSAIDS. I use it with my autistic children and monitor the effectivenes of my treatment to reduce intestinal permeability. Two physicians have written articles that are posted on the Great Smokies' web site: Inflammatory Conditions and the Gastrointestinal Tract, by Myron Lezak. M.D., and Leaky Gut Syndrome: A Modern Epidemic, by Jake Paul Fratkin, O.M.D. Both discuss aspects of intestinal permeability and the conditions related to impaired mucosal function. I suspect intestinal permeability is very important for autistic children, and that the assay should be routinely used as a means of following the success of therapies for autism.

[Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Gastrointestinal Abnormalities Among Children with Autism Horvath, et al. (1999)29 evaluated the structure and function of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a group of patients with autism who had gastrointestinal symptoms. Thirty-six children (age: 5.7 \ufffd 2 years, mean \ufffd SD) with autistic disorder underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies, intestinal and pancreatic enzyme analyses, and bacterial and fungal cultures. The most frequent gastrointestinal complaints were chronic diarrhea, gaseousness, and abdominal discomfort and distension. Histologic examination in these 36 children revealed grade I or II reflux esophagitis in 25 (69.4%), chronic gastritis in 15, and chronic duodenitis in 24. The number of Paneth's cells in the duodenal crypts was significantly elevated in autistic children compared with non-autistic control subjects. Low intestinal carbohydrate digestive enzyme activity was reported in 21 children (58.3%), although there was no abnormality found in pancreatic function. Seventy-five percent of the autistic children (27/36) had an increased pancreatico-biliary fluid output after intravenous secretin administration. Nineteen of the 21 patients with diarrhea had significantly higher fluid output than those without diarrhea. The authors concluded that unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders, especially reflux esophagitis and disaccharide malabsorption, may contribute to the behavioral problems of non-verbal autistic patients. The observed increase in pancreatico-biliary secretion after secretin infusion suggested an upregulation of secretin receptors in the pancreas and liver. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Binstock's Anterior Insular Hypothesis for Linkage Between Gut and Brain. Binstock (http://www.jorsm.com/~binstock/insular.htm) has developed a hypothesis to explain the gut-brain relationships for autistic children. The anterior insular cortex (aIC) links visceral sensation from the gastrointestinal tract with the amygdala and the hypothalamus (1-6). The anterior insular cortex also participates in oral phenomena, object recognition, and naming (5) along with \"apraxia of speech\" (7,8). Twenty-five stroke patients with articulatory deficits all had a lesion within \"a discrete region of the left precentral gyrus of the insula\", whereas this area was \"completely spared\" in 19 stroke patients without these deficits (7). Autism-spectrum children with atypical oral habits and/or disorders of naming and of language (9-10) also tend to have a typical gastrointestinal symptoms (11-12). There is also a growing volume of anecdotal data that a small subgroup of autism-spectrum children experiences improved sound production and language use in response to treatments whose focus and effects are gastrointestinal. These treatments include gluten-free and casein-free diets, anti-Candida therapies, anti-viral therapies, and antibiotic therapies (13-19,31,32) suggesting that the underlying neuronal circuitry is intact. Binstock suggests that the aIC and associated nuclei could become disrupted by at least two mechanisms: (I) intraneuronal migration of a neurotropic virus and/or (II) chronic hyperstimulation of the gastrointestinal tract. Gesser and colleagues have documented (I) the translocation of HSV from the gastrointestinal tract into the mesenteric nervous system (rats and humans), and (II) the migration of mesenteric HSV as far as theamygdaloid nuclei in rats (20-23). In this theory, viruses could migrate from the gastrointestinal tract through neural pathways into the central nervous system. Given a high rate of stimulation of neuron pathways reporting gastrointestinalconditions to limbic regions and cortex, neurotransmitter or intracellular-messenger use in excess of their production or recirculation could occur, thereby inducing a change of function of neurons within the aIC. This hypothesis provides a basis for helping autistic children through treating their gastrointestinal disturbances. References: Krushel LA, van der Kooy D.

[Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Prenatal Aspartamate Exposure Some parents suspect that prenatal aspartame (NutraSweet) can trigger the auto-immune response that leads eventually to autism. Controversy exists about the potential effects of this artificial sweetener, and about whether or not it has an effect on the developing brain. We agree that there is absolutely no reason for its use. Nancy Markle (1120197) lectured at the World Environmental Council in 1999 on Aspartame, also marketed as Equal and Spoonful. When the temperature of Aspartame exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood alcohol in Aspartame coverts to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which in turn causes metabolic acidosis. The methanol toxicity is thought to mimic the symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Some believe that systemic lupus erythematosis may be triggered by Aspartame. Other practitioners report that lupus improves when diet soda consumption is stopped. Symptoms of fibromyalgia, spasms, shooting pains, numbness in the legs, cramps, vertigo, dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, joint pain, depression, anxiety, slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory loss have been attributed to Aspartame. It is thought that the methanol in the aspartame converts to formaldehyde in the retina of the eye, causing blindness. Aspartame changes the dopamine level in the brain, affecting Parkinson's Disease. This drug is thought by some to cause Birth Defects. In the Congressional record, Dr. Roberts stated, \"It makes you crave carbohydrates, and will make you gain weight.\" He reported that when he got patients off aspartame, their average weight loss was 19 pounds per person. The formaldehyde stores in the fat cells, particularly in the hips and thighs. Aspartame is thought to make diabetic control especially problematic. Memory loss is thought to be due to aspartic acid and phenylalanine being neurotoxic without the other amino acids found in protein. They may go past the blood brain barrier and deteriorate the neurons of the brain. Dr. Russell Blaylock, neurosurgeon, said, \"The ingredients stimulate the neurons of the brain excessively, causing ... damage of varying degrees. Dr. Blaylock has written a book entitled Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills (Or, Publisher: Health Press: 1-800-643-2665). Dr. H.J. Roberts, diabetic specialist, has written a book entitled Defense Against Alzheimer's Disease : A Rational Blueprint for Prevention ( Or, 1-800-814-9800). Dr. Roberts believes that aspartame poisoning is escalating Alzheimer's Disease. Dr. Roberts says, \"consuming aspartame at the time of conception can cause birth defects.\" \"The phenylalanine concentrates in the placenta, causing mental retardation,\" according to Dr. Louis Elsas, Pediatrician Professor -Geneticist, at Emory University in testimony before Congress. In the original lab tests, animals developed brain tumors (phenylalanine breaks down into DXP, a brain tumor agent). We recommend avoiding aspartame, since it has no nutritional value and appears to contribute to weight gain overall, rather than weight loss. While its effects on the developing brain are largely speculative, it clearly has no benefits, is not a food, and should be avoided. Apparently, the term diet drink, is a misnomer. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Vitamin A Deficiency and Autism Research is currently being conducted by Dr. Mary Megson on a connection between Vitamin A deficiency and Autism. Children are receiving either Vitamin A or placebos to study effect on behavioral and biological symptoms. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 250 million children worldwide have Vitamin A deficiency. While these statistics refer to primarily developing nations, researchers are beginning to examine a link between Vitamin A deficiency and Autism. Autistic children may have a Vitamin A deficiency because of gastrointestinal inflammation caused by Leaky Gut syndrome, allergies or viral infections. Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of treatable blindness in the world. This important vitamin is necessary for the health of every organ in the body. It is essential for normal growth and development, cell growth and repair, especially in bones, teeth, collagen and cartilage. Vitamin is known as a natural anti-infective and anti-viral agent. Vitamin A can be found naturally in animal products like liver and whole milk and cold water fish like salmon and cod. Cod liver oil is an excellent source of Vitamin A. For further information about Vitamin A deficiency and Autism see the links below. Article: Autism May Linked to Vitamin A Deficiency Vitamin A Information Dr. Megson's Vitamin A Research Fish Oil and Cod Liver Oil Wellness Page [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Orphanin Protein: Orphanin FQ/nociceptin (OFQ/N) A brain protein may modulate the level of anxiety experienced by those who are exposed to novel or threatening environments.28 The protein has been discovered by researchers at the University of California, Irvine. Mice who lacked the gene required to produce the OFQ/N protein display ''increased anxiety-like behavior when exposed to a novel and threatening environment.'' OFQ/N is concentrated in several areas, including the hypothalamus and amygdala. These brain areas are essential for modulating stress reactions. The chances that OFQ/N has a similar function in humans is very high (since) the protein is identical between rat, mouse, and human and is made in the same brain regions in all three species. The protein is relevent to autism in that it might explain the exaggerated anxiety experienced by some developmentally disabled children. Future interventions may develop based upon manipulating the levels of this protein in key brain areas. [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Smoke and Air Pollution May Be Related to Learning and Behavioral Problems The following appeared in Science Total Environment in January, 1989. While the reference is old, the problem is not: \"The Effect of Ambient Cadmium Air Pollution on the Hair Mineral Content of Children\" Stewart-Pinkham, SM Neurobehavioral Toxicologist Columbus, OH 43212. \"Hair analyses of 80 children with learning and behavioral problems were assessed by age, sex, season, place of residence, exposure to passive smoke and excess contact with known cadmium air pollutant sources. All children had been exposed for at least 2 years to air pollution from a refuse-derived fuel incineration plant. All of the patients had increased hair cadmium compared with a control group, but there was a strong seasonal influence on hair cadmium. Exposure to cadmium was ubiquitous. A neurobehavioral toxic effect was found in children who showed evidence of inhibition of pyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase by low hair phosphorus levels and low zinc levels in whom there was enhanced lead absorption. Hair analyses appear to be a useful biological monitor for detecting toxic effects from ambient air cadmium levels in subsets of the population at risk for heavy metal toxicity. Air filter measurements appear worthless for detecting environmental contamination with cadmium in air with low levels of lead. Trees, on the other hand, which are more adversely affected by cadmium than other heavy metals, show evidence of inhibition of pyrimidine-5'-nucleosidase by excess seeding. \" Reference: Sci Total 1989 Jan;78:289-96 [Return to \"Quick-Index\" of Theories of Autism] Footnotes 1.

As a whole, they help a child with autism by providing structure and choice when necessary toward daily activities and allows for learning and experience planning, making choices and then following those choices. The first is the blue Schedule Board which allows for scheduling of daily routines and thus makes them more fun and easier to do.\ufffd Included are forty pictorial magnets, and your child can get prepared to go through morning and bed time routines, get ready for school, go to appointments, and more. Your child can participate in the scheduling if you wish and can choose their prize for completing each task successfully. Next is the orange board, which is called the Waiting Board and through repetition helps teach an autistic child the skills for not interrupting, waiting, and taking turn. It has pictures you can add to help give them ideas and suggestions for what they can do while waiting for their next turn. It comes with a built in timer so they know exactly how long they will have to wait. Last is the green Feelings Board, which supports a special needs child\ufffds ability to exert self-control through alternatives and expectations. Once they are satisfied with their self-control the choice wheels provide options for what to do next. Unfortunately for some, these boards are not available separately, you can only buy them as a set.\ufffd However, it has been structured to work as a system and was designed in this manner.\ufffd Using one board without the others will not be as good as using them all. These boards will help provide much needed structure and a calming center when needed most.\ufffd It help autistic children gain confidence, self-control and independence as they live each day.\ufffd Each board comes with a story to read to your child to help introduce the concepts and ideas behind each board and lessen any anxiety they might have. This set gets top reviews from parents and caregivers of children with ASD, ADHD, PDD, and other behavioral challenges.\ufffd Many parents say this help stop tantrums and provided a calming and centering influence on a daily basis. Many users report buying multiple of these sets, as they like using the Scheduling board to show Morning, Afternoon, and Night activities without having to rearrange the pieces.

Autism is a developmental disorder that usually becomes evident during the first three years of life. It occurs in approximately 15 out of every 10,000 births. It is four times more likely to show up in boys than in girls. It\ufffds been found throughout the world in all racial, ethnic and social backgrounds. It\ufffds also a sensory integration disorder and a communication disorder. As we have seen before, the Tomatis Method can make positive and lasting changes in both of these areas. Tomatis and Autism The Tomatis Method is not a cure for autism. We cannot perform miracles, and we do not promise them. However, our listening therapy can greatly improve the life of many autistic people, by attenuating the symptoms. It is often used in conjunction with other therapies. By stimulating the auditory system, and through it, by stimulating the brain, the Tomatis Method has been able to reduce the autistic symptoms to varying degrees. Each autistic person is different and may respond differently to the program. In some cases we see the first results within a few weeks, whereas in others it may take longer. Also, progress is never a straight line. There are still good days and bad days. But the trend is often upward, especially when you look back over a period of a few months. In many cases we have seen improvements in the following areas: Decreased hypersensitivity to sound They will be able to better deal with noise. As one mother said: He can now hear the vacuum cleaner or the mixer without losing it . They may start to connect with what happens around them, because they feel less threatened by the sounds that surround them As a result, they may have less temper tantrums and show less repetitive behavior. They may also start paying more attention. One of the parents said of her autistic daughter: She is more tuned in. She pays more attention . Reduced tactile defensiveness As they become less tactile defensive, their desire to reach out will increase and they may start to interact with others. This makes them more social. They may also become more affectionate. A child may come and sit on your lap, expecting to be held and cuddled. Improved language skills For autistic children who do not speak, receptive language is likely to improve. They may try to vocalize more and start to babble, experimenting with their voice. For autistic children with more developed language skills, the expressive language may improve. They may use longer sentences, and find more appropriate words to describe things. The may also use personal pronouns, like I and You more correctly, instead of referring to themselves in the third person. Better mastery of language leads to an increased desire to communicate. Improved appreciation for food. less picky in what they like to eat Those who are picky eaters may start to accept a greater variety of foods, including foods with different textures. Better self-image Once they start to connect with their voice, their self-image will start to improve. They know that they have a voice! Improved social skills They may start to look for contact and respond better to others. They may start to follow directions better. They may start to initiate contacts. Less aggressive behavior They may become less aggressive towards others and to themselves. They may start to inflict less injury to themselves and show less repetitive behavior. Better eye contact They may start looking you in the eyes and comprehend what you are saying more readily. She looks people in the face now , one parent said. They may start paying more attention to what they see. As one mother said: When we're driving, he now looks out of the window. he never did that before. When autistic people are hypersensitive to sounds, we try to treat this first. When this stumbling block is taken away, we can help them to start listening better. It also opens the way to improve sensory integration. These two elements, improved listening skills and better sensory integration, are the building blocks to develop their communication skills. Reducing hypersensitivity to sounds People with autism often suffer unbearable pain because of they have multiple sensitivities. Many are hypersensitive to sounds. The intensity of their pain can be excruciating. Some indicators of that hypersensitivity are: covering their ears with their hands to protect themselves from the incoming sounds bursting into huge temper tantrums due to the frustration of having to deal with the constantly incoming sounds repeating the same words, phrases or sentences perhaps as a way to soothe or stabilize themselves in the face of the barrage of intense and confusing sounds So, why are they hypersensitive to sounds? The reason lays in the way we listen. We all listen both with our ears and with our bodies. Our skin and our bones are excellent sound conductors. Our whole body responds to sounds. However, unlike most people, many autistic children (and adults) listen predominantly with their bodies. Sounds picked up by the body go directly to the brain, without being filtered. That means that the irrelevant background noise is not filtered out. So, many autistic people are continuously assaulted with sounds. When people listen predominantly with their ears, the sounds are filtered to reduce its intensity. Also, they are able to filter out all the background noises, so that they can tune in to what is really important. Many autistic people do not have the ability to filter out background noise and tune in to what really matters. So, when we work with autistic people that are hypersensitive to sounds, our first goal is to desensitize the bone conduction response, and make their ears to become the main entrance to sounds. That way, the sounds can be processed in the correct way. We'll do it by having them listen to gated music through a special headphone that is equipped with a vibrator. Through the vibrator they'll listen with their bodies, at the same time as they listen with their ears. The music is coming first to the vibrator, and several milliseconds later to the ears. Over time, our clients will adjust to listening primarily with their ears. Desensitizing the bone conduction reduces the hypersensitivity to sounds. It may appear paradoxical to use sounds to desensitize someone who is sensitive to sounds, but it is an efficient, gentle and non-intrusive way to begin to alleviate some of the problems that come with autism. As all our senses are interrelated, reducing hypersensitivity to sounds often results in reducing other sensitivities, such as tactile defensiveness and aversions of foods that have different textures. Improving communication Tomatis discovered that we can only produce a sound, if we hear that sound well. Hence, self-listening is the basis of speaking. So, paradoxically, it is the ear that controls speech and checks all its parameters: intensity, flow, articulation, etc\ufffd Self-listening is thus the basis of communicating with others. When we talk, we unconsciously monitor our speech through self-listening. That means that we have to have the ability to zero in on the sound coming from outside (mom talking to me) and/or on the sounds that are coming from within (my own sounds when I talk). As we have seen above, many autistic children tune-out what comes from the outside, to protect themselves from the bombardment of stimuli that threaten them. They also tune-out what is coming from within, possibly for the same reasons. They seem as disconnected from the world around them as they are disconnected from themselves. Communication thus is very difficult. The Tomatis Program tries to help autistic children to develop self-listening to foster communication. In that context, the vocal exercises are key in trying to achieve that goal. The children are asked to talk into a microphone. Through a feedback loop, they immediately perceive their voice coming back to their right ear, which is the ear that allows for a faster and more precise processing of language. The voice not only comes back to the ears but also to the bones, thanks to a vibrator situated on the skull. If a child is severely autistic and has no language, we still open the microphone to try to capture his babbling or any vocalization that he or she may produce. The vocal exercises are often difficult for autistic children, especially at the beginning. Often, they are afraid of their own voice and immediately become silent. It takes gentle prodding to help them overcome gradually their anxiety. Their reaction is easily understandable: first, this is new, and everything new brings fear. Second, it is the first time that they \ufffdlisten\ufffd to their own voice. Up till now, they probably didn\ufffdt connect themselves with their voice, because that requires having a sense of self, and a perception of one's body, both of which are weak in most autistic children. The bone vibration is key to developing a better perception of the body, the basis for the self to develop. We have often observed autistic children who try to swallow the microphone during the vocal exercises. It provides them with an intense vibration that reverberates throughout their body. It gives them an opportunity to \ufffdfeel\ufffd their body. Some enjoys the experience tremendously, but a normal adult could not stand the intensity of the bone vibration that it generates. This phenomenon in itself is very normal: the simple fact of speaking creates vibrations throughout our body, but we are most of the time unaware and undisturbed by it. In his book on opera-singing, (L\ufffdOreille et la Voix, not published in English), Tomatis explains in details how singers must be able to control their bodies all the way down to the smallest proprioceptive sensation, to produce a sound of perfect quality Singer, he insists, need to learn to play of their body as if it were an instrument. Likewise, autistic child have to learn to use their body as an instrument to initiate language. The vocal exercises we do, make it possible for them to \ufffdfeel\ufffd their body, to build their ability to produce sounds, and this may lead to language. By giving them the ability to produce sounds in a controlled way, we open the way for them to develop their sense of self. As we know it well, \ufffdfinding one's voice\ufffd is finding oneself. \ufffd expanded articulation of words\ufffd increased expressive language\ufffd more developed receptive language\ufffd more sharpened listening skills\ufffd better voice control\ufffd growing sense of self develops\ufffd deeper awareness of the whole body It is clear that reducing hypersensitivity and regulating sensory-integration are key steps in helping reconnect the autistic child or person to their families and their environment, allowing them to move outside of their protective shells. While the Tomatis Listening Program primarily focuses on listening and audio vocal exercises, other senses are changing simultaneously. The Tomatis Method builds a safer world for autistic people, in which they can live a better life, to the joy of those who care for them.

If you are interested in learning about alternative vaccine schedules, please read our section titled On Vaccines. Methodology Generation Rescue commissioned an independent opinion research firm, SurveyUSA of Verona NJ, to conduct a telephone survey in nine counties in California and Oregon. Counties were selected by Generation Rescue. Interviews were successfully completed in 11,817 households with one or more children age 4 to 17. From those 11,817 households, data on 17,674 children was gathered. Of the 17,674 children inventoried, 991 were described as being completely unvaccinated. For each unvaccinated child, a health battery was administered. Generation Rescue chose to use telephone interviews with parents to gather data on children, so as to closely mirror the methodology the CDC uses to establish national prevalence for NDs such as ADHD and autism through their national phone survey of parent responses. Generation Rescue chose to focus on children ages 4-17 to match the age range used by CDC. Are parent responses a reliable indicator of a child's diagnostic status? According to Dr. Laura Schieve, co-author of the CDC's national phone survey study, in discussing the CDC's two phone surveys on autism prevalence, \"the consistency of prevalence estimates across the two surveys supports high reliability or reproducibility of parental report of autism and reliability is one important component of validity.\" SurveyUSA is a well-known national opinion research firm with unique expertise in canvassing local communities. SurveyUSA has no vested interest in any outcome this or any survey might produce. You can see a copy of the questionnaire used in the survey here. The data the survey intended to capture included: - Households with a child or children aged 4-17 - Whether or not that child had been vaccinated - Whether or not that child had any one (or more) of the following diagnosis: ADD, ADHD, Asperger's, PDD-NOS, Autism, Asthma, or Juvenile Diabetes (the final two of which were added to consider other health outcomes). The results of the survey allowed us to compare the prevalence (what percentage of children have a particular diagnosis) to see if there was any meaningful difference between unvaccinated and vaccinated children. The most common way to measure prevalence differences is through a calculation known as relative risk or the Risk Ratio, where we compared prevalence amongst unvaccinated children to prevalence amongst vaccinated children. So, if 5% of unvaccinated children have asthma, and 10% of vaccinated children have asthma, that represents an \"RR\" of 2.0 (10%/5%), or a difference of 100%. We were also able to look at the data by gender, age, and county. Results SurveyUSA gathered data on 9,175 boys and 8,499 girls. Counties surveyed in California included: San Diego Sonoma Orange Sacramento Marin Counties surveyed in Oregon included: Multnomah Marion Jackson Lane The results of the survey can be accessed as a pdf file here. This is the primary data we received from SurveyUSA and it can be used for anyone to independently analyze our results. Generation Rescue analyzed the data provided by SurveyUSA, and a copy of our analysis can be found here. The most notable results of our survey are with the boys, which is not surprising considering boys represent approximately 80% of total cases of NDs.

Benefits and services for autistic adults over the age of 22 vary from state to state and often depend on the person's individual level of functioning and on what types of programs are available in his or her local area. With appropriate therapy, many adults with autism or other autism spectrum disorders (e.g., Asperger's syndrome) are able to work at conventional jobs, maintain social and professional relationships, and live relatively independent lifestyles. The level of care and assistance that each person needs depends on the severity of his or her condition. As in children with autism, autistic adults often experience sleep problems that require treatment. An effective treatment plan can include white noise machines or fans, weighted sleep blankets, melatonin, or other medications. These treatment options may help adults with autism get more restful sleep. Adults with autism generally need some form of assistance, counseling, and coaching with the following basic life skills: Establishing and maintaining personal and professional relationships Finding an appropriate living arrangement Learning and improving upon communication skills Seeking and maintaining employment Parents and caregivers of an adult child with autism should contact his or her health care provider for help in locating professionals to assist with finding a place to live, acquiring necessary life skills, and seeking financial assistance. Local or national chapters of non-profit advocacy groups, such as Autism Speaks, also may be able to provide information about appropriate services. <!-- google_ad_client //--> Advertising Disclaimer The following types of living arrangements are common to adults with autism: Independent Living Adults with milder autism spectrum disorders, such as Asperger's syndrome, may be able to live independently with minimal help. Mildly autistic adults may need help with certain household maintenance tasks, personal finances, and/or accessing benefits and services through state and federal agencies. Living with Parents or Other Family Members Adults with autism who continue to live at home with their parents may be able to receive benefits such as Supplemental Security income, Medicaid, or disability benefits through the Social Security Administration (SSA). Specialized Programs Some states have residential programs for adults with autism. These programs often teach self-care and housekeeping skills as well as offer job training and social activities. These types of programs may be referred to as foster homes or skill-development homes. Other residential programs, referred to as group homes, offer more supervised care and services such as meal preparation, housekeeping, and assistance with personal care. Institutions In rare cases, severely-impaired adults with autism may require supervision and care in a long-term institution. 1998-2010 Healthcommunities.com, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Autism is a developmental disorder with impairments in social interaction and communication, in addition to restricted, repetitive behaviors. Once considered quite rare, 1 in every 150 children in the United States is now diagnosed with the illness, making it a common developmental disability. Diagnosis of Autism typically occurs at about 3 years of age. The treatment of the condition is complex, as there is no single known cause or cure. Early childhood is the period during which the symptoms of Autism are clearly observable and children are experiencing rapid developmental changes. Researchers continue to look for more effective behavioral, educational and medical treatments to improve the lives of children with Autism. Therefore, a key to overcoming some of the challenges associated with the condition is early diagnosis and intervention. A clinical research study is now underway in the Bay Area for children between the ages of 3 and 6 with Autistic Disorder. The goal of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medication for children with this condition. Dr. Glen Elliott of Children s Health Council (CHC) is conducting this clinical research study. CHC believes all children deserve the opportunity to reach their full emotional, educational and developmental potential. CHC seeks participants for this clinical study, based on the following: the children must be at least 3 years old and less than 7 years old; candidates for the study must meet the criteria for Autistic Disorder; and, she or he must have an IQ or developmental quotient (DQ) of at least 50. Parents must give informed consent for their child to participate in this clinical research study, and must also be willing and able to comply with all study requirements. All clinical study-related care will be provided at no cost, including physical exams, psychological testing, and study medication. Compensation may be available to eligible parents or guardians. Health insurance is not required to participate. If your child or a child you know has Autism, additional information about this clinical research study and how to participate is available at (800) 314-2597 and at www.chcautism.com. | MyWeb | Propeller | Live Bookmarks Newsvine Slashdot | Digg | Stumbleupon | Google Bookmarks | Sphere | Blink It | Spurl Autism CA social interaction United States Palo Alto Bay Area Autistic Disorder March 16, 2010 Del.icio.us Google Bookmarks Autism Research Study Announced By Children Health Council Glen Elliott CHC of this website is to provide Kansans with information about the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Autism Waiver. As a result of the drastic increase in diagnosed cases of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) the Kansas Department of Social & Rehabilitation Services (SRS) has sought funding support for an early intensive Autism Medicaid waiver program to provide services to children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Studies show that early intensive behavioral intervention for these children are the most effective method for increasing functional skills, replacing challenging behavior, and improving quality of life. The waiver will provide opportunities for children with Autism to receive intensive early intervention treatment and their primary caregivers to receive needed support through respite services. The program will greatly benefit children with Autism and their families, in the future it may potentially provide dramatic cost savings to the state, as these children are less likely to depend on public services over the course of their lifetime. According to the Autism Society of America, the cost of lifelong care can be reduced by two-thirds with early diagnosis and intervention. Currently, Autism can be diagnosed as early as eighteen months of age. Services provided to children during early childhood have the additional benefit of preparing children for entering the school system. Studies show that with intensive early interventions around fifty percent of children with Autism can succeed in the regular education classroom by first grade. Others will make gains significant enough that they will only require partial or less intensive special education services. The HCBS Autism waiver is an early intensive intervention waiver for children who are 0 through 5 years of age, who has a diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder and Other Pervasive Developmental Disorder- Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), Children are required to meet functionally eligibility guidelines and Kansas? financially eligible guidelines for Medicaid, and utilize two waiver services every month.

Karyotype tests identified chromosomal aberrations associated with autism in about 2 percent of patients, while the fragile X genetic mutation was found in about 0.5 percent of patients. CMA detected chromosomal abnormalities in slightly more than 7 percent of patients, making it the best available genetic test for autism spectrum disorders, the study authors said. \"The CMA test alone has triple the detection rate of karyotyping or fragile X,\" said co-senior author Bai-Lin Wu, director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston. \"CMA should be added to first-tier genetic testing for autism spectrum disorders.\" The study appeared online March 15 and will be published in the April print issue of Pediatrics. \"When parents have a child diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, one of the first questions they often ask is 'how did this happen?' \" said Dr. Robert Marion, a pediatric geneticist at Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. \"In the vast majority of cases, we believe there is at least a genetic predisposition to autism, but the ability to identify a specific genetic cause has been very elusive,\" Marion said. \"Part of that is because of the technology that's been available. A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\" Standard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said. In karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium. Like karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said. \"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\" While both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted. The main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said. If tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.) But if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said. Still, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those. There are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases. But that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said. \"CMA is better, but it's not great,\" Marion said. \"The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies. That is very frustrating.\" More information The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism. genetic genetic dna CMA David Miller Hospital Boston Miller Bai-Lin Wu DNA Autism Consortium G-banded Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children 's Hospital Boston Robert Marion Montefiore Medical Center New York City Marion Montefiore U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders Boston Standard Children 's Hospital health.yahoo.com/news/healthday/newergenetictestforautismmoreeffective.html Autism236 http://www.symptomjournal.com/public/conditions-center/health-tools-help-reduce-autism-symptoms What parents of children with autism have in common: As a parent, our children\ufffds future and quality of life are the most important things in the world to us.

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), also known as Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs), cause severe and pervasive impairment in thinking, feeling, language, and the ability to relate to others. These disorders are usually first diagnosed in early childhood and range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, through pervasive development disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), to a much milder form, Asperger syndrome. The incidence of ASD is estimated at probably 1 in every 120 births, with boys being affected about 4 times more often than girls. Generally, the earlier the disorder is diagnosed, the sooner the child can be helped through treatment interventions. Learn more about autism for your child as a member of the Symptom Journal. Causes of Autism There is no known cause for ASD. Scientists believe that both genetics and environment play a part. Studies on families with children with ASD have been helpful in understanding how genes play a role. Current research points to brain abnormalities as the cause of AS. Using advanced brain imaging techniques, scientists have found structural and functional differences in specific regions of the brains of neuro-typical versus ASD children. There are many different theories about causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Many studies are being conducted about differences in brain activity with ASD children. Scientists have always known that there had to be a genetic component to ASD because of their tendency to run in families. A specific gene for autism, however, has not yet been identified. Inside the members area of the Symptom Journal, we discuss in detail the different theories and possible risk factors that are associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Symptoms of Autism Children with Autism display impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and display many different forms of restricted and repetitive behavior. From the start, typical developing infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most children with ASD seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. In the Members area, we discuss at length the different challenges with social interaction that Autistic children can tend to have. By age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language. One of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, and points when he wants a toy. Some children diagnosed with ASD remain nonverbal throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of ASD coo and babble during the first few months of life, but then soon stop. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Children with ASD often times display restricted and repetitive behaviors, which may include: compulsive behavior, restricted behavior, ritualistic behavior and a need for sameness.

What are the symptoms? Symptoms almost alway's start before the child or children is 3 years of age. Usually, parents first notice that their toddler or toddlers has not started talking yet and is not acting like the other children the same age. Symptoms of autism include: A delay in learning to talk, or not talking at all. A child may seem to be deaf, even through the hearing teat is normal. Repeated and overused types of behavor, interests, and play. For (EXAMPLES) include body rocking, unusual attachments to objects, and getting very upset when rountines change. There is no Typical person with autism. People can have many different kinds of behaviors, from mild to servere. Parents often say that their child or children with autism often like to play along and does not make any eye contect with other people, Autism may also include other problems. Many children have below-normal intelligence. Teenagers often become more depressed, and have a lot of anxiety, especially if they have average or above-average intelligence.

ASD Autism Spectrum Disorder www.autismgroup.com/ Autism239 http://www.elizabethmoon.com/autism-general.htm Autism: Past, Present, Future, Speculative Autism is all over the news right now, a very different situation than 18 years ago when we were looking for the cause of our son's developmental delay. Much of the media coverage, however, focusses on the sound-bite and tear-jerking opportunities that any problems with young children can provide. This is fine for the television crews, but it really does not inform the public, or help parents who are wondering whether their child could be autistic, or what to do with a child who is autistic. Autism is a neurological condition, a developmental disorder. Increasingly, as the ability to image brain structure and trace brain function improves, it's evident that autism results from physical differences in the structure and function of the brain. Although it used to be considered a psychiatric disorder with an \"emotional\" cause, it is instead a physical problem, in the same way that a missing limb or eye is a physical problem. The autistic child's brain is not physically set up to process information the same way as an average baby's brain. One of the most frustrating things for parents is that there is no single, obvious test for autism itself--there are only screening tests which look at children's behavior and skills, and compare them to those of average children the same age. These screening tests have improved (when our son was a toddler, we were told he could not be autistic because he clung to, and showed affection for, family members--not true) but they are not good enough, or widely known enough, to be trusted by non-specialist physicians and by school personnel. Tragically, many autistic children are refused services they need because a physician or a school counselor refuses to accept that the child is autistic. It is easier for a school, for instance, to label a child disruptive, difficult, oppositional, lazy, naughty, etc., than to admit that he is autistic and that they have been mistreating him for years. In our society, issues of causation and blame arise whenever there's a problem. \"Whose fault is it?\" is often the first question parents ask a doctor when a child has a developmental problem. Years ago, when autism was believed to be a psychiatric illness, an emotional illness, doctors told mothers that they were the cause--it was the mother's style of parenting which made children autistic. They were wrong. While abusive parenting can produce some autistic traits in normal children, autistic children nearly always arrive with their problem. Today, the loudest voices claim that immunizations cause autism. Their main argument is that children exhibit symptoms shortly after a series of shots. What they miss is that infants too young to have shots are also too young to look much different unless they have gross physical malformations or extremely low levels of behavior. An autistic infant and a non-autistic infant look the same at birth, and for some months after. But then the non-autistic infant develops on the average timetable, and the autistic infant--who has looked normal up until then--falls behind. How can that be if something didn't \"happen\" right before the development slowed, ceased, or reversed? We are now learning things about the developmental process that show how a slowdown or halt could be pre-programmed to appear only later. Each stage in the complex development of a human's nervous system requires completion of a previous stage--just as you have to have the foundation complete before starting to put up the walls of a building. During the previous stage, both biochemical precursors and physical structures prepare the child to continue to and through the next stage of development. It's possible to have something go wrong--be missing, be chemically \"underfunded\" --at an early stage, which will not be needed until later. The problem shows up when there is a developmental \"need\" that can't be met. Imagine a builder working on a project who finds out, halfway through framing the second floor, that he can't get any more lumber, or someone putting together a puzzle who doesn't know there's a missing piece until the puzzle is well along toward completion. It is clear from recent work on the structure and function of the human brain that autism results from specific problems in brain development which occur, in most cases, before birth, even though the results of those problems do not show up until the brain has reached the developmental stage where it needs the missing pieces. In many cases, there is evidence of subtle (and sometimes obvious) neurological difference in family members, especially when the extended family of both biological parents is considered. This strongly suggests that most autism is genetic in origin. It also suggests that improved therapy for autistic children, which helps them become more sociable and thus increases their chance of marriage and parenthood, will result in more autistic children being born to autistic parents. What is it like to be an autistic individual? Only autistic individuals know for sure. Interviews with autistic people, their essays and books, all suggest that the autistic experience is just as varied as the non-autistic experience. Some people are happy. Some people are not happy. Some people have close friends. Some do not. The similarities imposed by the condition do not impose an emotional tone or even a core personality in the Myers/Briggs sense. Some autistic individuals, for instance, are extroverts; our son is one of them. From my reading, and from correspondence with autistic individuals online, I've come to think that autistic people are much more like the rest of us than previously thought. Their emotional lives are very much like mine: they want to be with people they enjoy being around, people who accept them for who they are, people who understand them, people who like them. They want to eat the food that tastes good to them, wear clothes that are comfortable for them, be in temperatures they find comfortable, do the things they think are fun. They want their concerns to be understood and taken seriously. They like people to get their jokes. They want to be respected. One of the things which impressed me about our son, even before he could communicate in signs, gestures, or words, was the healthy quality of his emotional life. Yes, he screamed when he was upset, and I would have preferred a \"Mom, I don't want to do that.\" But the things he enjoyed were reasonable, healthy things to enjoy: food that tasted good, music he liked, running around on the grass on a spring day. There was nothing weird about what he liked. His dislikes were harder to understand, but made sense once I realized that his sensory input was different than mine, and his responses were stronger. He felt hot when I barely felt warm. Tags in clothes (that I find only mildly irritating) bothered him a lot. He liked some colors more than others. Certain textures and flavors in food bothered him more. He liked some people and didn't warm up to others. These are perfectly normal responses in a small child--just on a different scale. His likes and dislikes tended to be more intense (typical of an earlier developmental stage: infants are usually very intense in their likes and dislikes.) What is the \"central deficit\" in autism? This argument is still going on among researchers. My background in computer programming led me to what is not one of the main contenders at present, but the most recent brain imaging is beginning to lean my way. Although the human brain is not *just* a computer, some of the tools of information processing in computers can be useful in looking at how the brain handles information. In my opinion, the so-called central deficit is not central at all--in computer terms, it's not a problem with the main processor chip, but with something in the input/output stream: perhaps a buffer, perhaps an internal bus, perhaps a switching mechanism. Here's why I think this. All autistic individuals I know about--and the parents of autistic children--agree that autistic people perceive the world a little differently than the average at the sensory level. That is, the primary raw sensory data is not getting to the central processor in the same way that it gets to the average brain. The odd patterns of extra sensitivity and insensitivity that autistic children display reflect this, as do the subtle (and sometimes obvious) differences in their patterns of attention and movement. From computers, we know that \"garbage in/garbage out\" determines the computer's performance: the central processor will come up with wrong answers if the information going into it is wrong. If the input device, a keyboard for instance, is miswired or has a piece of potato chip under one key, then it may send the wrong signal to the processor when the user tries to send information in. If the input buffer--where information is stored temporarily before being sent on to the central processor--isn't big enough, information can be lost or transmitted out of order. If the internal communications channels are too slow, information backs up and may be lost, or the central processor may get ahead of itself and try to compute without having all the data. Some programs may require a pre-processor which performs computations on incoming data before it goes to the central processor; if the pre-processor doesn't work right, then the central processor is handed bad data to work with. These are just a few of the ways in which a computer can go wrong without having a problem in the central processor. The human nervous system has analogues for all these and more. The peripheral nervous system--the nerves in fingers and skin and eyes and ears and tongue and nasal cavity--collects the sensory information which becomes the data input to the brain. When you have a cold, you lose the ability to smell most things--your brain then gets corrupted \"smell data.\" When you have a sunburn, your skin tells your brain that a light touch is like a slap. When an arm or leg \"goes to sleep\" and becomes numb, your brain may think it's not even there. We have all experienced small, temporary glitches in our sensory input. But there's another kind of problem that can arise, with the speed of transmission, not the accuracy of \"pickup.\" Imagine a computer keyboard. You press A and A appears on the screen; it has also reached the central processor, so that if A is a command (A for add, A for another, A for Aunt Alice's email address) the computer responds to that command. The speed of transmission of that electrical signal makes it possible to send commands, or type a message, as fast as you can type. Now imagine that the keyboard has a very slow connection. You type A, and nothing happens. The seconds tick by. Finally an A pops up on the screen. It would take a long time to compose a message to Aunt Alice--or to give a series of commands for an accounting program--if you had such a slow connection. Or suppose the keyboard would not transmit an A at all unless you pressed on the A key for five seconds. That would also slow down the transmission of information, even if the actual transmission time were the same. The human nervous system can have similar glitches. Research has shown that some people have \"slower\" nerves than others--it takes longer for an electrical impulse to travel from the finger to the brain than it does for others. And it's also shown that some people need sensory impulses to last longer before they're captured (slow capture rate.) This can have serious consequences. For instance, in normal speech, the sounds of many consonants are very brief--on the order of 75 milliseconds. If an infant cannot capture such brief sounds--needs the sound to last, say, 200 or 300 milliseconds before it's \"caught\"--then the infant will not even \"hear\" the sounds of most consonants. If the infant doesn't hear them, then they don't become part of the library of speech sounds which the infant uses to build a model of speech, and understand which sounds are speech and which aren't. Some non-autistic children with severe language delay have exactly this problem. Some autistic adults who can now talk have described what speech sounded like to them when they were small--and they say it was like 'mooing' or 'groaning'--full of vowel sounds, not consonants. A problem with slow capture rate that affects more than one sensory channel would interfere in a number of ways with information processing and normal development. Autistic individuals have problems with interpreting the rapid changes in facial expression which modify verbal communication--recognizing the brief twitch of an eyebrow or quirk of the lips that changes \"You stinker\" from an angry insult to a loving compliment, for instance. They often have difficulty interpreting similarly rapid changes in pitch, rate, prosody that interact with the words spoken. They may be unable to \"see the picture\" on a TV screen, because of the rapidly scanning raster. They may not feel a brief painful stimulus, or may feel a painful stimulus delayed from its actual onset. If the slow capture rate and a slow transmission rate are combined, it's clear that the data available for processing on the inside would always be out of phase with what's going on outside. Many parents report that autistic children are slow to respond even when they can respond appropriately: here is one physical model that might explain why they're like that. Sensory integration--the ability to combine sound, sight, touch, and other senses into one coherent sensory experience--is another area in which most autistic persons have problems. Some autistic adults describe being unable to understand speech unless they deliberately shut off the visual channel (shut their eyes, look down.) In the average infant, sensory integration develops over the first few years in a seamless way. But if the capture rate and/or transmission rate of the senses are not synchronous--if the visual channel and the sound channel are out of synch, as you sometimes see on TV--the infant has no way to make them match. As an adult, you know how to adjust if the announcer's mouth and speech aren't in synch. But an infant has no prior experience to work from. If your mouth is making the motion for one sound while the infant hears another, then looking at you will not help him copy that sound. There's another complication which few computers possess. Most computers will sit passively waiting for information to come to them. The silicon chip doesn't care if it's computing or not. The human brain, however, is not capable of sitting idle in the dark, so to speak; it will make things up and amuse itself while waiting for data to arrive. If the data from normal sensory channels doesn't arrive, something else will be going on--and when the sound or the sight or the touch signal does arrive, the brain will work it into the pattern it had already created. Our brains are pattern-makers. The rigid patterns of play typical of autistic kids--stacking blocks over and over, laying out objects in repetitive sequences--are quite possibly the result of the brain's pattern-making ability going to work on whatever is available. You see similar behavior in average kids and adults when they're bored--they swing their legs, tap pencils, doodle rows of similar designs. Adding to that complication is another. The human brain is not only busy all the time, in childhood it is also always growing....and it grows in response to its experience, both in terms of structure (the neurons and their connections) and function (what it can do, what calculations it can make.) If its experience is limited, possibly because the data coming in are limited in comparison to the data that average children can acquire, then its growth will also be limited and aimed in the direction of the activity it *can* perform. What this means is that the brains of adult autistic individuals are not necessarily representative of the brains (and potentials) of autistic infants and young children. It is not a good idea to reason backward from the structure of an adult autistic's brain to assume that the same structures are missing in the infant's brain. It's important to remember that the final structure and function of anyone's brain reflects both innate structure and developmental experience, just as the outward physical condition of a 60 year old reflects both inherited physical characteristics and how that body was used throughout life. The 60 year old ballet dancer will have a different body than a twin who never danced. Why am I so sure that the central aspects of cognition are not the problem in autism? Observation, both of autistic children and (through their writing) of adult autistic individuals, combined with a knowledge of how information processing works in complex systems like computers and humans. Where autistic individuals are presented with correct data in a sensory format they can use (such as math), they reason clearly and well; they understand cause and effect in physical (nonsocial) situations very well. Many if not most autistic children have no trouble learning letters, numbers, and they may pick up reading (simple decoding) even faster than the average child. But letters and numbers hold still on the page. Where they clearly fall behind is in situations where the necessary data require sensory processing in multiple channels--which all social interaction definitely does. Neurocognitive research on brain function is already helping to define the way that typical brains work--how we convert our sensory input into a model of the world, how we use that model to communicate with each other and manipulate things around us. The next stage for research into autism will be to define how the brains of autistic people work. It will be important to go beyond defining \"different\" to discovering what the difference is, and what its implications are for development. Interventions to help autistic children should be based on their reality--on the way their brains actually do function, rather than on guesses. Once we know--at the biochemical, molecular level--how typical brains grow, develop, and function...and we know how the brain of an autistic child grows, develops, and functions...precisely targeted intervention will become possible.

Brain imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and similar advanced techniques have given neuroscientists huge insights into this question. Yet studying the brain doesn\ufffdt have to be such a high-tech enterprise. Simple experiments can still probe the inner workings of the brain, and many of these are easy to set up at home or are available on the internet. Try them on yourself and you will experience first-hand some of its strangest, most amazing workings \ufffd facets of brain function that scientists are only just starting to understand. You\ufffdll see aspects of perception, memory, attention, body image, the unconscious mind \ufffd and the curious consequences of your brain being split in two. 1 Seeing isn't believing TAKE a moment to observe the world around you. Scan the horizon with your eyes. Tilt your head back and listen. You're probably getting the impression that your senses are doing a fine job of capturing everything that is going on. Yet that is all it is: an impression. Despite the fact that your visual system seems to provide you with a continuous widescreen movie, most of the time it is only gathering information from a tiny patch of the visual field. The rest of the time it isn't even doing that. Somehow from this sporadic input it conjures up a seamless visual experience. What is going on? Bang in the middle of your retina is a small patch of densely crowded photoreceptors called the fovea. This is the retina's sweet spot, the only part of the eye capable of seeing with the rich detail and full colour we take for granted. This tiny spot - which covers an area of our visual field no bigger than the moon in the sky - feeds your visual system almost all of its raw information. To build up a big picture, your eyes constantly dart about, fixating for a fraction of a second and then moving on. These jerky movements between fixations are called saccades, and we make about three per second, each lasting between 20 and 200 microseconds. The curious thing about saccades is that while they are happening we are effectively blind. The brain doesn't bother to process information picked up during a saccade because the eyes move too rapidly to capture anything useful. All in all, your visual system works like a man blundering around in the dark waving around a flickering torch with a very narrow beam. Despite the fact that you don't normally notice saccades, you can catch them in action. Look at your eyes close-up in the mirror and flick your focus back and forth from one pupil to another. However hard you try you cannot see your eyes move - even though somebody watching you can. That's because the motion is a saccade, and your brain isn't paying attention. Now pick two spots in the corners of your visual field and flick your gaze from one to the other and back again. If you're lucky you'll notice, just barely, a brief flash of darkness. This is your visual cortex clocking off. So how does your brain weave such fragmentary information into a seamless movie? This remains something of a mystery. The best explanation, according to Andrew Hollingworth of the University of Iowa in Iowa City, is that your short-term and long-term visual memories retain information from previous fixations and integrate them into a here-and-now visual experience (Visual Cognition, vol 14, p 781). There is also some guesswork going on. You can get a feel for this from the frozen-time illusion - the sensation that you sometimes get when you look at a clock and the second hand appears to freeze momentarily before tick-tocking back into action. This happens because of saccades. To compensate for the temporary shut-down of vision, your brain makes a guess at what it would have seen, but it does so retrospectively. So the 100 or so milliseconds of blindness gets back-filled with the image that appears after the saccade is over. If your eyes happen to alight on the clock just after the second hand has moved, your brain assumes that the hand was in that location for the duration of the saccade too. The \"second\" then lasts about 10 per cent longer than normal, which is enough for you to notice. The weirdness isn't confined to vision. Your auditory system is also full of gaps and glitches that the brain cleans up so we can make sense of the world. This is especially true of speech. In everyday life we encounter lots of situations that obscure or distort people's voices, yet most of the time we understand effortlessly. This is because our brain pastes in the missing sounds, a phenomenon called phonemic restoration. It is so effective that it is sometimes hard to tell that the missing sounds are not there. A good demonstration of this effect was published last year by Makio Kashino of NTT Communication Science Laboratories in Atsugi, Japan. He recorded a voice saying \"Do you understand what I'm trying to say?\" then removed short chunks and replaced them with silence. This made the sentence virtually unintelligible. But when he filled the gaps with loud white noise, the sentence miraculously becomes understandable (Acoustic Science and Technology, vol 27, p 318). \"The sounds we hear are not copies of physical sounds,\" Kashino says. \"The brain fills in the gaps, based on the information in the remaining speech signal.\" The effect is so powerful that you can even record a sentence, chop it into 50-millisecond slices, reverse every single slice and play it back - and it is perfectly intelligible. You can listen to Kashino's sound files at http://asj.gr.jp/2006/data/kashi/index.html....In fact, your mental body map is an absolute sucker for visual information. This year Frank Durgin of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania set up the illusion as described above but instead of touching the rubber hand he merely \"stroked\" it with light from a laser pointer, leaving the unseen hand alone. Two-thirds of 220 subjects reported a sense of ownership of the rubber hand and said they had the sensation of heat and even touch from the laser pointer (Psychological Science, vol 18, p 152). \"It's obvious the hand is rubber - no one is fooled at all,\" says Durgin. \"But if your brain decides it's your hand, all the conscious awareness in the world won't change it.\" If you can't get hold of a fake hand, there are other (though less reliable) ways to experience the illusion. Some people can be fooled into believing a piece of wood has replaced their hand. Around half of people can even be made to feel a table top is part of their body. Sit at a table and put your hand out of sight underneath. Get someone to tap and stroke this hand while doing exactly the same to the table top directly above. If you watch the table top, you may experience the illusion that the table has become part of your body.This stuff is fascinating. There are ways that this information can be used in autism research to identify how it is that some autistics have problems in understanding speech. And perhaps why they aren't as easily fooled by some visual puzzles.But now to go from the sublime to the surreal, Jenny McCarthy is the mother of a five year old autistic boy. She is an ex-Playboy centerfold and \"model\" who made a name for herself for having absolutely no shame. She brags about having a big mouth that will say anything. With this big mouth she has vomited on camera and then eaten the (presumably fake) vomit. When she was younger she was the \"it girl\" (ick girl?), that is if you needed a buxom bleach-bottle blonde who could convincingly play a total airhead and who would pose as someone passing gas in a crowded elevator, for cash, of course. Wikipedia calls her \"toilet humor\" \"grotesque\". She wrote the script for a movie called, \"Dirty Love,\" which she also starred in. The movie featured McCarthy sitting in a quantity of what was supposed to be her menstrual blood. Wikipedia notes about Jenny:In March 2006, she was given for \"Worst Actress,\" \"Worst Screenplay,\" and \"Worst Picture\" for her work on Dirty Love, which also netted her then-husband, John Asher, a Razzie for \"Worst Director.\"After her divorce from Asher, she later took up with Jim Carrey. She says that she and Carrey were destined to be together by the stars (this is astrology talk). Maybe they were destined to be together, McCarthy had a small part in the TV series The Stupids and her boyfriend starred in a title role in the Dumb and Dumber(er) duology. Maybe they could co-star in a movie and call it \"Pathetically Inane.\" Wikipedia says she will next be seen in a movie called, Witless Protection. There are other weird things to note about Jenny McCarthy and what she's done, things that tend to make one doubt the woman's intelligence, but they tend toward the even more grotesque, so we won't go there. But one thing we should note is her somewhat brief reign as top Hollywood Indigo Mom.As a headline grabbing TV Star and best-selling author, Jenny McCarthy may be the last person one might expect to find coming out and declaring herself an Indigo. Well, it just goes to prove what we say in our Mission Statement, humanity is evolving and we are the proof!...What impresses us even more is that, in addition to being an absolutely delightful, warm, funny, dedicated lady, Jenny is putting her money where her mouth is by starting up a website especially for Indigo Moms.Launched in late April 2006, Jenny's website at www.indigomoms.com provides a meeting place where Indigo Moms can meet others, organize get Momme and Me get together groups, chat in the Indigo Cafe, read articles, and chat with Jenny herself about different topics on her Forum each month.Says Jenny: \"There were so many times I would be sitting around with my son, Evan, and wish that I could join a 'mommy and me' group that loved talking about Indigos and Crystals. I always felt like there was no one around me who 'got' it. That\ufffds why I came up with the idea to have women post their info so as more mommies become enlightened they can contact someone in their own neck of the woods to chat and share stories with.(Found here on \"Children of the new earth\".)But if you go looking for indigomoms.com now you won't find anything. You can find some of the pages in the Internet Archive, but some pages seem to have been removed from there, too. She had some weird stuff in there about treating the problems of crystal children with gemstone necklaces, this is crystal therapy. There were links from her site to a website that sold gemstone necklaces with dosing recommendations. Like, dude, you wouldn't want to overdose your Crystal kid on too many rose quartz necklaces, or just go and mix hematite with malachite, not unless you had a bunch of moonstone on hand!Since you can't go to straight to Jenny's indigomoms.com to figure out what an \"Indigo\" is, here's a partial explanation:The name itself indicates the Life Color they carry in their auras and is indicative of the Third Eye Chakra, which represents intuition and psychic ability...Cue the Twighlight Zone music.The Crystal Children began to appear on the planet from about 2000, although some date them slightly earlier. These are extremely powerful children, whose main purpose is to take us to the next level in our evolution, and reveal to us our inner power and divinity. They function as a group consciousness rather than as individuals, ...Apparently, you can be born an Indigo but move \"up\" to being a Crystal. So according to some, being a Crystal is better even than being an Indigo, and Indigos are really special.How did Jenny discover she was an Indigo?The day I found out I was an adult Indigo will stay with me forever. I was walking hand in hand with my son down a Los Angeles street when this women [sic] approached me and said, \"You're an Indigo and your son is a Crystal.\" I immediately replied, \"Yes!\" and the woman smiled at me and walked away. I stood there for a moment, because I had no idea what the heck an Indigo and Crystal was, but I seemed so sure of it when I had blurted out \"Yes!\" After doing some of my own research on the word Indigo, I realized not only was I an early Indigo but my son was in fact a Crystal child. From that point on things in my life started to make sense. ... and at that moment I knew exactly why. I was born to not only think outside the box, but to break that box up into a million pieces. I called this day my \"awakening\", but really it was the day I remembered. This was the day my life and global mission became so clear. There was nothing I could do that could contain the excitement of what was to come.(Bold emphasis added.)Autism Diva hasn't figured out when this Indigo awareness thing happened. McCarthy's son was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 2 1/2 and a few weeks after that as being autistic. She said on Oprah that after his being diagnosed as having epilepsy, her mommy instinct told her something was wrong. Well, yeah, he has epilepsy. But when she got the autism diagnosis her mommy instinct told her that was right. But she \"happened to say\", 'Well, I believe my son is trapped inside. I'm not settling for this.'\"Strangely, it would seem that her son got the Crystal label after the autism label since he and his mom were walking hand and hand down the street... which seems more like something a mom would do with a 3- or 4-year old rather than with a 2-year old.So maybe after Jenny's son was diagnosed as autistic, a woman walked up to her and announced to her that Jenny was an Indigo, but not only that, her son was a Crystal. One supposes that this woman could see their \"auras\". Jenny then blurted out \"Yes!\" expressing agreement with the strange woman, without knowing what the words Crystal and Indigo meant. But not to worry she did \"research\" to find out. Where do you suppose she did this research? One might suppose that, Jenny McCarthy, famed for acting stupid, and being a party girl, a woman who apparently smoked through her pregnancy and then discovered health food and HEPA filters after her son was born, doesn't have a library card. Maybe she does, but she now claims is PhD in \"Google\" research and when her son was having seizures she lamented that her ex wouldn't ask her what she was finding on \"Google.\"But before we move on, back to the strange woman Jenny passed on the street, if that woman can spot a Crystal (meaning: autistic) kid, in passing, with a high accuracy rate and has that much confidence in her differential diagnosis, can we get her to go to work with Dr. David Amaral on the Autism Phenome Project? Imagine the money they'd save on skipping over that time consuming ADOS testing.Another weird thing is that before her son had seizures, at age one at least, he had symptoms of autism. A woman who worked at a \"play gym\" where Jenny had taken her son to play asked Jenny if the boy had a \"brain problem.\" Jenny responded by getting the woman fired (she said this with no sign of shame, on Oprah). So it wasn't ok for a stranger who works around children to ask if her child had a brain problem, but it was OK for a stranger to tell her that he's a Crystal. One supposes that that is because \"Crystal\" sounds special and \"brain problem\" sounds like a put down, or maybe cause one to fear one had done something to cause it.At some point after deciding to write a book about her son being autistic, and after hooking up with the quackery-aligned, Southern California based autism organization known as TACANow, Jenny decided that being a pillar of support for her fellow Indigo Moms wasn't working out. She shut down her indigomoms.com website. It seems that in her book she has a new definition for what an Indigo is, that's a person with ADHD. And a Crystal is an autistic child (or maybe a autistic adult). Though one has to think that autistic adults are not Crytals because we don't seem to share one consciousness... you know, 'cuz if we did, like, ... why would we need the Internet to connect with each other?This past week Jenny McCarthy hawked her book on both Oprah, and on ABC's 20/20. The 20/20 reporter introduced Jenny's story by saying that when Jenny gave birth to her son Evan, he in turn gave birth to her new career as a writer. As Jenny said on Oprah (about modeling in a bikini while worrying about her son's health,) \"Mommy's gotta work it.\"If you'd like to read Jenny's Crystal-less pearls of wisdom about autism without forking over the dough for her book, she's posted some of them to Oprah.com. She helpfully points out that she's not a doctor, but lists what she did with/to Evan. Including:#4 Starting anti-fungal meds to kill Candida/fungus. Meds like Diflucan, Nystatin. Evan started to come out of autism completely after I killed CANDIDA!!First of all, what's the deal here? She says he \"started to come out of autism\" when she, personally, \"killed CANDIDA!\". But he started to come out autism \"completely\" meaning that he eventually became normal? \"Completely\"? Why is he called her \"autistic son\" on the cover of People magazine? Why is he still doing repetitive and stereotypical behaviors and why does he stil have problems with \"abstract understanding\"? One can only assume that Jenny feels deeply as if she has failed when Evan flaps because her efforts with diet, Diflucan and Nystatin haven't killed every last imaginary crazy-making yeast bug in his body.Candida infections only become very serious if a person has no immune defenses at all, as in a person with full-blown AIDS. In that case the Candida is going through the person's whole body, the infection is systemic. But Candida albicans became the b?te noire of the worried well in the 1980's, everyone who thought they had Candida infections did, because they just did, and Candida was could be named as a cause for practically any symptom a person might have.Jenny might have known that Candidiasis is just so eighties, and that it fell from favor when people figured out that \"treating\" Candidiasis didn't remove their symptoms. Candida is practically a quaint relic of health-faddism, and has been replaced by Lyme disease and maybe Morgellons (both are said to cause autism) and who knows what else as a fave of hypochondriacs and their curers. Jenny might not be expected to know about fads in the 1980's, being as how she was 10 years old in 1982, and we know she was busy being a bunny and second rate actress in the 1990s.Jenny said on Oprah that she chose to go with the GFCF diet and antifungal drugs after getting her son's blood and stool checked. It's likely that she got the Candida blood test results from one of the providers of questionable lab tests favored by quacks. Yeast (Candida) is a big topic of discussion on autism \"biomed\" parent forums. They are chock full of parents discussing how they diagnose \"yeastiness\" from the child's behavior as in, \"Oh, I can tell when Johnny is yeasty, because he starts acting crazy....\" \"Yeastiness\" can be \"diagnosed\" by these parents just by looking at a child's behavior. Jenny explained how she had to break off from seeing Jim Carrey for some time because her son had gone \"crazy\" from yeast and needed her full attention.Interestingly, it seems that not too long ago Medicare pulled the CLIA operating certificate for Immunosciences Lab (not so affectionately known as Immunoseances). Medicare's inspection looked for validity in the tests Immunosciences offered and found it severely wanting. That one lab is said to have been the major provider of bogus Candida testing. If you go to the Immunosciences lab's website they announce via pdf, that they are no longer in business as of a couple of months ago. So one can imagine that perhaps Jenny's son was found to have \"CANDIDA!\" via a nonsense lab test ordered by her son's DAN! doctor. Meaning that it's possible that her son was put on prescription drugs (Nystatin and/or Diflucan) for no reason. But it seems safe to say that knowing that will not going to stop her from attributing his \"coming out of autism completely\" to these drugs (and diet).Evan went from being a 2-year old (diagnosed) autistic boy (with seizures) to a 5 year old autistic boy apparently still on meds to prevent seizures, in 3 years. This is supposed to be an amazing thing. It's not. Not unless we are to believe that all autistic children stagnate at their two year old level and can never learn anything or develop skills beyond that. Jenny doesn't attribute his development to, uh, development, but to her magical mystery cures that she got by way of quack dox and quackery promoting autism websites which of course, she discovered by doing \"Google research.\" Oh, but she's a heroine for saving her son, from... what? From being a 2-year old, low functioning, psychic with a few too many autistic traits? Jenny seems to have a hard time keeping her story straight.On Oprah.com, Jenny takes time out from her busy schedule to spread lies about vaccines, like they contain \"aborted fetal tissue.\" Thanks, Jenny. Thanks, Oprah. Maybe now some kids will die of vaccine preventable diseases because they trusted the vomit eating side-show girl with the high-school diploma to give them medical advice.To compensate for her obliviousness to, and dismissiveness of, real science--she claims her son is her science. Kevin Leitch on his newly reworked blog, \"Left Brain/Right Brain\" discusses Evan being Jenny's science, and value of Jenny McCarthy to autism and autistics as opposed to the value of her son's being autistic to Jenny.Apparently, Jenny feels like she was destined to have an autistic child (or maybe it's that she was destined to have a Crystal child but got stuck with one that was also autstic) because she has said she felt she was destined to vaccinate her son and cause him to become autistic. When asked if she'd like to have another child with Mr. Dumb (or did he play Dumber?), she replied that having Evan had kicked her (posterior). Meaning, presumably, that it's been a horrible, draining experience, so that she couldn't handle another child. Probably a good choice on her part. For additional intelligent discussion of the problem of Jenny McCarthy Autism Expert, Estee Klaar-Wolfond discusses a Jenny centered People magazine article where Jenny talks about spending the rest of her life on the project of curing her son, presumably with quack treatment after alternative-airhead treatment until he's 100% normal (for a Crystal) or maybe until one of them can no longer participate in the experimentation.Figure the odds that Jenny McCarthy knows anything about how the brain works, or is even interested in how it works. Figure the odds on whether or not she can understand how it is that you can't just trust any advice that shows up in a Google search? Figure the odds that she can sit back and evaluate the flim-flammery she's been exposed to with \"CANDIDA!\" treatments and anti-vax nonsense. Figure the odds that she'll ever pick up a heavy-duty peer reviewed paper on how the brain functions in autism, or that she might question what her smoking during her pregnancy did to her son's health.Our minds and hearts can trick us, or as New Scientist said:5. Pay attention!IMAGINE you are walking down the street and a passer-by asks you for directions. As you talk to him, two workmen rudely barge between you carrying a door. Then something weird happens: in the brief moment that the passer-by is behind the door, he switches places with one of the workmen. You are left giving directions to a different person who is taller, wearing different clothes and has a different voice. Do you think you would notice?Of course you would, right? Wrong. When researchers at Harvard University played this trick on 15 unsuspecting people, eight of them failed to spot the change.What this demonstrates is a phenomenon called \"change blindness\". It happens because of a chronic shortage of a crucial mental resource: attention. You are blithely unaware of most of what is going on around you, to the point where you can fail to notice \"obvious\" changes in your surroundings.How would Jenny explain it if someone asking her for her expert advice wrote something like:\"Jenny, sometimes when my son and I look at the second hand on a clock, it seems to stop. What does this mean?\"Would Jenny answer, \"Oh! Girlfriend! This means you are an Indigo and your son is a Crystal! Angels have been proven to hang around Indigos and Crystals and stop time for them!\"?If someone claimed that Crystal children are \"so powerful that you can even record a sentence, chop it into 50-millisecond slices, reverse every single slice and play it back - and it [will be] perfectly intelligible,\" to them. Would she just say, \"WOW! Of course!\" Or would she pause and ask if the same was true for every other hearing person? And how many others, like Oprah, would just take her just take her word for whatever Jenny's \"mommy instinct\" told her was correct?More about Jenny on Oprah from the science blogger Orac. and from Qchan and Do'C on the new Left Brain Right Brain group blog, James of Autism Natural Variation and Liz at \"I Speak of Dreams\" blog.Also, via the New Scientist article an excellent video about the power of the subconscious mind as shown by a patient with a newly severed corpus collosum.P.S.

Crystal is Crystal Autism Diva Oprah Crystal label Crystal and Indigo HEPA Google Crystal ( David Amaral Indigo struggling for over 40 years with chronic migraines, IBS, Muscle and joint pain, fatigue, brain fog, asthma and a slew of other ailments and frustrations I decided to take a closer look at the cause rather than obsessing on the symptoms. I was tired of relying on doctors to give me answers and tired of the medications that only gave me side affects and little relief. I had been committed to health and fitness for over 20 years, losing close to 50 pounds and 5 dress sizes, however I still had all the chronic conditions that played havoc in my life. I realized there was a key element missing and soon found out it was my reaction to gluten and dairy. I didn't know enough about food intolerance or allergies or at least put the two together. I never believed food could have such a serious impact on overall health let alone be the direct cause of my diseases. With what I know today I\ufffdm surprised my doctor didn\ufffdt put the connection together when he diagnosed me with Sj\ufffdgren\ufffds Syndrome (autoimmune disease). Sj\ufffdgren\ufffds is one of the symptoms of Celiac along with a long list as you will see below and nutrition plays a critical role in the healing process. By making the appropriate diet changes \ufffd (gluten and dairy free), I\ufffdve managed to eliminate my migraines, IBS\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdetc., etc., and have the Sj\ufffdgren\ufffds Syndrome under control. Even better, I have eliminated all medications and use food and natural remedies for nutrition and overall health. Now that you know why I became a clinical nutritionist and why I started Karmic Health lets get into the details of why it\ufffds so important to understand gluten and its relation to diseases. Why the problem with gluten now? A lot has changed in the way we harvest food compared to 50 years ago. Some of the seed companies began engineering wheat kernels that could be more easily ground and produce fluffier flour to make the soft, delicious white bread for example had to have greater yields; it made more money for the farmer and increased sales. Gluten is a composite of the proteins gliadin and glutenin. These exist, conjoined with starch, in the endosperms of some grass-related grains, notably wheat, rye, and barley. Understanding what happens in the body and some of the symptoms will help millions of people who go undiagnosed. Celiac is the most common genetic disease of mankind (yet for every person diagnosed, 140 will go undiagnosed). A wheat allergy is the body\ufffds abnormal autoimmune response to a certain protein component of wheat; it\ufffds exhibited by a severe sudden onset allergic reaction. Usual symptoms are immediate coughing, asthma, breathing difficulties, and/or projectile vomiting. It can cause life-threatening responses in allergic people. A true Wheat allergy affects less than 1/2 % of population. Intolerance's are much more common than true food allergies but are harder to diagnose. Food intolerance is an adverse reaction to food that does not involve the body's immune system. Generally food intolerance is an inability to properly digest certain foods. In some cases food passes right through the body before digestion is complete. Leaky Gut is an increase in permeability of the intestinal mucosa to luminal macromolecules, antigens, and toxins associated with inflammatory degenerative and/ or atrophic mucosa or lining. Put more simply, large spaces develop between the cells of the gut wall allowing bacteria, toxins and food to leak into the bloodstream. Leaky Gut Syndrome has also been linked with many conditions, such as: Celiac Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, Autism, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Eczema, Dermatitis, and Ulcerative Colitis. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease caused by an inappropriate immune response to dietary proteins found in wheat, rye, and barley (gluten and gliadin). This response leads to inflammation of the small intestine and to damage and destruction of the villi that line the intestinal wall. These villi are projections (small folds) that increase the surface area of the intestine and allow nutrients, vitamins, minerals, fluids, and electrolytes to be absorbed into the body. When the villi are destroyed, the body is much less capable of absorbing food and begins to develop symptoms associated with malnutrition and malabsorption. When the body is exposed to the gluten and gliadin proteins, it forms antibodies that recognize and act against not only the grain proteins, but also against constituents of the intestinal villi. As long as the patient continues to be exposed to the proteins, he will continue to produce these autoantibodies. Celiac disease is found throughout the world but is most prevalent in those of European descent. It can affect anyone at any age and is more common in women. It is thought to be an inherited tendency that is triggered by an environmental, emotional, or physical event \ufffd although the exact mechanism is not fully understood. According to the National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, about 5 to 15% of close family members of a celiac disease patient will also have the condition. Symptoms There are literally dozens, if not hundreds, of symptoms of gluten intolerance. It all comes down to inflammation in the body! Many people believe the most common symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature - yet the majority of people with gluten intolerance (and celiac disease) have extraintestinal symptoms. The most common symptoms of celiac disease include: \ufffd Fatigue \ufffd Addison\ufffds vomiting, reflux) \ufffd stature Seizures \ufffd Tingling numbness in the legs The \ufffdcure\ufffd is a life long gluten free diet. Making the Transition 1. Have a reality check. Remember this is a choice! If you want to feel lousy for the rest of your life and get worse as time goes on then continue eating gluten. If you want to start on a journey to heal; go gluten free! 2. Give it time. It takes time to heal. Take the 45 day challenge. Within this time frame you will notice the brain fog is gone. Your body will start adjusting to a healthy weight. Yes, you will lose the bloating and weight around the middle. Don\ufffdt be discouraged if it takes a little longer to feel 100%. 3. Look at your current diet and go through your pantry and refrigerator to find the foods and meals you already eat that are gluten-free. You may need to keep a food journal if you haven't already. Be sure to list condiments, ice creams, produce, snacks, and other foods. This list will be helpful as you create menus around your new foods and give you encouragement that you're already on the right track! 4. Give yourself permission to eat things that you may have restricted from your diet before your diagnosis. Potato chips or GF cookies may not be appropriate for other people, but they are a treat in a GF diet in small doses of course. You will need to find treats for yourself initially as you adjust to this diet. Count calories after you are comfortable with your new way of eating, manage your portions instead. Once you are comfortable with the switch start cutting back on refined grains, crackers, breads, etc., to help the gut heal quicker. In all honesty, bread will not be that important. It's all about taking baby steps! 5. Look at your current menus and meals and find ways to eliminate gluten from your diet. Replace bread in sandwiches with GF bread or green leaf lettuce and add your favorite fixings and condiments. Have breakfast burritos with rice tortillas instead of toast and eggs. Look for GF hot and cold cereals (must not have barley malt) and have those handy for a snack or meal. Replace bread and crackers with tortilla or corn chips, brown rice cakes or popcorn. For example, chicken or tuna salad on rice cakes or scooped onto corn chips is delicious. Popcorn is a filling side dish with soup. Be on the lookout for meals on your current menus or the menus of friends and family that are naturally gluten-free (roasted chicken, baked sweet potatoes and steamed veggies, for example) and make them a staple on your new menus. Surf the internet, watch cooking shows and browse magazines for ideas and adapt them as you see fit. 6. Clear out any and all foods that have gluten, wheat, wheat flour, oats, oat flour, rye, semolina, or modified food starch from your pantry. This will allow you to see how close you are to living gluten-free already. If you have family members living with you who are not gluten free, you might consider giving the \"offending edibles\" to them to be put in another part of the house while you learn to live and think gluten-free. As time goes on you can cook for the entire family without gluten. 7. Plan and prepare your meals ahead of time. Being caught hungry without a plan is not a good idea! Keep a few GF soups on hand in case of extreme hunger. Keep a small cooler in your car with snacks such as nuts, dried fruit and water. It helps to outline and pack any meals you're eating at home and away from home, including snacks. An example could be - o Breakfast: scrambled eggs and mixed vegetables rolled in a rice tortilla, sliced apples, and coffee. o Lunch: Lettuce with turkey, avocado slices, tomato, and mustard, 1 oz. chips, and 2 organic dark chocolate pieces. o Dinner: Grilled fish or chicken with mixed vegetables, wild rice, and fruit. o Snacks: 1 oz. almonds and popcorn. o Desert: Coconut Ice Cream or fruit. Tips 1. Be patient with yourself. You'll have days when being gluten-free is really depressing (maybe even \"fall off the wagon\"). This is normal. Relax \ufffd it\ufffds a process. 2. Carry snacks with you wherever you go. It's often difficult to find an appropriate snack when the hunger strikes. GF bars are great! 3. Arrange with the hosts of gatherings you may attend to bring your own sides or complete meals. Most people are very supportive of restricted diets. 4. Carry a small cooler in your car with small cold packs to store fruit, snacks and water. 5. Consider avoiding restaurants during your transition phase as you learn how to eat and think gluten-free. Grilled meats (over a flame), baked potatoes and salads without croutons are usually safe bets. But keep a log of places you eat, what you ate and how you felt afterward. Gluten is insidious and can turn up in the oddest places (french fries, for example which can be dusted with flour). 6. Get your hands on cookbooks or start collecting your own recipes in a binder. 7. Carry digestive aids (enzyme and bioflavonoid) with you in case of accidental ingestion. There are ones specifically for gluten such as GlutenFlam by Apex Energetics; available from your healthcare practitioner. 8. Consider taking a multi-vitamin to make up for vitamins and minerals you may lack with your new diet (ask your doctor or nutritionist if necessary). 9. Find a mentor or support system. 10.

Autism is a very complex disorder. It causes developmental problems in children and can differ in severity. The five different forms of Autism range by severity on the Autism spectrum. The different forms are also referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The five different forms of Autism are Classic Autism, Aspergers Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Rett Syndrome. Classic Autism Classic Autism is the most severe disorder on the Autism Spectrum. Children with Classic Autism typically have social difficulties such as problems responding to people and avoiding eye contact. It may seem as though a child with classic autism has difficulty playing with other children and has very narrow interests. Children with classic Autism also are very sensitive to stimulation such as lights, loud noises, or being touched or hugged. Being exposed to excessive stimulation children with Autism may become very upset. Classic Autism will also cause a child to be inflexible to change. Children with Classic Autism may develop strict routines or rituals, and changes to these may upset him or her. Repetitive movements are also a sign of Classic Autism. Children may do motions such as rocking or hitting themself constantly, or continuously repeat the same words or sounds. Asperger's Syndrome Those with Asperger's Syndrome have a very distinct difficulty with social situations. Signs of Asperger's Syndrome can typically be noticed when children are in social settings such as preschool or daycare. Children with this disorder may have many of the same signs as those of a child with Classic Autism. They dislike changes in routine, avoid eye contact with others, and may avoid social situations. Children with Asperger's Syndrome may have normal intellectual development and language, but will have trouble with many social skills. They may lack the ability to read others' body language, and may be unable to notice differences in speech tones. Also, children with Asperger's may have delayed motor development. As a result, a child with Asperger's may have an akward walk or poor handwriting skills. To be diagnosed with Asperger's Sydrome a child must have many of these symptoms, and they must be severe. Even with treatment, Asperger's will not go away. Teenagers with this disorder will learn things like motor skills, but will often still have difficulty with social cues and body language. Childhood Disintegrative Disorder Childhood Disintegrative Disorder is similar to autism, but has some very unique characteristics. Children with CDD will have at least two years of normal development, but will then begin to lose social, motor and language skills. Typically, this will occur before the age of ten. This disorder is a result of the neurobiology of the brain, however the exact cause is unknown. As the child begins to lose the skills that they have developed, they may experience unexplained changes in behavior. These changes can be heightened anxiety, anger or agitation. Similar to Classic Autism, children with this disorder may have social problems and a need for routines. These children may also lose control of their bladder or bowels, and may lose commnication and motor skills. To be diagnosed with this disorder, children must exibit regression in at least two of the follow areas: play with peers bladder or bowel control spoken language language understanding social or self-help skills motor skills Rett Syndrome Rett Syndrome is developmental and neurological disorder that typically occurs only in females. Rett Syndrome is caused by a mutation on the MECP2 gene (located on the X chromosome). Like CDD, children will either stop developing or lose skills and abilities that have developed. Children with Rett Sydrome can begin to show symptoms between ages 3 months and 3 years. They will have symptoms such as loss of speech, anxiety, social problems, breathing problems, balance/coordination problems, and stereotypic hand movements such as clapping or hand wringing. Also common is children with Rett Syndrome are seizures, cardiac problems, scoliosis, trouble sleeping, gastro-intestinal problems, and problems feeding themselves. Causes of Autism The cause of Autism is unknown, however there are many theories about what causes it. Vaccines and Autism There are theories that link autism to vaccines. The MMR vaccine, used to prevent measles-mumps-and rubella, has been linked to causing intestinal problems which can lead to the development of Autism. Also, there is a theory that connects the preservative used in vaccines, thimerosal, to autism. Genetics It is also suggested that Autism is genetic. Research has shown that children born to families with Autistic member have a higher chance of being Autistic. Also, the risk of parents having more than one autistic child is higher. Other theories exist that connect things such as bad parenting, food allergies, immune deficiencies, and poor nutrition to the cause of Autism. The cause of Autism is a very controversial subject, and like stated above there is no research pointing to a definite cause. pointing genetic brain genetic Autism Autism eye contact routines regression aspergers childhood disintegrative disorder seizures anxiety MMR rett syndrome Autistic Autism Spectrum Asperger Aspergers Syndrome Autism There Autism Spectrum Disorders Classic Autism Rett Syndrome Classic Autism Classic Asperger 's widely in severity and symptoms and may go unrecognized, especially in mildly affected children or when it is masked by more debilitating handicaps. Very early indicators that require evaluation by an expert include: no babbling or pointing by age 1 no single words by 16 months or two-word phrases by age 2 no response to name loss of language or social skills poor eye contact excessive lining up of toys or objects no smiling or social responsiveness. Later indicators include: impaired ability to make friends with peers impaired ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others absence or impairment of imaginative and social play stereotyped, repetitive, or unusual use of language restricted patterns of interest that are abnormal in intensity or focus preoccupation with certain objects or subjects inflexible adherence to specific routines or rituals. Health care providers will often use a questionnaire or other screening instrument to gather information about a child s development and behavior. Some screening instruments rely solely on parent observations, while others rely on a combination of parent and doctor observations. If screening instruments indicate the possibility of ASD, a more comprehensive evaluation is usually indicated. A comprehensive evaluation requires a multidisciplinary team, including a psychologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, speech therapist, and other professionals who diagnose children with ASD. The team members will conduct a thorough neurological assessment and in-depth cognitive and language testing. Because hearing problems can cause behaviors that could be mistaken for ASD, children with delayed speech development should also have their hearing tested. Children with some symptoms of ASD but not enough to be diagnosed with classical autism are often diagnosed with PDD-NOS. Children with autistic behaviors but well-developed language skills are often diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Much rarer are children who may be diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder, in which they develop normally and then suddenly deteriorate between the ages of 3 to 10 years and show marked autistic behaviors. Girls with autistic symptoms may have Rett syndrome, a sex-linked genetic disorder characterized by social withdrawal, regressed language skills, and hand wringing. pointing genetic genetic eye contact babbling routines ASD childhood disintegrative disorder cognitive rett syndrome PDD-NOS www.healthynj.org/dis-con/autism/main.htm screening Autism244 http://www.wrightslaw.com/info/autism.index.htm Autism, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), Asperger Syndrome (AS) FAQs l Articles l Caselaw l Books l Resources l Organizations Explaining Autism to Children Print pageWe receive many questions from parents, teachers, and health care providers about special education services for children with autism. If you are a parent, you need to educate yourself about your child's disability, effective educational methods and medical treatments, and how to present your child's problems and needs to school staff so they want to help. On the Autism, PDD Asperger Syndome page, you will find FAQs, articles, legal resources, recommended books, free publications, and a short list of information and support groups.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has opened the Autism Information Center. You can find out exactly what Autism and other Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) are on this website. What is Autism? Autism is a neurological disorder that can impair communication, socialization and behavior. It is usually diagnosed within the first three years of life and is four times more common in boys than in girls . However, some types of Autism may not be diagnosed until years later when the child enters school, due to late-occurring social deficits or difficulty playing with others. When this occurs, the child is usually too old to take advantage of early childhood intervention services and is evaluated for entry into the special education system. Though awareness and understanding have greatly increased over the past few decades, many people are still unaware of the true affect of Autism. It can become an overshadowing factor in every aspect of life, including education, establishing and maintaining relationships, responding to pain and discomfort, and even in the ability to express emotion. Symptom severity in Autism can range from mild to severe. For example, one child may intensely flap their arms to show excitement, another may display a smile under the same set of circumstances, while another child may sit in the corner and rock, leading the observer to believe that they may be incapable of showing or feeling emotion.As parents reach the diagnosis, treatment and education stages of Autism, they will hear many different terms used to describe their child. This may include words such as autistic-like, non-verbal, developmentally delayed, autistic tendencies, savant, high-functioning, and low-functioning. The important thing to realize is that all children with Autism are different. What works for one may have zero effect on another. The combinations of signs and symptoms are endless. More important than the words used to describe the child is the underlying understanding that whatever the diagnosis is, children with Autism are able to learn, function productively in society and show positive gains with appropriate education and treatment plans in place. Without appropriate support, the child may never realize his full potential. (Source)According to the National Academy of Sciences, the diagnosis of autism can be made reliably in two-year-olds by professionals experienced in the diagnostic assessment of young children with autistic disorders. Early diagnosis is crucial because education is the primary form of treatment, and the earlier it starts, the better. Autism and PDD: Fact Sheet. What is Asperger's Syndrome? Asperger Syndrome (AS) is a severe developmental disorder characterized by major difficulties in social interaction, and restricted and unusual patterns of interest and behavior. There are many similarities with autism without mental retardation (or Higher Functioning Autism ). (see Resources: Asperger's Syndrome; information & support). What Can You Tell Me About Asperger Syndrome? Asperger syndrome (AS) is a neurobiological disorder, which most researchers feel falls at the high end of the autistic spectrum. Individuals with Asperger syndrome can have symptoms ranging from mild to severe. While sharing many of the same characteristics as Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified and High-Functioning Autism, Asperger syndrome is a relatively new term in the United States, having only recently being officially recognized as a diagnosis by the medical community. Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) and Pervasive Development Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) The diagnostic category of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) refers to a group of disorders characterized by delays in the development of socialization and communication skills. Parents may note symptoms as early as infancy, although the typical age of onset is before 3 years of age. Symptoms may include problems with using and understanding language; difficulty relating to people, objects, and events; unusual play with toys and other objects; difficulty with changes in routine or familiar surroundings, and repetitive body movements or behavior patterns. (source)Autism Spectrum Disorders (Pervasive Developmental Disorders). A detailed booklet, from the National Institute of Mental Health, that describes symptoms, causes, and treatments, with information on getting help and coping. Intensive Early Intervention All available research strongly suggests that intensive early intervention makes a critical difference to children with autistic spectrum disorders. Without early identification and diagnosis, children with autism are unlikely to learn the skills they need to benefit from education. The National Research Council analyzed intervention models for young children with autistic disorders and concluded that intensive early intervention makes a clinically significant difference for many children. Children who had early intervention had better outcomes. (See Current Interventions in Autism: A Brief Analysis) What is Developmental Screening? In this CDC article, many questions are discussed regarding developmental screening. For example: What is developmental screening? Developmental screening is a procedure designed to identify children who should receive more intensive assessment or diagnosis, for potential developmental delays. It can allow for earlier detection of delays and improve child health and well-being for identified children. Early Intervention for Toddlers with Autism Highly Effective. The study, published online in the journal Pediatrics, examined an intervention called the Early Start Denver Model, which combines applied behavioral analysis (ABA) teaching methods with developmental 'relationship-based' approaches. Study finds significant gains in IQ, communication and social interaction. (November 2009) To Top Articles Here are links to articles about educating children with autism.

These disorders are usually first diagnosed in early childhood and range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, through pervasive development disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), to a much milder form, Asperger syndrome. They also include two rare disorders, Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder. More about Autism \ufffdSigns SymptomsParents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child. In some cases, the baby seemed \"different\" from birth, unresponsive to people or focusing intently on one item for long periods of time. The first signs of an autism spectrum disorder can also appear in children who had been developing normally. When an affectionate, babbling toddler suddenly becomes silent, withdrawn, self-abusive, or indifferent to social overtures, something is wrong. More about Signs Symptoms \ufffdTreatmentThere is no single best treatment package for all children with ASD.

Mercury (Hg) is a toxic metal that can exist as a pure element or in a variety of inorganic and organic forms and can cause immune, sensory, neurological, motor, and behavioral dysfunctions similar to traits defining or associated with autism. Thimerosal, a preservative frequently added to childhood vaccines, has become a major source of Hg in human infants and toddlers. According to the FDA and the American Academy of Pediatricians, fully vaccinated children now receive, within their first two years, Hg levels that exceed safety limits established by the FDA and other supervisory agencies. A thorough review of medical literature and U.S. government data indicates (i) that many and perhaps most cases of idiopathic autism, in which an extended period of developmental normalcy is followed by an emergence of symptoms, are induced by early exposure to Hg; (ii) that this type of autism represents a unique form of Hg poisoning (HgP); (iii) that excessive Hg exposure from thimerosal in vaccine injections is an etiological mechanism for causing the traits of autism; (iv) that certain genetic and non-genetic factors establish a predisposition whereby thimerosal's adverse effects occur only in some children; and (v) that vaccinal Hg in thimerosal is causing a heretofore unrecognized mercurial syndrome. SYNOPSIS A review of medical literature indicates that the characteristics of autism and of mercury poisoning (HgP) are strikingly similar. Traits defining or associated with both disorders are summarized in Table A immediately following the Table of Contents and are discussed and cited in the body of this document. The parallels between the two diseases are so thorough as to suggest, based on total Hg injected into U.S. children, that many cases of autism are a form of mercury poisoning. For these children, the exposure route is childhood vaccines, most of which contain thimerosal, a preservative which is 49.6% ethylmercury by weight. The amount of mercury a typical child under two years receives from vaccinations equates to 237.5 micrograms, or 3.53 x 1017 molecules (353,000,000,000,000,000 molecules). Most such vaccinal Hg may not be excreted and instead migrates to the brain. The total amount injected into infants and toddlers (i) is known to exceed Federal safety standards, (ii) is officially considered to be a low level; whereby (iii) only a small percentage of exposed individuals exhibit symptoms of toxicity. In fact, children who develop Hg-related autism are likely to have had a predisposition derived from genetic and non-genetic factors. Importantly, the timings of vaccinal Hg-exposure and its latency period coincide with the emergence of autistic-symptoms in specific children. Moreover, excessive mercury has been detected in urine, hair, and blood samples from autistic children; and parental reports, though limited at this date, indicate significant improvement in symptoms subsequent to heavy-metal chelation therapy. The HgP phenotype is diverse and depends upon a number of factors - including type of Hg, route of entry into the body, rate and level of dose, individual genotype, and the age and immune status of the patient. Historically, variation among these factors has caused slightly different manifestations of mercurialism; Mad Hatter\u2019s disease, Minamata disease, acrodynia, and industrial exposures provide examples. The pathology arising from the mercury-related variables involved in autism - intermittent bolus doses of ethylmercury injected into susceptible infants and toddlers - is heretofore undescribed in medical literature. Therefore, in accord with existing HgP data and HgP s ability to induce virtually all the traits defining or associated with autism spectrum disorders, we hypothesize that many and perhaps most cases of autism represent a unique form of mercury poisoning. This conclusion and its supporting data have important implications for the affected population of autistic individuals and their families, for other unexplained disorders with symptoms similar to those of heavy metal intoxication, for vaccine content, and for childhood vaccination programs. Due to its high potential for neurotoxicity, thimerosal should be removed immediately from all vaccine products designated for infants and toddlers.

Exposure occurs at 0 - 15 months; clinical silent stage means symptom emergence delayed; symptoms emerge gradually, starting with movement sensation Symptoms emerge from 4 months to 2 years old; symptoms emerge gradually, starting with movement sensation INTRODUCTION Autism Autism, or Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is considered a neurodevelopmental syndrome, emerging early in life and exhibiting a constellation of seemingly unrelated features and a wide variation in symptom expression and level of severity by individual (Filipek et al, 1999; Bailey et al, 1996). The diagnostic criteria for autism are qualitative impairments in social relatedness, deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication, and the presence of repetitive and restricted behaviors or interests (APA, 1994). As will be cited below, other traits associated with autism are movement disorder, sensory dysfunction, and cognitive impairments as well as gastrointestinal difficulties and immune abnormalities (Gillberg Coleman, 1992; Warren et al, 1990; Horvath et al, 1999). Onset must occur before age 36 months (APA, 1994); although in some instances deficits are apparent at birth, in the great majority of cases there are at least several months of normal development followed by clear regression or failure to progress normally (Gillberg Coleman, 1992; Filipek et al, 1999; Bailey et al, 1996). Formerly regarded as a rare disease, autism is now said to affect one in 500 children (Bristol et al, 1996), with some estimates suggesting one in 100 for a broader phenotype often labeled as the autism-spectrum of disorders and which includes both higher and lower functioning individuals (Arvidsson et al, 1997; Wing, 1996). Autism and autistic symptoms can arise from a number of known disorders, most notably tuberous sclerosis, Rhett syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Fragile X, Phenylketonuria, purine and other purine diseases defects and 5'-nucleotidase superactivity. The etiology and pathogenesis of the vast majority of autism cases - 70% - 90% (Gillberg and Coleman, 1992; Bailey et al, 1996) - remain unexplained, however, despite ASD being one of the most extensively studied disorders in child psychiatry today (Malhotra and Gupta, 1999). Nevertheless, there is general agreement that most cases of autism arise from the interaction of an early environmental insult and a genetic predisposition (Trottier et al, 1999; Bristol et al, 1996). Mercury A heavy metal, mercury (Hg) is widely considered one of the most toxic substances on earth (Clarkson, 1997). Instances of Hg poisoning or mercurialism have been described since Roman times. The Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland was a victim of occupational exposure to mercury vapor, referred to as Mad Hatter's Disease. Further human data has been derived from instances of widespread poisonings during the 20th Century. These misfortunes include an outbreak in Minamata, Japan, caused by consumption of contaminated fish and resulting in Minamata Disease; outbreaks in Iraq, Guatemala and Russia due to ingestion of contaminated seed grains; and, in the first half of the century, poisoning of infants and toddlers by mercury in teething powders, leading to acrodynia or Pink Disease. Besides these epidemics, numerous instances of individual or small group cases of Hg intoxication and subsequent phenotype are described in the literature. The constellation of mercury-induced symptoms varies enormously from individual to individual. The diversity of disease manifestations derives from a number of interacting variables which are summarized in Table I. The variables which affect phenotype include an individual's age, the total dosage, dose rate, duration of exposure, type of mercury, routes of exposure such as inhaled, subcutaneous, oral, or intramuscular, and, most importantly, by individual sensitivity arising from immune and genetic factors (Dales, 1972; Koos and Longo, 1976; Matheson et al, 1980; Eto et al, 1999; Feldman, 1982; Warkany and Hubbard, 1953). Table I: Summary of Mercury Exposure Variables Leading to Diverse Non-Specific Symptomatology Variable Level of Variable Exposure Amount Ranges from high doses, leading to death or near death with severe impairments, to low safe doses, leading to subtle neurological and other physical impairments Duration of exposure One time vs. multiple times over the course of weeks, months, or years Dose rate Bolus dose, daily dose Individual sensitivity A function of (a) the age at which exposure occurs, that is, prenatal, infant, child, adolescent, or adult, (b) genetically determined reactivity to mercury, and (c) gender Common types of mercury The organic alkyl forms - methylmercury and ethylmercury; and inorganic forms - metallic mercury, elemental (liquid) mercury, and ionic mercury/mercuric salt Primary routes of exposure Inhalation of mercury vapors, orally through the intestinal tract, subcutaneous and intramuscular injections, topically through ear drops, teething powders, skin creams and ointments, and intravenously during medical treatments While these variations in exposure, individual status, and genotype give rise to a diverse clinical phenotype, there are nevertheless obvious commonalities across all mercury-caused disorders. Thus, for example, victims will almost always develop a movement disorder, but in some individuals this may manifest as mere clumsiness, while others will develop severe involuntary jerking movements. Likewise, psychological disturbances are usually present, but in some individuals these might manifest as anxiety while in others it might present as aggression or irritability. Diagnosing Mercury Poisoning in Autism Mercury poisoning can be difficult to diagnose and is often interpreted by clinicians as a psychiatric disorder, especially if exposure is not suspected (Diner and Brenner, 1998; Frackelton and Christensen, 1998). The difficulty in diagnosis derives primarily from two notable characteristics of this heavy metal. First, there can be a long latent period between time of exposure and onset of overt symptoms, so that the connection between the two events is often overlooked. The latency period is discussed in more detail below. Second, the diverse manifestations of the disease make it difficult for the clinician to find a precise match of his particular patient's symptoms with those described in other case reports (Adams et al, 1983, Kark et al, 1971; Florentine and Sanfilippo, Christensen, 1998; Warkany Hubbard, 1953). Due to the difficulty of diagnosing mercurialism based on presentation of non-specific symptoms alone, clinicians have come to rely on the following criteria (Warkany Hubbard, 1953; Vroom and Greer, 1972). 1. Observation of impairments in many but not all of the following domains: (a) movement/motor disorder, (b) sensory abnormalities, (c) psychological and behavioral disturbances, (d) neurological and cognitive deficits, (e) impairments in language, hearing, and vision, and (f) miscellaneous physical presentations such as rashes or unusual reflexes (Adams et al, 1983; Snyder, 1972; Vroom & Greer, 1972). 2. Known exposure to Hg (a) at a level that has been documenting as causing impairment in similar individuals under similar circumstances, and (b) at approximately the same time as the symptoms emerge, with allowances given for the latency period (Ross et al, 1977; Amin-Zaki et al, 1978). It should be noted that the dose which is considered toxic vs. safe is unresolved among toxicologists; some researchers feel that any amount of exposure is unsafe (see EPA, 1997, pp.6-47 to 6-59, for dose discussion). 3. Detectable levels of mercury in urine, blood, or hair (Florentine and Sanfilippo, 1991; Frackelton and Christensen, 1998; EPA, 1997, p.ES-2). Importantly, because mercury can clear from biologic samples before the patient feels symptoms or is tested, the lack of detectable mercury is not cause for ruling out mercury poisoning; and conversely, detectable levels have been observed in unaffected individuals (Adams et al, 1983; Warkany Hubbard, 1953; Cloarec, 1995). 4. Improvement in symptoms after chelation. While many patients' symptoms resolve with chelation, some clearly poisoned individuals do not improve. Other exposed subjects have also been known to improve without intervention (Vroom Greer, 1972; Warkany Hubbard, 1953). Thus, none of these criteria is sufficient on its own for a certain diagnosis. Rather, observed effects within two or three domains are generally required. This paper, which reviews and compares the extensive literature available on both ASD and mercury, provides citations documenting that, based on these four diagnostic criteria, many if not most cases of autism meet the requirements for mercury poisoning. In fact, this review and its citations (i) delineate a single mechanism for inducing all of the primary domains of impairment and biological abnormalities in autism, including its genetic component, prevalence levels, and sex ratios; and (ii) identify that mechanism as arising from the environmental insult of early childhood exposure to mercury. Furthermore, the route of exposure is thimerosal, which is 50% ethylmercury by weight and which is a preservative used in many childhood vaccines. We are not suggesting that the previous reports of mercurialism described in the literature are in fact cases of autism; rather, we claim that autism represents its own unique form of Hg poisoning, just like acrodynia, Minamata disease, and Mad Hatter's disease represent distinct yet closely related presentations of mercurialism. A unique expression would be expected in cases of autism, given that the effects of repeated vaccinal administration of ethylmercury to infants and toddlers have never been described before in mercury-related literature. We maintain that the diverse phenotype that is autism matches the diverse phenotype that is mercurialism to a far greater degree that could reasonably be expected to occur by chance. Given the known exposure to mercury via vaccination of autistic children and the presence of mercury found in biologic samples from a number of autistic subjects, also described here, we are confident that our claim is substantiated. Our paper discusses some important medical and societal ramifications of this conclusion. I. SYMPTOM COMPARISON The overt symptoms of ASD and mercury poisoning, described in the literature and presented here, are strikingly similar. Summary tables have been provided after each section to aid in symptom comparisons. a. Affect/Psychological Presentation Since its initial description in 1943 by Leo Kanner, a psychiatrist, autism has been defined primarily as a psychiatric condition. One of the three requirements for diagnosis is a severe deficit in social interactions (APA, 1994). Self and parental reports describe children and adults who prefer to be alone and who will withdraw to their rooms if given the chance (MAAP, 1996-1999). Even high functioning autistics tend to be aloof, have poor social skills, are unable to make friends, and find conversation difficult (Tonge et al, 1999; Capps et al, 1998). Face recognition and what psychologists call theory of mind are impaired (Klin et al, 1999, Baron-Cohen et al, 1993). Poor eye contact or gaze avoidance is present in most cases, especially in infancy and childhood (Bernabei et al, 1998). The second psychobehavioral diagnostic characteristic of autism is the presence of repetitive, stereotyped activities and the need for sameness (APA, 1994). Traits in this domain strongly resemble obsessive-compulsive tendencies in both thought and behavior (Lewis, 1996; Gillberg & Coleman, 1992, p.27), especially as the individual becomes more high functioning (Roux et al, 1998): it [is] very difficult.to distinguish between obsessive ideation and the bizarre preoccupations so commonly seen in autistic individuals (Howlin, 2000). Serotonin uptake inhibitors known to be effective for OCD also reduce repetitive behaviors in some autistic patients (Lewis, 1996). Most autistic subjects - 84% in one study - show high levels of anxiety and meet diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorder (Muris et al, 1998). ASD has been linked to depression, based on symptoms, familial history of depression and the positive response to SSRIs among many autistics (Clarke et al, 1999; DeLong, 1999; Piven and Palmer, 1999). One subset of autistics has been described as passive , with flat affect, absence of facial expression, lack of initiative, and diminished outward emotional reactions. Some autistics have a strong family history of manic depression and mood swings, and, among those who are verbal, psychotic talk is frequently observed (Plioplys, 1989). Autism is also said to strongly resemble childhood schizophrenia. In the past it was often misdiagnosed as such (Gillberg Coleman, 1992, p.100), and there are a number of instances of dual ASD-schizophrenia diagnoses in the literature (Clarke et al, 1999). Furthermore, irrational fears, aggressive behaviors, and severe temper tantrums are common (Muris et al, 1998; McDougle et al, 1994), as are chronic hyperarousal and irritability (Jaselskis et al, 1992). Inexplicable changes of mood can occur, with giggling and laughing or crying for no apparent reason (Wing Attwood, 1987). Mercury poisoning, when undetected, is often initially diagnosed as a psychiatric disorder in both children and adults (Fagala and Wigg, 1992). Common psychiatric symptoms are (a) depression, including lack of interest and mental confusion; (b) extreme shyness, indifference to others, active avoidance of others or a desire to be alone ; (c) irritability in adults and tantrums in children; and (d) anxiety and fearfulness. Neurosis, including schizoid and obsessive-compulsive traits, has been reported in a number of cases (Fagala and Wigg, 1992; Kark et al, 1984; Rice, 1996; Vroom & Greer, 1972; Adams et al, 1973; Hua et al, 1996). Juvenile monkeys prenatally exposed to mercury exhibit decreased social play and increased passive behavior (Gunderson et al, 1986, 1988), as well as impaired face recognition (Rice, 1996). Humans exposed to mercury vapor also perform poorly on face recognition tests and may present with a mask face (Vroom Greer, 1972); emotional instability can occur in children and adults exposed to Hg. For instance, Iraqi children poisoned by methylmercury had a tendency to cry, laugh, or smile without obvious provocation (Amin-Zaki et al, 1974 1979), like the autistic group described by Wing and Attwood (1987).

Also included is a comparison of Lenny, an autistic adult described by Rhea Paul (1987), and the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland, considered to be an accurate portrayal of victims of the disease. Of particular relevance in all these cases are social withdrawal and deficits in social communication, traits (i) always prominent in autism and (ii) clearly associated with mercurialism. Case Studies: Autism I am 18 years old. My parents found out I was autistic when I was 18 months old. My parents said I banged my head a lot when I got frustrated when I was young. Head banging motions help me deal with nervousness. I also take 2 medications to help me cope with stress. I have very few friends. It is also somewhat painful for me to look people in the eye. This sometimes makes people think I am not paying attention (The MAAP, Vol. II, 1997). I have a high-functioning autistic eight-year-old boy. My mistake was putting him in the second grade with a teacher who was determined to 'socialize' him. After three months, the anxiety proved to be too great for him. He spent a lot of time crying, withdrawing to his room, becoming compulsive and belligerent. In another era, he would have been seen as having a 'nervous breakdown' (The MAAP, Vol. II, 1997). I am writing regarding our 25 year old son who was diagnosed only a few months ago as having Asperger's Syndrome. All his life he displayed the 'classic' symptoms of Asperger's (lack of social skills, disorganization, anxiety, etc.). A few months ago, he became clinically depressed, phobic about being around people for fear of more rejection or being laughed at. He now has obsessive thoughts that our home is electronically 'bugged' and all his actions are being observed and belittled (The MAAP, Vol. II, 1997). Several people have asked me what it's like to have Asperger's Syndrome. Today, I still prefer to work on my computer or with electronics rather than socialize. I've never been able to tolerate any kind of physical contact or intimacy. I like wrestling and rough-housing, but I hate being caressed or held. (The MAAP, Vol. II, 1997). My son Brian is a 6-year-old with high functioning autism. Our main problem now is his rigidity and obsessive/compulsive behaviors. He gets extremely upset when activities don't go as he thinks they should. He first gets mad, screaming and yelling, then begins to obsessively talk about how he can remedy the situation, then often begins to cry uncontrollably. These tantrums can go on for hours (The MAAP, Vol. IV, 1996). [I'm] age 12r. I have Autism/PDD. I don't really know any real social skills, though my brother Isaiah says I am a social outcast. I do have trouble making new friends because I get real shy and nervous (The MAAP, Vol. IV, 1997). I am the mother of three autistic boys. Nate was considered very shy. Poor eye contact but very smart and doing well in school. Nate was also diagnosed with Hypotonia of the face (which answered all the mumbling he did wasn't just shyness) and extremities (The MAAP, Vol. III, 1999) I spent many hours sitting in the trees or under the bed or in a dark closet. I had a loud flat voice. Socialization has always been beyond me (The MAAP, Vol. II, 1998). I sit in my room a prisoner to my autism. Mom and sis doing their loving best to get me out. I wanted to get out - really get out. I wanted to love, to feel, to connect. But, I couldn't. I was stuck. I was slowly dying. There were days I truly wanted to end it all. If any days were good, I didn't deserve it. I shouldn't be happy. Autism teaches you that - because it's a life sentence (The MAAP, Vol. VI, 1996). Case Studies: Mercury Poisoning A 12 year old girl with recent mercury vapor poisoning was initially diagnosed as having a psychiatric disturbance. Her behavior was more normal when she was unaware of being watched. She became upset when people were around, was reluctant to speak when others were present, spoke in a soft, mumbling voice, lacked eye contact, had a flat affect, was sometimes tearful, experienced auditory hallucinations of voices laughing at her, wished to stay alone in her room with the lights off and her head covered, and had frequent temper tantrums (Fagala and Wigg, 1992). Sufferers of Mad Hatter's disease, arising from prolonged mercury vapor exposure, were known to suffer from depression, lassitude, acute anxiety, and irrational fears. They also became nervous, timid, and shy. They blushed readily, were embarrassed in social situations, objected to being watched, and sought to avoid people. They felt a constant impulse to return home. They were easily upset, and were prone to agitation, irritability, anger, and aggressive behavior (O'Carroll et al, 1995). A survey on an Internet site of adult acrodynia victims, which compared the symptoms of adults who suffered from acrodynia as children with controls, reported the following symptoms as seen to a greater degree in acrodynia sufferers than in controls: dislikes being touched or hugged, is a loner, lacks self confidence, feels nervousness and has a racing heart, has depression and suicidal feelings (Farnesworth, 1997). One acrodynia victim described his own situation: not having learnt normal social skills I spent a lot of my time alone.Gradually by age 11 or so, I was becoming 'normal'.But, I have never overcome the headache problem, irritability, shyness with real people, not wanting to be touched, depression, fear of doctors, great anxiety. (Neville's Recollection, Pink Disease site) A doctor from the 19th century described several cases of mercury poisoning from dental amalgams: There is mental excitability as well as mental depression; perplexing events cause the highest degree of excitement, ordinary conversation sometimes causes complete confusion, headache, palpitation, intense solicitude, and anxiety, without reason for it. Such are some of the symptoms attending these cases. As an example he cites the case of a young woman who had come to be melancholic and to withdraw herself from her family and friends, seeking the seclusion of her room -- refusing to go out or to associate with others, or even with the members of her own household. (Tuthill, 1899) Nearly a century later, initial questioning of a 28 year old woman, subsequently found to have mercury vapor poisoning, elicited the fact that she had become increasingly withdrawn from social activities and had felt most uncomfortable when with strangers. She also felt that her friends had turned against her. She had a repetitive disturbing dream of electric fire around the frames of the windows in her bedroom. (Ross et al, 1977) Lenny and The Mad Hatter (a) Rigid literal interpretation of word meaning; word meaning and pragmatic errors which interfere with social communication Lenny - He was very literal minded, and words spoken to him became matters of immutable fact. For example, he was trying on new shoes. His mother asked him if they slipped up and down. He said they didn't, and when asked again if he were sure, he replied, 'No, they don't slip up and down; they slip down and then they slip up.' The Mad Hatter - Take some more tea, the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. I've had nothing yet, Alice replied in an offended tone: so I ca'n't take more. You mean you ca'n't take less, said the Hatter: It's very easy to take more than nothing. (b) Social deficits, inability to interpret social rules, leading to perceived rude behavior Lenny - Although he tried working in his father's business for a time, his immaturity, self-centered behavior, and lack of social judgment required his return to a sheltered setting. The Mad Hatter - Your hair wants cutting, said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech. You should learn not to make personal remarks, Alice said with some severity: it's very rude. The Hatter opened his eyes wide upon hearing this; but all he said was Why is a raven like a writing desk? (c) Inability to engage in meaningful social conversation; poor conversational interpretation skills; perseverative thoughts Lenny - During one interview he engaged in a 20 minute monologue about a broken washing mashine. The interviewer momentarily dozed off. Upon rousing, the interviewer exclaimed, 'Oh, Lenny, I'm sorry!' 'It's all right,' Lenny replied calmly, 'the washing machine got fixed. The Mad Hatter (who talks obsessively/perseveratively about Time for a good portion of the chapter) - What a funny watch! she remarked. It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is! Why should it? muttered the Hatter. Does your watch tell you what year it is? Of course not, Alice replied very readily: but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time altogether. Which is just the case with mine, said the Hatter. Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to her to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly plain English. b. Language and Hearing The third diagnostic criterion for autism is a qualitative impairment in communication (APA, 1994), and such impairment is a primary feature of mercury poisoning. Delayed language onset is often among the first overt signs of ASD (Eisenmajer et al, 1998). Historically, half of those with classic autism failed to develop meaningful speech (Gillberg Coleman, 1992; Prizant, 1996); and oral-motor deficits (e.g. chewing, swallowing) are often present (Filipek et al, 1999). When speech develops, there may be specific neuromotor speech disorders, including verbal dyspraxia, a dysfunction in the ability to plan the coordinated movements to produce intelligible sequences of speech sounds, or dysarthria, a weakness or lack of control of the oral musculature leading to articulation problems (Filipek et al, 1999). Echolalic speech and pronoun reversals are typically found in younger children. Many ASD subjects show poorer performance on tests of verbal IQ relative to performance IQ (Dawson, 1996; Filipek at al, 1999). Higher functioning individuals, such as those with Asperger's Syndrome, may have language fluency but still exhibit semantic (word meaning) and pragmatic (use of language to communicate) errors (Filipek et al, 1999). Auditory impairment is also common. Two separate studies, for example, both found that 24% of autistic subjects have a hearing deficit (Gillberg Coleman, 1992). More recently Rosenhall et al (1999) have diagnosed hearing loss ranging from mild to profound, as well as hyperacusis, otitis media, and conductive hearing loss, in a minority of ASD subjects, and these traits were independent of IQ status. Among the earliest signs of autism noted by mothers were strange reactions to sound and abnormal babble (Gillberg Coleman, 1992), and many ASD children are tested for deafness before receiving a formal autism diagnosis (Vostanis et al, 1998). Delayed or prompted response to name differentiates 9-12 months old toddlers, later diagnosed with autism, from mentally retarded and typical controls (Baranek, 1999). In fact, bizarre responses to auditory stimuli are nearly universal in autism and may present as either a lack of responsiveness or an exaggerated reaction to auditory stimuli (Roux et al, 1998), possibly due to sound sensitivity (Grandin, 1996). Kanner noted an aversion to certain types of sounds, such as vacuum cleaners (Kanner, 1943). Severe deficits in language comprehension are often present (Filipek et al, 1999). Difficulties in picking out conversational speech from background noise are commonly reported by high functioning ASD individuals (Grandin, 1995; MAAP, 1997-1998). In regard to language and auditory phenomena, autism's parallels to mercurialism are striking. Emerging signs of mercury poisoning are dysarthria (defective articulation in speech due to CNS dysfunction) and then auditory disturbance, leading to deafness in very high doses (Clarkson, 1992). In some cases, hearing impairment manifests as an inability to comprehend speech rather than an inability to hear sound (Dales, 1972). Hg poisoning can also result in aphasia, the inability to understand and/or physically express words (Kark et al, 1971). Speech difficulties may arise from intention tremor, which can be noticeable about the mouth, tongue, face, and head, as well as in the extremities (Adams et al, 1983). Mercury-exposed children especially show a marked difficulty with speech (Pierce et al, 1972; Snyder, 1972; Kark et al, 1971). Even children exposed prenatally to safe levels of methylmercury performed less well on standardized language tests than did unexposed controls (Grandjean et al, 1998). Iraqi babies exposed prenatally either failed to develop language or presented with severe language deficits in childhood. They exhibited exaggerated reaction to sudden noise and some had reduced hearing (Amin-Zaki, 1974 and 1979). Iraqi children who were postnatally poisoned from bread containing either methyl or ethylmercury developed articulation problems, from slow, slurred word production to the inability to generate meaningful speech. Most had impaired hearing and a few became deaf (Amin-Zaki, 1978). In acrodynia, symptoms of sufferers (vs. controls) include noise sensitivity and hearing problems (Farnesworth, 1997). Adults also exhibit these same Hg-induced impairments. There is slurred or explosive speech (Dales, 1972), as well as difficulty in picking out one voice from a group (Joselow et al, 1972). Poisoned Iraqi adults developed articulation problems (Amin-Zaki, 1974). A 25 year old man with elemental mercury poisoning had reduced hearing at all frequencies (Kark et al, 1971). Thimerosal injected into a 44 year old man initially led to difficulty verbalizing, even though his abilities in written expression were uncompromised; he then progressed to slow and slurred speech, although he could still comprehend verbal language; and he finally lost speech altogether (Lowell et al, 1996). In Mad Hatter's disease, there were word retrieval and articulation difficulties (O'Carroll et al, 1995). A scientist who recently died from dimethylmercury poisoning demonstrated an inability to understand speech despite having good hearing sensitivity for pure tones (Musiek and Hanlon, 1999). Workers exposed to mercury vapor showed decreased verbal intelligence relative to performance IQ (Piikivi et al, 1984; Vroom and Greer, 1972) .

Sensory Perception Sensory impairment is considered by many researchers to be a defining characteristic of autism (Gillberg and Coleman, 1992; Williams, 1996). Baranek (1999) detected sensory-motor problems - touch aversion, poor non-social visual attention, excessive mouthing of objects, and delayed response to name - in 9-12 month old infants later diagnosed with autism, and suggests that these impairments both underlie later social deficits and serve to differentiate ASD from mental retardation and typical controls. Besides sensitivity to sound, as previously noted, ASD often involves insensitivity to pain, even to a burning stove (Gillberg Coleman, 1992), while on the other hand there may be an overreaction to stimuli, so that even light to moderate touches are painful. Pinprick tests are usually normal. Children with autism have been described as stiff to hold, and one of the earliest signs reported by mothers is an aversion to being touched (Gillberg Coleman, 1992). Abnormal sensation in the extremities and mouth are common. Toe-walking is frequently seen. Oral sensitivity often results in feeding difficulties (Gillberg Coleman, 1992, p.31). Autistic children frequently have vestibular impairments and difficulty orienting themselves in space (Grandin, 1996; Ornitz, 1987). As in ASD, sensory issues are reported in nearly all cases of mercury toxicity, and serve to demonstrate the similarities between the two conditions. Paresthesia, or abnormal sensation, tingling, and numbness around the mouth and in the extremities, is the most common sensory disturbance in Hg poisoning, and is usually the first sign of toxicity (Fagala and Wigg, 1992; Joselow et al, 1972; Matheson et al, 1980; Amin-Zaki, 1979). In Japanese who ate contaminated fish, there was numbness in the extremities, face and tongue (Snyder, 1972; Tokuomi et al, 1982). Iraqi children who ate bread experienced sensory changes including numbness in the mouth, hands and feet, and a feeling that there were ants crawling under the skin. These children could still feel a pinprick (Amin-Zaki, 1978). Loss of position in space has also been noted (Dales, 1972). Acrodynia sufferers describe excessive pain when bumping limbs, numbness, and poor circulation (Farnesworth, 1997). One adult acrodynia victim described himself as a boy as shying away from people wanting to touch me due to extreme touch sensitivity (Neville Recollection, Pink Disease Support Group). Iraqi babies exposed to mercury prenatally showed excessive crying, irritability, and exaggerated reaction to stimulation such as sudden noise or when touched (Amin-Zaki et al, 1974 and 1979).

Movement/Motor Function Nearly all cases of autism include disorders of physical movement. Movement disturbances have been detected in infants as young as four to six months old who were later diagnosed as autistic: Teitelbaum et al (1998) have observed that these children do not lie, roll over, sit up or crawl like normal infants; impairment in motor control sometimes caused these babies to fall over while sitting, consistently to avoid using one of their arms, or to rest on their elbows for stability while crawling. Later, when trying to walk their gait was abnormal, and some degree of asymmetry, mostly right-sided, was present in all cases studied. Kanner noted in several of his subjects the absence of crawling and a failure to assume an anticipatory posture preparatory to being picked up in infancy (Kanner, 1943). Arm flapping, abnormal posture, jumping, and hand-finger mannerisms (choreiform movements) are common (Tsai, 1996). Many individuals with Asperger's syndrome are typically characterized as uncoordinated or clumsy (Kugler, 1998). Other autism movement disorders include praxis (problems with intentional movement), stereotypies, circling or spinning, rocking, toe walking, myoclonal jerks, difficulty swallowing and chewing, difficulty writing with or even holding a pen, limb apraxia, and poor eye-hand coordination (Caesaroni and Garber, 1991; Gillberg and Coleman, 1992; Filipek et al, 1999). Like ASD, movement disorders have been a feature of virtually all descriptions of mercury poisoning in humans (Snyder, 1972). Even children prenatally exposed to safe levels of methylmercury had deficits in motor function (Grandjean et al, 1998). The movement-related behaviors are extremely diverse: Iraqi infants and children exposed postnatally, for example, developed ataxia that ranged from clumsiness and gait disturbances to an inability to stand or even sit (Amin-Zaki et al, 1978). The various movement behaviors are listed more fully in Table V (Adams et al, 1983; Kark et al, 1971; Pierce et al, 1972; Snyder, O'Kusky et al, 1988; Vroom and Greer, 1972; Warkany and Hubbard, 1953). Noteworthy because of similarities to movement disorders in autism are reports in the Hg literature of (a) an infant with peculiar tremulous movements of the extremities which were principally proximal and can best be described as flapping in nature (Pierce et al, 1972; Snyder, 1972); (b) jerking movements of the upper extremities in a man injected with thimerosal (Lowell et al, 1996); (c) \"constant choreiform movements affecting the fingers and face in mercury vapor intoxication (Kark et al, 1971); (d) myoclonal jerks, associated with epilepsy among Iraqi subjects (Amin-Zaki et al, 1978); (e) poor coordination and clumsiness among victims of acrodynia (Farnesworth, 1997); (f) rocking among with acrodynia (Warkany Hubbard, 1953); (g) \"unusual postures\" observed in both acrodynia and mercury vapor poisoning (Vroom and Greer, 1972; Warkany and Hubbard, 1953); and (h) toe walking among less severely poisoned children in the Minamata epidemic (Minamata Disease, 1973). In animal studies, cats exposed to mercury by eating fish developed circling movements (Snyder, 1972), and subcutaneous administration of methylmercury to rats during postnatal development has resulted in postural disorders (O'Kusky et al, 1988). As summarized in Table V, movement similarities in autism and Hg poisoning are clear. Table V: Summary of Motor Disorder Behaviors in Mercury Poisoning Autism Mercury Poisoning Autism Involuntary jerking movements, e.g., arm flapping, ankle jerks, myoclonal jerks; choreiform shaking; muscular spasticity Stereotyped movements such as arm flapping, jumping, circling, spinning, rocking; myoclonal jerks; choreiform movements Unsteadiness in handwriting or an inability to hold a pen; deficits in eye-hand coordination; limb apraxia; intention tremors; loss of fine motor skills Difficulty in writing with or holding a pen; poor eye-hand coordination; limb apraxia; problems carrying out intentional movements (praxia) Ataxia: gait impairment; severity ranging from mild incoordination, clumsiness to complete inability to walk, stand, or sit; staggering, stumbling; loss of motor control Abnormal gait and posture, clumsiness and incoordination; difficulties sitting, lying, crawling, and walking in infants and toddlers Toe walking Toe walking Difficulty in chewing or swallowing Difficulty chewing or swallowing Unusual postures Unusual postures Areflexia None described Tremors in general, tremors of the face and tongue, hand tremors None described e. Cognition/Mental Function Nearly all autistic individuals show impairment in some aspects of mental function, even as other cognitive abilities remain intact. Most individuals may test in the retarded range, while others have normal to above average IQs. These characteristics are true in mercurialism. Moreover, the specific areas of impairment are similar in the two disorders. The impaired areas in autism are generally in (a) short term or working memory and auditory and verbal memory; (b) concentration and attention, particularly attention shifting; (c) visual motor and perceptual motor skills, including eye-hand coordination; (d) language/verbal expression and comprehension; and (e) using visually presented information when constraints are placed on processing time. Relatively unimpaired areas include rote memory skills, pattern recognition, matching, perceptual organization, and stimuli discrimination. Higher level mental skills requiring complex processing are typically deficient; these include (a) processing and filtering of multiple stimuli; (b) following multiple step commands; (c) sequencing, planning and organizing; and (d) abstract/conceptual thinking and symbolic understanding (Rumsey Hamburger, 1988; Plioplys, 1995; Sigman et al, 1987). Younger or more mentally impaired children may have difficulties with symbolic play and understanding object permanence or the mental state of others (Bailey et al, 1996). Some autistic children are hyperlexic, showing superior decoding skills while lacking comprehension of the words being read (Prizant, 1996). As mentioned before, for most autistic individuals verbal IQ is lower than performance IQ. As in autism, Hg exposure causes some level of impairment primarily in (a) short term memory and auditory and verbal memory; (b) concentration and attention, including response inhibition; (c) visual motor and perceptual motor skills, including eye-hand coordination; (d) language/verbal expression and comprehension; and (e) simple reaction time. Hg-affected individuals may present as forgetful or confused. Performance IQ may be higher than verbal IQ. Degeneration of higher mental powers has resulted in (a) difficulty carrying out complex commands; (b) impairment in abstract and symbolic thinking; and (c) deficits in constructional skills and conceptual abstraction. One study mentions alexia, the inability to comprehend the meaning of words, although reading of the words is intact (Yeates Mortensen, 1994; O'Carroll et al, 1995; Pierce et al, 1972; Snyder, 1972; Adams et al, 1983; Kark et al, 1971; Amin-Zaki, 1974 and 1979; Davis et al, 1994; Grandjean et al, 1984; Vroom and Greer, 1972). Even children exposed prenatally to safe levels of methylmercury show lower scores on selective subtests of cognition, especially in the domains of memory and attention, relative to unexposed controls (Grandjean et al, 1998). In exposed juvenile monkeys, tests have revealed delays in the development of object permanence, or the ability to conceptualize the existence of a hidden object (Rice, 1996). Research on mental retardation in autism is contradictory (Schuler, 1995). The finding that mental retardation or borderline intelligence often co-exists with autism (Filipek et al, 1999) is based on using standard measures of intelligence (Gillberg Coleman, 1992, p.32; Bryson, 1996); other intelligence tests, designed to circumvent the language and attentional deficits of autistic children, show significantly higher intelligence test scores (Koegel et al, 1997; Russell et al, 1999). One study using such a modified rating instrument has found 20% of autistic children to be mentally retarded (Edelson et al, 1998), rather than the 70%-80% so scored on standard tests. ASD individuals also show strikingly uneven scores on IQ subtests, unlike other disorders involving mental retardation, in which subtest scores seem to be more or less even (Bailey et al, 1996). Also unlike typical cases of mental retardation, which is nearly always noted in the peri- or neonatal periods, most parents of ASD children report infants of seemingly normal appearance and development who were later characterized as mentally retarded on tests. For example, one study compared early developmental aberrations in mentally retarded children with and without autism. Findings indicated that, whereas nearly all parents of the non-autistic mentally retarded study group were aware of their child's impairment by age 3 months, nearly all parents of the autistic children failed to notice any developmental delays or issues until after 12 months of age (Baranek, 1999). Finally, there are several case reports of autistic adults who were labeled mentally retarded as children based on tests, who later emerged from their autism and had normal IQs (ARI Newsletter, 1993, review). As in autism, symptomatic mercury-poisoned victims can present with normal IQs, borderline intelligence, or mental retardation; some may be so impaired as to be untestable (Vroom and Greer, 1972; Davis et al, 1994). When lowered intelligence is found, it is always reported as an obvious deterioration among previously normally functioning people; this includes children exposed as infants or toddlers (Dale, 1972; Vroom and Greer, 1972; Amin-Zaki, 1978). Once the Hg-exposure source is removed, many (although not all) of these patients recover their normal IQ, suggesting that real IQ was not affected (Vroom and Greer, 1972; Davis et al, 1994). Infant monkeys given low doses of Hg, while clearly impaired in visual, auditory, and sensory functions, had intact central processing speed, which has been shown to correlate with IQ in humans (Rice, 1997).

Behaviors Autism is associated with difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep; hyperactivity and other ADHD traits; and self injurious behavior such as head banging, even in the absence of mental retardation. Agitation, screaming, crying, staring spells, stereotypical behaviors, and grimacing are common Kanner (1943) made a point of noting excessive and open masturbation in two of the eleven young children comprising his initial cases. Feeding and suckling problems are typical (Wing, 1980), and restricted diets and narrow food preferences are the rule rather than the exception (Gillberg and Coleman, 1992; Clark et al, 1993); some autistics show a preference for salty foods (Shattock, 1997). Kanner, in his 1943 article, noted feeding problems from infancy, including vomiting and a refusal to eat, in six of the eleven autistic children he described. There are case studies of anorexia nervosa occurring in ASD patients, as well as an increased likelihood of this eating disorder in families with ASD (Gillberg Coleman, 1992, p.99). Humans and animals exposed to mercury develop unusual, abnormal, and inappropriate behaviors (Florentine and Sanfilippo, 1991). Rats exposed to mercury during gestation have exhibited stereotyped sniffing (Cuomo et al, 1984) and hyperactivity (Fredriksson et al, 1996). Restlessness has already been noted, and Davis et al (1994) found poor response inhibition in their human subjects; both of these behaviors are closely associated with ADHD in children. Babies and children with Hg poisoning exhibit agitation, crying for no observable reason, grimacing, and insomnia (Pierce et al, 1972; Snyder, 1972; Sanfilippo, 1991; Aronow and Fleischmann, 1976). An 18 month old toddler with otitis media, exposed to thimerosal in ear drops, had staring spells and unprovoked screaming episodes (Rohyans et al, 1984). Symptoms of acrodynia in babies and toddlers include continuous crying, anorexia and insomnia (Matheson et al, 1980; Aronow and Fleischmann, 1976). These children were said to bang their heads, have difficulty falling asleep, be irritable, and either refuse to eat or only eat a few foods (Neville Recollection, Pink Disease Support Group Site; Farnesworth, 1997). The frequent temper tantrums of a previously normal 12 year old, poisoned by mercury vapor, included hitting herself on the head and screaming; furthermore, she had extreme genital burning and was observed to masturbate even in front of others (Fagala and Wigg, 1992). Similarly, priapism, persistent erection of the penis due to a pathologic condition resulting in pain and tenderness, has been noted in boys with mercury poisoning (Amin-Zaki et al, 1978). Adults with mercury poisoning present with insomnia, agitation, and poor appetite (Tuthill, 1899; Adams et al, 1983; Fagala and Wigg, 1992). Relative to controls, more adults who had acrodynia in childhood have eating idiosyncrasies, particularly a preference for salty foods to sweet ones (Farnesworth, 1997), possibly because mercury causes excessive sodium excretion, as shown in studies of dental amalgam placed in monkeys and sheep (Lorscheider et al, 1995).

Vision In autism, one of the earliest signs detected by mothers is a lack of eye contact (Gillberg Coleman, 1992), and an early diagnostic behavior is failure to engage in joint attention based on the ability to look where you are pointing (CHAT, Baron-Cohen et al, 1992). Of 11 autistic children studied, ten had inaccurate or slow visual saccades (Rosenhall et al, 1988). Although some adults with ASD report exceptional visual acuity, visual problems are common, with two separate studies reporting 50% of ASD subjects having some type of unusual visual impairment (Steffenburg, in Gillberg Coleman, 1992). Ritvo et al (1986) and Creel et al (1989) found decreased function of the rods in a study of autistic people, including a retinal sheen, and noted that many such individuals tend to use peripheral vision because of this. A number of case reports describe over-sensitivity to light and blurred vision (Sperry, 1998; Gillberg & Coleman, 1992, p.29; O'Neill & Jones, 1997). Mercury can lead to a variety of vision problems, especially in children (Pierce et al, 1972; Snyder, 1972). Children who ate high doses of mercury from contaminated pork developed blindness (Snyder, 1972). In Iraqi babies exposed prenatally there was blindness or impaired vision (Amin-Zaki, 1974 and 1979). Iraqi children exposed postnatally developed visual disturbances, which ranged from blurred or hazy vision to constriction of the visual fields to complete blindness (Amin-Zaki et al, 1978). Two girls with mercury vapor poisoning were found to have visual field defects (Snyder, 1972), and, as previously noted, one child with Hg poisoning developed gaze avoidance (Fagala Wigg, 1992). Acrodynia sufferers report vision problems, including near-sightedness and light sensitivity or photophobia (Diner and Brenner, 1998; Neville Recollection, Pink Disease site; Farnesworth, 1997; Matheson et al, 1980; Aronow and Fleischmann, 1976). A 25 year old man with elemental mercury poisoning exhibited decreased visual acuity, difficulty with visual fixation, and constricted visual fields (Kark et al, 1971). In Japanese victims, there was blurred vision as well as constriction of visual fields (Snyder, 1972; Tokuomi et al, 1982). Iraqi mothers exposed to Hg had visual disturbance (Amin-Zaki, 1979). In dogs exposed to daily doses of methylmercury, distortion of the visual evoked response from the visual cortex was the first sign. Damage occurred in the preclinical silent stage, demonstrating that CNS damage is occurring before overt symptoms appear (Mattsson et al, 1981). Monkeys treated at birth with low level methylmercury exhibited impaired spatial vision and visual acuity at age 3 and 4 years (Rice and Gilbert, 1982). Disturbances caused by methylmercury in rat optic nerves were observed (Kinoshita et al, 1999). Table VIII: Summary of Visual Impairments Seen in Mercury Poisoning Autism Mercury Poisoning Autism Lack of eye contact; difficulties with visual fixation Lack of eye contact; gaze abnormalities; problems in joint attention Visual impairments, blindness, near-sightedness, decreased visual acuity Visual impairments ; inaccurate or slow saccades; decreased functioning of the rods; retinal sheen Light sensitivity, photophobia Over-sensitivity to light Blurred or hazy vision Blurred vision Constricted visual fields Not described h. Physical Presentations There is a much higher rate of autism among children with cerebral palsy than would be expected by chance (Nordin and Gillberg, 1996). Many autistic children have abnormal muscle tone including hyper- and hypotonia, and many are incontinent or have difficulty being toilet trained (Filipek et al, 1999; Church and Coplan, 1995). Several of the infants which Teitelbaum and colleagues (1998) observed showed decreased arm strength, and Schuler (1995) describes greater muscle weakness in the upper than the lower body. Impairments in oral-motor function, including problems chewing and swallowing, are common, as noted previously. These impairments are seen in mercurialism as well. In the Iraqi and Japanese epidemics, many children developed clinical cerebral palsy (Amin-Zaki, 1979; Myers & Davidson, 1998; Gilbert & Grant-Webster 1995; Dale, 1972). Amin-Zaki et al (1978) reported muscle wasting and lack of motor power and control in most cases, complete paralysis in several cases, and athetotic movements in 2 cases, of postnatally exposed children. In the Iraqi babies and children, some had increased muscle tone, while others had decreased muscle tone. Abnormal reflexes, spasticity, and weakness were common. One child said my hands are weak and do not obey me (Amin-Zaki et al, 1974 and 1978). The 12 year old who inhaled mercury vapor exhibited weakness and decreased muscle strength (Fagala and Wigg, 1992). As in autism, muscle weakness from mercury poisoning is most prominent in the upper body (Adams et al, 1983). Acrodynia, for example, is marked by poor muscle tone in general and loss of arm strength in particular (Farnesworth, 1997). Finally, difficulty in chewing and swallowing, salivation, and drooling are common in children as well as adults; incontinence was observed in children in the Iraqi Hg-crisis (Amin-Zaki, 1974 and 1978; Pierce et al, 1972; Snyder, 1972; Joselow et al, 1972; Smith, 1977). The presence of rashes and dermatitis is sometimes reported in descriptions of ASD subjects. Whiteley et al (1998) found that 63% of the ASD children had a history of eczema or other skin complaints. Some children with autism are frequent scratchers. Gentle rubbing and scratching can become a calming self-stimulation; but when it becomes clawing, and there are rashes and open scrapes on the skin, a tactile intolerance can be responsible (O'Neill, 1999). Rashes and itching are common disturbances in mercury toxicity as well (Kark et al, 1971). A 4 year old with Hg poisoning developed an itchy, peeling rash on the extremities (Florentine and Sanfilippo, 1991). Mercury vapor inhalation caused a rash and peeling on the palms and soles of a pre-adolescent (Fagala and Wigg, 1992). An acrodynia victim described himself as a child as having severe itching and a constant burning sensation at the extremities, resulting in him rubbing his hands and feet raw (Neville Recollection, Pink Disease Support Group). Acrodynia symptoms in an adult poisoned by ethylmercury injection included pink scaling palms and soles, flushed cheeks, and itching (Matheson et al, 1980). In acrodynia the skin may be rough and dry, and the soles and palms are usually but not necessarily red (Aronow and Fleischmann, 1976). Thimerosal ingested by 44 year old man led to dermatitis (Pfab et al, 1996). In autism, signs of autonomic disturbance may be noticed at times, including sweating, irregular breathing, and rapid pulse (Wing and Attwood, 1987). There may be elevated blood flow and heart rate (Ornitz, 1987). An increased incidence of acrocyanosis has been observed in Asperger's syndrome. Acrocyanosis is an uncommon disorder of poor circulation in which skin on the hands and feet turn red and blue; there is profuse sweating; and the fingers and toes are persistently cold (Carpenter and Morris, 1991). Sweating and circulatory abnormalities are also common in some forms of mercury poisoning. Acrodynia in adults and children results in excessive sweating, poor circulation, and rapid heart rate (Farnesworth, 1997; Matheson et al, 1980; Cloarec et al, 1995; Warkany and Hubbard, 1953). The 12 year old with mercury vapor poisoning sweated profusely, especially at night (Fagala and Wigg, 1992), and elevated blood pressure has been reported in exposed workers (Vroom and Greer, 1972). Autonomic system abnormalities can be caused by disturbances in acetylcholine levels, known to be deficient in both autism and Hg poisoning (see neurotransmitter section below). Table IX: Physical Disturbances in Mercury Poisoning Autism Mercury Poisoning Autism Increase in cerebral palsy; hyper- or hypotonia; paralysis, abnormal reflexes; spasticity; decreased muscle strength and motor power, especially in the upper body; incontinence; problems chewing, swallowing, and salivating Increase in cerebral palsy; hyper- or hypotonia; decreased muscle strength, especially in the upper body; incontinence/toilet training difficulties; problems chewing and swallowing Autonomic sweating abnormalities; poor circulation; elevated heart rate j. Gastrointestinal Function Many if not most autistic individuals have gastrointestinal problems, the most common complaints being chronic diarrhea, constipation, gaseousness, and abdominal discomfort and distention (D'Eufemia et al, 1996; Horvath et al, 1999; Whitely et al, 1998). Colitis is not uncommon (Wakefield et al, 1998). As noted previously, anorexia is sometimes associated with ASD (Gillberg Coleman, 1992). Kanner noted that over half his initial cases had feeding difficulties and excessive vomiting as infants (1943). O'Reilly and Waring (1993) have described sulfur deficiencies in autism, an effect of which can be clumping of proteins on the gut wall, which is lined with sulfated proteins. The clumping can lead to increased intestinal permeability, or leaky gut syndrome (Shattock, 1997), found in many autistic individuals (D'Eufemia, 1996). Some ASD individuals have unusual opioid peptide fragments in urine; these peptides are believed to enter the bloodstream due to a leaky gut and to result from an incomplete breakdown of gluten and casein in the diet possibly arising from inadequacy of the [endopeptidase] enzyme systems which are responsible for their breakdown (Shattock, 1997). Mercury, which binds to sulfur groups (Clarkson, 1992), is known to cause gastroenteritis (Kark et al, 1971). For example, a four year old with diarrhea was initially diagnosed with gastroenteritis (Florentine and Sanfilippo, 1991). A pre-adolescent with mercury vapor poisoning developed nausea, abdominal pain, poor appetite, rectal itching, and diarrhea; she frequently strained to have a bowel movement, and was at one point diagnosed with colitis (Fagala and Wigg, 1992). Acrodynia is marked by both constipation and diarrhea (Diner and Brenner, 1998). Incontinence of urine and stool are observed in infants and children exposed pre- and postnatally in Iraq (Amin-Zaki, 1974 and 1978). In another case, a 28 year old woman with occupational exposure to mercury vapor developed watery stools (Ross et al, 1977). Diarrhea and digestive disturbance were seen in a dentist with measurable mercury levels; there was obesity in another dentist (Smith, 1977). A 44 year old man poisoned with thimerosal given intramuscularly developed gastrointestinal bleeding, which looked like hemorrhaging colitis (Lowell et al, 1996). Intense exposure to mercury vapor can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting (Feldman, 1982). Severe constipation, anorexia, weight loss, and other disturbances of gastrointestinal function have been noted in other cases (Adams et al, 1983; Joselow et al, 1972). Rats tested with mercuric chloride were observed with lesions of the ileum and colon with abnormal deposits of IgA in the basement membranes of the intestinal glands and of IgG in the basement membranes of the lamina propria (Andres, 1984, reviewed in EPA, 1997, p.3-36). In another rat experiment, Hg was found to increase the permeability of intestinal epithelial tissues (Watzl et al, 1999). Mercury also inhibits the peptidase - dipeptidyl peptidase IV - which cleaves, among other substances, casomorphin during the digestive process (Puschel et al, 1982). There is no reported increase in incidence in kidney problems in autism. Although renal function is commonly impaired from Hg exposure, such impairment would not be expected if the mercury exposure occurred from thimerosal injections, since kidney function may be unaffected when mercury is injected or inhaled (Davis et al, 1994; Fagala and Wigg, 1992). For example, although thimerosal ingested orally by a 44 year old man resulted in renal tubular failure and gingivitis (Pfab et al, 1996), renal function was normal in another 44 year old man injected intramuscularly with thimerosal (Lowell et al, 1996).

COMPARISON OF BIOLOGICAL ABNORMALITIES Like the similarities seen in observable symptoms, parallels between autism and mercury poisoning clearly exist even at cellular and subcellular levels. These similarities are summarized in tables after each individual section. a. Biochemistry Sulfur: Studies of autistic children with known chemical or food intolerances show a low capacity to oxidize sulfur compounds and low levels of sulfate (O'Reilly Waring, 1993; Alberti et al, 1999). These findings were interpreted as suggesting that there may be a fault either in the manufacture of sulfate or that sulfate is being used up dramatically on an unknown toxic substance these children may be producing (O'Reilly and Waring, 1993). Alternatively, these observations may be linked to mercury, since mercury preferentially forms compounds with molecules rich in sulfhydryl groups (--SH), such as cysteine and glutathione, making them unavailable for normal cellular and enzymatic functions (Clarkson, 1992). Relatedly, mercury may cause low sulfate by its ability to irreversibly inhibit the sulfate transporter Na-Si cotransporter NaSi-1 present in kidneys and intestines, thus preventing sulfate absorption (Markovitch and Knight, 1998). Among the sulfhydryl groups, or thiols, mercury has special affinity for purines and pyrimidines, as well as other subcellular substances (Clarkson, 1992; Koos and Longo, 1976). Errors in purine or pyrimidine metabolism are known to result in classical autism or autistic features in some cases (Gillberg and Coleman, 1992, p.209; Page et al, 1997; Page & Coleman, 2000; The Purine Research Society), thereby suggesting that mercury's disruption of this pathway might also lead to autistic traits. Likewise, yeast strains sensitive to Hg are those which have innately low levels of tyrosine synthesis. Mercury can deplete cellular tyrosine by binding to the SH-groups of the tyrosine uptake system, preventing colony growth (Ono et al, 1987), and Hg-depleted tyrosine would be particularly significant in cells known to accumulate mercury (e.g., neurons of the CNS, see below). Similarly, disruptions in tyrosine production in hepatic cells, arising from a genetic condition called Phenylketonuria (PKU), also results in autism (Gillberg Coleman, 1992, p.203). Glutathione: Glutathione is one of the primary means through which the cells detoxify heavy metals (Fuchs et al, 1997), and glutathione in the liver is a primary substrate by which body clearance of organic mercury takes place (Clarkson, 1992). Mercury, by preferentially binding with glutathione and/or preventing absorption of sulfate, reduces glutathione bioavailability. Many autistic subjects have low levels of glutathione. O'Reilly and Waring (1993) suggest this is due to an exotoxin binding glutathione so it is unavailable for normal biological processes. Edelson and Cantor (1998) have found a decreased ability of the liver in autistic subjects to detoxify heavy metals. Alternatively, low glutathione can be a manifestation of chronic infection (Aukrust et al, 1996, 1995; Jaffe et al, 1993), and infection-induced glutathione deficiency would be more likely in the presence of immune impairments derived from mercury (Shenkar et al, 1998). Glutathione peroxidase activities were reported to be abnormal in the erythrocytes of autistic children (Golse et al, 1978). Mercury generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cells, which increases ROS scavenger enzyme content and thus glutathione, to relieve oxidative stress (Hussain et al, 1999). At high enough levels, mercury depletes rat hepatocytes of glutathione (GSH) and causes significant reduction in and glutathione reductase (Ashour et al, 1993). Mitochondria: Disturbances of brain energy metabolism have prompted autism to be hypothesized as a mitochondrial disorder (Lombard, 1998). There is a frequent association of lactic acidosis and carnitine deficiency in autistic patients, which suggests excessive nitric oxide production in mitochondria (Lombard, 1998; Chugani et al, 1999), and again, mercury may be a participant. Methylmercury accumulates in mitochondria, where it inhibits several mitochondrial enzymes, reduces ATP production and Ca2+ 1998). Neurons have increased numbers of mitochondria (Fuchs et al, 1997), and since Hg accumulates in neurons of the CNS, an Hg effect upon neuronal mitochondria function seems likely - especially in children having substandard mercury detoxification. Table XI: Abnormalities in Biochemistry Arising from Hg Exposure Present in Autism Mercury Poisoning Autism Ties up sulfur groups; prevents sulfate absorption Low sulfate levels Has special affinity for purines and pyrimidines Errors in purine and pyrimidine metabolism can lead to autistic features Depletes cellular tyrosine in yeast PKU, arising from disruption in tyrosine production, results in autism Reduces bioavailability of glutathione, necessary in cells and liver for heavy metal detoxification Low levels of glutathione; decreased ability of liver to detoxify heavy metals Can cause significant reduction in glutathione peroxidase mitochondrial activities, especially in brain Mitochondrial dysfunction, especially in brain b. Immune System A variety of immune alterations are found in autism-spectrum children (Singh et al, 1993; Gupta et al, 1996; Warren et al, 1986 & 1996; Plioplys et al, 1994), and these appear to be etiologically significant in a variety of ways, ranging from autoimmunity to infections and vaccination responses (e.g., Fudenberg, 1996; Stubbs, 1976). Mercury's effects upon immune cell function are well documented and may be due in part to the ability of Hg to reduce the bioavailability of sulfur compounds: It has been known for a long time that thiols are required for optimal primary in vitro antibody response, cytotoxicity, and proliferative response to T-cell mitogens of murine lymphoid cultures. Glutathione and cysteine are essential components of lymphocyte activation, and their depletion may result in lymphocyte dysfunction. Decreasing glutathione levels profoundly affects early signal transduction events in human T-cells (Fuchs Sch fer, 1997). Allergy, asthma, and arthritis: Individuals with autism are more likely to have allergies and asthma, and autism occurs at a higher than expected rate in families with a history of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and hypothyroidism (Comi and Zimmerman, 1999; Whitely et al, 1998). Relative to the general population, prevalence of selective IgA deficiency has been found in autism (Warren et al); individuals with selective IgA deficiency are more prone to allergies and autoimmunity (Gupta et al, 1996). Furthermore, lymphocyte subsets of autistic subjects show enhanced expression of HLA-DR antigens and an absence of interleuken-2 receptors, and these findings are associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (Warren et al). These observations suggest autoimmune processes are present in ASD (Plioplys, 1989; Warren et al); and this possibility is reinforced by Singh's findings of elevated antibodies against myelin-basic protein (Singh et al, 1993). Atypical responses to mercury have been ascribed to allergic or autoimmune reactions (Gosselin et al, 1984; Fournier et al, 1988), and a genetic predisposition for Hg reaction may explain why sensitivity to this metal varies so widely by individual (Rohyans et al, 1984; Nielsen & Hultman, 1999). Acrodynia can present as a hypersensitivity reaction (Pfab et al, 1996), or it may arise from immune over-reactivity, and children who incline to allergic reactions have an increased tendency to develop acrodynia (Warkany Hubbard, 1953). Those with acrodynia are also more likely to suffer from asthma, to have poor immune system function (Farnesworth, 1997), and to experience intense joint pains suggestive of rheumatism (Clarkson, 1997). Methylmercury has altered thyroid function in rats (Kabuto, 1991). Rheumatoid arthritis with joint pain has been observed as a familial trait in autism (Zimmerman et al, 1993). A subset of autistic subjects had a higher rate of strep throat and elevated levels of B lymphocyte antigen D8/17, which has expanded expression in rheumatic fever and may be implicated in obsessive-compulsive behaviors (DelGiudice-Asch Hollander, 1997). Mercury exposure frequently results in rheumatoid-like symptoms. Iraqi mothers and children developed muscle and joint pain (Amin-Zaki, 1979), and acrodynia is marked by joint pain (Farnesworth, 1997). Sore throat is occasionally a presenting sign in mercury poisoning (Vroom and Greer, 1972). A 12 year old with mercury vapor poisoning, for example, had joint pains as well as a sore throat; she was positive on a streptozyme test, and a diagnosis of rheumatic fever was made; she improved on penicillin (Fagala and Wigg, 1992). Acrodynia, which is almost never seen in adults, was also observed in a 20 year old male with a history of sensitivity reactions and rheumatoid-like arthritis, who received ethylmercury via injection in gammaglobulin (Matheson et al, 1980). One effective chelating agent, penicillamine, is also effective for rheumatoid arthritis (Florentine and Sanfilippo, 1991). Mercury can induce an autoimmune response in mice and rats, and the response is both dose-dependent and genetically determined. Mice genetically prone to develop spontaneous autoimmune diseases [are] highly susceptible to mercury-induced immunopathological alterations (al-Balaghi, 1996). The autoimmune response depends on the H-2 haplotype: if the strain of mice does not have the susceptibility haplotype, there is no autoimmune response; the most sensitive strains show elevated antibody titres at the lowest dose; and the less susceptible strain responds only at a medium dose (Nielsen Hultman, 1999). Interestingly, Hu et al (1997) were able to induce a high proliferative response in lymphocytes from even low responder mouse strains by washing away excess mercury after pre-treatment, while chronic exposure to mercury induced a response only in high-responder strains. Autoimmunity and neuronal proteins: Based upon research and clinical findings, Singh has been suggesting for some time an autoimmune component in autism (Singh, Fudenberg et al, 1988). The presence of elevated serum IgG may suggest the presence of persistent antigenic stimulation (Gupta et al, 1996). Connolly and colleagues (1999) report higher rates in autistic vs. control groups of elevated antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers, as well as presence of IgG and IgM antibodies to brain endothelial cells. On the one hand, since mercury remains in the brain for years after exposure, autism's persistent symptoms may be due to an on-going autoimmune response to mercury remaining in the brain; on the other hand, activation and continuation of an autoimmune response does not require the continuous presence of mercury ions: in fact, once induced, autoimmune processes in the CNS might remain exacerbated because removal of mercury after an initial exposure can induce a greater proliferative response in lymphocytes than can persistent Hg exposure (Hu et al, 1997). In sera of male workers exposed to mercury, autoantibodies (primarily IgG) to neuronal cytoskeletal proteins, neurofilaments (NFs), and myelin basic protein (MBP) were prevalent. These findings were confirmed in rats and mice, and there were significant correlations between IgG titers and subclinical deficits in sensorimotor function. These findings suggest that peripheral autoantibodies to neuronal proteins are predictive of neurotoxicity, since histopathological findings were associated with CNS and PNS damage. There was also evidence of astrogliosis (indicative of neuronal CNS damage) and the presence of IgG concentrated along the bbb (El-Fawal et al, 1999). Autoimmune response to mercury has also been shown by the transient presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and antinucleolar antibodies (ANolA) (Nielsen Hultman, 1999; Hu et al, 1997; and Wigg, 1992). A high incidence of anti-cerebellar immunoreactivity which was both IgG and IgM in nature has been found in autism, and there is a higher frequency of circulating antibodies directed against neuronal antigens in autism as compared to controls (Plioplys, 1989; Connolly et al, 1999). Furthermore, Singh and colleagues have found that 50% to 60% of autistic subjects tested positive for the myelin basic protein antibodies (1993) and have hypothesized that autoimmune responses are related to an increase in select cytokines and to elevated serotonin levels in the blood (Singh, 1996; Singh, 1997). Weitzman et al (1982) have also found evidence of reactivity to MBP in autistic subjects but none in controls. Since anti-cerebellar antibodies have been detected in autistic blood samples, ongoing damage may arise as these antibodies find and react with neural antigens, thus creating autoimmune processes possibly producing symptoms such as ataxia and tremor. Relatedly, the cellular damage to Purkinje and granule cells noted in autism (see below) may be mediated or exacerbated by antibodies formed in response to neuronal injury (Zimmerman et al, 1993). T-cells, monocytes, and natural killer cells: Many autistics have skewed immune-cell subsets and abnormal T-cell function, including decreased responses to T-cell mitogins (Warren et al, 1986; Gupta et al, 1996). One recent study reported increased neopterin levels in urine of autistic children, indicating activation of the cellular immune system (Messahel et al, 1998). Workers exposed to Hgo exhibit diminished capacity to produce the cytokines TNF (alpha) and IL-1 released by monocytes and macrophages (Shenkar et al, 1998). Both high dose and chronic low-level mercury exposure kills lymphocytes, T-cells, and monocytes in humans. This occurs by apoptosis due to perturbation of mitochondrial dysfunction. At low, chronic doses, the depressed immune function may appear asymptomatic, without overt signs of immunotoxicity. Methylmercury exposure would be especially harmful in individuals with already suppressed immune systems (Shenker et al, 1998). Mercury increases cytosolic free calcium levels [Ca2+]i in T lymphocytes, and can cause membrane damage at longer incubation times (Tan et al, 1993). Hg has also been found to cause chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes, even at concentrations below those causing overt poisoning (Shenkar et al, 1998; Joselow et al, 1972), and to inhibit rodent lymphocyte proliferation and function in vitro. Depending on genetic predisposition, mercury causes activation of the immune system, especially Th2 subsets, in susceptible mouse strains (Johansson et al, 1998; Bagenstose et al, 1999; Hu et al, 1999). Many autistic children have an immune portrait shifted in the Th2 direction and have abnormal CD4/CD8 ratios (Gupta et al, 1998; Plioplys, 1989). This may contribute to the fact that many ASD children have persistent or recurrent fungal infections (Romani, 1999). Many autistic children have reduced natural killer cell function (Warren et al, 1987; Gupta et al, 1996), and many have a sulfation deficiency (Alberti, 1999). Mercury reduces --SH group/sulfate availability, and this has immunological ramifications. As noted previously, decreased levels of glutathione, observed in autistic and mercury poisoned populations, are associated with impaired immunity (Aukrust et al, 1995 and 1996; Fuchs and Sch\"fer, 1997). Decreases in NK T-cell activity have in fact been detected in animals after methylmercury exposure (Ilback, 1991). Singh detected elevated IL-12 and IFNg in the plasma of autistic subjects (1996). Chronic mercury exposure induces IFNg and IL-2 production in mice, while intermittent presence of mercury suppresses IFNg and enhances IL-4 production (Hu et al, 1997). Interferon gamma (IFNg) is crucial to many immune processes and is released by T lymphocytes and NK cells, for example, in response to chemical mitogens and infection; sulfate participates in IFNg release, and the effector phase of cytotoxic T-cell response and IL-2-dependent functions is inhibited by even a partial depletion of the intracellular glutathione pool (Fuchs Sch fer, 1997). A mercury-induced sulfation problem might, therefore, impair responses to viral (and other) infections - via disrupting cell-mediated immunity as well as by impairing NK function (Benito et al, 1998). In animals, Hg exposure has led to decreases in production of antibody-producing cells and in antibody titres in response to inoculation with immune-stimulating agents (EPA, 1997, review, p.3-84). Table XII: Summary of Immune System Abnormalities in Mercury Exposure Autism Mercury Poisoning Autism Individual sensitivity due to allergic or autoimmune reactions; sensitive individuals more likely to have allergies and asthma, autoimmune-like symptoms, especially rheumatoid-like ones More likely to have allergies and asthma; familial presence of autoimmune diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis; IgA deficiencies Can produce an immune response, even at low levels; can remain in CNS for years Indications of on-going immune response in CNS Presence of autoantibodies AnolA of autoantibodies (IgG and IgM) to cerebellar cells, myelin basis protein Causes overproduction of Th2 subset; diminishes capacity to produce TNF(alpha) IL-2 production Skewed immune-cell subset in the Th2 and CD4/CD8 IL-12 c. CNS Structure Autism is primarily a neurological disorder (Minshew, 1996), and mercury preferentially targets nerve cells and nerve fibers (Koos and Longo, 1976). Experimentally, primates have the highest levels in the brain relative to other organs (Clarkson, 1992). Methylmercury easily crosses the blood-brain barrier by binding with cysteine to form a molecule that is nearly identical to methionine. This molecule - methylmercury cysteine - is transported on the Large Neutral Amino Acid across the bbb (Clarkson, 1992). Once in the CNS, organic mercury is converted to the inorganic form (Vahter et al, 1994). Inorganic mercury is unable to cross back out of the bbb (Pedersen et al, 1999) and is more likely than the organic form to induce an autoimmune response (Hultman and Hansson-Georgiadis, 1999). Furthermore, although most cells respond to mercurial injury by modulating levels of glutathione, metallothionein, hemoxygenase, and other stress proteins, with few exceptions, neurons appear to be markedly deficient in these responses and thus more prone to injury and less able to remove the metal (Sarafian et al, 1996). While damage has been observed in a number of brain areas in autism, many functions are spared (Dawson, 1996). In mercury exposure, damage is also selective (Ikeda et al, 1999; Clarkson, 1992), and the list of Hg-affected areas is remarkably similar to the neuroanatomy of autism. Cerebellum, Cerebral Cortex, Brainstem: Autopsy studies of carefully selected autistic individuals revealed cellular changes in cerebellar Purkinje and granule cells (Bauman and Kemper, 1988; Ritvo et al, 1986). MRI studies by Courchesne and colleagues (1988; reviewed in ARI Newslett, 1994) described cerebellar defects in autistic subjects, including smaller vermal lobules VI and VII and volume loss in the parietal lobes. The defects were present independently of IQ. No other part of the nervous system has been shown to be so consistently abnormal in autism. Courchesne (1989) notes that the only neurobiological abnormality known to precede the onset of autistic symptomatology is Purkinje neuron loss in the cerebellum. Piven found abnormalities in the cerebral cortex in seven of 13 high-functioning autistic adults using MRI (1990). Although more recent studies have called attention to amygdaloid and temporal lobe irregularities in autism (see below), and cerebellar defects have not been found in all ASD subjects studied (Bailey et al, 1996), the fact remains that many and perhaps most autistic children have structural irregularities within the cerebellum. Mercury can induce cellular degeneration within the cerebral cortex and leads to similar processes within granule and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum Magos et al, 1985). Furthermore, cerebellar damage is implicated in alterations of coordination, balance, tremors, and sensations (Davis et al, 1994; Tokuomi et al, 1982), and these findings are consistent with Hg-induced disruption in cerebellar synaptic transmission between parallel fibers or climbing fibers and Purkinje cells (Yuan Atchison, 1999). MRI studies have documented Hg-effects within visual and sensory cortices, and these findings too are consistent with the observed sensory impairments in victims of mercury poisoning (Clarkson, 1992; Tokuomi et al, 1982). Acrodynia, a syndrome with symptoms similar to autistic traits, is considered a pathology mainly of the CNS arising from degeneration of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex (Matheson et al, 1980). In monkeys, mercury preferentially accumulated in the deepest pyramidal cells and fiber systems. Mercury causes oxidative stress in neurons. The CNS cells primarily affected are those which are unable to produce high levels of protective metallothionein and glutathione. These substances tend to inhibit lipid peroxidation and thereby suppress mercury toxicity (Fukino et al, 1984). Importantly, granule and Purkinje cells have increased risk for mercury toxicity because they produce low levels of these protective substances (Ikeda et al, 1999; Li et al, 1996). Naturally low production of glutathione, when combined with mercury's ability to deplete usable glutathione reserves, provides a mechanism whereby mercury is difficult to clear from the cerebellum -- and this is all the more significant because glutathione is a primary detoxicant in brain (Fuchs et al, 1997). Mercury's induction of cerebellar deterioration is not restricted to high-doses. doses of methylmercury cause apoptosis of developing cerebellar granule cells by antagonizing insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and increasing expression of the transcription factor c-Jun (Bulleit and Cui, 1998). Several researchers have found evidence of a brainstem defect in a subset of autistic subjects (Hashimoto et al, 1992 and 1995; McClelland et al, 1985); and MRI studies have revealed brainstem damage in a few cases of mercury poisoning (Davis et al, 1994). The peripheral polyneuropathy examined in Iraqi victims was believed to have resulted from brain stem damage (Von Burg and Rustam, 1974). Amygdala Hippocampus: Atypicalities in other brain areas are remarkably similar in ASD and mercury poisoning. Pathology affecting the temporal lobe, particularly the amygdala, hippocampus, and connected areas, is seen in autistic patients and is characterized by increased cell density and reduced neuronal size (Abell and Kemper, 1985). The basal ganglia also show lesions in some cases (Sears, 1999), including decreased blood flow (Ryu et al, 1999). Mercury can accumulate in the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as the striatum and spinal chord (Faro et al, 1998; Lorscheider et al, 1995; Larkfors et al, 1991). One study has shown that areas of hippocampal damage from Hg were those which were unable to synthesize glutathione (Li et al, 1996). A 1994 study in primates found that mercury accumulates in the hippocampus and amygdala, particularly the pyramidal cells, of adults and offspring exposed prenatally (Warfvinge et al, 1994). The documenting of temporal lobe mercury provides a direct link between autism and mercury because, as cited previously, (i) mercury alters neuronal function, and (ii) the temporal lobe, and the amygdala in particular, are strongly implicated in autism (e.g., Aylward et al, 1999; Bachevalier, 1994; et al, 1990; Warfvinge et al, 1994). Bachevalier (1996) has shown that infant monkeys with early damage to the amygdaloid complex exhibit many autistic behaviors, including social avoidance, blank expression, lack of eye contact and play posturing, and motor stereotypies. Hippocampal lesions, when combined with amygdaloid damage, increases the severity of symptoms. Also noteworthy is the fact that amygdala findings in autism and mercury literatures are paralleled in fragile X syndrome, a genetic disorder wherein many affected individuals have traits worthy of an autism diagnosis. These traits include sensory alterations, emotional lability, appetite dysregulation, social deficits, and eye-contact aversion (Hagerman). Not only are in amygdaloid function (Binstock, 1999), but neurons involved in gaze- and eye-contact-aversion have been identified within the primate temporal lobe and amygdaloid subareas (Rolls 1992, reviewed in Binstock 1995). These various findings in ASD, mercury poisoning, and fragile X suggest that amygdaloid mercury is a mechanism for inducing traits central to or associated with autism and the autism-spectrum of disorders. Neuronal Organization Head Circumference: Several autism brain studies have found evidence of increased neuronal cell replication, a lowered ratio of glia to neurons, and an increased number of glial cells (Bailey et al, 1996). Based on these and other neuropathological findings, autism can be characterized as a disorder of neuronal organization, that is, the development of the dendritic tree, synaptogenesis, and the development of the complex connectivity within and between brain regions (Minshew, 1996). Mercury can interfere with neuronal migration and depress cell division in the developing brain. Post-mortem brain tissue studies of exposed Japanese and Iraqi infants revealed abnormal neuronal cytoarchitecture characterized by ectopic cells and disorganization of cellular layers (EPA, 1997, p.3-86; Clarkson, 1997). Developmental neurtoxicity of Hg may also be due to binding of mercury to sulfhydryl-rich tubulin, a component of microtubules (Pendergrass et al, 1997). Intact microtubules are necessary for proper cell migration and cell division (EPA, review, 1997, p.32-88). Rat pups dosed postnatally with methylmercury had significant reductions in neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs), which are critical during neurodevelopment for proper synaptic structuring. Sensitivity of NCAMs to methylmercury decreased as the developmental age of the rats increased. Toxic perturbation of the developmentally-regulated expression of NCAMs during brain formation may disturb the stereotypic formation of neuronal contacts and could contribute to the behavioral and morphological disturbances observed following methylmercury poisoning (Deyab et al, 1999). Plioplys et al (1990) have found depressed expression of NCAM serum fragments in autism. Abnormalities in neuronal growth during development are implicated in head size differences found in both autism and mercury poisoning. In autism, Fombonne and colleagues (1999) have found a subset of subjects with macrocephaly and a subset with microcephaly. The circumference abnormalities were progressive, so that, while micro- and macrocephaly were present in 6% and 9% respectively of children under 5 years, among those age 10-16 years, the rates had increased to 39% and 24% respectively. Another study, by Stevenson et al (1997), had found just one subject out of 18 with macrocephaly who had this abnormality present at birth. The macrocephaly in autism is generally believed to result from increased neuronal growth or decreased neuronal pruning. The cause of microcephaly has not been investigated. The most detailed study of head size in mercury poisoning, by Amin-Zaki et al (1979), involved 32 Iraqi children exposed prenatally and followed up to age 5 years. Eight (25%) had progressive microcephaly, i.e., the condition was not present at birth. None had developed macrocephaly, at least at the time of the study. The microcephaly has been ascribed to neuronal death or apoptosis from Hg intoxication.

Neurons Neurochemicals The brains of autistic subjects show disturbances in many neurotransmitters, primarily serotonin, catecholamines, the amino acid neurotransmitters, and acetylcholine. Mercury poisoning causes disturbances in these same primarily serotonin, the catecholamines, glutamate, and acetlycholine. Serotonin: Serotonin synthesis is decreased in the brains of autistic children and increased in autistic adults, relative to age-matched controls (Chugani et al, 1999), while whole blood serotonin in platelets is elevated regardless of age (Leboyer; Cook, 1990). Autistic patients frequently respond well to SSRIs as well as Risperidone (McDougal; 1997; Zimmerman et al, 1996). Likewise, a number of animal studies have found serotonin abnormalities from mercury exposure. For example, subcutaneous administration of methylmercury to rats during postnatal development increases tissue concentration of 5-HT and HIAA in cerebral cortex (O'Kusky et al, 1988). Findings about serotonin abnormalities in mercury literature implicate interactions between mercury and intracellular calcium as well as mercury and sulfhydral groups: Many researchers have documented disruptions of intra- and extra-cellular calcium in neurons from mercury exposure (Atchison Hare, 1994), including thimerosal (Elferink, 1999), and calcium metabolism abnormalities have been identified in autism (Plioplys, 1989; Coleman, 1989). Intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ are critical for controlling gene expression in neurons and mediating neurotransmitter release from presynaptic vesicles (Sutton, McRory et 5-HT re-uptake activity and intrasynaptic concentration of 5-HT are regulated by Ca2+ in nerve terminals. Methylmercury causes a rapid, irreversible block of synaptic transmission by suppression of calcium entry into nerve terminal channels (Atchison et al, 1986). Thimerosal inhibits 5-HT transport activity in particular through interaction with intracellular sulfhydryl groups associated with Ca2+ pump ATPase (Nishio et al, 1996), for example, by modifying cysteine residues of the Ca(2+)-ATPase (Sayers et al, 1993; Thrower et al, 1996). Dopamine: Studies have found indications both of abnormally high and low levels of dopamine in autistic subjects (Gillberg Coleman, 1992, p288-9). For example, Ernst et al (1997) reported low prefrontal dopaminergic activity in ASD children, while Gillberg and Svennerholm (1987) reported high concentrations of homovanillic acid (HVA), a dopamine metabolite, in cerebro-spinal fluid of autistic children, suggesting greater dopamine synthesis. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) has been found to improve function in some autistic patients by lowering dopamine levels through enhanced DBH function (Gillberg Coleman, 1992, p289; Moreno et al, 1992; Rimland Baker, 1996). Dopamine antagonists such as haloperidol improve some antipsychotic symptoms in ASD subjects, including motor stereotypies (Lewis, 1996). Rats exposed to mercury during gestation show major alterations in synaptic dynamics of brain dopamine systems. The effects were not apparent immediately after birth but showed a delayed onset beginning at the time of weaning (Bartolome et al, 1984). A variety of mercuric compounds increase the release of [3H]dopamine, possibly by disrupting calcium homeostasis or calcium-dependent processes (McKay et al, 1986). Minnema et al (1989) found that methylmercury increases spontaneous release of [3H]dopamine from rat brain striatum mainly due to transmitter leakage caused by Hg-induced synaptosomal membrane permeability. SH groups may also be involved in the inhibition of dopamine binding in rat striatum (Bonnet et al, 1994). Pyridoxine deficiency in rats causes acrodynia, with features similar to human acrodynia (Gosselin et al, 1984). Epinephrine and norepinephrine: Studies on autistic subjects have consistently found elevated norepinephrine and epinephrine in plasma, which suggests elevated levels of these transmitters in brain, as plasma and CSF norepinephrine are closely correlated (Gillberg and Coleman, 1992, p.121-122). Recently, Hollander et al (2000) have noted improvement in function in about half of their ASD subjects with administration of venlafaxine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Mercury also disrupts norepinephrine levels by inhibiting sulfhydryl groups and thus blocking the function of O-methyltransferase, the enzyme that degrades epinephrine (Rajanna and Hobson, 1985). In acrodynia, blocking this enzyme resulted in high levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine in plasma (Cheek, Pink Disease Website). In rats, chronic exposure to low doses of methylmercury increased brain-stem norepinephrine concentration (Hrdina et al, 1976). Glutamate: It has been observed that many autistics have irregularities related to glutamate (Carlsson ML, 1998). In autism, glutamate and aspartate have been found to be significantly elevated relative to controls (Moreno et al, 1992); and in a more recent study of ASD subjects, plasma levels of glutamic acid and aspartic acid were elevated even as levels of glutamine and asparagine were low (Moreno-Fuenmayor et al, 1996). Mercury inhibits the uptake of glutamate, with consequent elevation of glutamate levels in the extracellular space (O'Carroll et al, 1995). Prenatal exposure to methylmercury of rats induced permanent disturbances in learning and memory which could be partially related to a reduced functional activity of the glutamatergic system (Cagiano et al, 1990). Thimerosal enhances extracellular free arachidonate and reduces glutamate uptake (Volterra et al, 1992). Excessive glutamate is implicated in epileptiform activities (Scheyer, 1998; Chapman et al, 1996), frequently present in both ASD and mercurialism (see below). Acetylcholine: Abnormalities in the cortical cholinergic neurotransmitter system have recently been reported in a post mortem brain study of adult autistic subjects (Perry et al, 2000). The problem was one of acetylcholine deficiency and reduced muscarinic receptor binding, which Perry suggests may reflect intrinsic neuronal loss in hippocampus due to temporal lobe epilepsy (see section below for discussions of epilepsy and ASD/Hg). Mercury alters enzyme activities (Koos and Longo, 1976, p.400), including choline acetyltransferase, which may lead to acetylcholine deficiency (Diner and Brenner, 1998), or Hg may inhibit acetylcholine release due to its effects on Ca2 homeostasis and ion channel function (EPA, 1997, p.3-79). In rats, chronic exposure to low doses of methylmercury decreased cortical acetylcholine levels (Hrdina et al, 1976). Methylmercury has also been found to increase spontaneous release of [3H]acetylcholine from rat brain hippocampus (Minnema et al, 1989) and to increase muscarinic cholinergic receptor density in both rat hippocampus and cerebellum, suggesting upregulation of these receptors in these selected brain regions (Coccini, 2000). Demyelination: Evidence of demyelination has been observed in the majority of autistic brains (Singh, 1992). This is true of mercury poisoning as well. Mild demyelinating neuropathy was detected in two girls (Florentine and Sanfilippo, 1991), and an adult showed axonal degeneration with Hg-related demyelination (Chu et al, 1998). Methylmercury can alter the fatty acid composition of myelin cerebrosides in suckling rats (Grundt et al, 1980).

EEG Activity/Epilepsy Abnormal EEGs are common in mercury poisoning as well as autism. In one study, half the autistic children expressed abnormal EEG activity during sleep (reviewed in LeWine, 1999). Gillberg and Coleman (1992) estimate that 35%-45% of autistics eventually develop epilepsy. A recent study by LeWine and colleagues (1999) using MEG found epileptiform activity in 82% of 50 regressive-autistic children. EEG abnormalities in autistic populations tend to be non-specific and consist of a variety of epileptiform discharge patterns (Nass, Gross, and Devinsky, 1998). Unusual epileptiform activity has been found in a variety of mercury poisoning cases (Brenner Snyder, 1980). These include (i) the Minamata outbreak - generalized convulsions and abnormal EEGs (Snyder, 1972); (ii) methylmercury ingestion through contaminated pork - all four affected children had epileptiform features and disturbances of background rhythms; two had seizures (Brenner Snyder, 1980); (iii) mercury vapor poisoning - abnormal EEG in a 12 year old girl (Fagala and Wigg, 1992) and slower and attenuated EEGs in chloralkali workers with long term exposure (Piikivi Tolonen, 1989); and (iv) exposure from thimerosal in ear drops and through IVIG - EEG with generalized slowing in an 18 month old girl with otitis media (Rohyans et al, 1984) and a 44 year old man (Lowell et al, 1996). More recently, Szasz and colleagues (1999), in a study of early Hg-exposure, described methylmercury's ability to enhance tendencies toward epileptiform activity and reported a reduced level of seizure-discharge amplitude, a finding which is at least consistent with the subtlety of seizures in many autism spectrum children (LeWine, 1999; Nass, Gross, and Devinsky, 1998). Processes whereby neuronal damage is induced by epileptiform discharges are elucidated in a number of studies, many of which focus upon brain regions affected in autism. Importantly, neuronal damage in the amygdala can be an ongoing delayed process, even after the cessation of seizures (Tuunanen et al, 1996, 1997, 1999). Alterations of cerebral metabolic function last long after seizures have occurred. In a model of seizure-induced hippocampal sclerosis, Astrid Nehlig's group describes hypometabolism having its regional boundaries directly connected to seizure-damaged locus (Bouilleret et al, 2000). That Hg increases extracellular glutamate would also contribute to epileptiform activity (Scheyer, 1998; Chapman et al, 1996). These findings support a rationale: In susceptible individuals, mercury can potentiate or induce Hg-related epileptiform activity, which can have lower amplitude and be harder to identify. Furthermore, this low-level but persisting epileptiform activity would gradually induce cell death in the seizure foci and in brain nuclei neuroanatomically related to the seizure foci. These studies have a more direct relevance to the possibility of Hg-induced cases of autism (i) because the amygdala are implicated in regard to core traits in autism, as described above, and (ii) because mercury finds its way into the amygdala (see above). Furthermore, these theoretical relationships are consistent with SPECT imaging studies by Mena, Goldberg, and Miller, who have demonstrated areas of regional hypoperfusion neuroanatomically associated with trait deficits in autism-spectrum children (Goldberg et al, 1999).

MECHANISMS, SOURCES EPIDEMIOLOGY OF EXPOSURE a. Exposure Mechanism Vaccine injections are a known source of mercury (Plotkin and Orenstein, 1999), and the typical amount of mercury given to infants and toddlers in this manner exceeds government safety limits, according to Neal Halsey of the American Academy of Pediatrics (1999) and William Egan of the Biologics Division of the FDA (1999). Most vaccines given to children 2 years and under are stored in a solution containing thimerosal, which is 49.6% mercury by weight. Once inside humans, thimerosal (sodium ethylmercurrithio-salicylate) is metabolized to ethylmercury and thiosalicylate (Gosselin et al, 1984). The vaccines mixed with this solution are DTaP, HIB, and Hepatitis B (Egan, 1999). Thimerosal is not an integral component of vaccines, but is a preservative added to prevent bacterial contamination. Many vaccine products are available without the thimerosal preservative; however, these alternatives have not been widely used (Egan, 1999). In addition, thimerosal is used during the manufacturing process for a number of vaccines, from which trace amounts are still present in the final injected product (FDA, personal communication; Smith-Kline press release on Hepatitis B, March 31, 2000). Since at least 1977 clinicians have recognized thimerosal as being potentially dangerous, especially in situations of long term exposure (Haeney et al, 1979; Rohyans et al, 1984; Fagan et al, 1977; Matheson et al, 1980). For nearly twenty years the US government has also singled out thimerosal as a potential toxin (FDA, 1982). In response to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Modernization Act of 1997, which called for the FDA to review and assess the risk of all mercury containing food and drugs (MMWR, 1999, July 9), the FDA issued a final rule in 1998 stating that over-the-counter drug products containing thimerosal and other mercury forms are not generally recognized as safe and effective (FDA, 1998). In December 1998 and April 1999, the FDA requested US vaccine manufacturers to provide more information about the thimerosal content in vaccines (MMWR, 1999, July 9); and in July 1999, the CDC asked manufacturers to start removing thimerosal from vaccines and rescheduled the Hepatitus B vaccine so it is given at 9 months of age instead of at birth (CDC, July 1999). In November 1999, the CDC repeated its recommendation that vaccine manufacturers move to thimerosal-free products (CDC, November 1999). Importantly, based on the CDC's own recommended childhood immunization schedule (and excluding any trace amounts), the amount of mercury a typically vaccinated two year old child born in the 1990s would receive is 237.5 micrograms; and a typical six month old might receive 187.5 micrograms (Egan, 1999). These amounts equate to 3.53 x 1017 molecules and 2.79 x 1017 molecules of mercury respectively (353,000,000,000,000,000 and 279,000,000,000,000,000 molecules). Since thimerosal is injected during vaccinations, the mercury is given intermittently in large, or 'bolus', doses: at birth and at 2, 4, 6, and approximately 15 months (Egan, 1999). The amount of mercury injected at birth is 12.5 micrograms, followed by 62.5 micrograms at 2 months, 50 micrograms at 4 months, another 62.5 micrograms during the infant's 6-month immunizations, and a final 50 micrograms at about 15 months (Halsey, 1999). Although infancy is recognized as a time of rapid neurological development, to the best of our belief and knowledge, there are no published studies on the effect of injected ethylmercury in intermittent bolus doses in infants from birth to six months or to 2 years (Hepatitis Control Report, 1999; Pediatrics, 1999; EPA, 1997, p.6-56). In contrast, four government agencies have set safety thresholds for daily mercury exposure based on ingested fish or whale meat containing methylmercury. Two of these guidelines are based on adult values and two are for pregnant women/fetuses (Egan, 1999). Applying these guidelines to a bolus dose scenario (see Halsey, 1999 for bolus vs. daily dose discussion), the sum of Hg-doses given at 6 months of age or younger, correlated to infant weights, exceed all of the Hg-total guidelines for all infants. The 2 month dose is especially high relative to the typical infant body weight. Halsey (1999) has calculated the 2 month dose to be over 30 times the recommended daily maximum exposure, with babies of the smallest weight category receiving almost three months worth of daily exposures on a single day. Halsey's observation is all the more important because even at doses which were not previously thought to be associated with adverse affects, mercury has resulted in some damage to humans (Grandjean et al, 1998). Given that ethylmercury is equally neurotoxic as methylmercury (Magos et al, 1985), and that injected mercury is more harmful than ingested mercury (EPA, 1997, p.3-55; Diner and Brenner, 1998), the amount of injected ethylmercury given to young children is cause for concern. The potential for Hg-induced harm is compounded by the special vulnerability of infants (Gosselin et al, 1984). Mercury, which primarily affects the central nervous system, is most toxic to the developing brain (Davis et al, 1994; Grandjean et al, 1999; Yeates and Mortensen, 1994), and neonates exposed to methyl (organic) mercury have been shown to accumulate significantly more Hg in the brain relative to other tissues than do adults ( EPA, 1997, p.4-1). Mercury may also be more likely to enter the infant brain because the blood-brain barrier has not fully closed (Wild Benzel, 1994). In addition, infants under 6 months are unable to excrete mercury, most likely due to their inability to produce bile, the main excretion route for organic mercury (Koos and Longo, 1976; Clarkson, 1993). Bakir et al (1973) have shown that those with the longest half-time of clearance are most likely to experience adverse sequelae, while Aschner and Aschner (1990) have demonstrated that the longer that organic mercury remains in neurons, the more it is converted to its inorganic irreversibly-bound form, which has greater neurotoxicity. b. Population Susceptibility Nearly all children in the United States are immunized, yet only a small proportion of children develop autism. The NIH (Bristol et al, 1996) estimates the current prevalence of autism to be 1 in 500. A pertinent characteristic of mercury is the great variability in its effects by individual. At the same exposure level of mercury, some will be affected severely, while others will be asymptomatic or only mildly impaired (Dale, 1972; Warkany and Hubbard, 1953; Clarkson, 1997). A ten-fold difference in sensitivity to the same exposure level has been reported (Koos and Longo, 1976; Davis et al, 1994; Pierce et al, 1972; Amin-Zaki, 1979). An example of variability in children is the mercury-induced disease called acrodynia. In the earlier half of this century, from one in 500 to one in 1000 children exposed to the same chronic, low-dose of mercury in teething powders developed this disorder (Matheson et al, 1980; Clarkson, 1997), and the likelihood of developing the disease appears to be dominated more by individual susceptibility and possibly age rather than the dose of the mercury (Clarkson, 1992). Given the documented inter-individual variability of responses to Hg, and the young age at which exposure occurs, the doses of mercury given concurrently with vaccines are such that only a certain percentage of children will develop overt symptoms, even as other children might have trait irregularities sufficiently mild as to remain unrecognized as having been induced by mercury. c. Sex Ratio Autism is more prevalent among boys than girls, with the ratio generally recognized as approximately 4:1 (Gillberg Coleman, 1992, p.90). Mercury studies have consistently shown a greater effect on males than females, except in instances of kidney damage (EPA, 1997). At the highest doses, both sexes are affected equally, but at lower doses only males are affected. This is true of mice as well as humans (Sager et al, 1984; Rossi et al, 1997; et al, 1998; McKeown-Eyssen et al, 1983; see also review in EPA, 1997, p.6-50). d. Exposure Levels Autism Prevalence Perhaps not coincidentally, autism's initial description and subsequent epidemiological increase mirror the introduction and use of thimerosal as a vaccine preservative. In the late 1930s, Leo Kanner, an experienced child psychologist and the discoverer of autism, first began to notice the type of child he would later label autistic. In his initial paper, published in 1943, he remarked that this type of child had never been described previously: Since 1938, there have come to our attention a number of children whose condition differs so markedly and uniquely from anything reported so far, that each case merits.a detailed consideration of its fascinating peculiarities. All these patients were born in the 1930s. Thimerosal was introduced as a component of vaccine solutions in the 1930s (Egan, 1999). Not only does the effect of mercury vary by individual, as noted above, it also varies in a dose-dependent manner, so that the higher the exposure level, the more individuals that are affected. At higher dose levels, the most sensitive individuals will be more severely impaired, and the less sensitive individuals will be only moderately impaired, and the majority of individuals may still show no overt symptoms (Nielson and Hultman, 1999). The vaccination rate, and hence the rate of mercury exposure via thimerosal, has steadily increased since the 1930s. In 1999 it was the highest ever, at close to 90% or above, depending on the vaccine (CDC, 1999, press release). The rate of autism has increased dramatically since its discovery by Kanner: prior to 1970, studies showed an average prevalence of 1 in 2000; for studies after 1970, the average rate had doubled to 1 in 1000 (Gillberg and Wing, 1999). In 1996, the NIH estimated occurrence to be 1 in 500 (Bristol et al, 1996). A large increase in prevalence, yet to be confirmed by stricter epidemiological analysis, appears to be occurring since the mid-1990s, as evidenced by several state departments of education statistics reflecting substantial rises in enrolment of ASD children (California, Florida, Maryland, Illinois, summarized by Yazbak, 1999). These increases have paralleled the increased mercury intake induced by mandatory innoculations: in 1991, two vaccines, HIB and Hepatitis B, both of which generally include thimerosal as a preservative, were added to the recommended vaccine schedule (Egan, 1999). e. Genetic Factors ASD is one of the most heritable of developmental and psychiatric disorders (Bailey et al, 1996). There is 90% concordance in monozygotic twins and a 3-5% risk of autism in siblings of affected probands (Rogers et al, 1999), a rate 50 to 100 times higher than would be expected in the general population (Smalley Collins, 1996; Rutter, 1996). From 2 to 10 genes are believed to be involved (Bailey et al, 1996). Individual differences in susceptibility to mercury are said to arise from genetic factors and these too may be multiple in nature (Pierce et al, 1972; Amin-Zaki, 1979). They include innate differences in (i) the ability to detoxify heavy metals, (ii) the ability to maintain balanced gut microflora, which can impair detoxification processes, and (iii) immune over-reactivity to mercury (Nielson and Hultman, 1999; 1992; EPA, review 1997, p.3-26). Many autistic children are described as having (i) difficulties with detoxification of heavy metals (Edelson Cantor, 1998), possibly due to low glutathione levels (O'Reilly and Waring, 1993), (ii) intestinal microflora imbalances that can impede excretion (Shattock, 1997), and (iii) autoimmune dysfunction (Zimmerman et al, 1993). These characteristics might be reflective of the underlying susceptibility genes that predispose to mercury-induced sequelae and hence to autism. As noted above, autism family studies show an exceptionally high concordance rate of 90% for identical twins. Most environmental factors, such as a postnatal viral infection, tend not to be present at exactly the same time or at the same level or rate for each twin. This would cause a difference in phenotype expression, and thus postnatal environmental influences in general reduce the concordance rate for identical twins. However, given the extremely high vaccination rate and the high likelihood of vaccination of one twin at the same time and with the same vaccines as the other twin, mercury-induced autism via vaccination injection, even though it is an environmental factor, would still lead to the high concordance rate seen in twins. Furthermore, among identical twin pairs, the 90% concordance rate is for the milder phenotype: if one twin has pure classic autism, there is (i) a 60% chance that the other twin will have pure classic autism; (ii) a 30% chance that the other twin will exhibit some type of impairment falling on the autism spectrum, but with less severe symptoms; and (iii) a 10% chance the other twin will be unimpaired. The difference in symptom severity among the 40% of monozygotic pairs who do not exhibit classic autism may arise from either (i) a different vaccination history within pairs, or (ii) the tendency of thimerosal to clump or be unevenly distributed in solution, so that one twin might receive more or less mercury than the other. One study found a 62% difference in the mercury concentration of ampoules drawn from the same container of immunoglabulin batches containing thimerosal (Roberts and Roberts, 1979). f. Course of Disease Age of onset: Autism emerges during the same time period as infant and toddler thimerosal injections during vaccinations. As noted above, the recommended childhood vaccination schedule from 1991 to 1999 has called for injections of thimerosal starting at birth and continuing at 2, 4, 6, and approximately 15 months (Halsey, 1999); a similar schedule occurred prior to this time but for DTP alone. In the great majority of cases, the more noticeable symptoms of autism emerge between 6 and 20 months old - and mostly between 12 and 18 months (Gillberg Coleman, 1992). Teitelbaum et al (1998), who have claimed the ability to detect subtle abnormalities at the youngest age so far, have observed these abnormalities at 4 months old at the earliest, the exception being a Moebius mouth seen at birth in a small number of subjects. Symptoms of mercury poisoning do not usually appear immediately upon exposure, although in especially sensitive individuals or in cases of excessive exposure they can (Warkany and Hubbard, 1953; Amin-Zaki, 1978). Rather, there is generally a preclinical silent stage, seen in both animals and humans, during which subtle neurological changes are occurring (Mattsson et al, 1981). The delayed reaction between exposure and overt signs can last from weeks to months to years (Adams et al, 1983; Clarkson, 1992; Fagala & Wigg, 1992; Davis et al, 1994; Kark et al, 1971). Consequently, mercury given in vaccines before age 6 months would not in most individuals lead to an observable or recognizable disorder, except for subtle signs, prior to age 6-12 months, and for some individuals, symptoms induced by early vaccinal Hg might not emerge until the infant had become a toddler (Joselow et al, 1972). A few autism researchers have suggested a prenatal onset for autism (Rodier et al, 1997; Bauman & Kemper, 1994), which would preclude a vaccinal-mercury etiology. Others, however, have evidence that suggest post-natal timings (Bailey, 1998; Courchesne, 1999; Bristol Power, NICHD, Dateline Interview, 1999). The general consensus at this point is that the timing cannot be determined (Bailey et al, 1996; Bristol et al, 1996); and, further, that there is little evidence that prenatal or perinatal events predict to later autism (Bristol et al, 1996), even though clustering of adverse effects (suboptimality factors) are associated with autism (Prechtel, 1968; Bryson et al, 1988; Finegan and Quarrington, 1979). There is also a general agreement that, in the great majority of cases, autistic signs emerge among infants and toddlers who had looked normal , developed normally, met major milestones, and had unremarkable pediatric evaluations (Gillberg Coleman, 1992; Filipek et al, 1999; Bailey et al, 1996), so that autism presents as an obvious deterioration or regression, either before age two or before age three (Baranek, 1999; Bristol Power, NICHD, Dateline Interview, 1999; LeWine, 1999). It is worthwhile to note that early and intensive educational and behavioral intervention can produce dramatic gains in function, and the gains made by these children may be somewhat unique among the more severe developmental disabilities (Rogers, 1996). This phenomenon further suggests that autism arises from an environmental overlay rather than being purely an organic disease. Additionally, at least one study has reported that re-education and physical treatment can improve outcomes in mercurialism (Amin-zaki, 1978). Emergence of symptoms: The manner in which symptoms emerge in many cases of autism is consistent with a multiple low-dose vaccinal exposure model of mercury poisoning. From a parent's and pediatrician's perspective, such an individual is a normal looking child who regresses or fails to develop after thimerosal administration. Clinically relevant symptoms generally emerge gradually over many months, although there have been scattered parental reports of sudden onset (Filipek, et al, 1999). The initial signs, occurring shortly after the first injections, are subtle, suggesting disease emergence, and consist of abnormalities in motor behavior and in sensory systems, particularly touch sensitivity, vision, and numbness in the mouth (excessive mouthing of objects) (Teitelbaum et al, 1998; Baranek, 1999). These signs persist and are followed by parental reports of speech and hearing abnormalities appearing before the child's second birthday (Prizant, 1996; Gillberg Coleman, 1992), that is, within several months of when additional and final injections are given. Finally, in year two, there is a full blossoming of ASD traits and a continuing regression or lack of development, so that the most severe expression of symptoms occurs at approximately 3-5 years of age. These symptoms then begin to ameliorate (Church Coplan, 1995; Wing & Attwood, 1987; Paul, 1987). The exceptions are the subset of those with regression during adolescence or early adulthood, which may involve onset of seizures and associated neurodegeneration (Howlin, 2000; Paul, 1987; Tuunanen et al, 1996, 1997, 1999). As in autism, onset of Hg toxicity symptoms is gradual in some cases, sudden in others (Amin-Zaki et al, 1979 1978; Joselow et al, 1972; Warkany and Hubbard, 1953). In the case of organic poisoning, the first signs to emerge are abnormal sensation and motor disturbances; as exposure levels increase, these signs are followed by speech and articulation problems and then hearing deficits (Clarkson, 1992), just like autism. Once the mercury source is removed symptoms tend to ameliorate (though not necessarily disappear) except in instances of severe poisoning, which may lead to a progressive course or death (Amin-Zaki et al, 1978). As in autism, epilepsy in Hg exposure also predicts a poorer outcome (Brenner Snyder, 1980). Long term prognosis: The long term outcomes of ASD and mercury poisoning show the same wide variation. Autism is viewed as a lifelong condition for most; historically, three-fourths of autistic individuals become either institutionalized as adults or are unable to live independently (Paul, 1987). There are, however, many instances of partial to full recovery, in which autistic traits persist in a much milder form or, in some individuals, disappear altogether once adulthood is reached (Rogers, 1996; Church & Coplan, 1994; Szatmari et al, 1989; Rimland 1994; Wing & Attwood, 1987). Upon exposure, mercury entering the bloodstream tends to accumulate in tissues and organs, primarily the brain (Koos and Long, 1976; Lorscheider et al, 1995). Once inside tissues, and particularly the brain, mercury will linger for years, as shown on X rays of a poisoned man 22 years after exposure (Gosselin et al, 1984), as well as autopsies of humans with known mercury exposure (Pedersen et al, 1999; Joselow et al, 1972) and primate studies (Vahter et al, 1994). The continued presence of mercury in organs and the CNS in particualr would explain why autistic symptoms might persist, why researchers such as Zimmerman or Singh would detect an on-going immune reaction, why epilepsy might not emerge until adolescence, or why sulfate transporters in the intestine or kidney might continue to be blocked. Nevertheless, despite the continued presence of Hg in tissue, the degree of recovery from mercurialism varies greatly. Even in severe cases, there are reports of full or partial recovery (e.g., Adams et al, 1983; Vroom & Greer, 1972; Amin-Zaki et al, 1978). In less severe cases, especially those in which exposure occurs early in life, the more severe symptoms may ameliorate over time, but milder impairments remain, especially neurological ones Amin-Zaki, 1974 Greer, 1972; EPA 1997, pp.3-10, 3-14, and 3-75). The wide variation in outcome is believed to be due, again, to individual sensitivity to mercury, in this case, the ability of some victims to develop immunity or a tolerance to Hg even when the metal is still present in tissue (Warkany Hubbard, 1953).

Thimerosal Interaction with Vaccines As noted above, for most ASD children symptom onset is gradual, but for a significant minority it is sudden. Additionally, many parents believe there is a connection between their child's autism and his or her immunizations. The Cure Autism Now Foundation, for example, reports that many parents who contact it mention such a connection (Portia Iversen, CAN president, personal communication). The association extends not only to the mercury-containing vaccines - DTP/DTaP, HIB, and Hepatitis B - but also to those without thimerosal, particularly the MMR (Bernard Rimland, president, Autism Research Institute, personal communication). Parents may describe a variety of post-vaccine scenarios: a fever followed by a short recovery period and then a more gradual symptom onset; onset of symptoms immediately and suddenly after inoculation with or without fever; or even a mildly impaired child whose condition worsened after vaccination (CAN Parent Advisory Board Internet list; St. John's Autism Internet list). While it is possible that any temporal association between vaccination and emergence of autism is due to chance, Warkany and Hubbard, who successfully proved the connection between acrodynia and mercury poisoning to the medical community 50 years ago, offer alternate explanations. In their 1953 article in Pediatrics, they made the following points: (a) They noted that high fever accompanied by a rash after mercury administration can be signs of a typical, acute, mercurial reaction, and acrodynia may follow, immediately or after short intervals, acute idiosyncratic reactions to mercury. This reaction was independent of hypersensitivity to mercury, as detected from skin tests, as they reported that only 10% of acrodynia victims responded positively to Hg on patch tests. Thus in ASD, the fevers and deteriorations seen by parents immediately after a thimerosal-containing vaccine injection may be a systemic reaction (and not a hypersensitivity response) to the mercury content, and this reaction may subsequently progress to the emergence of autism, just as topical mercury administration produced fever and then acrodynia over 50 years ago. (b) Warkany and Hubbard provided some tentative observations that the administration of a vaccine, irrespective of whether or not it contains thimerosal, can set off a reaction to any mercuric compound that may also be given to a child, which in the case of acrodynia, would be topical mercury in powders or rinses. This inter-reactivity might explain the pronounced effects from the MMR among subsequently-diagnosed autistic children: [One patient] underwent a fourteen day course of antirabies injections six weeks before outbreak of acrodynia. Ten days after completion of the therapy she was treated with ammoniated mercury ointment and subsequently acrodynia developed...[In another case] antirabies treatment preceded the disease by three months. In several children various immunization procedures preceded the onset of acrodynia in addition to [topical] mercurial exposure. This could be purely coincidental or the vaccination material may play a role as an accessory factor. It is noteworthy that many vaccines and sera contain small amounts of mercury as preservatives which are injected together with the biologic material. These small amounts of mercurial compounds could act as sensitizing substances. In several instances vaccination against smallpox preceded the development of acrodynic symptoms, and some patients were exposed to bismuth, arsenic, lead, and antimony in addition to mercury. Such observations deserve attention. (c) Finally, these two researchers observed that some individuals would react to mercury and then, upon re-exposure, not show any effects, i.e., they had acquired an unexplained tolerance to it. In other cases, Hg sensitivity would be maintained. Rarely, though, would reactivity occur with the first dose: more often the patient tolerates several before the reaction occurs. The organism can harbor appreciable amounts of mercury while remaining in perfect health, and then, for unknown reasons, these innocuous stores of mercury become toxic. It seems in such cases as if the barriers which held the mercury in check break down without provocation, or as if the mercury had been converted from a nontoxic to a toxic form... In ASD, this delayed sensitivity would explain why some might develop autism later, not after the first few vaccines, and it would also explain in part why the more vaccines that are given, the more likely it is that a given individual will develop a reaction since there are more sensitizing opportunities. Importantly, in susceptible individuals, the reactions described by Warkany and Hubbard are likely to occur if mercury's presence occurred via injected thimerosal. IV. DETECTION OF MERCURY IN AUTISTIC CHILDREN In the past, hair, urine, or blood tests from autistic subjects have mostly found lead rather than mercury (Wecker et al, 1985), but this is likely due (i) to lead's pervasiveness in our environment, coupled with autistic children's pica tendencies and general inability to detoxify any heavy metal (LaCamera and LaCamera, 1987; Edelson & Cantor, 1998); (ii) to the difficulty in detecting Hg, especially in older children exposed early in life, since remaining mercury is sequestered in tissue; and (iii) to the greater affinity of standard chelators used in challenge tests (e.g., DMSA) for lead over mercury, making lead more readily detectable in such exams (Frackelton and Christenson, 1998). More recently, a number of parents of younger autistic children, in whom mercury is more likely to be detectable, have reported higher than expected levels of mercury in hair, blood, and urine samples. Cases studies are listed below, and more are in the process of documentation. Several parents have also noted improved function after chelation. The Case Studies We are providing data from several retrospective case studies of autistic children with associated tissue mercury burdens. In each case we have tried to identify potential sources of exposure, although we have not been able to identify the exact amounts in some cases due to inadequate documentation. This information does not purport to be a rigid scientific study, but rather an initial effort to demonstrate that there may be a problem with mercury toxicity in children with autism. Our primary objective is to show that considerable amounts of mercury are found in the bodies of some autistic children. The data we present were derived from many sources: hair, urine and blood. Some of the samples were baseline and others were obtained utilizing a provocative agent, either DMPS or DMSA. Typically a single dose of DMPS will provoke more mercury from the tissue than a single oral dose of DMSA. Excretion levels will also vary depending on the amount of DMPS or DMSA given. There are also variations among these factors in the case studies. Identifier: 0001SM Sex: M Age: 5 DOB: History: Premature contractions, which required bedrest during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters.

Symptoms at 3 years include extreme thirst, echolalia, toe walking, high pain threshold, sleep disturbances, hyperactivity and obsessive behaviors. Exposure Sources: No maternal amalgam history and minimal dietary exposure. He received all recommended vaccines, although without manufacturer data we are unable to calculate total exposure at this time. Known exposure from hepatitis B vaccine, 37.5 mcg mercury. Mercury Levels: Hair mercury was 2.21ppm at 3 years and 3 months of age with a lab reference of 0-1.5ppm. DMPS provocation utilizing 3 mg. DMPS/kg given IV revealed: 46 micrograms of mercury / g creatine on 12-18-98 86 micrograms of mercury / g creatine on 3-25-99 46 micrograms of mercury / g creatine on 7-27-99 36 micrograms of mercury / g creatine on 9-30-99 Normal reference for urinary mercury 0-3 micrograms g creatine. Between DMPS infusions the child received DMSA 100 mg. orally two days a week, with glutathione 75 mg. twice daily, glycine 900 mg. on day prior to DMSA and glycine 900 mg. on DMSA treatment days. Response to treatment: On 3-22-00 the parents reported marked behavioral improvement, particularly over the past two months. He now responds to his name and follows instructions. He has developed original speech without echolalia, and obsessive behaviors History: Prenatal history was unremarkable. Infant was thought to be 4 weeks premature, although birth weight was that of a term infant at 8lbs. 6oz. He developed jaundice shortly after birth and was treated with phototherapy. He was briefly given antibiotics for a suspected infection the first 3 days of life. Developmental Landmarks: Parents report that his development was normal until 12 months. He was crawling but did not begin to walk until 18 months of age with the support of a walker. Regression and Symptoms: Some concerns at 13 months, marked regression at 16 months. Six to seven spoken words in use at 12 months were entirely lost. Vacant stares predominated and he began biting his hands. Officially diagnosed autistic at 2 1/2 years of age. Exposure Sources: Mother had 8 amalgams. He also received exposure via vaccine, but total dose is not available at this time. Mercury Levels: Hair mercury at 2 years 7 months was below detection limits. DMSA provacative protocol with 10 mg per kg per dose three times daily for three days with 24 hr urine screen for heavy metals day 2 revealed: 3.2 micrograms of mercury / g creatine on 6-21-99 28 micrograms of mercury / g creatine on 9-13-99 13 micrograms of mercury / g creatine on 10-12-99 Normal lab reference 0-3 mcg Hg per g creatine. Response to treatment: Parents feel certain that DMSA chelation has resulted in improvement in their son. They noticed almost immediate improvement during the three days of treatment along with dramatic improvement the past six months. He is much more with it and curious about his world . Although he is still not talking, he is having frequent vocalizations. He just started running for the first time 6 weeks ago. Identifier: 0004WR Sex: M Age: 6 DOB: 2-2-94 Prenatal and Postnatal History: Prenatal history unremarkable with the exception of breech presentation. C-section preformed and apgars were 9 and 10. Birth weight, 8lbs. 11oz. Normal postnatal course. Developmental Landmarks: He easily met and exceeded all early developmental landmarks and was described as a pleasant, happy baby. Regression and symptoms: Shortly after his first birthday he developed numerous infections and was hospitalized for a respiratory illness. He received antibiotics, steroids, and oxygen and was discharged on day three. By 15 months he had lost speech and interaction. At 18 months he developed a very limited diet with bouts of bloody, culture negative diarrhea. Officially diagnosed autistic at 5 yrs, although he had been receiving services for autism from the school system since age 3. Exposure sources: This child received all early vaccines with thimerosal preservative. At 2 months of age he received 62.5 mcg of mercury which represented a 125 fold increase above EPA guidelines based on his weight. This occurred again at 4 months, 62.5 mcg mercury and 50 mcg mercury at 6 months, 11 months 12.5mcg mercury and at 18 months, 50 mcg mercury for a total of 237.5 mcg of mercury. Mother also reports 5 dental amalgams and minimal dietary exposure. Child has never eaten fish or seafood. Mercury Levels: Hair analysis from 20 months revealed 4.8 ppm mercury with a reference range of 0-1ppm and aluminum 40.2 with a reference of 0-9ppm. Note this sample was not sent for analysis until the child was already 5 1/2 years at which time the mother became aware of his early mercury exposure from vaccines. A subsequent analysis at 5 r years revealed normal levels of mercury and elevated lead 1.14 ppm with a normal reference 0-0.5, aluminum 23.2, and antimony 0.017 with reference of 0-0.03 and bismuth 0.19 with reference of 0-0.11. Initial treatment with oral DMSA removed 17 mcg per g creatine lead with reference 0-15 mcg per g creatine. Oral cyclic chelation was continued for 5 cycles with lead again present at 15 mcg per g creatine down to normal levels at the 5th cycle. Response to treatment: Parents report marked improvement with each round of chelation. The last two cycles were not as pronounced as the first 3 cycles of treatment. An increase in spontaneous language and a general overall increase in all areas of functioning were also noted. Identifier: 0005ZH Sex: M Age: 10 Unremarkable pre- and postnatal course. Term vaginal delivery. Pitocin given for failure to progress. Birth weight 7 lbs. 14 oz., good apgars. Developmental Landmarks: Mother reports he was a very alert and pleasant infant who easily obtained all his early developmental landmarks with the exception of crawling. He progressed directly to walking at 8 r months. He began to babble and had developed some speech the first year of life, which did not progress. Regression and Symptoms: Parents were concerned about his speech delay but attributed it to other factors. He also developed a very picky diet with a preference for starches. He also would line up toys and repeat phrases but was not officially diagnosed autistic until 5 years of age. Exposure Sources: Mother with multiple dental amalgams. DPT vaccine known to have mercury 25 mcg per dose at 2,4,and 6 months. Child did eat fish sticks as a toddler but parents switched to only farm raised fish. Mercury Levels: A 24 hour heavy metal challenge at 9 years of age removed 67 mcg of mercury. Unfortunately, the parents were not able to financially afford further treatment at that time. Identifier: 0006MA Sex: M Age: 4 r yrs. DOB: 8-24-95 and Postnatal History: Uncomplicated pregnancy, term vaginal delivery, apgars 9 and 10, birth weight 7 lbs. 6 oz. Quickly learned to breast feed, unremarkable postnatal history. Developmental Landmarks: Easily met all early developmental milestones. Described as being very social with good eye contact. He was saying Mama, bye-bye, and babbling at 14 months. Regression and Symptoms: According to the parents, at 16 to 17 months he began to slide into his own world. He stopped responding to his name and making eye contact. He also lost language and social interactions. Parents also report muted emotions. Exposure Sources: This infant was exposed to 100 mcg mercury the first six months of life via vaccines. No dietary exposure from seafood or fish to the child. Mother with 9 amalgam fillings and only occasional fish consumption during pregnancy. Mercury Levels: Hair analysis without mercury detection. Heavy metals challenge urine 8.6 mcg / g / creatine with a norm reference of 0-2.5 mcg / g / creatine at 3 years 8 months of age. He is currently undergoing cyclic chelation therapy with oral DMSA. Response To Treatment: Parents report that his level of awareness, eye contact, emotions, and receptive and expressive language have all improved since starting the chelation program. Identifier: 0007EK History: Uncomplicated prenatal and postnatal history. Birth weight 8 lbs., apgars 9 and 9. Developmental Landmarks: Easily met all early milestones. Parents report precocious language skills. At 10 months he was talking with phrases oh, there it is. Regression and Symptoms: At 12 months there was a major and obvious reversal in behavior. Speech, social interaction, and laughter began to fade away rapidly. He began toe walking, lost eye contact, grew inattentive, and developed repetitive behaviors. Exposure Sources: Mother with 8 dental amalgams, no fish consumption. Infant received thimerosal in vaccines, but unable to calculate exposure at this time. At 3 years of age 8 amalgam fillings were placed with an initial improvement in behavior for 3 weeks, then a decline to a level much worse than before the dental work with progressive decline. Mercury Levels: Prior to chelation non-detectable, 12-27-99. DMPS urinary mercury. DMSA supp. 250mg bid were used 3 x week, every other week subsequent to provocation testing. Oral DMSA provocation for urinary Hg pending. Response to Treatment: Multiple dietary and secretin infusions are concurrent to the DMPS/DMSA chelation, but mother is firmly convinced that the latter are contributing to excellent behavioral and somatic gains. Improvement in eye contact within 2 days of DMSA is evident. Improvement in speech, sociability and playing with toys are seen consistently right after DMSA and are reported to be on a gradual upward trend. A full sentence was uttered on or about 3-1-00. In addition to the above case studies, we have collected preliminary data on three autistic children who have not undergone chelation. These children also exhibit elevated levels of mercury. Data on Non-Chelated ASD Children Age Sex Mercury level and source of sample 2 r yrs. Female Heavy metal hair analysis 5.6ppm (ref.range 0-2) 4 r yrs. Male Hair analysis 1.2ug/g (ref. 0.4) PRBC 18.4 (ref 9) 5 yrs. Male Hair analysis 1.8 ppm PRBC 18.3 (ref. 9) Discussion Several observations from these case studies deserve mention. One is that all of the children experienced a regressive form of autism. Other findings are that (i) low levels of mercury in hair may be associated with large amounts of mercury excretion on provocation and (ii) initial levels of provoked mercury may not be as high as subsequent ones. Mercury in the hair will only reflect a current or recent exposure of approximately one year or the body's active detoxification of mercury. This was evident in a child with non-detectable levels of mercury in the hair and positive levels on provocation. In the case studies there is also a trend of higher numbers for mercury in younger children (20 month hair sample of 4.8 ppm and 2 r year hair sample of 5.6 ppm). This may be related to the fact that the testing was performed closer to the time of exposure. Hair levels of mercury greater than 5.0 ppm are considered diagnostic for mercury poisoning (Applied Toxicology, 1992). Among the majority of these case studies much moremodest elevations of mercury, if detected at all, were associated with high levels of provoked mercury. There are no standards for provoked levels of mercury in children in the context of behavioral disorders. Therefore, we surveyed a large number of physicians treating adults with chronic health problems diagnosed as secondary to mercury. These clinicians advise that tolerable limits may vary according to the general health of the patient and associated health problems. All consulted agreed that in adults excretion of 50 mcg of mercury per gm creatine after intravenous DMPS challenge is worrisome. We submit that the concern level for children should be even more stringent. High levels of mercury are demonstrated in some children without a history of fish consumption, amalgam burden, or known environmental exposure, suggesting the role of vaccines as a contribution to body burden. The families who submitted these case histories wanted to tell their stories because their children are noticeably improved after treatment for mercury. Whether this improvement was sudden or gradual, the parents are convinced that lessening the mercury and heavy metal burden has helped their child. They ask us to request support for much needed research in this area. DISCUSSION How reasonable is it to claim that the most common form of autism, where there is normal development and then regression, could be caused by mercury poisoning? There are several reasons to believe that this process has indeed occurred. Diagnostic Criteria Are Met Medical literature demonstrates that mercury can induce autism-spectrum traits, and this association extends to mercury's localization within specific brain nuclei. In attempting to address the totality of the syndrome (Bailey et al, 1996), we have shown that every major characteristic of autism has been exhibited in at least several cases of documented mercury poisoning, and that every major area of biological and neurological impairment implicated in ASD has been observed with Hg exposure. Recently, government-directed studies have revealed that the amount of mercury given to infants receiving vaccinations exceeds safety levels. The timing of mercury administration via vaccines coincides with the onset of autistic symptoms. Case reports of autistic children with measurable mercury levels in hair, blood, and urine indicate a history of mercury exposure along with inadequate detoxification. Thus the standard criteria for a diagnosis of mercury poisoning in autism, as outlined at the beginning of this paper, are met. In other words, mercury toxicity is a significant contributing factor or primary etiological factor in many or most cases of autism. Unique Form Would be Expected, Implicates Vaccinal Thimerosal Symptoms manifested in mercury poisoning are diverse and vary by the interaction of variables such as type of mercury, age of patient, method of exposure, and so forth. Thus, although it could be argued that in all the thousands of cases of past Hg poisonings, no instance of autism could be found, such an argument fails to take into account the possibility of unique expression. It would be comparable to saying that, because in all the cases of Minamata disease no instance of acrodynia could be found, then acrodynia could not be caused by mercury poisoning. Since there are no case reports or systematic studies in the literature of the effects of intermittent bolus doses of injected ethylmercury on susceptible infants and toddlers, it would be reasonable to expect that symptoms arising from this form of mercury poisoning would present as a novel disease. In fact, given the high neurotoxicity of organic mercury, its known psychological effects, and the age at which it has been given in vaccines, it would almost be a given that the novel disease would present as a neurodevelopmental disorder like autism. Conversely, the fact that autism meets the diagnostic criteria for mercury poisoning, yet has never been described as a mercury-induced disease, requires that the disorder must arise from a mode of mercury administration which has not been studied before. This would rule out other known sources of Hg like fish consumption or occupational mercury hazards, as these have been well characterized. It is possible that another under-investigated mercury route, such as maternal Hg exposures (e.g., from vaccinations, thimerosal-containing RhoGam injections during pregnancy, or dental fillings) or infant exposures to thimerosal-containing eardrops or eyedrops, might be a factor, and this cannot be ruled out. Historical Precedent Exists There is a precedent for large scale, undetected mercury poisoning of infants and toddlers in the syndrome that came to be known as acrodynia or pink disease. For over 50 years, tens of thousands of children suffered the bewildering, debilitating, and often life-long effects of this disease before its mercury etiology was established, as Ann Dally relates in The Rise and Fall of Pink Disease (1997, excerpts): Acrodynia is a serious disease that was common, at least in children's clinics, during the first half of the present (20th) century. Reports abound of children too miserable to acknowledge their mothers, such as the child who kept repeating, I am so sad. One unhappy mother was quoted as saying, My child behaves like a mad dog. In most cases the condition improved spontaneously, but was often regarded as chronic. Mortality varied from 5.5% to 33.3% and was usually about 7%. Most physicians who speculated on the causes of pink disease believed in either the infective or the nutritional theory. No one seems to have suggested that it might be due to poisoning. It was a tradition to advise student doctors to treat cases of difficult teething with the mercury powders that were eventually to be revealed as the cause of the disease. The ill-effects of mercury on the mouth had been known at least since the time of Paraclesus, but it was not until 1922 that the pediatrician, John Zahorsky, commented on the similarity between pink disease and mercury poisoning. He dismissed rather than pursued his new idea of possible mercury poisoning and suggested a theory that was more in tune with current fashion. Most doctors, even those skilled in the use of calomel, associated mercury poisoning with adults (syphilis, industrial poisoning, hatters shakes) rather than with infants. By 1935 the disease was seen in every children's out-patient clinic. The mystery began to be solved in 1945 by Dr. Josef Warkany, of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital. He and his assistant found large amounts of mercury in the urine of a child with pink disease. They did not publish their findings until 1948, but it is noteworthy that the news seems not to have spread through the small and tightly knit pediatric world, where everyone knew everyone else. It was probably because the idea was unfashionable and contrary to the conventional wisdom. The theory that mercury poisoning caused pink disease was gradually accepted, but against resistance, particularly by older men and those in powerful positions. Mercury was withdrawn from most teething powders after 1954, initially through voluntary action by the manufacturers because of adverse publicity and probably in the hope of avoiding statutory prohibition. Pink disease almost disappeared. Later in the decade the theory was widely accepted and soon pink disease was no longer part of the usual pediatric out-patient clinic. Thus, like acrodynia before it, autism may in fact be just another epidemic of mercury poisoning, this time caused by childhood vaccinal mercury rather than infant teething powders. Barriers Preventing Earlier Discovery Are Removed The priorities and methods of research experts in the autism and mercury fields have prevented the association between mercurialism and ASD to be recognized until recently. The effects on humans of mercury-containing medicinals and home remedies used to be studied quite regularly by medical researchers (Warkany and Hubbard, 1953); but since, aside from vaccinal thimerosal, such products have declined dramatically in number since the 1950s and 1960s, most mercury researchers today focus on biochemical studies or environmental sources like fish and coal plants. Some mercury experts seem surprised to learn that Hg is present in infant vaccines (authors' personal experience), and as recently as 1997, when the EPA released its massive review of extant mercury research, vaccines were not even mentioned as a potential source. Thus it is not surprising that mercury experts have never investigated thimerosal as they have, say, contaminated whale meat consumption in the Faroes Islands or Hg exposure among Amazonian goldminers. Likewise, it is not surprising that neither mercury experts nor autism professionals have ever investigated autism as a possible disease of mercury exposure. Since its discovery by Kanner, autism has been characterized in almost exclusively psychological terms. The descriptions have been such that the symptoms would be essentially unrecognizable as manifestations of poisoning to any mercury expert not looking closely. A perfect example is Kanner himself, who recorded feeding problems and vomiting in infants and concluded: Our patients, anxious to keep the outside world away, indicated this by the refusal of food. Bruno Bettleheim, who dominated autism discourse in the 1950s and 1960s and blamed the entire disorder on refrigerator mothers who forced the withdrawal of the child, asserted, the source of the anxiety is not an organic impairment but the child's evaluation of his life as being utterly destructive (1967, reported in ARI Newsletter). In 1987, Robert Sternberg would propose a unified theoretical perspective on autism by defining the disorder in terms of a triarchic theory of intelligence, and in the same publication Lorna Wing and Anthony Attwood would write: Sometimes young autistic children will stand in a dejected posture, with tears streaming down their faces, as if they suddenly felt their helplessness in the face of a world they cannot understand. Even as recently as 1995, a typical slate of articles in the dominant Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (April 1995) would consist of eight psychological pieces (example: Generativity in the Play of Young People with Autism ) and one biomedical one (on biopterin). Thus biomedical research in autism existed, but it was mostly relegated to the margins as psychology held center stage, and the symptomatic characteristics of autism continued to be presented in accord with psychological biases. In the latter part of the 1990s, the situation on both sides changed. Congressional mandate led to the public quantification of the cumulative amount of mercury in vaccines, raising interest in understanding its effects. Parent organizations like CAN and NAAR, working with the NIH and other researchers, engineered an autism research agenda which is more heavily focused on underlying physiological mechanisms of the disease. With parents already suspecting a vaccine-autism link, the environment was right for investigations focused on the link between vaccinal mercury and autism. MEDICAL SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS Affected Population The NIH (1999, web site) estimates that there are nearly half a million Americans who suffer from autism, a devastating, debilitating, and lifelong disorder. Given the role of thimerosal as a major contributing factor in ASD, basic and clinical research efforts should be focused on understanding how mercury leads to autism in susceptible individuals and on finding effective methods to address the resulting Hg damage. Such research might focus on the following areas, with others undoubtedly still to be identified: (a) Chelation methods which will work across all body tissues and especially the brain. The current standard chelators - DMPS and DMSA - appear unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Other promising but less studied chelators like alpha lipoic acid can cross the bbb (Fuchs et al, 1997) and should be studied in autism. (b) Mechanisms to induce immunity to Hg and which might possibly reverse the Th2 shift or IFNg expression which mercury causes. The work of Hu and colleagues suggests that Hg can cause an immune reaction in any individual, but some are protected by a counteractive immunosuppressive response, and Warkany and Hubbard have pointed out that individuals who are Hg-sensitive can later become immune . It may be possible to engineer these responses in autistic individuals through careful research. (c) Mechanisms which might reverse Na-Si transporter blockage in the intestines and kidney, thereby normalizing sulfate absorption. (d) Techniques to eliminate the Hg-induced epileptiform activities found in the majority of autistic children, as outlined by LeWine et al. (e) Stem cell applications in autism to repair brain damage that occurred during development. Other Disorders As pointed out by David Hartman (1998), mercury's ability to cause a wide range of common psychiatric disturbances should be considered in their diagnosis, and it might also be productive in developing hypotheses about and designing research studies for these other disorders. The disorders might include depression, OCD, dementia, anxiety, ADHD/ADD, Tourette's, and schizophrenia. Mercury may play a role in the etiology of some cases of these conditions. Conversely, investigating mercury's wide ranging effects upon neurobiological processes may lead to a quicker understanding of the organic etiologies in these other diseases which are now seen with increasing frequency. Vaccination Programs Universal compliance with the recommended vaccine schedule is a governmental, medical, and societal goal, since vaccines save lives (CDC). Our goal is not to negatively impact childhood immunization rates. Instead, we have been careful to distinguish between thimerosal and vaccines. Thimerosal is not a vaccine; it is a preservative. Except for trace amounts, vaccines without thimerosal are currently available for all routinely recommended immunizations for children under 6 years (Institute for Vaccine Safety, 1999). Furthermore, it is possible to remove mercury from existing products. Merck, for example, delivered and received FDA approval for a thimerosal-free Hepatitis B vaccine in a record-breaking two months from the time the FDA publicly encouraged manufacturers to develop thimerosal-free alternatives (Pless, 1999; Merck, 1999). Thus, any issues being raised here are related to how vaccine programs are run, not with vaccines themselves. The issues, of course, are: (i) first, how thimerosal was allowed to remain a component of the immunization program, even after 1953 when Warkany and Hubbard specifically named vaccinal mercury as a possible factor in acrodynia, or 1982 when the FDA issued a notice singling out thimerosal as especially neurotoxic as well as ineffective as a preservative (Federal Register, 1982); and (ii) second, why thimerosal remains in over 30 vaccine products today (FDA, 1999), and why the FDA, as of March 2000, has only encouraged rather than required the vaccine manufacturers to remove the thimerosal (William Egan personal communication). Although the CDC has stated that no adverse effects from thimerosal have been found other than hypersensitivity reactions, the sad fact is there have been no direct studies on the long term effects of intermittent bolus doses of ethylmercury injected in infants and toddlers. As Altman and Bland have aptly demonstrated (1995), absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. These lapses in vaccine program oversight suggest that vaccine safety studies need to be bolstered. Current practice is to track adverse reactions only if they occur within one month of the vaccination. The experience with mercury clearly shows that an adverse event may not manifest for months if not years. Studies on adverse reactions must involve long term tracking of patients; they should investigate the impact of multiple injections as well as compare reactions to vaccines with and without various additives; and sample sizes need to be large enough to include especially sensitive groups. Finally, the FDA should require manufacturers to remove all remaining thimerosal from their vaccines immediately, so that another child is not lost to this terrible disease.

According to a 2007 Centers for Disease Control report, one in 150 children in the U.S. has autism, a neurological disorder that affects development and social functioning and can cause even a precocious child to disappear into his or her own self-contained world. Autism is the fastest growing developmental disability in the U.S. It is more common than childhood cancer, diabetes and AIDS combined. These statistics are alarming to parents. By arming themselves with knowledge, parents can be prepared to distinguish between behaviors that are typical for a developing child and behaviors that need special attention. Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means every person with autism is different. At one end of the spectrum, people with Asperger\ufffds Disorder have trouble interacting in social environments but can live very independent lives. At the other end of the spectrum, someone diagnosed with Rett\ufffds Disorder may need constant care. How do parents know if their child should be evaluated for autism? There are some significant red flags which may indicate that an evaluation is appropriate. \ufffdParents usually identify concerns between the ages of 18 months to 3 years, although we have seen children as young as 3 months at Fraser,\ufffd says Pat Pulice, a licensed psychologist and autism services director at Minneapolis-based Fraser, a leading provider of autism services. Below are some signs of autism that parents should know. * Communication \ufffd Children with autism may experience delayed or lack of language development. Their use of words and gestures is unusual. They may use words with no meaning or gesture instead of using words. They may repeat words or phrases in place of responsive, back and forth communication. \ufffdA parent who sees a significant regression may want to consider an evaluation at a place like Fraser,\ufffd says Pulice. * Social Interaction \ufffd Children with autism often spend much of their time alone. They may be less responsive to social cues and interacting with others may be difficult. Often, displaying emotions (laughing, crying) that others don\ufffdt understand is common. They may find it difficult to relate to others and may be unable to make eye contact. * Sensory Impairment \ufffd Children with autism often have sensitivity in sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste. Parents might notice this if their child starts crying when exposed to bright lights or loud sounds or refuses to eat food of a certain color or texture. Children may also dislike being touched and overreact to pain or not react at all. * Play \ufffd Children with autism may not be able to play with their toys in an imaginative way, instead playing with their toys in odd, unusual ways. They may spin toys or line them up or have an inappropriate attachment to them. * Behaviors \ufffd A child with autism may be overactive or passive, have tantrums, may have no fear of danger, may show aggression and may be resistant to change. They often have repetitive behaviors such as hand-flapping that identify their excitement or upset. \ufffdParents are often the best judges of whether their child is developing normally,\ufffd says Pulice. If you suspect your child is not developing on schedule, talk to your pediatrician. And always remember a clinical diagnosis is not the end. Types of therapies available include day treatment for children as young as preschool age, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language therapy, music therapy, feeding therapy and social language groups. \ufffdThere is hope for children with autism,\ufffd says Pulice. \ufffdAt Fraser, we see children learning new skills and improving every day. Many therapies are very effective in helping children to gain skills like verbalization, social interactions and how to calm themselves. What is most important is to identify the needs early and find appropriate treatment. With treatment, children with autism can learn to manage or overcome many of the challenges they face.\ufffd For information on autism and other developmental disabilities, visit www.fraser.org.

Autism is a brain disorder that affects development. People who have autism have trouble communicating and interacting with other people. A child who has autism may seem very withdrawn, may not make eye contact with people, may not talk or play the way other children do or may repeat certain motions and behaviors over and over again.Signs of autism can vary from person to person. They can also be worse in some people than in others. People can be said to have \"low-functioning autism\" or \"high-functioning autism,\" depending upon the severity of their symptoms and the results of an IQ (intelligence) test. High-functioning autism describes autism with less severe symptoms, while low-functioning autism describes autism with more severe symptoms. Some of the more common signs are listed in the box below. Return to top Common Signs of Autism Avoids cuddling or making eye contact Does not respond to voices or other sounds Does not respond to his or her name Does not talk or does not use language properly Rocks back and forth, spins or bangs his or her head Stares at parts of an object, such as the wheels of a toy car Does not understand hand gestures or body language Does not pretend or play make-believe games Is very concerned with order, routine or ritual and becomes upset if routine is disturbed or changed Has a flat facial expression or uses a monotone voice Injures himself or herself or is unafraid of danger Return to top What causes autism? Doctors aren't sure what causes autism. Some studies have shown that the cause is genetic (runs in families). Certain medical problems or something in your child's surroundings may also play a role. In many cases, the cause of a child's autism is never known. Boys are more likely than girls to have autism. As doctors continue to study autism, they may learn more about what causes it. Return to top Can vaccines cause autism? No. Good research has shown that there is no link between autism and childhood vaccinations (\"shots\") like the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.Vaccines are an important part of your child's health. If you have any concerns about the safety of vaccines, talk to your doctor. Return to top A note about vaccines Sometimes the amount of a certain vaccine cannot keep up with the number of people who need it. More info... Return to top How is autism diagnosed? There is no lab test that can detect autism. Autism is often diagnosed when a baby or toddler doesn't behave as expected for his or her age. If your doctor thinks your child has autism, he or she will probably suggest that your child see a child psychiatrist or other specialist. The specialist will probably test your child to see if he or she shows signs of autism. Return to top If my child has autism, does it mean that he or she is mentally retarded? Many children with autism are also mentally retarded, but others are not. It can be hard to test autistic children because they do not respond to questions in the same way other children do. An autism expert can give your child special tests that will tell you more about his or her condition.Some autistic children have special skills, such as the ability to do complex math problems in their heads. However, abilities like these are very rare. Return to top My baby seemed fine. Why does he or she seem to have autism now? We don't know why this happens, but approximately 20% of children with autism seem to develop normally for the first 1 to 2 years. Then, these babies experience what doctors call a regression. This means that they lose abilities that they had before, such as the ability to talk. Return to top Are there more cases of autism now than there used to be? More children are being diagnosed with autism. However, we're not sure if this really means that more children have autism. It may mean that parents, teachers and doctors are becoming better at recognizing the signs of autism. Return to top How is autism treated? Several treatments for autism are available. Research has shown that very intense behavior and language therapy may help some children. There is no medicine that treats autism itself, but medicine may help with some of the symptoms of autism, such as aggressive behavior or sleeplessness. Talk to your doctor about what kind of treatment is best for your child.Children don't \"outgrow\" autism, and it cannot be cured. With therapy, some children may improve as they mature. The individual child's language skills and overall intellectual level may help predict what will happen with his of her case of autism. Return to top If I have one child with autism, am I more likely to have another one? Brothers and sisters of children who have autism have about a 5% chance of developing autism themselves. There also seems to be a higher risk (10% to 40%) of another disability, such as a learning disability, in siblings of children who have autism.If you're thinking about having more children, talk with your doctor about whether it would help you to talk with a genetic counselor. Return to top What is Asperger's syndrome (AS)? Asperger's syndrome (AS) is a condition very similar to high-functioning autism. Typically, people with AS have a normal IQ and some may exhibit an exceptional skill or interest in a particular area. While verbal language development is considered normal, people with AS can have trouble using this language correctly in social situations. They may also have difficulty communicating in nonverbal ways such as making eye contact, understanding facial expressions and using body gestures. General social skills such as developing relationships and adjusting to new situations can also be affected. Even so, people who have AS can often learn how to deal with their difficulties through behavior and communication therapy.

The proceeding combines the cases of 5,000 families with autistic children seeking compensation from the federal vaccine injury fund, which comes from a 75-cent tax on every dose of vaccine. Families of children hurt by vaccines for example, who suffer fatal allergic reactions are paid from it but are unable to sue the vaccine manufacturer. The fund has never accepted that vaccines cause autism; the omnibus proceeding, with nine test cases based on three different theories, was begun in 2002. The antivaccine groups also lost the first three cases, which were decided in February 2009 by the same three judges, known as special masters. All three rulings were upheld on their first appeals. Defenders of vaccines said they were pleased by Friday s decision, while opponents were dismissive, saying they would never get a fair ruling from the omnibus arrangement. In the three cases brought against the government, by the parents of Jordan King, Colin R. Dwyer and William Mead, all three special masters used strong language in dismissing the expert evidence from the families lawyers. The master in the King ruling emphasized that it was not a close case and extremely unlikely that Jordan s autism was connected to his vaccines. The master in the Dwyer case wrote that many parents relied upon practitioners and researchers who peddled hope, not opinions grounded in science and medicine. Patricia Campbell-Smith, the master in the Mead case, also dismissed two subarguments made by a few opponents of vaccines, saying they have not shown either that certain children are genetically hypersusceptible to mercury or that certain children are predisposed to have difficulty excreting mercury. She also echoed a contention by vaccine defenders that a shot is safer than a tuna sandwich. A normal fish-eating diet by pregnant mothers is more likely to deposit mercury in the brain than vaccines are, she wrote. In a telephone press conference after the rulings, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children s Hospital of Philadelphia and the inventor of a rotavirus vaccine from which he receives royalties, praised the decisions, saying: This hypothesis has already had its day in scientific court, but in America we like to have our day in literal court. Fortunately, we now have these rulings. Fears of thimerosal emerged more than a decade ago and have cast a pall over vaccines ever since, even though it has been removed from most of them. The fear has caused some parents to avoid them and made outbreaks of diseases like measles and whooping cough more likely. Even with this decision, Dr. Offit said, it s very hard to unscare people after you ve scared them. The Coalition for Vaccine Safety, a group of organizations that believe vaccines cause autism, dismissed the rulings. The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court, said Rebecca Estepp, of the coalition s steering committee. Government attorneys defend a government program using government-funded science before government judges. Where s the justice in that? The coalition claims to represent 75,000 families. Amy Carson, founder of Moms Against Mercury, who has a son with brain damage, called the vaccine court arrangement like the mice overseeing the cheese. The vaccine injury fund and the court overseeing it were created in 1988 after judgments in state court lawsuits over vaccines became so inconsistent and so expensive that vaccine companies started quitting the American market. The third theory, that measles vaccine causes autism, is still to be ruled on by the special masters. But Lisa Randall, a lawyer with the Immunization Action Coalition, which defends vaccines, said she believed some of the test cases had been abandoned by the families that brought them after the 2009 decisions dismissed a variant of the same theory. brain American 10/03/13 Coalition for Vaccine Safety William Mead Philadelphia Paul Offit Rebecca Estepp America Offit United States Court Federal Claims Autism Proceeding Jordan King Colin R.

At first, autistic children were thought to suffer from schizophrenia or emotional trauma. Then, aloof and unloving \"refrigerator mothers\" were blamed for their children's odd behavior. Now considered a spectrum disorder, autism ranges from its \"classic\" state to Asperger's Syndrome, characterized by social and communication difficulties but average to superior intelligence. Children with the disorder may exhibit repetitive behaviors as well, such as hand-flapping, head-banging or rocking back and forth. Those with classic autism generally don't speak, seem unaware of the outside world and often require institutionalization. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), autism rates have climbed from about one in 2,500 children in the 1980s to between one and four in 500 today, but it's unclear whether the number of cases is rising or greater public awareness and broader diagnostic criteria have brought more cases to light. Autism: Why is it on the Rise? by Ela Schwartz in the Long Island Press. Used by permission. Luke Gilmore has come a long way in the past few years. The 5-year-old boy used to avoid eye contact and would spend his time staring out the window or racing distractedly around the house. Now he plays with other children and can even identify about 40 words by pointing them out to his teachers. But Luke's father, John Gilmore of Long Beach, says his son hasn't spoken a word since he was about a year old. Luke has been diagnosed with autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder whose causes remain unknown. Gilmore believes Luke's autism was caused by mercury poisoning via three vaccines containing thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used in childhood vaccines since the 1930s. In 1999, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended that manufacturers reduce thimerosal content from about 25 micrograms per shot to trace amounts, although older vaccines may still be on the market. But the government has not officially identified mercury as a cause of autism. Indeed, many medical professionals and even other parents like the Gilmores say the correlation isn't clear. Luke's parents began noticing changes after his first vaccination, at the age of 2 months, when he developed eczema and asthma. After another round of vaccinations, at 8 months of age, Luke stopped making eye contact and would alternate between being \"spacey and hyperactive,\" says Gilmore. At about 1 year, Luke got his third round of vaccines and \"all hell broke loose,\" as his father puts it. \"He'd just bounce off the walls constantly, had gastrointestinal problems and his eczema was out of control,\" Gilmore remembers. \"We knew something was really wrong. We'd seen three distinct changes in our son after three rounds of vaccines.\" Gilmore is not alone in his belief that autism is a medically caused catastrophe. Many parents with autistic children have joined groups that seek to eliminate mercury from vaccines altogether. Gilmore is president of one such group-the New York Metro chapter of the National Autism Association. Others include the Coalition for SAFE MINDs (Sensible Action For Ending Mercury-Induced Neurological Disorders), No Mercury and Generation Rescue, all of whose members say their children were developing normally until regressing into the desolate world of autism between the ages of 2 and 7. Their proactivity was rewarded this summer when Gov. George Pataki signed into law a bill limiting the use of thimerosal in vaccines for pregnant women and children. The bill was powered by Assemb. Harvey Weisenberg. A former educator, Weisenberg is familiar with the needs and issues facing children with physical and mental disabilities. Determined to improve the quality of life for disabled people and their families, he spearheaded the recently passed legislation that limits the amounts of thimerosal in vaccines given to children under 3 or pregnant women. \"Although there's no evidence thimerosal is the cause, we're aware mercury is toxic and poison, so why inject this into a child?\" he says. But some parents say this isn't enough. They want thimerosal banned in all 50 states and financial compensation for what they consider to be injuries caused by vaccines. \"I have three children with autism, so clearly there's a genetic basis,\" says Michele Iallonardi of Hauppauge. \"But I believe that my children would not have autism if they hadn't been exposed to thimerosal. Some people are genetically predisposed-their bodies don't have the ability to get rid of the thimerosal injected into them with their vaccines. My children are a perfect example.\" Iallonardi says her eldest son, Jackson, 4, suffered developmental delays from early infancy, and because he had health problems, doctors recommended two dosages of the flu shot when he was 2 years old. \"His behaviors got worse,\" she says, \"and about a month later he was diagnosed with autism.\" After that, Iallonardi stopped vaccinating her twins, Bennett and Luca, now 2, when they turned 3 months. She says their autism is not as severe as that of their sibling. AUTISM ASCENDING Autism was first described in the 1940s, but the condition was poorly understood and little known until the 1990s. At first, autistic children were thought to suffer from schizophrenia or emotional trauma. Then, aloof and unloving \"refrigerator mothers\" were blamed for their children's odd behavior. Now considered a spectrum disorder, autism ranges from its \"classic\" state to Asperger's Syndrome, characterized by social and communication difficulties but average to superior intelligence. Children with the disorder may exhibit repetitive behaviors as well, such as hand-flapping, head-banging or rocking back and forth. Those with classic autism generally don't speak, seem unaware of the outside world and often require institutionalization. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), autism rates have climbed from about one in 2,500 children in the 1980s to between one and four in 500 today, but it's unclear whether the number of cases is rising or greater public awareness and broader diagnostic criteria have brought more cases to light. Densely populated Long Island has a high number of autistic children. May-Lynn Andresen, a registered nurse and the senior administrative manager at the Fay J. Lindner Center for Autism at North Shore-Long Island Jewish (NSLIJ) Health System in Bethpage, is the parent of a child with an autism spectrum disorder. Based on stats provided by the CDC, Andresen estimates that there may be as many as 18,000 autistic children in Nassau, Suffolk and Queens. \"Autism is a big issue for us here,\" she says. EVIDENCE OF HARM David Kirby, a Brooklyn-based journalist, first heard about the thimerosal theory in 2002. He was skeptical until learning that a rider tacked on to the Homeland Security Act-dubbed the \"Eli Lilly Protection Act\" after the primary manufacturer-absolved pharmaceutical companies from liability for damages caused by the vaccine additive. The rider was repealed in 2003. Kirby chronicled the experiences of parents who formed the Coalition for SAFE MINDs in Evidence of Harm-Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic: A Medical Controversy. Published in April 2005, the book investigates claims that the FDA failed to total up the amounts of thimerosal in the increasing number of vaccines given to children and conduct safety studies, thus exposing children to amounts of thimerosal that far exceeded federal safety limits. The book also alleges that the CDC manipulated data from the federal Vaccine Safety Database to eliminate a statistically significant link between thimerosal and autism, ADHD and speech delay, and that the CDC refused to disclose data and records until required to do so under the Freedom of Information Act. Kirby says government officials refused requests for interviews. \"I would have been willing to publish anything they had to say,\" he says, stressing that \"evidence\" of harm is not the same as \"proof.\" People should reach their own conclusions after reading the book, in which Kirby does not take an anti-vaccine stance, he adds. \"If I had children, I would have them vaccinated,\" Kirby says. \"Children can lose their sight or hearing, become disfigured, even die from these diseases.\" Thanks to vaccinations, few of us recall the days when catching diseases such as diphtheria or measles was a childhood rite of passage. Smallpox has been eradicated; polio is rarely seen outside of the Third World. But when vaccination rates drop, diseases regain a foothold, as Japan, England and Sweden discovered when whooping cough and measles re-appeared after parents fearful of side effects stopped inoculating their children. IN SEARCH OF ANSWERS While there have been many studies aimed at unearthing the causes of autism, none has proven a link between the disorder and thimerosal. For the most part, the medical community attributes autism to genetic factors, and statistics do show a correlation. According to the CDC, if one child in a family has autism, the odds that a sibling will be affected increase significantly. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and independent researchers, who are trying to identify genes that could cause autistic symptoms, say these traits often run in families. That's something many parents of autistic children acknowledge, even as they insist there's more to blame for the condition than just chromosomes and genes. Not everyone in the autism community believes that mercury's to blame. Many cite the fact that the CDC and other public health organizations conducted five major epidemiological (large-population) studies examining the health records of hundreds of thousands of children in the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), which pored over the data, those studies show no proof that autism is linked to thimerosal. Proponents of the theory that thimerosal and autism are linked counter that the IOM failed to give equal weight to biological and toxicological laboratory studies showing the negative neurological effects of thimerosal. \"Autism could be caused by any number of factors, but the potential for thimerosal to be one of them is there, based on research done by qualified professionals,\" says Chris Petrosino, the parent of a son with autism and co-president of the Nassau/Suffolk chapter of the 500-members-strong Autism Society of America, which supported the legislation to remove thimerosal from vaccines. Those on the other side of the fence say mercury-blaming parents are upset-seeing your child regress into autism is traumatic-but that emotion is no substitute for science and facts. Retired Roslyn dentist Marvin Schissel is an adviser to the American Council on Science and Health and the National Council Against Health Fraud. His adult son was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at age 25. Schissel sees no point in funding more thimerosal studies, since the preservative has been removed from most vaccines and studies have shown no concrete connection. \"Why keep wasting money and energy with this issue when we could be investigating other, more promising areas?\" Schissel asks. Marty Schwartzman, too, has his doubts about the thimerosal theory. The Bayside resident, president of the Long Island chapter of the National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR), says his twins, Allyson and Robby, now 12, did not show signs of regression after receiving vaccinations. \"They were both delayed, but then, for some reason, Allyson took off,\" Schwartzman says. Now a typical seventh-grader, Allyson wants to work with autistic children when she grows up. Her brother has autism and attends the School for Language and Communi-cation Development in Glen Cove. Schwartzman, however, considers himself open-minded and doesn't discount any potential links to the disorder that affects his son. \"I go to a lot of presentations and read papers [about autism], and [many things] sound plausible, but I'm not a chemist and I don't understand the structure of cells,\" he says. \"I think we need to explore the cause of autism to the fullest extent.\" Those who do blame thimerosal are encouraged by new developments. The Los Angeles Times published a Merck company memo warning of the dangers of high mercury doses through increased immunizations. The memo was dated 1991, eight years before the FDA recommended that thimerosal be removed from vaccines. In California, autism rates are dropping, in keeping with the prediction of lower rates after thimerosal's phase-out. The University of Texas found that school districts in environments with high mercury levels had the highest rates of special-education services, and that autism rates increased by 17 percent for every 1,000 pounds of mercury released. The emissions came from coal-burning plants, with Texas releasing more than any other state. FUTURE FALLOUT Autism affects more than the child diagnosed with it. Parents exhaust themselves trying to fill the child's needs. Siblings feel neglected. Financial and marital woes often set in because insurance seldom pays for expensive newer therapies and one parent may have to quit work to care for the child. And our society is responsible for caring for a staggering number of autistic individuals. Robert Krakow, an attorney who represents vaccine-injury cases and is the father of a child with autism, is also chairman of the board of Lifespire, a not-for-profit organization that provides housing and services for 5,000 disabled adults in the New York City region. Krakow says that if you multiply the cost of special-education services for a child over several years, then add about $225,000 that's spent per year on each adult resident at an institution, the cost comes out to about $13 million to care for an autistic individual who requires housing and services over his or her lifetime. Andresen says that huge numbers of developmentally disabled Long Island children need to be helped and supported, brought in to local school districts and protected from teasing and bullying. \"Communities need to rally and provide opportunities for them to practice social skills in different environments and support them with jobs,\" she says. \"We need to understand that it truly takes a village.\" This article appears courtesy of the Long Island Press.

Autism is a type of pervasive developmental disorder that interferes with a person's ability to communicate with and relate to others. It is a lifelong condition involving a biological or organic defect in the brain. Signs of autism almost always develop before three years of age, although age at diagnosis varies. The current statistics state that the prevalence of autism is approximately 1 in every 166 persons, and this statistic continues to rise. The severity of autism varies, and no two persons with autism hold identical characteristics. It is much more common in boys, and four out of every five children diagnosed with autism are male. If you think that your child may have autism, seek a professional diagnosis as soon as possible. Early intervention greatly increases your child's chance of success in a typically-developing environment. What are the symptoms of Autism? All people with autism have difficulties with social interactions and relationships. There is always some difficulty with verbal and nonverbal communication, and language development in children with autism is almost always delayed. Children with autism have limited, repetitive and stereotypical patterns of behavior, interests and play, such as repetitive body rocking or hand flapping, unusual attachments to objects, and obsessions with routines or rituals. Children with autism also typically have a variety of sensory issues, including either a hyper- or a hypo-sensitivity to various forms of sensory input (sound, light, touch, etc). Some children with autism also have a cognitive delay, but many children with this diagnosis have average or above average intelligence. Children with this diagnosis can range from very high functioning to very low functioning, depending on the levels of impairment. What is Asperger's Syndrome? Asperger's Syndrome is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by severe and sustained impairment in social interaction, development of restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests and activities. These characteristics result in clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning and development. In contrast to autism, there are no clinically significant delays in language or cognition. There are also no delays in self help skills or in adaptive behavior, other than those that are involved in social interactions and relationships. Children with Asperger's Syndrome often have obsessional interests or activities that further impede their social development. It is more common in males, and is often diagnosed later than autism, usually after the age of 5. Asperger's is not easily recognizable, and many children are misdiagnosed or do not receive a diagnosis until much later. What are Autism Spectrum Disorders? Autistic spectrum disorder is an umbrella term for all of the diagnoses that include autistic characteristics. This includes Autism, Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Asperger's Syndrome, Rett's Syndrome, and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. Many young children are diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder instead of a subcategory, because symptom intensity and impairment level often change as the child ages. This allows for more flexibility in treatment options and can result in a more specific diagnosis later in life. What is ABA therapy? Applied behavior analytic therapy is the only empirically-validated form of intervention for young children with autism. In ABA therapy, the client's behavior is assessed through observations that focus on exactly what the client does, when the client does it, at what rate, and what happens before (antecedents) and what happens after (consequences) behavior. Strengths and weaknesses are specified in this way. Skills that each client shows deficiencies in are broken down into small steps and taught in learnable chunks. The therapy is usually very intensive and is done on a one-to-one ratio of therapist to child. ABA focuses on observable behavior and data collection to allow for monitoring of progress and alteration of programming as needed, to ensure the best possible intervention for the targeted child.

Do you offer ABA therapy to adults? Not at this time. The primary emphasis of The Parker Autism Foundation is to provide early intensive intervention to decrease the need for services at later ages. We are always available to connect you with the services that would better suit the needs of older persons with autism. Who can receive an ABA scholarship? Any child who has been diagnosed with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder whose family qualifies financially. Do you offer other scholarships to children or their families? Yes! We offer scholarships for the children's workshop, social groups, parent training classes, and ABA supplies. What determines who gets a scholarship? Anyone that financially qualifies and has a child who has received a diagnosis for an Autistic Spectrum Disorder is eligible. Each application will be reviewed by the scholarship committee, and eligible families will be asked to come in for an interview. (All scholarships are based on availability of funds). How can I use the scholarship? Scholarships may be used at our foundation or with a Parker Autism Foundation-approved center, school, or therapist. How do I apply for a scholarship?

From: Dr. Chun WongDay in and day out, researchers are looking for treatments for the often life-changing condition that affects over 1% of children between 3 and 17. Though a cure for Autism may or may not be around the corner, there are often new advancements, and specialists are trying to find the missing link that will answer the difficult questions. One route that many researchers take, is associating Autism with other similar conditions in which there are successful treatments for. Another way, is to take a look at similarly structured conditions that might not have a cure yet, but have had their own advancements. The possibility of joint-discoveries gives researchers another avenue to explore when searching for cures and treatments for Autism. One of the conditions that appears to have many of the same characteristics as Autism is one that affects over 26 millions people worldwide. Alzheimer\ufffds traditionally affects the elderly population, but with many of the same symptoms as Autism the one substantial difference is simply the age range of the people that the conditions effect. Autism traditionally affects adolescents while Alzheimer\ufffds tends to attack the elderly population. Setting aside this key difference, Autism and Alzheimer\ufffds have a striking amount of similarities. Autism shares a number of symptoms with Alzheimer\ufffds including those on both physical and psychological level. Both conditions often leave their sufferers with the tendency to become catatonic at times, have attention transition issues, become easily distracted and/or disoriented and have difficulty with language comprehension. The similarities between the two conditions are in the hundreds - particularly in the similar brain patterns and symptoms. These likenesses leave you thinking - could Alzheimer\ufffds hold a piece of the puzzle that is finding a cure for Autism? There is currently research being done on a common drug, Namenda which slows the rate of decline in Alzheimer\ufffds patients. Clinicians are studying the possibility that the drug will assist in the treatment of Autism by targeting the same areas in which Alzheimer\ufffds Patients are affected. 8:00 PM 598 Views 2 eProps 1 Comment brain Autism vaccine additive thimerosal is not to blame for autism, a special federal court ruled Friday in a long-running battle by parents convinced there is a connection. While expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism. \"Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration,\" special master George Hastings Jr. wrote. But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case. The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court. The parents presented expert witnesses who argued mercury can have a variety of effects on the brain, but the ruling said none of them offered opinions on the cause of autism in the three specific cases argued. They testified that mercury can affect a number of biological processes, including abnormal metabolism in children. Special master Denise K. Vowell noted that in order to succeed in their action, the parents would have to show \"the exquisitely small amounts of mercury\" that reach the brain from vaccines can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts ... from other sources do not. The ruling said the parents were arguing that the effects from mercury in vaccines differ from mercury's known effects on the brain. Vowell concluded that the parents had failed to establish that their child's condition was caused or aggravated by mercury from vaccines. Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines. The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism. The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available. The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had \"already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.\" But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, \"it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them.\" On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. \"The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,\" Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement. SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling. \"The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology,\" the goup said. The advocacy group Autism Speaks said \"the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases.\" However, while research has found no overall connection between autism and vaccines, the group said it would back research to determine if some individuals might be at increased risk because of genetic or medical conditions. Meanwhile, in reaction to the concerns of parents, thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines in the United States. In Friday's action the court ruled in three different cases, each concluding that the preservative has no connection to autism. The trio of rulings can offer reassurance to parents scared about vaccinating their babies because of a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, are on the rise. The U.S. Court of Claims is different from many other courts: The families involved didn't have to prove the inoculations definitely caused the complex neurological disorder, just that they probably did. More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation through the government's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the rulings dealt with test cases to settle which if any claims had merit. Autism is best known for impairing a child's ability to communicate and interact. Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it's unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosis. Worry about a vaccine link first arose in 1998 when a British physician, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published a medical journal article linking a particular type of autism and bowel disease to the measles vaccine. The study was later discredited. Copyright 2010 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Autism (aw-tis-um) is a very serious brain disorder that affects how children communicate. Autism makes it hard for children to think, feel, play, or talk like other children. Autism effects every child differently. Some children are autistic from birth. Other children begin to show signs of autism by 3 years of age. Many autistic children are also mentally slow. Autism is seen about 4 times more often in boys than in girls. Your child may have signs of autism for the rest of his life. Some autistic children learn skills as they get older that help them work and live in their community. Other autistic children need to have someone care for them forever. Medicine and other treatments may be used to treat autism. Causes: It is not clearly known what causes autism. Scientists are beginning to understand that problems with how a baby's brain develops before and after birth may cause it. Autistic children have brains that look and work in a different way than normal children. Autism may run in families. Signs and Symptoms: Autistic children have many different signs and symptoms. Your child may have some or many of the following. Avoids looking at you or other people. Cannot sit still for any amount of time and moves quickly from one activity to the next. Cries all the time, or cried all the time when he was a baby. Does not like being touched. Does not understand or hear when you talk to him. Does the same thing over and over like head banging, body rocking, or hand twisting. Gets upset if his routine is changed, like changing what he usually eats or drinks. Has a bad temper tantrum because a change upsets him. Has problems talking and seems to have a language of his own. He may say the same words over and over in a high sounding voice. Seems not to know you from other people and strangers. Seems not to have fun when playing, and does not have normal friendships like other children. Seizures (convulsions). Sniffs or licks toys. Stiffens up when you pick him up. Tries to hurt himself or others by biting, hitting, or kicking. Very anxious (nervous) or changes moods quickly. Very quiet as a baby or did not want to be cuddled or held. Will not come to you to be comforted when he is ill, hurt, or tired. Or, does not seem to feel his injuries or pain at all. Care: Your child may need to be put in the hospital for tests and treatment. Caregivers may need to do many tests like blood tests, hearing tests, visual tests, a MRI or PET scan. There is no cure for autism, but treatment may help your child live a more normal life. Treatment is different for every autistic child. What treatment works for one child may not work for your child. It is best if treatment for your child's autism is started early. Caregivers may suggest one or more of the following treatments. Behavior (b-hav-yer) Modification (mah-duh-fuh-k-shun) Therapy. Counseling. Medicine. Occupational (ok-u-pa-shun-ull) therapy. Physical (fizz-ih-kull) therapy. Speech therapy. Coping: Your family may feel scared, confused, and anxious because of your child's autism. As parents you may blame yourself and think you have done something wrong. These feelings are normal. Talk about them with your child's caregiver or someone close to you. Ask your child's caregiver about support groups for children with autism. Such a group can give your child and the family support and information. You may want to write or call the following support groups.

Who is affected by autism? How does autism affect communication? How are the speech and language problems of autism treated? What research is being conducted to improve communication in children with autism? Where can I find additional information? What is autism? Autism is one of the autism spectrum disorders, a group of conditions that vary in their severity and the age at which a child first may show symptoms. Autism spectrum disorders fall under a broader category known as pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). PDDs cause delays in many areas of childhood development, such as the development of skills to communicate and interact socially. Autism typically is diagnosed during a child s second year and is lifelong, although symptoms may lessen over time. There is no cure for autism, but appropriate treatments can help a child develop life skills to function more independently. Top Who is affected by autism? Autism is one of the most common developmental disabilities. It affects people of every race, ethnic group, and socioeconomic background. Boys are four times more likely to have autism than are girls. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), autism spectrum disorders were found to affect an average of one out of every 110 8-year-old children. Top How does autism affect communication? The word autism has its origin in the Greek word autos, which means self. Children with autism often are self-absorbed and seem to exist in a private world where they are unable to successfully communicate and interact with others. Children with autism may have difficulty developing language skills and understanding what others say to them. They also may have difficulty communicating nonverbally, such as through hand gestures, eye contact, and facial expressions. Not every child with an autism spectrum disorder will have a language problem. A child s ability to communicate will vary, depending upon his or her intellectual and social development. Some children with autism may be unable to speak. Others may have rich vocabularies and be able to talk about specific subjects in great detail. Most children with autism have little or no problem pronouncing words. The majority, however, have difficulty using language effectively, especially when they talk to other people. Many have problems with the meaning and rhythm of words and sentences. They also may be unable to understand body language and the nuances of vocal tones. Below are some patterns of language use and behaviors that are often found in children with autism. Repetitive or rigid language. Often, children with autism who can speak will say things that have no meaning or that seem out of context in conversations with others. For example, a child may count from one to five repeatedly. Or a child may continuously repeat words he or she has heard, a condition called echolalia. Immediate echolalia occurs when the child repeats words someone has just said. For example, the child may respond to a question by asking the same question. In delayed echolalia, the child will repeat words heard at an earlier time. The child may say Do you want something to drink? whenever he or she asks for a drink. Some children with autism speak in a high-pitched or singsong voice or use robot-like speech. Other children with autism may use stock phrases to start a conversation. For example, a child may say My name is Tom, even when he talks with friends or family. Still others may repeat what they hear on television programs or commercials. Narrow interests and exceptional abilities. Some children may be able to deliver an in-depth monologue about a topic that holds their interest, even though they may not be able to carry on a two-way conversation about the same topic. Others have musical talents or an advanced ability to count and do math calculations. Approximately 10 percent of children with autism show savant skills, or extremely high abilities in specific areas, such as calendar calculation, music, or math. Uneven language development. Many children with autism develop some speech and language skills, but not to a normal level of ability, and their progress is usually uneven. For example, they may develop a strong vocabulary in a particular area of interest very quickly. Many children have good memories for information just heard or seen. Some children may be able to read words before 5 years of age, but they may not comprehend what they have read. They often do not respond to the speech of others and may not respond to their own names. As a result, children with autism sometimes are mistakenly thought to have a hearing problem. Poor nonverbal conversation skills. Children with autism often are unable to use gestures such as pointing to an object to give meaning to their speech. They often avoid eye contact, which can make them seem rude, uninterested, or inattentive. Without meaningful gestures or the language to communicate, many children with autism become frustrated in their attempts to make their feelings and needs known. They may act out their frustrations through vocal outbursts or other inappropriate behaviors. Top How are the speech and language problems of autism treated? If a doctor suspects a child has autism or another developmental disability, he or she usually will refer the child to a variety of specialists, including a speech-language pathologist. This is a health professional trained to treat individuals with voice, speech, and language disorders. The speech-language pathologist will perform a comprehensive evaluation of the child s ability to communicate and design an appropriate treatment program. In addition, the pathologist might make a referral for audiological testing to make sure the child s hearing is normal. Teaching children with autism how to communicate is essential in helping them reach their full potential. There are many different approaches to improve communication skills in a child with autism. The best treatment program begins early, during the preschool years, and is tailored to the child s age and interests. It also will address both the child s behavior and communication skills and offer regular reinforcement of positive actions. Most children with autism respond well to highly structured, specialized programs. Parents or primary caregivers as well as other family members should be involved in the treatment program so it will become part of the child s daily life. For some younger children, improving verbal communication is a realistic goal of treatment. Parents and caregivers can increase a child s chance of reaching this goal by paying attention to his or her language development early on. Just as toddlers learn to crawl before they walk, children first develop pre-language skills before they begin to use words. These skills include using eye contact, gestures, body movements, and babbling and other vocalizations to help them communicate. Children who lack these skills may be evaluated and treated by a speech-language pathologist to prevent further developmental delays. For slightly older children with autism, basic communication training often emphasizes the functional use of language, such as learning to hold a conversation with another person, which includes staying on topic and taking turns speaking. Experts estimate that as many as 25 percent of all children with autism may never develop verbal language skills. For some of these children, the goal may be to acquire gestured communication, such as the use of sign language. For others, the goal may be to communicate by means of a symbol system in which pictures are used to convey thoughts. Symbol systems can range from picture boards or cards to sophisticated electronic devices that generate speech through the use of buttons that represent common items or actions. Top What research is being conducted to improve communication in children with autism? The federal government s Combating Autism Act of 2006 brought attention to the need to expand research and improve coordination among all of the components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that fund autism research. These include the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which is the principal institute for autism research at the NIH, along with the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute on Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Together, these five institutes have established the Autism Centers of Excellence (ACE), a program of research centers and networks at universities across the country. Here, scientists study a broad range of topics, from basic science investigations that explore the molecular and genetic components of autism to translational research studies that test new types of behavioral interventions. Some of these studies, which could be testing new treatments or interventions, might be of interest to parents of children with autism. Go to http://clinicaltrials.gov and search on autism for information about current trials, their locations, and who may participate. The NIDCD supports additional research to improve the lives of people with autism and their families. Recently, a group of NIDCD-funded researchers developed recommendations calling for a standardized approach to evaluate language skills in young children with autism spectrum disorders. The new benchmarks will make it easier, and more accurate, to compare the effectiveness of different intervention strategies. NIDCD-funded researchers in universities and organizations across the country are also looking at: Better ways to predict early in infancy if a child is at risk for an autism spectrum disorder. Whether or not treatment interventions for at-risk infants can influence the development of speech perception and speech preferences. How infants with autism spectrum disorders visually scan their environment during their earliest social interactions and how this influences their development of language and communication skills. How genes and other potential factors predispose individuals to autism spectrum disorders. Top Where can I get additional information? Additional information from other centers and institutes at the NIH that participate in autism research is available at http://health.nih.gov/topic/Autism. In addition, the NIDCD maintains a directory of organizations that provide information on the normal and disordered processes of hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, and language.

Children who have problems in these areas are sometimes said to have an autistic spectrum disorder because the severity of symptoms varies greatly. Autism affects about 1 in 150 children in the United States (1, 2). More children than ever are being diagnosed with autism. The rates of autism are about 10 times higher than in the 1980s, though much or all of this increase may be due to improved awareness and changes in how autism is diagnosed (1). What are the symptoms of autism?Children with autism have a number of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe. Symptoms include: Difficulty interacting with others and making friends. Communication problems, both with spoken language and nonverbal gestures. About 40 percent of affected children do not talk at all (2). Insistence on the same routine. Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping. Some degree of mental retardation or learning disabilities (in many but not all affected children). Each child with autism is unique, but some common characteristics and behaviors may include (2, 3): Repeats words Doesn't play ?pretend? games Doesn't point at objects or wave ?bye-bye? Is overly active Has frequent temper tantrums Avoids eye contact Has difficulty starting or maintaining conversation Does not respond to being called by name Repeats actions again and again Focuses on single subject or activity Wants to be alone Is overly sensitive to the way things feel, sound, taste or smell Dislikes being held or cuddled Has sleep disturbances Lacks fear in risky situations Is aggressive Hurts himself Loses skills (for example, stops saying words he used to say) Children with a mild autistic spectrum disorder called Asperger syndrome share some of the features of autism. However, children with Asperger syndrome have normal intelligence and learn to speak at the expected age. When is autism diagnosed? A child with autism usually does not look different from other children. The child may appear to develop normally for the first year or so of life. But during the second year of life, some children with autism begin to fall behind in social skills, fail to develop speech, or even lose skills that they had previously acquired. Autism is often diagnosed around age 3, though it can sometimes be diagnosed as early as 18 months (2). How is autism diagnosed?There is no medical test to diagnose autism. Health care providers generally diagnose autism by observing a child's behavior and by using screening tests that measure a number of characteristics and behaviors associated with autism. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all children be screened for autism at their 18-, 24- and 30-month well-child visits (2). If a screening test suggests a possible problem, the provider may do additional tests or recommend evaluation by a specialist. Who is at risk of autism?Autism occurs in all racial, social and educational groups. Boys are about 4 times as likely as girls to be affected (2). Siblings of an affected child may be at increased risk for autism, though the risk appears fairly low (2 to 8 percent) (2). What causes autism?While the causes of autism are poorly understood, scientists do know that autism is not caused by poor parenting or other social factors. It is a biological disorder that appears to be associated with subtle abnormalities in specific structures or functions in the brain. Both genetic and environmental factors appear to play a role in the disorder. Scientists believe that at least a dozen genes on different chromosomes may contribute (3). In a minority of cases, other genetic diseases, such as fragile X syndrome (mental retardation and behavioral problems) and tuberous sclerosis (non-cancerous tumors affecting the brain and other organs), may play a role (2). Certain infections that occur before birth (such as rubella and cytomegalovirus) have been associated with autism (2). Do childhood vaccines contribute to autism?Childhood vaccines, including the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine, do not cause autism. Some suspect that this vaccine, given around 12 to 15 months of age, contributes to autism because children sometimes begin to display symptoms of autism around the time they are vaccinated. Most likely, this is the age when symptoms of the disorder commonly begin, even if a child is not vaccinated. Another reason that childhood vaccines were suspected of playing a role in autism is that, until recently, they included a preservative called thimerosol that contains mercury. Since 2002, all routine childhood vaccines have been free of thimerosol. The exception is the flu shot, and thimerosol-free versions are available (4). While higher doses of certain forms of mercury may affect brain development, studies suggest that thimerosal does not. In 2004, an Institute of Medicine panel concluded that neither the MMR vaccine nor thimerosol-containing vaccines are associated with autism (5). How is autism treated?Children often show great improvement in symptoms with intensive behavioral treatment beginning during the preschool years (2, 4). An individualized treatment program can begin as early as age 2 or 3 and continue through the school years. There is no cure for autism. However, some children benefit from medications that help improve their behavioral symptoms so that they are better able to learn. Some commonly used medications include antidepressants, antipsychotics and stimulants. One such medication is Ritalin, which is commonly prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A new anti-psychotic called risperidone (Risperdal) is the only drug that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for autistic behaviors, such as aggression, self-injury and temper tantrums (4).

The cause of autism in children is unknown, but researchers generally feel that it lies in a malfunction of the central nervous system, not in the way parents have treated them or in other aspects of their environment. The term is sometimes applied, more loosely, to adults who are extremely self-absorbed and who see things in terms of their hopes and fantasies rather than realistically. Cultural Dictionary dictionary.reference.com/browse/autism Autism276 http://www.autismcenter.org/autism_faq.aspx Autism FAQ Following are some frequently asked questions relating to autism spectrum disorders. If you have additional questions, please email sarrc@autismcenter.org and our family services director will answer your question promptly. What is the definition of autism spectrum disorders? What causes autism spectrum disorders? Is there a cure for autism spectrum disorders? Are there disorders that can accompany ASD? What should I do about problematic behaviors? Can adults with ASDs live independent lives? How do I know what to do to help my child? What medications are available? How do we participate in research projects at SARRC? What is the definition of autism spectrum disorders? The term autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) refers to a wide range of developmental disorders and includes five classifications. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, these disorders are usually first diagnosed in early childhood and range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, through pervasive development disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), to a much milder form, Asperger's syndrome. They also include two rare disorders, Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder. Each of these disorders has a specific set of characteristics used as criteria for diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM IV) of the American Psychiatric Association. It is important to understand that individuals can share common characteristics on the spectrum, yet ASD is unique to the individual and will be different for every person. What causes autism spectrum disorders? While autism research has made great strides in the past decade, the causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) remain unknown. Family and twin studies lend support to a genetic etiology, and other studies indicate neurobiological differences in the anatomy and function of the brain in individuals with autism. The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) and SARRC are currently working to find the cause or causes of ASDs. Is there a cure for autism spectrum disorders? Today, there is no cure for ASDs. It is not possible to \"outgrow\" an ASD, but it is possible to \"overcome\" many symptoms of an ASD or at the very least, gain control of difficult behaviors. With time and appropriate interventions, individuals can learn to compensate for deficits with new strengths and skills. There has been, and continues to be, much progress in the treatment of ASDs. At this point in time, no one can predict what a child with autism will be like as an adult. However, most experts in the field of autism research and treatment agree that early intervention is essential and critical. Are there disorders that can accompany ASD? It is possible to be diagnosed with an ASD and also be diagnosed with other disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, visual and hearing impairments, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, mental retardation and others. Any of these disorders can vary from mild to severe. It is also possible for some people to be diagnosed with an ASD and not have mental retardation or other disorders. A few other disorders that sometimes accompany autism include: Seizures: About one-third of the children with ASDs develop seizures in early childhood or adolescence. Researchers are trying to learn if there is any significance to the time of onset, since the seizures often first appear when certain neurotransmitters become inactive. Since seizures range from brief blackouts to full-blown body convulsions, an electroencephalogram (EEG) can help confirm their presence. Fortunately, in most cases, seizures can be controlled with medication. Fragile X: Found in about 3 percent of people with an ASD, mostly males, this inherited disorder is named for a defective piece of the X-chromosome that appears pinched and fragile when seen under a microscope. People who inherit this faulty bit of genetic code have many of the same symptoms as an ASD along with unusual physical features that are not typical of ASDs. Tuberous Sclerosis: Research shows that a relationship exists between ASDs and Tuberous Sclerosis, which is a genetic condition that causes abnormal tissue growth in the brain and problems in other organs. Although Tuberous Sclerosis is a rare disorder, occurring in less than one in 10,000 births, about a fourth of those affected are also diagnosed with an ASD. Scientists are exploring genetic conditions such as Fragile X and Tuberous Sclerosis to see why they so often coincide with autism. Understanding exactly how these conditions disrupt normal brain development may provide insights to the biological and genetic mechanisms of ASDs. What should I do about problematic behaviors? While it is impossible to provide a single answer to this question that will apply to every child and every family, there are some guidelines that parents and others can follow in order to handle situations safely and effectively. There may be many different functions, or reasons, some individuals with ASD's display problematic behaviors. Due to difficulties with communication, an individual with autism may become easily frustrated if they are unable to communicate with others or have trouble understanding what to do. When problematic behavior occurs, it is possible to find the reason or cause for the behavior. This can be done through establishing an understanding of behavior patterns. There is much to be learned by paying close attention to what happens immediately before and after a specific behavior occurs. Once the function, or cause of the behavior, is understood it is possible to determine an appropriate intervention plan to change or replace the problem behavior with a more appropriate alternative. Teaching skills that will reduce frustration, increase communication ability and facilitate the replacement of inappropriate behavior with appropriate alternatives can be highly effective. However, it is important to refrain from trying to teach these skills when an individual is upset or engaged in a tantrum. A proactive approach will help minimize or overcome the behavior. Some proactive and preventative steps to take can include: Provide many opportunities for the individual to make choices (e.g., Do you want to use crayon or marker?) Provide lots of positive reinforcement and verbal praise when the individual is not acting out Consider what motivates and makes sense to the individual and use these objects or activities to reward good behavior Provide structure, routine and predictability through the use of routines, schedules and other appropriate supports when dealing with transitions or difficult situations Can adults with ASD live independent lives? Individuals with ASDs exhibit a wide range of variation when it comes to their level of functioning and capability. Every person with an ASD can learn. Some will live productive lives with varying levels of support and others will live independently, marry, work and raise a family. By teaching individuals with ASDs necessary life skills from a young age, these individuals have a greater potential to lead largely successful lives. How do I know what to do to help my child? Because ASDs are unique to the individual, what works for one person may not for another. Understanding the process for gathering good information and how to use that information in creating a program with appropriate support and services is always the best way to get started. Autism experts commonly agree that intervention programs supported by solid research are an important indicator of effectiveness. With that said, research also suggests that because ASDs are unique to the individual, the results of any particular study may be impacted by these individual differences. Some approaches are controversial and can be surrounded by passionate supporters. It is important to keep your focus on the defining characteristics of the individual, what is regarded as best practice and supported by research and autism professionals, and the learning abilities and disabilities of the individual. A comprehensive evaluation can identify strengths and challenges. This information is useful in creating a comprehensive intervention program that addresses the strengths and challenges of the individual. A comprehensive program should include supports and services that complement each other, are realistic for implementation, and are accessible to the individual in the home, community and school setting. Always work with skilled and qualified professionals to correctly implement the program and to monitor and change the program as the individual changes. Varying treatment approaches exist with a wide range of features available. There are programs with fees covered by insurance, state and local agencies, or private pay. SARRC recommends you consult your doctor when considering interventions that may put the health of an individual at risk. What medications are available? No medication can correct the brain structures or impaired nerve connections that seem to underlie ASDs. Scientists have found, however, that medicines developed to treat other disorders with similar symptoms are sometimes effective in treating the symptoms and behaviors that make it hard for individuals with autism to function at home, school or work. The idea of using medication as part of treatment is something that should be discussed in great detail with your child's doctor. How do we participate in research projects at SARRC? SARRC has developed a research questionnaire that we encourage all parents to complete. Information from the questionnaire is entered into our computer database, and assessments help guide our research and identify subjects for studies. We urge parents to complete the questionnaire for their typical children as well and recruit neighbors and friends (who do not have ASDs) to complete the forms. This provides SARRC with an essential control group for comparative evaluations and benchmarks.

An intriguing new area is looking at two kinds of tissue in the brain: white matter and gray matter. We usually think of gray matter as the stuff we use for cognition; more grey matter tends to equal a higher IQ, for example. White matter, on the other hand, is the connective nerve tissue thought to be used for \"wiring together\" different parts of the brain. Of course, it's not that simple. Too much gray matter in some regions has been linked to trauma. Two studies released today looked at the relationship between volume of white or gray matter and behavior. First, a team led by Manzar Ashtari of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania looked at the brains of autistic kids. They found more gray matter than normal in parts of the brain dealing with social interactions. They think this could be related to abnormal function of the mirror neuron system. Mirror neurons are thought to be special kinds of nerve cells that fire when we watch others. It's still speculative in humans, but they've found that monkeys have what they call mirror neuron regions that fire when the monkey watches a researcher pick up a cup. This might be related to empathy, the ability to literally put oneself in another's place. See Mirror Neurons, Oxytocin and Autism for more. According to the Science Daily story, In the normal brain, larger amounts of gray matter are associated with higher IQs, Dr. Ashtari said. But in the autistic brain, increased gray matter does not correspond to IQ, because this gray matter is not functioning properly. The autistic children also evidenced a significant decrease of gray matter in the right amygdala region that correlated with severity of social impairment. Children with lower gray matter volumes in this area of the brain had lower scores on reciprocity and social interaction measures.Another study by James Cantor of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto found significantly less white matter in the brains of pedophiles than in the brains of non-sexual offenders. The article says, The study, published in the Journal of Psychiatry Research, challenges the commonly held belief that pedophilia is brought on by childhood trauma or abuse. This finding is the strongest evidence yet that pedophilia is instead the result of a problem in brain development. I don't understand why they draw this conclusion. Plenty of studies have shown abnormalities in brain development in children who've been neglected, abused or traumatized. In fact, Victor Carrion of Stanford has found more gray matter in the prefrontal cortexes of the brains of children with PTSD. He's also found decreased total volume in the PFCs of adults and children with PTSD. He recently told me that it's difficult to identify exactly what these differences mean when it comes to brain function and behavior. He said, It seems like in some regions, there's a problem if you have more volume ... in others, it's problematic if you don't have enough. It seems to me that Cantor's study provides further evidence for two things: that early trauma affects brain development, and that this abnormal brain development leads to abnormal behavior later. I've contacted the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health to more information on this statement. I'll post if and when they get back to me. brain Autism social interaction Toronto Philadelphia Pennsylvania Mental Health Cantor Manzar Ashtari Oxytocin Science Daily Ashtari James Cantor Journal of If the world is a stage, and we are the actors (and actresses) of the drama that we call life, then the autistic is a passerby who has stopped to watch us. He finds rituals strange, our frustrations amusing and the masks we wear confusing. Why would someone want to tell a lie just to please another, he asked himself. Why do people like to waste time doing useless social rituals instead of improving their lives on Planet Earth, he wondered. An actor and actress spot him and invite him to perform. But I do now know how , he exclaimed. Just do it , they tell him. But I do not understand your alien culture , he protested. Just improvise , they tell him. And so he walks clumsily up the stage. He has not seen the script but the stage director says nothing to him. He does not feel at ease and refuses to join the social rituals that he finds ridiculous. He does not know how dance the exotic alien music and keeps bumping into the other actors. In the end, he makes a fool of himself. The actors and actress who introduced him on stage shook their heads. You should be ashamed of yourself , one of them tells him. You had better learn how to act properly , says the other. But I am not interested to act. I just want to watch from the sidelines , he protested. No you don't. Now just be a good actor and play your part. Hence, he finds himself lost on the vast stage of Planet Earth, living a life that is not his own, playing a role that he could not fathom and joining in dances that he does not know. The other actors soon have a nickname for him: the autistic. Different Types of Autism Autism does not affect everyone in the same way. There are both very mild and severe cases of autism, categorized into many sub-types. Because autistics look the same as non-autistics and have no physical deficiency, people find it difficult to empathize with their invisible disability. First identified in 1943, professionals now classify autism into many categories including Autistic Disorder (usually severe autism) and Asperger's Syndrome (usually mild autism with high intelligence). Because every autistic express autism in a unique manner, professionals use the term autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to cover all autism-related disorders. Difficulties Encountered Difficulty with time - They may only understand 'now' and fail to learn from past experiences due to the lack of a Subjective Personal History. They are always fearful and anxious to know the future as they could not instinctively predict future events. They have difficulty transitioning from one activity to another as well as handling many unpredictable inputs at the same time. Unable to handle free time, they tend to develop rigid habits. Difficulty with space - They may only see in two dimensions without the associated location, form, texture of objects. They may have poor body awareness and may not even notice that their body exists. This can cause difficulty controlling motor movements and judging whether it is safe to handle objects in a certain way. Difficulty with emotions - Many autistics experience emotions with lesser clarity and awareness. Even when they become aware of very strong emotions, they had no idea what to do with them. Without the emotional bonding between friends and family members, they could only build transactional relationships. High functioning autistics (including those with Aspergers) often use their intellect to substitute for their unreliable instincts. They will observe the social situations they encounter, analyze their dynamics and build a huge library of rules on appropriate behavior that they can follow. The reliance on logic does not mean that they lack emotions. When they are in a bad mood, have too little time to react or encounter something completely foreign to their understanding, their intellect may fail and lead to an emotional outburst. Likewise, even socially competent autistics may fail to handle long term intimate relationships as they could not sustain their mental effort for so long. Difficulty with human self - The concepts of self , other , tribe (of people) and (human) intentions often elude them. Without their own Subjective Personal History for comparison, other peoples' intentions are a mysterious puzzle. Difficulty with sensory perception - Without a coherent perception of the world, they experience fragmented consciousness. Sometimes they may miss out the meaning in speech and not realize what happened, making them seem inattentive. They may lack the capacity to enjoy sensory and emotional pleasure, making life a frustrating series of compromises and chores. Even ordinary stimuli like the subtle flickering of fluorescent lighting, strong perfume and noisy hum of traffic can make life very difficult for them. Difficulty with speech - Without the aid of bodily instincts, speech may be difficult or impossible for them as it requires a good coordination of their mouth, tongue, throat and lungs. Without the social instincts, the content of their speech is limited to what they want, do, see or know without the intent of influencing others. Turn your interest in Autism into a career. There are a number of online accredited degrees available in the health field. Autism Misunderstood Autism is sometimes mistaken as social shyness, but it is more of having a different consciousness. Autism is not just a label. Autistics do suffer because they are constantly misunderstood by the people around them and frustrated by not being able to enjoy the good things that life brings to the rest of us (like feeling the warmth of friendship, enjoying good food, being able to easily multi-task). It is not fun to be autistic. Many autistics are not anti-social by choice. Non-autistics rely on instincts to guide them in decision making, social interaction and using their physical body. Autistics have to rely on backup systems, such as intellectual reasoning and experience. The missing instincts turn a simple social interaction into a complex social calculus equation. As a result, autistics often see no meaning in the social interaction since they are merely faking it. The mental strain tires them and removes any possible pleasure they might obtain. While most autistics are low functioning and require help to survive, there are also able and intelligent autistics who have made important contributions to our society, such as Temple Grandin and Bram Cohen. Many speculate that Albert Einstein and Bill Gates are on the autism spectrum too. Sometimes, autism is mistaken as a psychological rather than a developmental disorder. While autistics may develop psychological disorders from the stresses of coping with social demands, bullying, sensory overload etc, there are key differences between these: Starting Age: Autism starts during childhood; a person cannot develop autism as an adult Duration: Autism is lifelong while some other disorders tend to be temporarily Causality: Autism may induce these disorders but not the other way around Pervasive Impairment: Psychological disorders do not affect the temporal, spatial and social instincts. They may, however, affect one's motivation to socialize or interact with the world. Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Signs of autism It is also common for autistics to suffer from depression or anger accumulated from their negative experiences with human society. Other common syndromes related to autism include: Being Aloof to everyone - The autistic child may not show the warmth and closeness of a typical child, not even to his mother because he may not feel the emotional impulses to form social bonds. Not knowing how to play and share - Autistic children do not know how to play and have no instinct to share their world. They tend to be unconscious of the world around them and unaware of the concept of people . Thus, they will not point at objects of interest to share with people around them. No common sense - An autistic often does not see the world as a coherent whole. They tend to misunderstand people because they could not feel the same emotions and bodily instincts. Thus, they may find it difficult to carry out instructions or perform chores using their common sense . Face blindness (Prosopagnosia) Autistics often find it difficult to identify and distinguish faces. This is like trying to tell the difference between two sheep of the same breed, size and color. Instead of facial features, autistics often rely on location (like being in his own office), clothes and hairstyle to distinguish people. Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD): Many autistics have difficulty filtering away background noise to understand speech. However, they can pass usual hearing tests and may even have super-sensitive hearing. Related Disorders Autism is associated with a few other disorders, but it can also occur without any of them. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) Depression Anxiety Disorders Epilepsy Mental retardation Autism Causes Autism affects many more males than females. While professionals generally agree that a genetic factor exists, they have no conclusive explaination for why autism occurs. Some people speculate that autistics are actually descendents of the Neanderthals, an extinct species which closely resemble modern humans. Perhaps the differences in autistic's body language and functioning are not really defects but merely Neanderthal behavior. In the meantime, National Institute of Mental Health and the Cure Autism Now Foundation are doing social research on monkeys to learn more about autism. The Baylor College of Medicine in the USA is providing genetic testing for autism using Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA). Autism Education Autistic children require a different approach to learning because they perceive and function differently from their non-autistic peers. Techniques such as the use of social stories are known to help them. Remedies such as EIP (Early Intervention Programme) reduce autistic syndromes and faciliate autistics to interact with the world around them. Certain drugs also help to make it easier for autistics to cope with their disability, although some of these drugs also have severe side effects. What if I am autistic? Research - Find out more about autism. Take the online autism tests. If you have a strong feeling of that's it, that's me , then perhaps you have autism. If not, be more cautious. Discuss - Talk to someone who knows you well. You must also find out your childhood history to be sure: the syndromes of autism are most apparent in young children, and it is often your childhood that determines if you have autism or not. Consider getting diagnosed - A diagnosis will help make your life easier because people will tend to be understanding about your differences. If you are from a needy family, you may be able to obtain financial assistance to pay for your diagnosis. Find out more from the autism organizations near you. Improve your life - Find out how autism affects your body, mind and behavior.

While expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism. \"Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration,\" special master George Hastings Jr. wrote. But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case. The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court. The parents presented expert witnesses who argued mercury can have a variety of effects on the brain, but the ruling said none of them offered opinions on the cause of autism in the three specific cases argued. They testified that mercury can affect a number of biological processes, including abnormal metabolism in children. Special master Denise K. Vowell noted that in order to succeed in their action, the parents would have to show \"the exquisitely small amounts of mercury\" that reach the brain from vaccines can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts ... from other sources do not. The ruling said the parents were arguing that the effects from mercury in vaccines differ from mercury's known effects on the brain. Vowell concluded that the parents had failed to establish that their child's condition was caused or aggravated by mercury from vaccines. Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines. The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism. The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available. The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had \"already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.\" But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, \"it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them.\" On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. \"The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,\" Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement. SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling. \"The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology,\" the goup said. The advocacy group Autism Speaks said \"the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases.\" However, while research has found no overall connection between autism and vaccines, the group said it would back research to determine if some individuals might be at increased risk because of genetic or medical conditions. Meanwhile, in reaction to the concerns of parents, thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines in the United States. In Friday's action the court ruled in three different cases, each concluding that the preservative has no connection to autism. The trio of rulings can offer reassurance to parents scared about vaccinating their babies because of a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, are on the rise. The U.S. Court of Claims is different from many other courts: The families involved didn't have to prove the inoculations definitely caused the complex neurological disorder, just that they probably did. More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation through the government's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the rulings dealt with test cases to settle which if any claims had merit. Autism is best known for impairing a child's ability to communicate and interact. Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it's unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosis. Worry about a vaccine link first arose in 1998 when a British physician, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published a medical journal article linking a particular type of autism and bowel disease to the measles vaccine. The study was later discredited. Copyright 2010 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Then she started talking about a new band, so Iris didn't have a chance to ask her any questions. It left her wondering: What is autism? How does someone get it? Can it be treated?Autism is a developmental disorder that some people are born with - it's not something you can catch or pass along to someone else. It affects the brain and makes communicating and interacting with other people difficult.People who have autism often have delayed language development, prefer to spend time alone, and show less interest in making friends. Another characteristic of autism is what some people describe as \"sensory overload\": Sounds seem louder, lights brighter, or smells stronger. Although many people with autism also have mental retardation, some are of average or high intelligence.Not everybody with autism has the exact same symptoms. Some people may have autism that is mild, whereas others may have autism that is more severe. Because it affects people differently, autism is known as a spectrum disorder . Two people with the same spectrum disorder may not act alike or have the same skills.As many as 1 in 150 people have autism, and it's more common in guys than in girls. Although doctors do not know exactly what causes it, many researchers believe autism is linked to differences in brain chemicals ( neurotransmitters ). These differences may be caused by something in our genes - families who have one child with autism have a higher risk of having another child with autism or a similar disorder. Research suggests that in most cases it's probably a combination of genes that causes the disorder, not a single autism gene.Sometimes you may hear other developmental disorders mentioned in the same way as autism, such as Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and childhood disintegrative disorder. These disorders, along with autism, are all considered pervasive developmental disorders . People diagnosed with any of these disabilities have problems with social skills and communication.What Do Doctors Do?Autism is usually diagnosed at a very young age, when a child is 11/2 to 4 years old. There are no medical tests to determine whether someone has autism, although doctors may run various tests to rule out other causes of the symptoms.The best way to identify autism is to watch how a child behaves and communicates. Parents can help by telling the doctor how the child acts at home. Then a team of specialists - which may include a psychologist, a neurologist, a psychiatrist, a speech therapist, and a developmental pediatrician - will evaluate the child and compare levels of development and behavior with those of other kids the same age. Together, they will decide whether the child has autism or something else.How Is Autism Treated?Autism is not treated with surgery or medicine (although some people with autism may take medicine to improve certain symptoms, like aggressive behavior or attention problems). Instead, people who have autism are taught skills to help them do the things that are difficult for them. The best results are usually seen with kids who begin treatment when they're very young and\ufffdas soon as they're diagnosed.Special education programs that are tailored to the child's individual needs are usually the most effective form of treatment. These programs work on breaking down barriers by teaching the child to communicate (sometimes by pointing or using pictures or sign language) and to interact with others. Basic living skills, like how to cross a street safely or ask for directions, are also emphasized.A treatment program might also include any of the following: speech therapy, physical therapy, music therapy, changes in diet, medication, occupational therapy, and hearing or vision therapy. The same specialists who helped diagnose the condition usually work together to come up with the best combination of therapies to use in addition to the educational program.By the time they are teens, people with autism may be taking regular classes or\ufffdattending special classes at the high school level. Some may go to\ufffda special school because of ongoing behavioral problems.What Are Teens With Autism Like?Because their brains process information differently, teens with autism may not act like other people you know (or each other, because the symptoms of autism vary from person to person). People with autism\ufffdcan have trouble talking and sometimes communicate with gestures instead of words. Some spend a lot of time alone, don't make friends easily (and may not act like they want to), and may not\ufffdreact to social cues like someone smiling or scowling at them. They often do not make eye contact when you are talking to them. They also find it hard to join in a game or activity with other people. If they are sensitive to sensations, they might draw back when hugged or startle easily when they hear a sudden noise, even if it's not very loud.Some teens with autism are passive and withdrawn; others are overactive and may have tantrums or act aggressively when they are frustrated. It's important to realize that this is part of the disorder.Some teens with autism also have intellectual limitations and learning problems. Because they don't have the ability to express emotions like anger and frustration in more acceptable ways, they might\ufffdexpress themselves in ways that seem inappropriate. Many have difficulty coping with change and get anxious if their daily routine is altered. In more severe cases, a person with autism\ufffdmight fixate on different objects or ideas or display repetitive motions like rocking or hand flapping.One common misconception is that people with autism don't feel or show emotion. Although they can feel affection, they often don't express it the same way others do. To an outsider, this can come across as being cold or unemotional.Living With AutismPerhaps the most difficult part of coping with autism is interacting with other people every day. Because the brain of someone with autism works a little differently, learning to communicate can be like learning a foreign language. This can make it hard for people with autism\ufffdto express themselves or for others to understand them, so just talking with a classmate becomes stressful and frustrating.When even a casual conversation requires so much effort, it's hard to make friends. Teens with autism may have to think constantly about how other people will view their actions. They may have to make a conscious effort to pay attention to social cues the rest of us handle without even thinking. Basically, it takes a lot of work for someone with autism to do what comes naturally to most people.So if you know someone who has autism, be extra patient when you're talking with him or her. Don't expect a person with autism to look at things the same way you do. You should also realize that some behaviors you think are rude (like interrupting you when you're talking) come from a different perception of the world: It's tough for people who can't read social cues and recognize the natural pauses in a conversation to know when to jump in with their own thoughts. The more understanding and supportive you are, the more enjoyable your time together will be.Despite all the day-to-day hurdles, though, many people with autism lead fulfilling, happy lives on their own or with help from friends and family. Most teens with autism like school, and some can attend regular classes with everyone else. They have individual tastes and enjoy different activities, just like you do.Some people with autism go on to vocational school or college, get married, and have successful careers. Consider Temple Grandin, for example. Despite having autism, she earned a PhD and became a college professor and expert in animal behavior. She's written several books, including one\ufffdabout her experience called Thinking in Pictures: And Other Reports From My Life With Autism . Although she still struggles with the disorder almost daily, she leads a normal life, just like many other people with autism.Reviewed by: Steven Dowshen, MDDate reviewed: April 2008 Originally reviewed by: Anne M.

Most Windows 95/98 Programs Run on Windows XP Home According to Microsoft, Windows XP is directly compatible with hundreds of applications, but if you have an older application that is not compatible, you can force Windows XP to provide an environment under which that application runs. You can choose from Windows 95, Windows 98 / ME, Windows NT (sp5), or the Windows 2000 environment. According to one of Autism Coach's software manufacturers, 9 out of 10 of his older Windows programs run under the Windows 95/98 emulator provided by Windows XP. Introducing the Autism Realized Ron Davis, Will Bennett, and Ray Davis In May 2008, my son, Will, became the first person in North America and third person in the world to complete Autism Realized\ufffd, a new program giving high functioning individuals within the autism spectrum the tools to participate fully in life. This program is the brainchild of and has been in the process of being developed for several years by Ron Davis, developer of Davis Dyslexia Correction\ufffd, a method of helping people with dyslexia to read. Ron, age 65, is uniquely qualified to develop and implement an autism program \ufffd he is brilliant and autistic. More Drugs in U.S. Drinking Water March 10, 2008. Associated Press investigative reporters have found a vast array of pharmaceuticals in the country's treated drinking water, including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, acetominophen, ibuprofen, mood stabilizers, and sex hormones in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans. These concentrations are measured in parts per billion, but the their presence is worrying scientists about their long-term consequences. Individuals within the autism spectrum are particularly sensitive contaminants. Reverse Osmosis filtration is the only way to completely remove contaminants. More Epsom Salts Cut Risk of Cerebral Palsy in Half for Premature Infants January 31, 2008. Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) are cheap and according to a study can cut the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) in half for prematurely born infants. Epsom salt baths have been widely used for years by parents of autistic children to help calm children down, sleep better, and to elevate levels of sulfur and magnesium. More Scientists Reverse Symptoms of Autism in Mice June 25, 2007. Researchers from the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) genetically manipulated the mice to model Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), which is the leading inherited cause of mental retardation and the most common genetic cause of autism. More Why is there virtually no Autism in the U.S. Amish communities? In a ground-breaking piece of investigative journalism published in the June 30-July 14, 2005 issue of Rolling Stone magazine, the noted environmental activist, author, and radio show commentator, Robert Kennedy Jr., about how public officials fudged numbers and refused to release the epidemiological raw data conclusively proving that vaccines caused an epidemic of autism in the United States. Kennedy also noted that the mercury-based preservative, thimerisol, is still being allowed in pediatric flu vaccines, other pharmaceutical products, and in vaccines shipped abroad, causing millions of children in around the world to develop autism (including 1.3 million children in China alone, where autism did not exist until they started receiving vaccines). In an independent study of autism amongst an Amish population in the United States which does not allow vaccinations, there is virtually no autism - of the four Amish children out of the entire population studied who were diagnosed autistic, all had been vaccinated, some prior to adoption. More Autism Declines as States Ban Mercury from Vaccines An article in the March 10, 2006, issue of the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons shows that in U.S. states where mercury was removed from childhood vaccines, the alarming increase in reported rates of autism and other neurological disorders (NDs) in children not only stopped, but actually dropped sharply \ufffd by as much as 35 percent. More How to Improve Your Child's Prognosis The Autism Coach Approach helps your child reach his or her maximum potential. The majority of parents whose children have recovered from autism have followed some or all of these guidelines. More Checklist for Diagnosing Autism in Toddlers British researchers have developed a checklist for diagnosing autism in toddlers. Preliminary studies show that they were able to identify children later diagnosed within the autism spectrum. More Early Warning Signs of Autism in Infants Researchers at the University of Florida are pioneering a new technique for detecting autism in infants by evaluating their crawling patterns. More Mirror Neuron Research May Lead to New Treatment for Autism November, 2007. The latest research on mirror neurons, published by the Society for Neuroscience, may lead to new treatments for autism. Mirror neurons are used to imitate others and acquire language. When you perform a voluntary action, such as picking up a pencil, a set of \ufffdcommand\ufffd neurons activate. When you watch someone else pick up a pencil a subset of these neurons, called \ufffd mirror\ufffd neurons activate. It is believed that mirror neurons enable us to learn through imitation. In autism, however, the mirror neurons do not typically activate, when observing activity, leading to the implication that people with autism primarily learn by doing and do not tend to learn by watching others. The latest research includes retraining the brain to activate the mirror neurons so that learning by imitation may take place. More The Gifted/Autism Spectrum Gifted children and autistic children may be part of the same spectrum. New research in mapping brain activity provides new intriguing insights into the connections between autism and giftedness, music and language. More Parent Survey Indicates Enzymes Benefit Children According to a survey of 260 parents using the enzymes, Peptizyde and Zyme Prime, over a seven month period, 90% of parents observed sustained behavioral improvements in their children. Virtually all of these parents saw improvements within two weeks of starting these enzymes. Peptizyde breaks down gluten and casein proteins commonly found in wheat and dairy products. Some experts in autism consider gluten and casein to be problematic for autistic children. HN-Zyme Prime is a complementary broad-spectrum enzyme, which helps to promote proper digestion and assimilation of all foods, and provides some benefit for children with phenol sensitivities. These two enzymes complement each other when used together and are acceptable for special diets such as the Gluten Free/Casein Free diet and the Feingold diet. Peptizyde and Zyme-Prime are available from Autism Coach. Asperger's Spokesmodel, Heather Kuzmich December 11, 2007 update - Heather has also been featured in this week's People Magazine. As reported in the New York Times, December 4, 2007. Heather Kuzmich, age 21, has not allowed herself to be defined by her diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome. She is the one of the most popular contestants in the four-and-a-half-year history of the reality show, America's Next Top Model. As the holidays approach, Heather's story is a source of both inspiration and hope, showing that the autism community contains not only some of the best and brightest people on the planet, but some of the most beautiful as well. More Extreme Makeover - Autism Coach Software Donated to Family Autism Coach and software manufacturers represented by Autism Coach have donated software to the O'Donnell family featured in an upcoming episode of ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, that aired on ABC Sunday, February 18, 8 Eastern Time, 7 Central Time. This deserving family has 5 of their 6 children within the autism spectrum, ranging in age from 5 to 15! They are the only known family in America with five biological autistic children. Their deteriorating home was razed to the ground and rebuilt before Christmas. It included each child having their own bedroom, complete with a computer configured with Autism Coach software, as well as the therapy room. For a list of the software we donated to each child and a reprint of articles about the family and this edition of Extreme Makeover, please click here. Autism Makes Cover of Time Magazine Autism has made the cover story of the May 15, 2006, issue of Time Magazine. The articles on-line articles about the autism schools are interesting, but the science articles seem to reflect the views of the mainstream medical and pharmaceutical industry, attempting yet again to divert the blame for the autism epidemic to anywhere but an excessive and mercury-laden immunization schedule. A large percentage of parents of autistic children observed changes in their children before, during and after immunizations and strongly believe that immunizations triggered their children's autism. Nonetheless, the very fact that autism is on the cover of Time Magazine, indicates that it is an epidemic that cannot be ignored and that it is having a significant impact upon our society.

TAP Magazine Features Autism Coach The Autism Perspective (TAP) magazine, is a colorful, photo-filled, highly informative magazine published in California, now entering its second year of publication. Each issue is filled with fascinating articles by diverse members of the autism community. Past issues have included articles by Dr. Temple Grandin, Stephen Shore, and Dr. Stanley Greenspan. Independently produced, the agenda of TAP is not to promote an agenda but to give an impartial, unbiased voice and face to the many facets of the autism community. If you are feeling isolated in dealing with autism, this upbeat magazine is a reminder we are not alone but are part of a vibrant, often brilliant community of kindred spirits with valuable information and wisdom to share for the betterment of all. The December issue highlighted a fundraising event in Los Angeles for the organization, Autism Speaks, that was headlined by Jerry Seinfeld, Paul Simon, Tom Brokaw, and the President of NBC, Bob Wright and his wife, Suzanne. The Wrights founded Autism Speaks to raise money for autism research - they have a grandson within the autism spectrum. It is wonderful that prominent members of the entertainment industry have chosen to shine the spotlight on autism and raise money for research that may make a huge difference for our children. TAP often creates a profile of an entire family in a single issue, with articles by individual family members. In the December issue, we are amongst the families profiled, and members of my family (my daughter, my mother, and myself) describe how each of us has been impacted by autism. January 2008- TAP has now gone on-line! for a FREE on-line subscription, visit www.theautismperspective.org.

Bisphenol Banned from Plastics in Canada but not in U.S. Plastics dishes, baby bottles and cups are also a health concern for our children. A man-made compound contained in thousands of plastic products in the U.S., bisphenol A, has been declared toxic and banned from all products in Canada. Unlike Canada, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ignored the same data presented to them September by an independent panel of scientists. Products bisphenol A are found thousands of products, including: baby bottles, sippy cups, pacifiers, hard plastic Nalgene sports bottles, reusable water jugs provided at the filtered water units at grocery stores, and in the plastic linings of metal cans (such as soft drinks and canned vegetables). To read the full Autism Coach article on the risks of bisphenol A and how to minimize exposure to it, click here. Lead-Free Dishes Safe Children's and Family Dishes - Holiday and Everyday Patterns Available Parents having their children tested for heavy metal toxicity are often surprised to find their children have high levels of lead and cadmium. The source of some of this may unfortunately be the child's dinnerware. The bright glazes in children's glass and ceramic dishes as well as family place settings are often high in lead and cadmium. Dishes imported from outside the U.S. are particularly at risk for heavy metal toxicity. We are pleased to offer this beautiful stoneware that made in the U.S. that is completely free of lead and cadmium, exceeding FDA standards. Hand-crafted and hand-painted.

Last reply by Ann Barrett Mar 2. ASD Sheila Mackay Ann Barrett perthshireautismconnections.ning.com/ Autism285 http://www.ktvu.com/health/22825130/detail.html WASHINGTON -- The vaccine additive thimerosal is not to blame for autism, a special federal court ruled Friday in a long-running battle by parents convinced there is a connection. While expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism. \"Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration,\" special master George Hastings Jr. wrote. But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case. The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court. The parents presented expert witnesses who argued mercury can have a variety of effects on the brain, but the ruling said none of them offered opinions on the cause of autism in the three specific cases argued. They testified that mercury can affect a number of biological processes, including abnormal metabolism in children. Special master Denise K. Vowell noted that in order to succeed in their action, the parents would have to show \"the exquisitely small amounts of mercury\" that reach the brain from vaccines can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts ... from other sources do not. The ruling said the parents were arguing that the effects from mercury in vaccines differ from mercury's known effects on the brain. Vowell concluded that the parents had failed to establish that their child's condition was caused or aggravated by mercury from vaccines. Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines. The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism. The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available. The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had \"already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.\" But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, \"it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them.\" On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. \"The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,\" Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement. SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling. \"The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology,\" the goup said. The advocacy group Autism Speaks said \"the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases.\" However, while research has found no overall connection between autism and vaccines, the group said it would back research to determine if some individuals might be at increased risk because of genetic or medical conditions. Meanwhile, in reaction to the concerns of parents, thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines in the United States. In Friday's action the court ruled in three different cases, each concluding that the preservative has no connection to autism. The trio of rulings can offer reassurance to parents scared about vaccinating their babies because of a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, are on the rise. The U.S. Court of Claims is different from many other courts: The families involved didn't have to prove the inoculations definitely caused the complex neurological disorder, just that they probably did. More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation through the government's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the rulings dealt with test cases to settle which if any claims had merit. Autism is best known for impairing a child's ability to communicate and interact. Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it's unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosis. Worry about a vaccine link first arose in 1998 when a British physician, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published a medical journal article linking a particular type of autism and bowel disease to the measles vaccine. The study was later discredited. Copyright 2010 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Also, on occasion, brain injury has caused people to display some of the symptoms of autism. Some diseases: Deafness Some children who exhibit symptoms similar to autism have been discovered to be deaf. A child should always have his hearing checked before being identified as autistic. Galactosemia Inborn error in carbohydrate metabolism. [Inability to metabolize galactose?] Heller's Disease Normal development to age 3 or 4, then abrupt onset of fretfulness, negativism and anxiety. Regression of mental development and gradual loss of speech. LKS \"Landau-Kleffner Syndrome\" Also Acquired Childhood Epileptic Aphasia. Very rare disorder. Typical profile: normal development and age appropriate language first 3-7 years; Loss of receptive language while retaining some expressive language; \"Telegraphic\" speech--few verbs; Suspicion of deafness; Child frustrated, puzzled by change in himself; Autistic-like behaviors; normal or above normal non-verbal IQ score; abnormal EEG, with or without seizures. Some practitioners suspect that some cases of Childhood Disintegrative Disorder or \"late outset\" autism may be Landau-Kleffner Syndrome. PKU \"Phenylketonuria\" A genetic disorder of the metabolism which will result in brain-damage during the first years of life unless special dietary measures are taken. Inadequate production of the enzyme which converts the amino acid phenylalanine into another amino acid, tyrosine. The extra phenylalanine accumulates in body fluids and converts to several chemicals that damage the brain. Symptoms include mental retardation as well as some of the symptoms of autism. PKU has been eliminated by screening all children immediately after birth so proper dietary measures can be taken. Rett's Syndrome a neurological disorder that occurs only in girls. Unlike autism, girls initially show normal development, then revert. The initial symptoms include some that are associated with autism. From DSM IV: DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR 299.80 RETT'S DISORDER (females only) A. All of the following: (1) apparently normal prenatal and postnatal development (2) apparently normal psychomotor develop (3) normal head circumference at birth B. Onset of all of the following after a period of normal development: (1) deceleration of head growth between ages 5 and 48 months (2) loss of previously acquired purposeful hand skills between ages 5 and 30 months with subsequent development of stereotyped hand movements (e.g. hand wringing or hand washing) (3) loss of social engagment early in the course (although social interaction often develops later) (4) appearance of poorly coordinated gait or trunk movements (5) severely impaired expressive and receptive language development with severe pyschomotor retardation. Childhood Disintegrative Disorder Much rarer than autism. I've seen references which treat this as a synonym for Heller's Disease (see above). From DSM IV: DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR 299.10 CHILDHOOD DISINTEGRATIVE DISORDER A. Apparently normal development for at least the first 2 years after birth as manifested by the presence of age appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication, social relationships, play and adaptive behavior. B. Clinically significant loss of previously acquired skills (before age 10 years in at least two of the following areas: (1) expressive or receptive language (2) social skills or adaptive behavior (3) bowel or bladder control (4) play (5) motor skills C. Abnormalities of functioning in at least two of the following areas: (1) qualitative impairment in social interaction (e.g., impairment in nonverbal behaviors, failure to develop peer relationships, lack of social or emotional reciprocity) 2) qualitative impairments in communication (e.g., delay or lack of the development of spoken language, inability to initiate or sustain a conversation, stereotyped and repetitive use of language, lack of verbal make-believe play) (3) Restricted repetitive & stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests and activities, including motor stereotypes and mannerisms. D. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder or by Schizophrenia. Tourette's Syndrome a condition thought to be genetic that causes uncontrollable motor and/or vocal tics. A major longterm study is being conducted by David Cummings, who published a thick book on the genetic links between various neurological disorders. (Not easy reading.) Obsessive-compulsive disorder Obsessions are thoughts or images that are involuntary, intrusive, and anxiety-provoking. Compulsions are impulses to perform a variety of stereotyped behaviors or rituals. OCD is a neurological disorder, cause uncertain. However, it is often confused with obsessions and compulsions caused by mental illness or simple neurosis, in much the way that the term \"Autism\" has been used to refer to any person who is severely withdrawn. For a clearer picture of OCD, read The Boy Who Wouldn't Stop Washing (Judith Rapaport). Clinical OCD has easily categorized symptomology that tend to occur at certain stages of life; counting and sorting and \"evening out\" usually start during childhood, \"grooming\" compulsions usually start at puberty, and \"ruminating\" (obsessions) usually begin during adulthood. Cocktail party speech syndrome a syndrome comprising the following characteristics: (1) A perseveration of response, either echoing the examiner, or repetition of an earlier statement made by the child. (2) An excessive use of social phrases in conversation. (3) An over-familiarity in manner, unusual for one's age. (4) A habit of introducing personal experience into the conversation in irrelevant and inappropriate contexts. (5) Fluent and normally well articulated speech. Asperger's Syndrome Similar to Autism except that language development is normal. In some people's minds, the same thing as high-functioning Autism. From DSM IV (p77): DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR 299.80 ASPERGER'S DISORDER A. Qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: (1) marked impairments in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction (2) failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level (3) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g. by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest to other people) (4) lack of social or emotional reciprocity B. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: (1) encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus (2) apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals (3) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) (4) persistent preoccupation with parts of objects C. The disturbance causes clinically significant impairments in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning D. There is no clinically significant general delay in language (e.g., single words used by age 2 years, communicative phrases used by age 3 years) E. There is no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or in the development of age-appropriate self-help skills, adaptive behavior (other than social interaction), and curiosity about the environment in childhood F. Criteria are not met for another specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder of Schizophrenia Nonverbal learning disabilities Semantic-pragmatic speech disorder (Semantic Pragmatic Disorder or SPD) A communication problem with mild autistic symptoms and problems generalizing. Schizophrenia a mental illness which can result in behavior similar to autism. Unlike autism, schizophrenia usually starts in adolescence or early adulthood, and involves delusions or hallucinations. Note that \"Childhood Schizophrenia\" used to refer to what we now label \"Autism\" and that the former term is still used in some circles. PDD or PDD/NOS or PDD-NOS \"Pervasive Development Disorder/Not Otherwise Specified\" PDD therefore becomes a term for individuals who do not fully meet the medical criteria for autism, but it is a very loose term. From DSM IV: 299.80 PERVASIVE DEVELOPMETAL DISORDER NOT OTHER SPECIFIED (including Atypical Autism) This category should be used when there is a severe and pervasive impairment the development of reciprocal social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication skills, or when the stereotyped behavior, interest and activities are present, but the criteria are not met by a specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Schizophrenia, Schizotypal Personality Disorder or Avoidant Personality Disorder. For example, this category includes \"atypical autism\" - presentations that do not meet the criteria for Autistic Disorder because of late age at onset, atypical symptomatology, or subthreshold symptomology (note; fewer than 6 items), or all three. mucopolysaccharoidoises (Type I) Has coincided with autism. adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency a disorder of nucleic acid metabolism. Has coincided with autism. Childhood aphasia ? Receptive Developmental Dysphasia ? Celiac's disease Gluten intolerance (?) Fragile-X Syndrome The most common cause of inherited mental retardation, with an incidence of about 1/1500 in males and 1/2500 in females. The inheritance pattern of the disease is unlike other X-linked disorders, because it shows significant numbers of apparently unaffected male carriers and some clinically affected females. The disease derives its name from the presence of a fragile site on the X chromosome of affected individuals. ADD \"Attention Deficit Disorder\" A disorder consisting of having a short attention span. Dr. C. Gillberg from Sweden has proposed (in addition to others) that there may be a continuum from ADD to autism. He proposes that some kids are in the middle of the continuum, with a combination of ADD and autistic features. These kids often have \"soft\" neurologic signs (incl. fine and/or gross motor coordination problems) in addition to their ADD, and are socially awkward. ADHD \"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\" Another term for ADD when the person is also hyperactive. Thought to be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, which results in a biological deficiency in a childs ability to concentrate. Diagnosis of ADHD is a grey area: there are 18 criteria involved in identifying ADHD including such traits as inability to concentrate and aggressiveness. The question of how many criteria a child must have before pharmaceutical treatment is however still debated. A daily dose of a controversial prescription drug called RITALIN, has been reported to cause marked improvement in childrens behaviour. CMV ? Tuberous Sclerosis ? Hyperlexia a disorder consisting of precocious reading development, disordered language acquisition and social and behavioral deficits. It is a matter of discussion whether to consider it a type of autism or asperger's syndrome. Manic Depression Autistic Children who have no apparent neurological basis for their disorders may actually be suffering from an inherited, early-onset form of manic-depression, according to results of two studies conducted at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC. The findings were reported in the May and August 1994 issues of \"Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology.\" Angelman Syndrome resembles autism only superficially since Angelman kids are profoundly retarded and (somtimes?) don't exhibit the lack of empathy, eye contact, etc. typical of autism. It is caused by a particular defect in chromosome 15 which can be diagnosed accurately by chromosome testing. The other name for it is the Happy Puppet because the children's limbs are usually held out from the body stiffly and the children always have a smiling countenance. Besides extreme retardation, other symptoms include low muscle tone, recurring seizures, sleep disorders, gastrointetinal problems, and slow development. Another syndrome caused by a defect in chromosome 15 is Prader-Willi. Smith-Magenis Syndrome has a lot of autistic characiteristics. Caused by a particular defect in the 17th chromosome. Klinefelter Syndromes Having an XXY chromosome. It is easily testable through genetic testing and occurs in about 1 in 1000 births. Often includes developmental and language impairment, and has been correlated with some kinds of withdrawn behavior. DAS \"Developmental Apraxia of Speech\" Also known as \"Developmental Verbal Dyspraxia\". A neurologically-based speech disorder observed in children learning to speak. It affects the rate of speech development, the number of sounds in a child's repertoire, and the child's ability to combine sounds during the production of words. Lactic Acidosis tendency to accumulate of lacitic acid in the blood. It's connection with autism is that it has been found to coincide with autism more than chance would dictate. Prosopagnosia The inability to recognize faces, also known as face blindness. Irlen Syndrome/Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome (SSS) Visual perceptual problem identified by Helen Irlen which causes (among other things) black-on-white print to be difficult to read, and which can be alleviated by filtering out portions of the light spectrum with colored glasses. See Irlen Lenses under treatment. Turner's syndrome A syndrome in females where they are missing one of their two X chromosomes.

Autism is not a disease, but a developmental disorder of brain function. People with classical autism show three types of symptoms: impaired social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and unusual or severely limited activities and interests. Symptoms of autism usually appear during the first three years of childhood and continue throughout life. Although there is no cure, appropriate early educational intervention may improve social development and reduce undesirable behaviors. People with autism have a normal life expectancy. Autism affects an estimated 10 to 20 of every 10,000 people, depending on the diagnostic criteria used. Most estimates that include people with similar disorders are two to three times greater. Autism strikes males about four times as often as females, and has been found throughout the world in people of all racial and social backgrounds. Autism varies a great deal in severity. The most severe cases are marked by extremely repetitive, unusual, self-injurious, and aggressive behavior. This behavior may persist over time and prove very difficult to change, posing a tremendous challenge to those who must live with, treat, and teach these individuals. The mildest forms of autism resemble a personality disorder associated with a perceived learning disability. What Are Some Common Signs of Autism? The hallmark feature of autism is impaired social interaction. Children with autism may fail to respond to their names and often avoid looking at other people. They often have difficulty interpreting tone of voice or facial expressions and do not respond to others' emotions or watch other people's faces for cues about appropriate behavior. They appear unaware of others' feelings toward them and of the negative impact of their behavior on other people. Many children with autism engage in repetitive movements such as rocking and hair twirling, or in self-injurious behavior such as biting or head-banging. They also tend to start speaking later than other children and may refer to themselves by name instead of I or me. Some speak in a sing-song voice about a narrow range of favorite topics, with little regard for the interests of the person to whom they are speaking. People with autism often have abnormal responses to sounds, touch, or other sensory stimulation. Many show reduced sensitivity to pain. They also may be extraordinarily sensitive to other sensations. These unusual sensitivities may contribute to behavioral symptoms such as resistance to being cuddled. How Is Autism Diagnosed? Autism is classified as one of the pervasive developmental disorders. Some doctors also use terms such as emotionally disturbed to describe people with autism. Because it varies widely in its severity and symptoms, autism may go unrecognized, especially in mildly affected individuals or in those with multiple handicaps. Researchers and therapists have developed several sets of diagnostic criteria for autism. Some frequently used criteria include:* * Absence or impairment of imaginative and social play * Impaired ability to make friends with peers * Impaired ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others * Stereotyped, repetitive, or unusual use of language * Restricted patterns of interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus * Apparently inflexible adherence to specific routines or rituals * Preoccupation with parts of objects Children with some symptoms of autism, but not enough to be diagnosed with the classical form of the disorder, are often diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (PDD - NOS). People with autistic behavior but well-developed language skills are often diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Children who appear normal in their first several years, then lose skills and begin showing autistic behavior, may be diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). Girls with Rett syndrome, a sex-linked genetic disorder characterized by inadequate brain growth, seizures, and other neurological problems, also may show autistic behavior. PDD - NOS, Asperger syndrome, CDD, and Rett syndrome are referred to as autism spectrum disorders. Since hearing problems can be confused with autism, children with delayed speech development should always have their hearing checked. Children sometimes have impaired hearing in addition to autism. About half of people with autism score below 50 on IQ tests, 20 percent score between 50 and 70, and 30 percent score higher than 70. However, estimating IQ in young children with autism is often difficult because problems with language and behavior can interfere with testing. A small percentage of people with autism are savants. These people have limited but extraordinary skills in areas like music, mathematics, drawing, or visualization. What Causes Autism? Autism has no single cause. Researchers have identified a number of genes that play a role in the disorder. In some children, environmental factors also may play a role in development of the disorder. Studies of people with autism have found abnormalities in several regions of the brain, including the cerebellum, amygdala, hippocampus, septum, and mamillary bodies. Neurons in these regions appear smaller than normal and have stunted nerve fibers, which may interfere with nerve signaling. These abnormalities suggest that autism results from disruption of normal brain development early in fetal development. Other studies suggest that people with autism have abnormalities of serotonin or other signaling molecules in the brain. While these findings are intriguing, they are preliminary and require further study. The early belief that parental practices are responsible for autism has now been disproved. In a minority of cases, disorders such as fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, untreated phenylketonuria (PKU), and congenital rubella cause autistic behavior. Other disorders, including Tourette syndrome, learning disabilities, and attention deficit disorder, often occur with autism but do not cause it. While people with schizophrenia may show some autistic-like behavior, their symptoms usually do not appear until the late teens or early adulthood. Most people with schizophrenia also have hallucinations and delusions, which are not found in autism. What Role Does Genetics Play? Recent studies strongly suggest that some people have a genetic predisposition to autism. Scientists estimate that, in families with one autistic child, the risk of having a second child with the disorder is approximately five percent, or one in 20, which is greater than the risk for the general population (see What is autism? ). Researchers are looking for clues about which genes contribute to this increased susceptibility. In some cases, parents and other relatives of an autistic person show mild social, communicative, or repetitive behaviors that allow them to function normally but appear linked to autism. Evidence also suggests that some affective, or emotional, disorders occur more frequently than average in families of people with autism. Do Symptoms of Autism Change over Time? Symptoms in many children with autism improve with intervention or as the children mature. Some people with autism eventually lead normal or near-normal lives. About a third of children with autistic spectrum disorders eventually develop epilepsy. The risk is highest in children with severe cognitive impairment and motor deficits. Adolescence may worsen behavior problems in some children with autism, who may become depressed or increasingly unmanageable. Parents should be ready to adjust treatment for their child's changing needs. How Can Autism Be Treated? There is no cure for autism at present. Therapies, or interventions, are designed to remedy specific symptoms in each individual. The best-studied therapies include educational/behavioral and medical interventions. Although these interventions do not cure autism, they often bring about substantial improvement. Educational/behavioral interventions: These strategies emphasize highly structured and often intensive skill-oriented training that is tailored to the individual child. Therapists work with children to help them develop social and language skills. Because children learn most effectively and rapidly when very young, this type of therapy should begin as early as possible. Recent evidence suggests that early intervention has a good chance of favorably influencing brain development. Medication: Doctors may prescribe a variety of drugs to reduce self-injurious behavior or other troublesome symptoms of autism, as well as associated conditions such as epilepsy and attention disorders. Most of these drugs affect levels of serotonin or other signaling chemicals in the brain. Many other interventions are available, but few, if any, scientific studies support their use. These therapies remain controversial and may or may not reduce a specific person's symptoms. Parents should use caution before subscribing to any particular treatment. Counseling for the families of people with autism also may assist them in coping with the disorder. What Aspects of Autism Are Being Studied? The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is the Federal Government's leading supporter of biomedical research on brain and nervous system disorders, including autism. The NINDS conducts research in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland, and supports research at other institutions through grants. NINDS-supported research includes studies aimed at identifying the underlying brain abnormalities of autism through new methods of brain imaging and other innovative techniques. Researchers also are investigating possible biologic markers present at birth that can identify infants at risk for the development of autism. Some scientists hope to identify genes that increase the risk of autism. Others are studying specific aspects of behavior, information processing, and other characteristics to learn precisely how children with autism differ from other people and how these characteristics change over time. The findings may lead to improved strategies for early diagnosis and intervention. Related studies are examining how the cerebellum develops and processes information, how different brain regions function in relation to each other, and how alterations in this relationship during development may result in the signs and symptoms of autism. Researchers hope this research will provide new clues about how autism develops and how brain abnormalities affect behavior.

Although cytogenetic abnormalities on almost every chromosome have been found in association with autism, only a few occur commonly enough to be regarded as possible indicators of putative autism genes. Chromosome abnormalities (in addition to 15q duplications) that have been reported on more than one occasion are deletions of 2q,18q, 22q13, Xp, and the sex chromosome aneuploidies, 47,XYY and 45,X [Gillberg 1998, Manning et al 2004]. Routine chromosome analysis detects most abnormalities; however, high-resolution chromosome studies, subtelomere FISH studies, or chromosomal microarray analysis are recommended for some persons. Reddy (2005) reported that 28% of the cytogenetic abnormalities detected were subtle, requiring high resolution analysis. Takahashi et al (2005) found unbalanced chromosome abnormalies exclusively in probands with autism who had significant dysmorphology (13/387 - 3.4%). All reported terminal deletions of 2q and 22q have been associated with dysmorphology [Lukusa et al 2004, Manning et al 2004]. The yield of subtelomeric FISH studies remains controversial. Although Wolff et al (2002) found that one out of ten unselected individuals with autism had a subtelomeric deletion detected by FISH analysis, Keller et al (2003) found no terminal deletions in 49 children with autism. Medne et al (2003) performed both routine chromosome analysis and subtelomeric FISH analysis in 108 individuals with autism; 7.4% (8/108) had a chromosome abnormality, only one of which required subtelomeric FISH analysis for detection. In a retrospective study of 29 mentally retarded individuals with submicrocopic chromosome defects, de Vries et al (2001) found that prenatal growth retardation and a family history of mental retardation were important predictors of subtelomeric abnormalities. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) can identify small deletions and duplications of the subtelomeres, each pericentromeric region, and other chromosome regions. Some of the abnormalities detected by CMA have been associated with autism; thus, CMA may replace subtelomeric FISH as the second-tier cytogenetic study.

These signs all begin before a child is three years old.[1] Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.[2] The two other autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and PDD-NOS, diagnosed when full criteria for the other two disorders are not met.[3]Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants.[4] In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects.[5] Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes, such as heavy metals, pesticides or childhood vaccines;[6] the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.[7] The prevalence of autism is about 1\ufffd2 per 1,000 people; the prevalence of ASD is about 6 per 1,000, with about four times as many males as females. The number of people diagnosed with autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.[8]Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.[9] The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress.[10] Although early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills, there is no known cure.[9] Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.[11] An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be tolerated as a difference and not treated as a disorder.[12]Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder[13] that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without remission.[14] Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,[15] and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.[16] It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.[17] Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.[18] genetic brain genetic mutations ASD social interaction birth defects repetitive behavior cognitive neural PDD-NOS atypical neurodevelopmental disorder www.amazines.com/autism_related.html Autism292 http://www.autism.net.au/Autism_definition.htm Autism Definition Autism is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the name given to describe the wide range of behaviours amongst the Autistic population. Children with autism are less able to interact with the world as other children do. Typically they have deficits in three key areas: \ufffd Verbal and non-verbal Communication \ufffd Social awareness and interactions \ufffd Imaginative play (variable interests and behaviours). There are separate labels given to children with autism for different points on the Autism spectrum. At the least affected end, you may find labels such as Asperger's Syndrome , High Functioning Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). At the other end of the spectrum you may find labels such as Autism , Classic Autism and Kanner Autism . We believe that a diagnosis of AUTISM should be a starting point, prompting health professionals to investigate further and initiate assessment and treatment of the possible underlying causes. Investigation and treatment of Biological, Nutritional and Metabolic factors In addition to ABA-based early intervention, have led to improvement of symptoms or complete resolution of symptoms in a multitude of Children with Autism worldwide. Autism is treatable and recovery possible. Autism research Institute, Defeat Autism Now (DAN) California The following is the list of criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Parents are urged to seek professional advise and not to self-diagnose the disorder in their children. It requires considerable experience and training to become competent at making a diagnosis. Please call the clinic for advice. A total of six (or more) items from the three domains, with at least two affecting social interactions and one each affecting communication and stereotypical behaviours.

Popular speculations about the possible causes of autism are a defective gene, a defective brain, an unknown virus, an environmental pollutant like mercury, a vaccination, or watching too much TV. The causes of autism are usually said to be biological. That is not true. The true causes of autism, like the causes of every other mental illness, are psychological, not biological. Essentially, autism is an extreme selfish reaction. As with every other person in a state of intense selfish reaction, the main objects of children with autism are their selfish parents. The symptoms of autism are parent-related reactions. The early signs of autism usually continue to grow in intensity as long as the autistic child's parents hold firm to their subconscious negative positions in relation to their child. Autism is a child disorder epidemic that is starting to overwhelm us. A staggering 1 in 150 children are now diagnosed with autism. The personal, family, and social costs of autism are going sky high. Autistic children suffer psychologically and consistently to a great degree. The parents of autistic children pay a huge mental, emotional, and financial price. Autism affects us all. It is important that we get to the truth about what is actually causing this growing, painful, expensive disorder. The annual cost of autism is fast approaching estimated costs of other so-called \ufffddisease conditions\ufffd such as Alzheimer\ufffds disease ($100 billion per year), depression (53 billion per year, anxiety disorder ($47 billion per year), and schizophrenia ($67 billion per year). In spite of huge investments of public and private money in research, the incidences and medical costs keep climbing at alarming rates, and no autistic ever actually heals from conventional treatments. The main reason solutions elude us is that the medical assumptions about disorders are false. Mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders, essentially, have psychological causes, they are not biological problems. 5 eBooks Available for Instant Download Now! 261 pages 204 pages 320 pages 445 pages 131 pages $14.95 $14.95 $14.95 $14.95 $8.95 New Information about the Causes of Autism Note: The content and our case studies do not reflect the whole picture of a person or our humanity.

Our personal and collective negatives are what need attention and change. On this Website, you will get a new, shocking, and what we believe to be an accurate view of hidden causes of autism and autistic behavior. You will read fascinating, but sad, clairvoyant readings (autism stories or case studies) that show deeply hidden parent and child reactions. Education will not solve this growing problem. Psychiatric drugs will not solve it either. The solution and steps to healing lie in autistic children and their parents making truly right choices in relation to each other. In the early 1950's and through the early 1970's many medical professionals thought that the mothers of autistic children were neglecting and not loving their children. That neglect was causing their autistic children to withdraw psychologically into a world of their own. These mothers were called Refrigerator Mothers. That view attempted to connect the problems that dysfunctional children were having to the unloving choices of their parents. Since then, such views have been suppressed and ridiculed by the medical establishment. They have especially been suppressed and ridiculed by the politically-active, highly organized armies of parents with dysfunctional children who starting pushing their self-interested ideas and theories in the 1970s . Since then, the investigation of medical causes of autism typically have shifted away from any possibility of parent involvement. Causes of autism (actually, causes of all mental, emotional, and behavior disorders) are now generally assumed to be \ufffdbiological causes.\ufffd Medical explanations of autism are very similar to those alleged to explain other serious mental illnesses and behavioral disorders. No one is ever at fault or has any responsibility. All of these medical explanations are based on questionable research methods, conclusions, and motives. The unfounded and unproven claims include beliefs that autistic symptoms are due to a yet to be discovered defective gene, an untestable brain disorder, an unknown virus, a vitamin deficiency, ingredients in vaccines, or possibly some kind of environmental chemical contamination. Doctors insist that autistic children are suffering from a \ufffddisease.\ufffd Their disease label and model opens wide a money door that can send the cost for educating and treating a severely autistic child as high as $100,000 a year. Refrigerator Mothers and Refrigerator Fathers Our research on autism and the early signs of autism, based mainly on Jean Mastellone\ufffds clairvoyant research into subconscious factors influencing autism, indicate that those medical professionals who believed that \ufffdRefrigerator Mothers were a factor in autistic behavior, were on the right track, but were not seeing the whole picture. In fact, Jean\ufffds autistic case study profiles of autistic children show that they are in extreme selfish reaction and withdrawal from both their \ufffdRefrigerator Mothers and their \ufffdRefrigerator Fathers. That\ufffds right, Jean\ufffds Inner Profiles reveal that subconsciously both parents of an autistic child have been subconsciously rejecting their child since conception and during womb life. The parental rejection is inward, and the parents usually have little or no conscious clue as to how they are truly feeling about their child. Usually, their conscious attitudes are of love, wanting, and caring. However, their child is aware of, understands, relates to, and strongly reacts to their parents' deeper, truer, negative thoughts and feelings of not wanting the child. The child dismisses his or her parents\ufffd less sincere outward and conscious positive projections. Rejected - No place to go Children with autism are in extreme selfish reaction to double-parent rejection. Autistic children perceive themselves as unwanted and having \ufffdno where to go.\ufffd Subconsciously, and often consciously, they are enacting willful, defiant, destructive intentions and behavior patterns. Autistic children and teens have been reacting in extreme ways to both their parents' subconscious and unseen selfish attitudes since before birth. This \ufffdentirely different on top from underneath parent psychological phenomenon\ufffd is common. It is a hidden influential factor in most serious disorders that incites and fuels a child's dysfunctional symptoms, which actually are selfish reactions not diseases. It is important we stop believing our lies about our negative behavior. Read Autism Articles Free Read an Autistic Child Teen Case Study Free Subconscious is key To properly understand autism and the early signs of autism (or any other serious mental, emotional, or behavioral disorder), it is necessary to accurately understand the psychological sophistication of the unborn baby, the true nature of our subconscious, and crucial hidden factors influencing mental illnesses. Healing Healing from autism is extremely complicated because the causal choices are made subconsciously in reaction to the subconscious choices of the mother and father. All of those causal choices began initially while the child was a fetus in the womb. Those choices may have inhibited an unborn baby in his or her natural psychological maturity, also may have extended to impairing the baby\ufffds physical development. Other subconscious psychological factors are child-to-parent negative agreements. The specifics of these agreements can keep a child subconsciously and psychologically locked into destructive behavior that the child consciously feels \ufffdhelpless to change or stop. The child\ufffds subconscious destructive reactions are often perceived similarly, and can greatly frustrate a child who may consciously want to change but cannot seem to do so. There are always clues as to how an expectant mother or father feels about having a baby. When a baby is not wanted, for whatever reason, a parent will often feel a sense of dread. This feeling is selfish not normal. It should not be ignored or lightly dismissed. A parent's conscious negative feelings can be used to access deeper, subconscious negative feelings and thoughts. Extreme selfish reaction An autistic child's selfish reaction is extreme. That reaction usually corresponds to the number and degree of selfish attitudes being indulged in by his or her parents. If an unborn child\ufffds mother seriously considers having an abortion, then for some reason decides not to have an abortion, the issue is rarely closed or ended. There are usually ongoing inner conflicts about the choice to have the baby and those conflicts can cause an embryo, fetus, infant, and young child to have ongoing selfish reactions. As the child grows and continually reacts in willful and defiant ways, those conflicts and reactions incite parental reactions and the reactive circle goes round and round. Most parents of autistic children tell themselves that their negative feelings relate to their autistic child\ufffds behavior and do not realize that they actually are responsible for starting the reactive circle. Of course, it must be extremely frustrating and hard to raise an autistic child. The many daily negative interactions and reactions make loving exchanges near impossible. The negative aspects of family life are usually covered-up. Subconsciously, all in the family are aware of the actual truth about their negative intentions, feelings, and choices. Buck stops here Our research on autism shows that the ultimate responsibility for healing lies with the autistic child. The child must decide to stop reacting and start making right choices. Children with autism have, like most other children, made their parents personal gods. Important choices are made in relation to their parents rather than in relation to what they know is right. Without a doubt, huge obstacles to an autistic child\ufffds improvement will be his or her parents\ufffd unwillingness to be wrong or look bad. The autistic child's parents must decide to change their most basic (subconscious) attitudes toward their child. Core-level positive choices are necessary if the reactive circle that defines the autistic syndrome is to end. Self-healing by parents will go a long way toward bringing a reactive child out of his or her painful, self-created psychological hole. In general, many core-level changes are required if we are to get out of the dysfunctional messes we have created with our selfish choices. Individually, we must all do our part to end The Great Cover-Up. Otherwise, as parents continue to conceive children that on their deepest level of being they actually do not want, but choose to have, babies in the womb will react. When unborn babies react selfishly and strongly to their parents rejection, the early signs of autism will start manifesting. The true causes of autism and the early signs of autism will constantly elude medical professionals as long as they hold firm to their unproven biological views.

CEUs Credits Hours (Units): 2 Fee: $ 16 Autism - Isolated in worlds of their own, people with autism appear indifferent and remote and are unable to form emotional bonds with others. Although people with this baffling brain disorder can display a wide range of symptoms and disability, many are incapable of understanding other people's thoughts, feelings, and needs. Often, language and intelligence fail to develop fully, making communication and social relationships difficult. Many people with autism engage in repetitive activities, like rocking or banging their heads, or rigidly following familiar patterns in their everyday routines. Some are painfully sensitive to sound, touch, sight, or smell. Children with autism do not follow the typical patterns of child development. In some children, hints of future problems may be apparent from birth. In most cases, the problems become more noticeable as the child slips farther behind other children the same age. Other children start off well enough. But between 18 and 36 months old, they suddenly reject people, act strangely, and lose language and social skills they had already acquired. But there is help-and hope. Gone are the days when people with autism were isolated, typically sent away to institutions. Today, many youngsters can be helped to attend school with other children. Methods are available to help improve their social, language, and academic skills. Even though more than 60 percent of adults with autism continue to need care throughout their lives, some programs are beginning to demonstrate that with appropriate support, many people with autism can be trained to do meaningful work and participate in the life of the community. Autism is found in every country and region of the world, and in families of all racial, ethnic, religious, and economic backgrounds. Emerging in childhood, it affects about 1 or 2 people in every thousand and is three to four times more common in boys than girls. Girls with the disorder, however, tend to have more severe symptoms and lower intelligence. In addition to loss of personal potential, the cost of health and educational services to those affected exceeds $3 billion each year. So, at some level, autism affects us all. What is Autism? Autism is a brain disorder that typically affects a person's ability to communicate, form relationships with others, and respond appropriately to the environment. Some people with autism are relatively high-functioning, with speech and intelligence intact. Others are mentally retarded, mute, or have serious language delays. For some, autism makes them seem closed off and shut down; others seem locked into repetitive behaviors and rigid patterns of thinking. Although people with autism do not have exactly the same symptoms and deficits, they tend to share certain social, communication, motor, and sensory problems that affect their behavior in predictable ways. Difference in the Behaviors of Infants With and Without Autism Infants with Autism Normal Infants Communication Avoid eye contact Seem deaf Start developing language, then abruptly stop talking altogether Study mother's face Easily stimulated by sounds Keep adding to vocabulary and expanding grammatical usage Social relationships Act as if unaware of the coming and going of others Physically attack and injure others without provocation Inaccessible, as if in a shell Cry when mother leaves the room and are anxious with strangers Get upset when hungry or frustrated Recognize familiar faces and smile Exploration of environment Remain fixated on a single item or activity Practice strange actions like rocking or hand-flapping Sniff or lick toys Show no sensitivity to burns or bruises, and engage in self-mutilation, such as eye gouging Move from one engrossing object or activity to another Use body purposefully to reach or acquire objects Explore and play with toys Seek pleasure and avoid pain Social symptoms From the start, most infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, endearingly grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most children with autism seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention and affection or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to anger or affection. Unlike other children, they rarely become upset when the parent leaves or show pleasure when the parent returns. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of response. Children with autism also take longer to learn to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues-whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace-may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, \"Come here,\" always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or squinting and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with autism have problems seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with autism may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. Some people with autism also tend to be physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. Some lose control, particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They are capable at times of breaking things, attacking others, or harming themselves. Alan, for example, may fall into a rage, biting and kicking when he is frustrated or angry. Paul, when tense or overwhelmed, may break a window or throw things. Others are self-destructive, banging their heads, pulling their hair, or biting their arms. Language difficulties By age 3, most children have passed several predictable milestones on the path to learning language. One of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it very clear that his answer is no. By age 2, most children begin to put together sentences like \"See doggie,\" or \"More cookie,\" and can follow simple directions. Research shows that about half of the children diagnosed with autism remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of autism do coo and babble during the first 6 months of life. But they soon stop. Although they may learn to communicate using sign language or special electronic equipment, they may never speak. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 8. Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. Some seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words. Others repeat the same phrase no matter what the situation. Some children with autism are only able to parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Without persistent training, echoing other people's phrases may be the only language that people with autism ever acquire. What they repeat might be a question they were just asked, or an advertisement on television. Or out of the blue, a child may shout, \"Stay on your own side of the road!\"-something he heard his father say weeks before. Although children without autism go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are. People with autism also tend to confuse pronouns. They fail to grasp that words like \"my,\" \"I,\" and \"you,\" change meaning depending on who is speaking. When Alan's teacher asks, \"What is my name?\" he answers, \"My name is Alan.\" Some children say the same phrase in a variety of different situations. One child, for example, says \"Get in the car,\" at random times throughout the day. While on the surface, her statement seems bizarre, there may be a meaningful pattern in what the child says. The child may be saying, \"Get in the car,\" whenever she wants to go outdoors. In her own mind, she's associated \"Get in the car,\" with leaving the house. Another child, who says \"Milk and cookies\" whenever he is pleased, may be associating his good feelings around this treat with other things that give him pleasure. It can be equally difficult to understand the body language of a person with autism. Most of us smile when we talk about things we enjoy, or shrug when we can't answer a question. But for children with autism, facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Their tone of voice also fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with autism are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, children with autism may simply scream or grab what they want. Temple Grandin, an exceptional woman with autism who has written two books about her disorder, admits, \"Not being able to speak was utter frustration. Screaming was the only way I could communicate.\" Often she would logically think to herself, \"I am going to scream now because I want to tell somebody I don't want to do something.\" Until they are taught better means of expressing their needs, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to others. Repetitive behaviors and obsessions Although children with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. A child might spend hours repeatedly flicking or flapping her fingers or rocking back and forth. Many flail their arms or walk on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position. Experts call such behaviors stereotypes or self-stimulation. Some people with autism also tend to repeat certain actions over and over. A child might spend hours lining up pretzel sticks. Or, like Alan, run from room to room turning lights on and off. Some children with autism develop troublesome fixations with specific objects, which can lead to unhealthy or dangerous behaviors. For example, one child insists on carrying feces from the bathroom into her classroom. Other behaviors are simply startling, humorous, or embarrassing to those around them. One girl, obsessed with digital watches, grabs the arms of strangers to look at their wrists. For unexplained reasons, people with autism demand consistency in their environment. Many insist on eating the same foods, at the same time, sitting at precisely the same place at the table every day. They may get furious if a picture is tilted on the wall, or wildly upset if their toothbrush has been moved even slightly. A minor change in their routine, like taking a different route to school, may be tremendously upsetting. Scientists are exploring several possible explanations for such repetitive, obsessive behavior. Perhaps the order and sameness lends some stability in a world of sensory confusion. Perhaps focused behaviors help them to block out painful stimuli. Yet another theory is that these behaviors are linked to the senses that work well or poorly. A child who sniffs everything in sight may be using a stable sense of smell to explore his environment. Or perhaps the reverse is true: he may be trying to stimulate a sense that is dim. Imaginative play, too, is limited by these repetitive behaviors and obsessions. Most children, as early as age 2, use their imagination to pretend. They create new uses for an object, perhaps using a bowl for a hat. Or they pretend to be someone else, like a mother cooking dinner for her \"family\" of dolls. In contrast, children with autism rarely pretend. Rather than rocking a doll or rolling a toy car, they may simply hold it, smell it, or spin it for hours on end. Sensory symptoms When children's perceptions are accurate, they can learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory information is faulty or if the input from the various senses fails to merge into a coherent picture, the child's experiences of the world can be confusing. People with autism seem to have one or both of these problems. There may be problems in the sensory signals that reach the brain or in the integration of the sensory signals-and quite possibly, both. Apparently, as a result of a brain malfunction, many children with autism are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin so disturbing that they can't focus on anything else. For others, a gentle hug may be overwhelming. Some children cover their ears and scream at the sound of a vacuum cleaner, a distant airplane, a telephone ring, or even the wind. Temple Grandin says, \"It was like having a hearing aid that picks up everything, with the volume control stuck on super loud.\" Because any noise was so painful, she often chose to withdraw and tuned out sounds to the point of seeming deaf. In autism, the brain also seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some children with autism seem oblivious to extreme cold or pain, but react hysterically to things that wouldn't bother other children. A child with autism may break her arm in a fall and never cry. Another child might bash his head on the wall without a wince. On the other hand, a light touch may make the child scream with alarm. In some people, the senses are even scrambled. One child gags when she feels a certain texture. A man with autism hears a sound when someone touches a point on his chin. Another experiences certain sounds as colors. Unusual abilities Some people with autism display remarkable abilities. A few demonstrate skills far out of the ordinary. At a young age, when other children are drawing straight lines and scribbling, some children with autism are able to draw detailed, realistic pictures in three-dimensional perspective. Some toddlers who are autistic are so visually skilled that they can put complex jigsaw puzzles together. Many begin to read exceptionally early-sometimes even before they begin to speak. Some who have a keenly developed sense of hearing can play musical instruments they have never been taught, play a song accurately after hearing it once, or name any note they hear. Like the person played by Dustin Hoffman in the movie Rain Man, some people with autism can memorize entire television shows, pages of the phone book or the scores of every major league baseball game for the past 20 years. However, such skills, known as islets of intelligence or savant skills are rare. How is Autism Diagnosed? Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child. In many cases, their baby seemed \"different\" from birth-being unresponsive to people and toys, or focusing intently on one item for long periods of time. The first signs of autism may also appear in children who had been developing normally. When an affectionate, babbling toddler suddenly becomes silent, withdrawn, violent, or self-abusive, something is wrong. Even so, years may go by before the family seeks a diagnosis. Well-meaning friends and relatives sometimes help parents ignore the problems with reassurances that \"Every child is different,\" or \"Janie can talk-she just doesn't want to!\" Unfortunately, this only delays getting appropriate assessment and treatment for the child.

And no two children with the disorder behave the same way. In addition, several conditions can cause symptoms that resemble those of autism. So parents and the child's pediatrician need to rule out other disorders, including hearing loss, speech problems, mental retardation, and neurological problems. But once these possibilities have been eliminated, a visit to a professional who specializes in autism is necessary. Such specialists include people with the professional titles of child psychiatrist, child psychologist, developmental pediatrician, or pediatric neurologist. Autism specialists use a variety of methods to identify the disorder. Using a standardized rating scale, the specialist closely observes and evaluates the child's language and social behavior. A structured interview is also used to elicit information from parents about the child's behavior and early development. Reviewing family videotapes, photos, and baby albums may help parents recall when each behavior first occurred and when the child reached certain developmental milestones. The specialists may also test for certain genetic and neurological problems. Specialists may also consider other conditions that produce many of the same behaviors and symptoms as autism, such as Rett's Disorder or Asperger's Disorder. Rett's Disorder is a progressive brain disease that only affects girls but, like autism, produces repetitive hand movements and leads to loss of language and social skills. Children with Asperger's Disorder are very like high-functioning children with autism. Although they have repetitive behaviors, severe social problems, and clumsy movements, their language and intelligence are usually intact. Unlike autism, the symptoms of Asperger's Disorder typically appear later in childhood. Diagnostic criteria After assessing observations and test results, the specialist makes a diagnosis of autism only if there is clear evidence of: poor or limited social relationships underdeveloped communication skills repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities. People with autism generally have some impairment within each category, although the severity of each symptom may vary. The diagnostic criteria also require that these symptoms appear by age 3. However, some specialists are reluctant to give a diagnosis of autism. They fear that it will cause parents to lose hope. As a result, they may apply a more general term that simply describes the child's behaviors or sensory deficits. \"Severe communication disorder with autism-like behaviors,\" \"multi-sensory system disorder,\" and \"sensory integration dysfunction\" are some of the terms that are used. Children with milder or fewer symptoms are often diagnosed as having Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD). Although terms like Asperger's Disorder and PDD do not significantly change treatment options, they may keep the child from receiving the full range of specialized educational services available to children diagnosed with autism. They may also give parents false hope that their child's problems are only temporary. What Causes Autism? It is generally accepted that autism is caused by abnormalities in brain structures or functions. Using a variety of new research tools to study human and animal brain growth, scientists are discovering more about normal development and how abnormalities occur. The brain of a fetus develops throughout pregnancy. Starting out with a few cells, the cells grow and divide until the brain contains billions of specialized cells, called neurons. Research sponsored by NIMH and other components at the National Institutes of Health is playing a key role in showing how cells find their way to a specific area of the brain and take on special functions. Once in place, each neuron sends out long fibers that connect with other neurons. In this way, lines of communication are established between various areas of the brain and between the brain and the rest of the body. As each neuron receives a signal it releases chemicals called neurotransmitters, which pass the signal to the next neuron. By birth, the brain has evolved into a complex organ with several distinct regions and sub regions, each with a precise set of functions and responsibilities. Different parts of the brain have different functions The hippocampus makes it possible to recall recent experience and new information The amygdala directs our emotional responses The frontal lobes of the cerebrum allow us to solve problems, plan ahead, understand the behavior of others, and restrain our impulses The parietal areas control hearing, speech, and language The cerebellum regulates balance, body movements, coordination, and the muscles used in speaking The corpus callossum passes information from one side of the brain to the other But brain development does not stop at birth. The brain continues to change during the first few years of life, as new neurotransmitters become activated and additional lines of communication are established. Neural networks are forming and creating a foundation for processing language, emotions, and thought. However, scientists now know that a number of problems may interfere with normal brain development. Cells may migrate to the wrong place in the brain. Or, due to problems with the neural pathways or the neurotransmitters, some parts of the communication network may fail to perform. A problem with the communication network may interfere with the overall task of coordinating sensory information, thoughts, feelings, and actions. Researchers supported by NIMH and other NIH Institutes are scrutinizing the structures and functions of the brain for clues as to how a brain with autism differs from the normal brain. In one line of study, researchers are investigating potential defects that occur during initial brain development. Other researchers are looking for defects in the brains of people already known to have autism. Scientists are also looking for abnormalities in the brain structures that make up the limbic system. Inside the limbic system, an area called the amygdala is known to help regulate aspects of social and emotional behavior. One study of high-functioning children with autism found that the amygdala was indeed impaired but that another area of the brain, the hippocampus, was not. In another study, scientists followed the development of monkeys whose amygdala was disrupted at birth. Like children with autism, as the monkeys grew, they became increasingly withdrawn and avoided social contact. Differences in neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system, are also being explored. For example, high levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin have been found in a number of people with autism. Since neurotransmitters are responsible for passing nerve impulses in the brain and nervous system, it is possible that they are involved in the distortion of sensations that accompanies autism. NIMH grantees are also exploring differences in overall brain function, using a technology called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify which parts of the brain are energized during specific mental tasks. In a study of adolescent boys, NIMH researchers observed that during problem-solving and language tasks, teenagers with autism were not only less successful than peers without autism, but the MRI images of their brains showed less activity. In a study of younger children, researchers observed low levels of activity in the parietal areas and the corpus callosum. Such research may help scientists determine whether autism reflects a problem with specific areas of the brain or with the transmission of signals from one part of the brain to another. Each of these differences has been seen in some but not all the people with autism who were tested. What could this mean? Perhaps the term autism actually covers several different disorders, each caused by a different problem in the brain. Or perhaps the various brain differences are themselves caused by a single underlying disorder that scientists have not yet identified. Discovering the physical basis of autism should someday allow us to better identify, treat, and possibly prevent it. Factors affecting brain development But what causes normal brain development to go awry? Some NIMH researchers are investigating genetic causes-the role that heredity and genes play in passing the disorder from one generation to the next. Others are looking at medical problems related to pregnancy and other factors. Heredity. Several studies of twins suggest that autism- or at least a higher likelihood of some brain dysfunction-can be inherited. For example, identical twins are far more likely than fraternal twins to both have autism. Unlike fraternal twins, which develop from two separate eggs, identical twins develop from a single egg and have the same genetic makeup. It appears that parents who have one child with autism are at slightly increased risk for having more than one child with autism. This also suggests a genetic link. However, autism does not appear to be due to one particular gene. If autism, like eye color, were passed along by a single gene, more family members would inherit the disorder. NIMH grantees, using state-of-the-art gene splicing techniques, are searching for irregular segments of genetic code that the autistic members of a family may have inherited. Some scientists believe that what is inherited is an irregular segment of genetic code or a small cluster of three to six unstable genes. In most people, the faulty code may cause only minor problems. But under certain conditions, the unstable genes may interact and seriously interfere with the brain development of the unborn child. A body of NIMH-sponsored research is testing this theory. One study is exploring whether parents and siblings who do not have autism show minor symptoms, such as mild social, language, or reading problems. If so, such findings would suggest that several members of a family can inherit the irregular or unstable genes, but that other as yet unidentified conditions must be present for the full-blown disorder to develop. Pregnancy and other problems. Throughout pregnancy, the fetal brain is growing larger and more complex, as new cells, specialized regions, and communication networks form. During this time, anything that disrupts normal brain development may have lifelong effects on the child's sensory, language, social, and mental functioning. For this reason, researchers are exploring whether certain conditions, like the mother's health during pregnancy, problems during delivery, or other environmental factors may interfere with normal brain development. Viral infections like rubella (also called German measles), particularly in the first three months of pregnancy, may lead to a variety of problems, possibly including autism and retardation. Lack of oxygen to the baby and other complications of delivery may also increase the risk of autism. However, there is no clear link. Such problems occur in the delivery of many infants who are not autistic, and most children with autism are born without such factors. Are There Accompanying Disorders? Several disorders commonly accompany autism. To some extent, these may be caused by a common underlying problem in brain functioning. Mental retardation Of the problems that can occur with autism, mental retardation is the most widespread. Seventy-five to 80 percent of people with autism are mentally retarded to some extent. Fifteen to 20 percent are considered severely retarded, with IQs below 35. (A score of 100 represents average intelligence.) But autism does not necessarily correspond with mental impairment. More than 10 percent of people with autism have an average or above average IQ. A few show exceptional intelligence. Interpreting IQ scores is difficult, however, because most intelligence tests are not designed for people with autism. People with autism do not perceive or relate to their environment in typical ways. When tested, some areas of ability are normal or even above average, and some areas may be especially weak. For example, a child with autism may do extremely well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low scores on the language subtests. Seizures About one-third of the children with autism develop seizures, starting either in early childhood or adolescence. Researchers are trying to learn if there is any significance to the time of onset, since the seizures often first appear when certain neurotransmitters become active. Since seizures range from brief blackouts to full-blown body convulsions, an electroencephalogram (EEG) can help confirm their presence. Fortunately, in most cases, seizures can be controlled with medication. Fragile X One disorder, Fragile X syndrome, has been found in about 10 percent of people with autism, mostly males. This inherited disorder is named for a defective piece of the X-chromosome that appears pinched and fragile when seen under a microscope. People who inherit this faulty bit of genetic code are more likely to have mental retardation and many of the same symptoms as autism along with unusual physical features that are not typical of autism. Tuberous Sclerosis There is also some relationship between autism and Tuberous Sclerosis, a genetic condition that causes abnormal tissue growth in the brain and problems in other organs. Although Tuberous Sclerosis is a rare disorder, occurring less than once in 10,000 births, about a fourth of those affected are also autistic. Scientists are exploring genetic conditions such as Fragile X and Tuberous Sclerosis to see why they so often coincide with autism. Understanding exactly how these conditions disrupt normal brain development may provide insights to the biological and genetic mechanisms of autism. Is There Reason for Hope? When parents learn that their child is autistic, most wish they could magically make the problem go away. They looked forward to having a baby and watching their child learn and grow. Instead, they must face the fact that they have a child who may not live up to their dreams and will daily challenge their patience. Some families deny the problem or fantasize about an instant cure. They may take the child from one specialist to another, hoping for a different diagnosis. It is important for the family to eventually overcome their pain and deal with the problem, while still cherishing hopes for their child's future. Most families realize that their lives can move on. Today, more than ever before, people with autism can be helped. A combination of early intervention, special education, family support, and in some cases, medication, is helping increasing numbers of children with autism to live more normal lives. Special interventions and education programs can expand their capacity to learn, communicate, and relate to others, while reducing the severity and frequency of disruptive behaviors. Medications can be used to help alleviate certain symptoms. Older children and adults like Paul may also benefit from the treatments that are available today. So, while no cure is in sight, it is possible to greatly improve the day-to-day life of children and adults with autism. Today, a child who receives effective therapy and education has every hope of using his or her unique capacity to learn. Even some who are seriously mentally retarded can often master many self-help skills like cooking, dressing, doing laundry, and handling money. For such children, greater independence and self-care may be the primary training goals. Other youngsters may go on to learn basic academic skills, like reading, writing, and simple math. Many complete high school. Some, like Temple Grandin, may even earn college degrees. Like anyone else, their personal interests provide strong incentives to learn. Clearly, an important factor in developing a child's long-term potential for independence and success is early intervention. The sooner a child begins to receive help, the more opportunity for learning. Furthermore, because a young child's brain is still forming, scientists believe that early intervention gives children the best chance of developing their full potential. Even so, no matter when the child is diagnosed, it's never too late to begin treatment. Can Social Skills and Behavior Be Improved? A number of treatment approaches have evolved in the decades since autism was first identified. Some therapeutic programs focus on developing skills and replacing dysfunctional behaviors with more appropriate ones. Others focus on creating a stimulating learning environment tailored to the unique needs of children with autism. Researchers have begun to identify factors that make certain treatment programs more effective in reducing- or reversing-the limitations imposed by autism. Treatment programs that build on the child's interests, offer a predictable schedule, teach tasks as a series of simple steps, actively engage the child's attention in highly structured activities, and provide regular reinforcement of behavior, seem to produce the greatest gains. Parent involvement has also emerged as a major factor in treatment success. Parents work with teachers and therapists to identify the behaviors to be changed and the skills to be taught. Recognizing that parents are the child's earliest teachers, more programs are beginning to train parents to continue the therapy at home. Research is beginning to suggest that mothers and fathers who are trained to work with their child can be as effective as professional teachers and therapists. Developmental approaches Professionals have found that many children with autism learn best in an environment that builds on their skills and interests while accommodating their special needs. Programs employing a developmental approach provide consistency and structure along with appropriate levels of stimulation. For example, a predictable schedule of activities each day helps children with autism plan and organize their experiences. Using a certain area of the classroom for each activity helps students know what they are expected to do. For those with sensory problems, activities that sensitize or desensitize the child to certain kinds of stimulation may be especially helpful. In one developmental preschool classroom, a typical session starts with a physical activity to help develop balance, coordination, and body awareness. Children string beads, piece puzzles together, paint and participate in other structured activities. At snack time, the teacher encourages social interaction and models how to use language to ask for more juice. Later, the teacher stimulates creative play by prompting the children to pretend being a train. As in any classroom, the children learn by doing. Although higher-functioning children may be able to handle academic work, they too need help to organize the task and avoid distractions. A student with autism might be assigned the same addition problems as her classmates. But instead of assigning several pages in the textbook, the teacher might give her one page at a time or make a list of specific tasks to be checked off as each is done. Behaviorist approaches When people are rewarded for a certain behavior, they are more likely to repeat or continue that behavior. Behaviorist training approaches are based on this principle. When children with autism are rewarded each time they attempt or perform a new skill, they are likely to perform it more often. With enough practice, they eventually acquire the skill. For example, a child who is rewarded whenever she looks at the therapist may gradually learn to make eye contact on her own. Dr. O. Ivar Lovaas pioneered the use of behaviorist methods for children with autism more than 25 years ago. His methods involve time-intensive, highly structured, repetitive sequences in which a child is given a command and rewarded each time he responds correctly. For example, in teaching a young boy to sit still, a therapist might place him in front of chair and tell him to sit. If the child doesn't respond, the therapist nudges him into the chair. Once seated, the child is immediately rewarded in some way. A reward might be a bit of chocolate, a sip of juice, a hug, or applause-whatever the child enjoys. The process is repeated many times over a period of up to two hours. Eventually, the child begins to respond without being nudged and sits for longer periods of time. Learning to sit still and follow directions then provides a foundation for learning more complex behaviors. Using this approach for up to 40 hours a week, some children may be brought to the point of near-normal behavior. Others are much less responsive to the treatment. However, some researchers and therapists believe that less intensive treatments, particularly those begun early in a child's life, may be more efficient and just as effective. So, over the years, researchers sponsored by NIMH and other agencies have continued to study and modify the behaviorist approach. Today, some of these behaviorist treatment programs are more individualized and built around the child's own interests and capabilities. Many programs also involve parents or other non-autistic children in teaching the child. Instruction is no longer limited to a controlled environment, but takes place in natural, everyday settings. Thus, a trip to the supermarket may be an opportunity to practice using words for size and shape. Although rewarding desired behavior is still a key element, the rewards are varied and appropriate to the situation. A child who makes eye contact may be rewarded with a smile, rather than candy. NIMH is funding several types of behaviorist treatment approaches to help determine the best time for treatment to start, the optimum treatment intensity and duration, and the most effective methods to reach both high- and low-functioning children. Nonstandard approaches In trying to do everything possible to help their children, many parents are quick to try new treatments. Some treatments are developed by reputable therapists or by parents of a child with autism, yet when tested scientifically, cannot be proven to help. Before spending time and money and possibly slowing their child's progress, the family should talk with experts and evaluate the findings of objective reviewers. Following are some of the approaches that have not been shown to be effective in treating the majority of children with autism: Facilitated Communication, which assumes that by supporting a nonverbal child's arms and fingers so that he can type on a keyboard, the child will be able to type out his inner thoughts. Several scientific studies have shown that the typed messages actually reflect the thoughts of the person providing the support. Holding Therapy, in which the parent hugs the child for long periods of time, even if the child resists. Those who use this technique contend that it forges a bond between the parent and child. Some claim that it helps stimulate parts of the brain as the child senses the boundaries of her own body. There is no scientific evidence, however, to support these claims. Auditory Integration Training, in which the child listens to a variety of sounds with the goal of improving language comprehension. Advocates of this method suggest that it helps people with autism receive more balanced sensory input from their environment. When tested using scientific procedures, the method was shown to be no more effective than listening to music. Dolman/Delcato Method, in which people are made to crawl and move as they did at each stage of early development, in an attempt to learn missing skills. Again, no scientific studies support the effectiveness of the method. It is critical that parents obtain reliable, objective information before enrolling their child in any treatment program. Programs that are not based on sound principles and tested through solid research can do more harm than good. They may frustrate the child and cause the family to lose money, time, and hope. What Medications are Available? No medication can correct the brain structures or impaired nerve connections that seem to underlie autism. Scientists have found, however, that drugs developed to treat other disorders with similar symptoms are sometimes effective in treating the symptoms and behaviors that make it hard for people with autism to function at home, school, or work. It is important to note that none of the medications described in this section has been approved for autism by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is the Federal agency that authorizes the use of drugs for specific disorders. Medications used to treat anxiety and depression are being explored as a way to relieve certain symptoms of autism. These drugs scientists believe that autism and these disorders may share a problem in the functioning of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which these medications apparently help. One study found that about 60 percent of patients with autism who used fluoxetine became less distraught and aggressive. They became calmer and better able to handle changes in their routine or environment. However, fenfluramine, another medication that affects serotonin levels, has not proven to be helpful. People with an anxiety disorder called obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), like people with autism, are plagued by repetitive actions they can't control. Based on the premise that the two disorders may be related, one NIMH research study found that clomipramine, a medication used to treat OCD, does appear to be effective in reducing obsessive, repetitive behavior in some people with autism. Children with autism who were given the medication also seemed less withdrawn, angry, and anxious. But more research needs to be done to see if the findings of this study can be repeated. Some children with autism experience hyperactivity, the frenzied activity that is seen in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Since stimulant drugs like Ritalin are helpful in treating many people with ADHD, doctors have tried them to reduce the hyperactivity sometimes seen in autism. The drugs seem to be most effective when given to higher-functioning children with autism who do not have seizures or other neurological problems. Because many children with autism have sensory disturbances and often seem impervious to pain, scientists are also looking for medications that increase or decrease the transmission of physical sensations. Endorphins are natural painkillers produced by the body. But in certain people with autism, the endorphins seem to go too far in suppressing feeling. Scientists are exploring substances that block the effects of endorphins, to see if they can bring the sense of touch to a more normal range. Such drugs may be helpful to children who experience too little sensation. And once they can sense pain, such children could be less likely to bite themselves, bang their heads, or hurt themselves in other ways. Chlorpromazine, theoridazine, and haloperidol have also been used. Although these powerful drugs are typically used to treat adults with severe psychiatric disorders, they are sometimes given to people with autism to temporarily reduce agitation, aggression, and repetitive behaviors. However, since major tranquilizers are powerful medications that can produce serious and sometimes permanent side effects, they should be prescribed and used with extreme caution. Vitamin B6, taken with magnesium, is also being explored as a way to stimulate brain activity. Because vitamin B6 plays an important role in creating enzymes needed by the brain, some experts predict that large doses might foster greater brain activity in people with autism. However, clinical studies of the vitamin have been inconclusive and further study is needed. Like drugs, vitamins change the balance of chemicals in the body and may cause unwanted side effects. For this reason, large doses of vitamins should only be given under the supervision of a doctor. This is true of all vitamins and medications. What are the Educational Options? The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990 assures a free and appropriate public education to children with diagnosed learning deficits. The 1991 version of the law extended services to preschoolers who are developmentally delayed. As a result, public schools must provide services to handicapped children including those age 3 to 5. Because of the importance of early intervention, many states also offer special services to children from birth to age 3. The school may also be responsible for providing whatever services are needed to enable the child to attend school and learn. Such services might include transportation, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and any special equipment. Federally funded Parent Training Information Centers and Protection and Advocacy Agencies in each state can provide information on the rights of the family and child. By law, public schools are also required to prepare and carry out a set of specific instructional goals for every child in a special education program. The goals are stated as specific skills that the child will be taught to perform. The list of skills make up what is known as an \"IEP\"-the child's Individualized Educational Program. The IEP serves as an agreement between the school and the family on the educational goals. Because parents know their child best, they play an important role in creating this plan. They work closely with the school staff to identify which skills the child needs most. In planning the IEP, it's important to focus on what skills are critical to the child's well-being and future development. For each skill, parents and teachers should consider these questions: Is this an important life skill? What will happen if the child isn't trained to do this for herself? Such questions free parents and teachers to consider alternatives to training. After several years of valiant effort to teach Alan to tie his shoelaces, his parents and teachers decided that Alan could simply wear sneakers with Velcro fasteners, and dropped the skill from Alan's IEP. After Alan struggled in vain to memorize the multiplication table, they decided to teach him to use a calculator. A child's success in school should not be measured against standards like mastering algebra or completing high school. Rather, progress should be measured against his or her unique potential for self-care and self-sufficiency as an adult. Can Autism be Outgrown? At present, there is no cure for autism. Nor do children outgrow it. But the capacity to learn and develop new skills is within every child. With time, children with autism mature and new strengths emerge. Many children with autism seem to go through developmental spurts between ages 5 and 13. Some spontaneously begin to talk-even if repetitively-around age 5 or later. Some, like Paul, become more sociable, or like Alan, more ready to learn. Over time, and with help, children may learn to play with toys appropriately, function socially, and tolerate mild changes in routine. Some children in treatment programs lose enough of their most disabling symptoms to function reasonably well in a regular classroom. Some children with autism make truly dramatic strides. Of course, those with normal or near-normal intelligence and those who develop language tend to have the best outcomes. But even children who start off poorly may make impressive progress. For example, one boy, after 9 years in a program that involved parents as co-therapists, advanced from an IQ of 70 to an IQ of 100 and began to get average grades at a regular school. While it is natural for parents to hope that their child will \"become normal,\" they should take pride in whatever strides their child does make. Many parents, looking back over the years, find their child has progressed far beyond their initial expectations. Autism Gene Scans Converge on Two Suspect Sites, Two Types of Genetic Risk Four teams of scientists, using resources supported in part by NIMH, have pinpointed two different sites in the genome, each conferring a different type of genetic risk for autism. At one site, risk genes appear to be inherited. At the other, risk stems from spontaneous mutations, not seen in the genetics of the parents. In both examples, evidence suggests the suspect genes are critical for development of brain circuits impaired in autism. In the inherited form of risk, people with autism were more prone than healthy controls to have certain versions of a gene on Chromosome 7. In the spontaneous form, one percent of autism was traced to a conspicuous \"hot spot\" of missing or duplicated genes on Chromosome 16. The new leads help to focus the search for genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which affect 1 in 150 children with language, social and communication deficits and repetitive behaviors. Studies examining the occurrence of ASD in siblings and family members suggest that 90 percent of ASD involves genetic components, yet findings to date account for only about 10 percent of this. Most cases are spontaneous, rather than being passed through families as an inherited feature, suggesting that different rare and possibly multiple mutations likely influence risk in different combinations - and in complex interplay with environmental factors. \"Hot spot\" glitch is rare, but notably more prevalent in ASD In a genome-wide scan, a research team called the Autism Consortium found identical mutations associated with autism at the Chromosome 16 site in three separate samples. In families from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE), Children's Hospital Boston, and Iceland, about one percent of nearly 1500 people with autism or related developmental delays were either missing, or had duplicate copies of, about 25 genes in the Chromosome 16 area. Though very rare, the mutations were about 100 times more prevalent in children with ASD, the researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, January 9, 2008. The Chromosome 16 hot spot may be especially prone to such spontaneous rearrangements of genetic material because it evolved relatively recently and is unique to humans and other primates. \"Autism may be a relatively 'young' disease,\" notes an accompanying editorial.2 \"The first widely replicated autism-predisposition gene.\" Also drawing upon the AGRE resource, three other teams of researchers independently linked inherited variation in a gene on Chromosome 7, called CNTNAP2, with autism. They reported their findings online January 10, 2008, in the American Journal of Human Genetics. An accompanying editorial heralds this triangulation as \"the first widely replicated autism-predisposition gene.\"3 CNTNAP2 is a member of a gene family that makes proteins called Neurexins that have been previously implicated in autism. Neurexins play a key role during development in building the machinery by which brain cells communicate. CNTNAP2 is also conspicuously located in an area of Chromosome 7 consistently identified as harboring autism risk genes. In one of the new studies, genetic risk for impaired language in autism was linked to specific circuits known to malfunction in the disorder - but only in males. Daniel Geschwind, M.D., of the University of California, Los Angeles, and colleagues ultimately focused on CNTNAP2 after a re-examination of all genes in the suspect Chromosome 7 area.4 They winnowed their search from four candidate genes that emerged in 172 families and confirmed it in a larger sample of 304 families. The researchers found that a version of CNTNAP2 influences the age at which boys with autism say their first word. Delayed onset of speech is a hallmark of autism, which affects three times as many boys as girls. Boys also are more prone to attention deficit and language disorders and learning disabilities. The findings suggest that gender is likely an important clue in understanding how variation in the gene increases risk. \"Strikingly,\" expression of CNTNAP2 was narrowly restricted to only a set of interconnected brain structures responsible for speech, language, reward and other \"executive\" functions - precisely the circuits that malfunction in autism, researchers said. \"This gene may not only predispose children to autism,\" said Geschwind. \"It also may influence the development of brain structures involved in language, providing a tangible link between genes, the brain and behavior.\" Another study reported in the same issue of the journal also linked autism to another version, called the thymine variant, of CNTNAP2.5 A research team led by Aravinda Chakravarti, Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins University, found that children with autism were about 20 percent more likely to have inherited this version from their mothers than their fathers. The risk gene version was first identified in 145 children with autism from families that had two or more children with the disorder, and then confirmed in larger sample of 1295 families with autism, drawn from the NIMH Autism Genetics Initiative. A third group of researchers turned up several autism-linked rare variants of CNTNAP2.6 Matthew State, M.D., Ph.D., of Yale University, and colleagues, became interested in the gene after tracing cognitive and social delays in a child to a spontaneous glitch in a part of the gene. After a thorough search, they found a total of 27 different sites of variation in 635 patients - a relatively larger number than seen in 942 controls. The researchers further determined that 8 of 13 rare variants seen only in patients were likely deleterious to brain development. All three groups noted that the significance of their findings is amplified by the fact that the other groups also independently implicated CNTNAP2, each using a different approach. \"The three studies together identify a set of common and rare variants that provide unequivocal evidence that the CNTNAP2 gene, when disrupted, leads to a type of ASD,\" noted Dietrich Stephan, Ph.D., of the Translational Genomics Research Institute, in the accompanying editorial. In addition to this inherited risk subtype, he suggested that CNTNAP2 likely harbors mutations that confer risk for ASD in some individuals. By understanding these variations, science one day may be able to detect children carrying specific CNTNAP2 mutations and tailor early interventions to assist them during a critical period in brain development (12-24 months), suggested Stephan.

(Photo by FRED ADAMS/FOR THE TIMeS LEADER) By Mary Therese Biebel | Times Leader He squirms. He twists. He bounces up and down. Anyone can see it\ufffds not easy for 4-year-old Eric Fritz to sit quietly at the little table in his preschool. \ufffdC\ufffdmon, Eric. Stop,\ufffd a therapeutic support staff worker says, gently massaging the little boy\ufffds shoulders and trying to hold his torso still. It\ufffds snack time at the Wyoming Valley Children\ufffds Association in Forty Fort \ufffd and it\ufffds time for Eric to pay attention to speech pathologist Terry Tokach, who has put Goldfish crackers, pumpernickel pretzels and pieces of shortbread cookie on the table. \ufffdWhat do you want, Eric?\ufffd Tokach repeats again and again, holding out her hand. \ufffdWhich one do you want?\ufffd She doesn\ufffdt expect Eric to say \ufffdcracker\ufffd or \ufffdpretzel\ufffd \ufffd the little boy, who was diagnosed with autism when he was going on 2 years old \ufffd doesn\ufffdt communicate verbally. But, Tokach hopes he will communicate another way, by picking up a picture of a \ufffdcracker\ufffd or \ufffdpretzel\ufffd and handing it to her. Again and again, he simply grabs at the pretzels and crackers (not the cookies, which he doesn\ufffdt seem to like.) Again and again, Tokach steers his hand toward the appropriate picture. When he finally hands her one, she rewards him with food and praise. \ufffdGood job, Eric,\ufffd she tells the child, \ufffdI like it when you \ufffdtalk\ufffd to me. I like it when you look at me, too.\ufffd A reluctance to engage in eye contact is one symptom of autism, a developmental disorder that, according to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, affects 1 in 110 children to some extent. Delayed verbal skills and tendencies toward hyperactivity and repetitive motions are other symptoms. But, it was a lack of eye contact that first prompted Eric\ufffds father, also named Eric, to suspect something was amiss. \ufffdMy husband noticed he wasn\ufffdt getting enough eye interaction,\ufffd Lori Fritz explained during an interview in the family\ufffds Nanticoke home. Young Eric also \ufffdhad a few words, but they went away,\ufffd his mother said. \ufffdHis speech isn\ufffdt there, so we do signing.\ufffd Eric knows how to ask his parents for things he wants through sign language. The gesture for \ufffdmilk\ufffd looks like you\ufffdre moving your hands to milk a cow. The gesture for \ufffdbook\ufffd looks as if you\ufffdre opening the covers of a book. \ufffdEric\ufffds come so far,\ufffd Lori Fritz, 37, said with a smile as Eric, her firstborn, climbed over his father\ufffds lap and onto his shoulders, and leaned over to do a jigsaw puzzle on the floor. \ufffdHe\ufffds good at puzzles,\ufffd said the elder Eric, who is 38. The couple\ufffds younger son, David, 2, favors dinosaurs, and played with several colorful ones on a recent evening. \ufffdDavid likes to do everything Eric does, and Eric is usually pretty tolerant of David,\ufffd said the boys\ufffd father, who gave up a job in sales and service to become \ufffdMr. Mom.\ufffd Eric\ufffds job required out-of-state travel to cover a large territory, which caused him to miss out on a considerable amount of family time. With young Eric\ufffds special needs, it made sense for Dad to give up his career. \ufffdWe definitely play it as a team,\ufffd said Lori, who kept her job in pharmaceutical sales. \ufffdWhat I\ufffdm good at doing, I do. What he\ufffds good at doing, he does. For example, you would not want me to cook.\ufffd Laughing, Eric the cook lets on that he likes to make homemade chili and spaghetti sauce. A typical day for young Eric involves getting up around 7 a.m., getting dressed, perhaps watching a cartoon, and seeing a TSS worker from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. From noon to 2:30 most days, he attends a preschool program at the children\ufffds association, where he is in a class of seven students, each of whom receives lots of one-on-one attention. On Mondays and Wednesdays a TSS worker spends time with him at home in the late afternoon, and every day there are familiar routines of supper, bath, story time and songs. Bedtime is about 9:30 p.m. \ufffdHe\ufffds less resistant to going to bed than he used to be,\ufffd his father said. Rejoicing in small triumphs Children with autism tend to become overwhelmed by certain stimuli \ufffd it could be too many bright colors, too many people, or a whiff of a stranger\ufffds perfume, Lori Fritz explained. \ufffdEric isn\ufffdt a fan of crowds,\ufffd she said. To cope, children with autism sometimes \ufffdself-stimulate,\ufffd using repetitive motions or sounds to distract themselves from the overwhelming stimuli. In addition to sights, sounds and aromas, textures can be a challenge. Eric, for example, doesn\ufffdt like the way rice feels, his mother said. Yet he doesn\ufffdt have a problem with shaving cream. That became apparent on a recent afternoon when the staff at Eric\ufffds preschool had an exercise designed to help the class become accustomed to the smoothness of the cream. Teacher\ufffds aide Cathy Wolfe spread some foam on a table and Eric plunged his hands into it with gusto. Later that day, after his session with the speech pathologist, he met with occupational therapist Shari Aude, who soon had him coloring a picture of a bear with crayons, then finger-painting various shapes and lines. \ufffdThis is to get him used to the idea of holding a pencil,\ufffd Aude said. One part of his therapy Eric really seemed to enjoy was swinging on his stomach in a contraption called a \ufffdprone swing\ufffd or \ufffdvestibular swing.\ufffd Lying in a canvas swing that was suspended from the ceiling and hanging just a few inches above a thick rubber mat on the floor, Eric reached down to the mat with his hands and propelled himself around. \ufffdThis is to help him understand his place in space, to deal with gravitational insecurity,\ufffd Aude said. \ufffdIt\ufffds exercising his arms and hands too, and that will be helpful for holding a pencil. That\ufffds something he needs for kindergarten readiness.\ufffd What kind of school Eric eventually attends is a matter as yet undecided, his dad said, and it\ufffds hard to predict what his life will be like as an adult. Web sites devoted to autism suggest careers as diverse as caring for animals or searching for abnormal cells on a microscope slide can be ideal for some with autism. For now, Eric\ufffds parents rejoice in the small triumphs, as when their son communicates through sign language or obeys a simple request, perhaps to put away a toy. He does seem to be in perpetual motion, and the reason for all that jumping and running around sometimes mystifies his parents. \ufffdWe don\ufffdt know if he\ufffds being willful,\ufffd Lori Fritz said. \ufffdOr is it because he can\ufffdt help it?\ufffd The Fritz family of Nanticoke relaxes in the family room of their Nanticoke home.

These are the far senses. Less familiar are the near senses: tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular.... Autism Most D.C. - The vaccine additive thimerosal is not to blame for autism, a special federal court ruled Friday in a long-running battle by parents convinced there is a connection. While expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism. Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration, special master George Hastings Jr., wrote. But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case. The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court. Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines. The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling covered one theory, and a second was dropped after that. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories. That doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available. The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had already had its day in science court and failed to hold up. But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them. On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges, Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement. SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling. The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology, the goup said. The advocacy group Autism Speaks said the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases. However, while research has found no overall connection between autism and vaccines, the group said it would back research to determine if some individuals might be at increased risk because of genetic or medical conditions. Meanwhile, in reaction to the concerns of parents, thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines in the United States. In Friday's action the court ruled in three different cases, each concluding that the preservative has no connection to autism. The trio of rulings can offer reassurance to parents scared about vaccinating their babies because of a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, are on the rise. The U.S. Court of Claims is different from many other courts: The families involved didn't have to prove the inoculations definitely caused the complex neurological disorder, just that they probably did. More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation through the government's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the rulings dealt with test cases to settle which if any claims had merit. Autism is best known for impairing a child's ability to communicate and interact. Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it's unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosis. Worry about a vaccine link first arose in 1998 when a British physician, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published a medical journal article linking a particular type of autism and bowel disease to the measles vaccine. The study was later discredited. Share this article: var trkcid=87516072;var partnerID=548927; var _hb=1; 8 Comments Email this article Print this article Submit! Digg this!

What is the Definition of Autism? Autistic disorder (known also as infantile autism or childhood autism) almost always develops before the age of three and is characterized by impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, social interaction, some form of repetitive and restricted stereotyped interest, ritual, or other behavior. top ^ Description of Autism Children with autism often have extreme difficulty developing normal relationships with others. They tend not to share in the interests their peers have. In many cases these children are not able to interpret non-verbal cues of communication like facial expressions. Most people with autism have some impairment in language and many never speak at all. About 8.7 of every 10,000 children are autistic, and more than 1 in 300 children have some form of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). PDD means that some, but not all, symptoms of autism are present. Autism is a lifelong disease that ranges in severity from mild cases in which the autistic person can live independently, to severe forms in which the patient requires social support and medical supervision throughout his or her life. top ^ Causes of Autism There are physical bases for autism's development including genetic, infectious, and traumatic factors. Viral infection including rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy, have been studied as possible causes of autism. Children with Fragile X syndrome or tuberous sclerosis have higher rates of autism than the general population. Autism affects males four times more often than females, and there is a genetic basis for the disease. Contrary to previous notions, autism is not caused by upbringing. top ^ Symptoms of Autism The symptoms vary greatly but follow a general pattern. Not all symptoms are present in all autistic children. Autistic infants may act relatively normal during their first few months of life before becoming less responsive to their parents and other stimuli. They may have difficulty with feeding or toilet training; may not smile in recognition of their parents' faces, and may put up resistance to being cuddled. As they enter toddlerhood, it becomes increasingly apparent that these children have a world of their own. They do not play with other children or toys in the normal manner, rather they remain aloof and prefer to play alone. Parents often mention that their child is so undemanding that he or she is ?too good?. Verbal and nonverbal communication skills, such as speech and facial expressions, develop peculiarly. Symptoms range from mutism to prolonged use of echoing or stilted language. When language is present, it is often concrete, unimaginative, and immature. Another symptom of autism is an extreme resistance to change of any kind. Autistic children tend to want to maintain established behavior patterns and a set environment. They develop rituals in play, oppose change (such as moving furniture), and may become obsessed with one particular topic. Other behavioral abnormalities that may be present are: staring at hands or flapping arms and hands, walking on tiptoe, rocking, tantrums, strange postures, unpredictable behavior and hyperactivity. An autistic child has poor judgment and is therefore always at risk for danger. For instance, an autistic child may run into a busy street without any sign of fear. top ^ Diagnosis of Autism Properly diagnosing autism is very important, since confusion may result from inappropriate and ineffective treatment. Deafness is often the first suspected diagnosis, since autistic children may not respond normally to sounds and often do not speak.The children's appearance and muscle coordination are often normal. Occasionally, an autistic child has an outstanding skill (splinter skills), such as an incredible rote memory or musical ability. Such children may be referred to as \"autistic savants\", and occur in almost 10% of cases of autism. These skills can be quite astonishing. One example is the ability to play a piece of music almost perfectly after hearing it one time. Many children with autism have a second psychiatric disorder or a neurologic disorder. Mental retardation and seizure disorders are very common in autistic children and a thorough neurologic and psychiatric evaluation is necessary in every case of autism to ensure all the child?s medical problems are being addressed. top ^ Treatment for Autism Appropriate early intervention is important. Once the diagnosis has been made, the parents, physicians, and specialists should discuss what is best for the child. In most cases, parents are encouraged to take care of the child at home. Special education classes are available for autistic children. Structured, behaviorally-based programs, geared to the patient's developmental level have shown some promise. Most behavioral treatment programs include:clear instructions to the childprompting to perform specific behaviorsimmediate praise and rewards for performing those behaviorsa gradual increase in the complexity of reinforced behaviorsdefinite distinctions of when and when not to perform the learned behaviorsParents should be educated in behavioral techniques so they can participate in all aspects of the child's care and treatment. The more specialized instruction and behavior therapy the child receives, the more likely it is that the condition will improve. Medication can be recommended to treat specific symptoms such as seizures, hyperactivity, extreme mood changes, or self-injurious behaviors. The autistic child requires much of the parents' attention, often affecting the other children in the family. Counseling and support may be helpful for the parents.The outlook for each child depends on his or her intelligence and language ability. Some people with autism become independent adults. A majority can be taught to live in community-based homes, although they may require supervision throughout adulthood. top ^ What Questions to ask Your Doctor About Autism?

Now, many Aspies, a nickname for people with Asperger's syndrome, are upset over a proposal they see as an attack on their identity. Under proposed changes to the most widely used diagnostic manual of mental illness, Asperger's syndrome would no longer be a separate diagnosis. Instead, Asperger's and other forms of autism would be lumped together in a single autism spectrum disorders category. Some parents say they'd welcome the change, thinking it would eliminate confusion over autism's variations and perhaps lead to better educational services for affected kids. But opponents _ mostly older teens and adults with Asperger's _ disagree. Liane Holliday Willey, a Michigan author Aspie whose daughter also has Asperger's, fears Asperger's kids will be stigmatized by the autism label _ or will go undiagnosed and get no services at all. Grouping Aspies with people who have language delays, need more self-care and have lower IQs, how in the world are we going to rise to what we can do? Willey said. Rebecca Rubinstein, 23, a graduate student from Massapequa, N.Y., says she vehemently opposes the proposal and will think of herself as someone with Asperger's no matter what. Autism and Asperger's mean such different things, she said. Yes and no. Both are classified as neurodevelopmental disorders. Autism has long been considered a disorder that can range from mild to severe. Asperger's symptoms can vary, but the condition is generally thought of as a mild form and since 1994 has had a separate category in psychiatrists' diagnostic manual. Both autism and Asperger's involve poor social skills, repetitive behavior or interests, and problems communicating. But unlike classic autism, Asperger's does not typically involve delays in mental development or speech. The American Psychiatric Association's proposed revisions, announced Wednesday, involve autism and several other conditions. The suggested autism changes are based on research advances since 1994 showing little difference between mild autism and Asperger's. Evidence also suggests that doctors use the term loosely and disagree on what it means, according to psychiatrists urging the revisions. A new autism spectrum category recognizes that the symptoms of these disorders represent a continuum from mild to severe, rather than being distinct disorders, said Dr. Edwin Cook, a University of Illinois at Chicago autism researcher and member of the APA work group proposing the changes. The proposed revisions are posted online at http://www.DSM5.orgfor public comment, which will influence whether they are adopted. Publication of the updated manual is planned for May 2013. Dr. Mina Dulcan, child and adolescent psychiatry chief at Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital, said Aspies' opposition is not really a medical question, it's an identity question. It would be just like if you were a student at MIT. You might not want to be lumped with somebody in the community college, said Dulcan who supports the diagnostic change. One of the characteristics of people with Asperger's is that they're very resistant to change, Dulcan added. The change makes scientific sense. I'm sorry if it hurts people's feelings, she said. Harold Doherty, a New Brunswick lawyer whose 13-year-old son has severe autism, opposes the proposed change for a different reason. He says the public perception of autism is skewed by success stories _ the high-functioning brainiac kids who thrive despite their disability. Doherty says people don't want to think about children like his son, Conor, who will never be able to function on his own. The revision would only skew the perception further, leading doctors and researchers to focus more on mild forms, he said. It's not clear whether the change would affect autistic kids' access to special services. But Kelli Gibson of Battle Creek, Mich., whose four sons have different forms of autism, thinks it would. She says the revision could make services now designated just for kids with an autism diagnosis available to less severely affected kids _ including those with Asperger's and a variation called pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified. Also, Gibson said, she'd no longer have to use four different terms to describe her boys. Hallelujah! Let's just put them all in the same category and be done with it, Gibson said. ___ On the Net: Proposed changes: http://www.DSM5.org Reaction: http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/02/10/a-single-diagnostic-category-for-autism/ (Copyright 2010 The Associated Press.

The Definition Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASM's) officially belong to a group of illnesses known as 'developmental disabilities'. They are characterized by problems with social and communication skills of varying degrees. Autistic people also commonly display unusual ways of learning, reacting to different sensations and paying attention. Sufferers also tend to repeat certain behaviors and have difficulties when required to change their usual daily activities. ASD's are commonly said to start in childhood and last for the persons whole life ,but as you will see below, there are many new theories as to the cause(s) of these disorders and many offer the hope of effective treatments. The following definition of Autism is taken from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM IV), which is used to diagnose Autism: DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR 299.00 AUTISTIC DISORDER A. A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3) (1) qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: a) marked impairments in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body posture, and gestures to regulate social interaction b) failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level c) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people, (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest to other people) d) lack of social or emotional reciprocity ( note: in the description, it gives the following as examples: not actively participating in simple social play or games, preferring solitary activities, or involving others in activities only as tools or mechanical aids ) (2) qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: a) delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) b) in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others c) stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language d) lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level (3) restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests and activities, as manifested by at least two of the following: a) encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus b) apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals c) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) d) persistent preoccupation with parts of objects B. Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction (2) language as used in social communication (3) symbolic or imaginative play C. The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (Rett's Disorder and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder belong to a group of illnesses called 'pervasive developmental disorders', as do Autism Spectrum Disorders) \"000000\"; //--> Conditions Included in Autistic Spectrum Disorders Autistic Spectrum Disorders include autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger's syndrome. The definition quoted above is specifically for autistic disorder but both PPD-NOS and Asperger's disorder have some of the same symptoms, but they differ in terms of when the symptoms start, how fast they appear, how severe they are, and their exact nature. Diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorders Early detection of autism is considered essential for the effective use of many behavioural therapies. Various screening techniques have been developed utilizing questionnaies, interviews, and clinical observation. A combination of these methods is usually used. A number of different questionnaies have been created to help doctors and researchers diagnose autism in children. The CHAT (Checklist for Autism in Toddlers) is considered to be a HIGHLY accurate and simple autism screening tool for early autism diagnosis. Research supporting the CHAT has been published in the British Journal of Psychiatry. Studies have found that the CHAT is 85% accurate in diagnosing children with autism and 100% accurate in diagnosing a developmental delay in general. The CHAT can be used for children 18 months old or older. Recently a modified CHAT (M-CHAT) has been developed to increase accuracy even further. M-CHAT Autism Questionnaire Possible Causes of Autism At present, no definitive cause has been identified for autism. Both genetic and environmental factors are being studied as possible causative factors. Studies carried out throughout the developed world have found that around 6 in every 1000 children have at least one ASD. A US government report published in January 2003 stated that incidence had increased ten fold in only 10 years. There is also evidence that this number is still increasing and that cases appear in clusters, both of which tend to lend weight to the theory that ASD's involve a significant environmental factor. On the other hand , with regards to increasing numbers of cases, it may just be that doctors are more aware of these illnesses and are better able to diagnose them but this wouldn't seem to account for such a large increase. It should be stressed that it is known that ASD's are not caused by parental actions. Below are the leading theories for the cause(s) of Autistic Spectrum Disorders: Genetic One of the strongest indicators of the role that genetics plays in Autism Spectrum Disorders comes from research involving identical twins conducted at the MRC Child Psychiatry Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry in London (1). The researchers found that if one identical twin had a autism then there was a 60% chance that the other would develop the condition. This was in contrast to non-identical twins where there was no increase at all in the chance of the second twin developing autism. Even when the criteria were expanded to include the other ASD's a similar correlation was observed. This study suggests that ASD's have a definite genetic factor as being the identical twin of an autistic person markedly increases your chances of also having the disorder. However, it also suggest to us that ASD's may also involve significant environmental factors due to the fact that not every identical twin of an autistic child also develops the condition. Research is now being conducted all over the world to determine specific genes that increase the likelihood of someone developing autism. A group known as the International Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium, which includes clinicians and researchers from the USA, UK, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, and Greece, has pinpointed four chromosomes which they believe play critical roles in autism. The chromosomes they identified are numbers 2, 7, 16 and 17. The evidence for involvement of chromosomes 2 and 7 is particularly strong as these had also been previously identified by other independent researchers (2,3,4,5). Chromosome 7 is known to be associated with many language disorders and chromosome 2 plays an important role in early brain development. These findings are further demonstrated by research showing dyslexia patients also have abnormalities on these chromosomes (6). This is not surprising as dyslexia also produces deficits in learning ability and information processing in the brain. These findings are based on a study involving 150 autistic children. A further study involving up to 500 people is now underway that should provide an even better picture of genetic involvement in ASDs. In February 2008, the US government conceded that vaccines had caused an autism-inducing reaction in one little girl, Hannah Poling. At the time most experts stated that her underlying condition, a mitochondrial disorder, was very rare and so the case had no implications for other children with autism. The United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation (UMDF) however has said that mitochondrial disorders are at the core of many well known diseases and chronic illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and autism spectrum disorders. Subsequently the Foundation published research demonstrating that at least one in 200 healthy humans harbors a pathogenic mitochondrial mutation that potentially causes disease. The study was published in the American Journal of Human Genetics (21). Vaccinations Aside from vaccines now being implicated in triggering mitochondrial dysfunction and possibly autism as a result, it has been proposed that the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) may be a causative factor in autism. This has been a subject of hot debate however. The study that brought this to the attention of the public was conducted in the UK in 1998 (Wakefield et al)(7). See the full research abstract here. The researchers reviewed reports of children with bowel disorders and regressive developmental disorders, mostly autism. The researchers suggested that the MMR vaccination may have been one possible environmental trigger that led to intestinal abnormalities, resulting in impaired intestinal function and developmental regression. This hypothesis was based on 12 children. In nine of the cases, the child's parents and/or pediatrician felt that the MMR vaccine had contributed to the behavioral problems of the children in the study. Since this study was published many other researchers have questioned its validity. It should be noted that this criticism only refers to a link between MMR and autism. The research by Dr. Wakefield demonstrated a valid link between autism and gastrointestinal disease with findings of chronic intestinal inflammation in 11 of the 12 children and reactive ileal lymphoid hyperplasia in 7. Haemoglobin and serum IgA (an antibody produced by the immune system) were found to be low in 4 of 12 children. Finally, methylmalonic acid was found to be consistently high, this is a strong indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency. None of these other findings have been disputed and offer indicate a need for further study in these areas. One valid criticism of the MMR connection is that it was a very small study, having only 12 subjects. However this doesn't negate the findings entirely, it just means that larger studies should be conducted in this area. Another major criticism is that in at least 4 of the 12 cases, behavioral symptoms preceded the onset of the bowel disorder and thus the line of cause and effect between MMR vaccination and autism, is broken. From an environmental illness perspective the criticism itself seems simplistic. Research into gut ecology and its role in illness is increasingly showing the link between disturbed gut microflora and symptoms distant from the gastrointestinal tract. Examples of this are multiple studies providing evidence for the role of Klebsiella pneumoniae in ankylosing spondylitis and Proteus sp in rheumatoid arthritis. Given this, it is entirely plausible that behavioral symptoms could precede overt bowel symptoms in autistic children even though the root cause is a bowel disturbance. Accordingly this possibility should not be dismissed out of hand. Bowel problems are are common finding in all environmental illnesses as any sufferer will reveal. Studies looking for changes in gut microflora using stool, urine and blood testing have also confirmed a high rate of abnormality in environmental illness patients (see Eaton et al). It is also widely accepted that these illnesses have a prominent immune dysfunction component. Studies have also shown that patients with compromised immune systems have a high incidence of abnormal gut microflora. Given that the MMR vaccine subjects the immune system to three different antigens at once it is a possibility that the child's immune system, while dealing with these becomes more susceptible to pathogenic changes in the bacterial composition of the intestines or causes other detrimental immunological or neurological changes not yet identified. Indeed, an increasing number of medical professionals are voicing concern about the immunological changes caused by vaccinations, especially regarding multiple vaccinations over a short period of time, which is what the MMR vaccine effectively is. One recent report (Nov, 2004) that lends weight to this feeling is the UK's independent study into Gulf War Syndrome which found it to be an organic disease and pointed to multiple vaccinations given to troops, amongst other factors, as a possible trigger for the illness. Similar conclusions were also drawn by two US studies in 2004. Although the media coverage of the MMR debate has died down, the debate is sure to rage behind closed doors for a long time to come as parents continue to see their child's health deteriorate following vaccinations. Another possible cause of symptoms stemming from vaccinations is the inclusion of mercury preservatives in vaccines. Mercury in vaccines is discussed in the 'heavy metals' section below. Yeast/Candida Following on from the previous paragraphs above about gut microflora disturbances, we'll now look at the possible role of yeast, specifically Candida, in ASD's. Dr. Shaw of The Great Plains Laboratory and formerly of the Centers for Disease Control has found that people suffering from ASD's (and other environmental illnesses) consistently have elevated levels of certain organic acids in their urine. He first noticed this in two autistic brothers who also had occasional muscle weakness and published his findings in the Journal Clinical Chemistry in 1995 (8). Dr. Shaw was originally looking for metabolites characteristic of congenital errors of metabolism that are associated with muscle weakness. All of these metabolites showed normal levels, however, other more unusual substances were consistently elevated. One in particular, tartaric acid, stuck out. One autistic child had tartaric acid levels 600 times higher than the normal value. Dr. Shaw also found that when he looked at the medical records of his other autistic patients, they too had this abnormality. Dr. Shaw noted that this substance is primarily produced by yeast. The next logical step was to try a course of an anti-fungal agent to see if this improved symptoms. Dr. Shaw administered Nystatin, a common anti-fungal drug, to a 2 year old boy who was being evaluated for autism. The boy had developed normally up until 18 months of age but had then been given repeated courses of antibiotics (repeatedly shown to increase intestinal yeast levels) for an ear infection and had subsequently developed behavioral problems. After only a few days of Nystatin treatment the boys eye contact returned to normal and his tartaric acid level markedly decreased. It took 60 days for the tartaric acid level to return to normal however. Tartaric acid accounts for the muscle problems because it is a known muscle toxin. It is also similar to malic acid which is an important part of the Krebs Cycle which in humans accounts for most of the energy production from food. An important note with regards to tartaric acid being a muscle toxin is that high levels are also found in fibromyalgia patients. Other complementary findings come from Dr. Sidhir Gupta, a clinical immunologist in California. Dr. Gupta has found that a large percentage of autistic children have significant immune dysfunction and this may include a genetic weakness that impairs the body's ability to kill yeast as well as deficiencies of IgG and IgA. IgA antibodies are responsible for killing pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract. Dr. Shaw believes that most of the tartaric acid is produced by yeast in the GI tract as Nystatin, which isn't absorbed into the body, has been successful in returning tartaric acid levels to normal. Other substances that Dr. Shaw finds to be raised in autistic children, and attributes to intestinal yeast, are citramalic acid and 3-oxoglutaric acid. The debate over the role of intestinal yeast overgrowth in chronic illness has been going on for decades. The confusion is mainly due to the lack of a definitive marker that can be used reliably to detect the presence of increased growth of yeast in the intestines. This situation has hampered research efforts and understanding for a long time now. Recent research has strongly suggested that D-arabinitol may be a candidate for this definitive marker (9, 10). D-arabinitol is a 'sugar alcohol' produced by yeast when they feed on a sugar called arabinose. Circumstantial evidence that also points in favour of a role for yeast in ASD's is the fact that the increase in these illnesses has paralleled the increase in the use of antibiotics which tend to wipe out beneficial bacteria in the gut allowing yeast such as Candida to proliferate (11). It can only be hoped that agreement over a definitive laboratory test for intestinal yeast overgrowth will lead to research looking at the role it may play in chronic, poorly understood illnesses, such as autism. Heavy Metal Toxicity Another finding in autistic children is a higher level of heavy metals than normal. One source of mercury exposure in early life is through vaccinations. Thimerosal is a preservative used in many vaccinations to prevent contamination. Thimerosal is 49.6% mercury by weight. Shockingly in 1999 the American Food and Drug Administration released a report stating that children who received thimerosal containing vaccinations at multiple visits may be exposed to more mercury than is recommended by federal guidelines. In fact, children may have been receiving 100 times the 0.1 micrograms per kilogram of daily exposure considered safe by most authorities worldwide. This report has, however, resulted in positive action being taken. Following the publication of the report, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended that thimerosal be removed from all vaccines given to children. Whether this move has reduced new cases of autism is still open for debate however. A study of 2 US government databases in March 2006 showed that in the 4 years following the recommended removal of thimerosal from childrens vaccines, exposure of children to this toxin was reduced to almost zero, and most importantly, new cases of autism actually began to decrease. On the other hand California public health officials examined state records for the period 1995-2007 and found that cases of autism continued to rise in the 6 years after thimerosal was removed from children's vaccines in 2001. Mercury is a known neurotoxin and could be especially harmful to the developing brains of young children. A study conducted in 2005 by Burbacher et al and published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives found that ethylmercury (the form found in thimerosal in vaccines) had a higher affinity for the brain than other forms i.e. much of the mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines ends up in children's brains (20). Mercury also disrupts biochemistry and can result in dysfunction of multiple enzyme systems and damage to cell membranes and many proteins involved in all bodily functions. As can be said for the MMR vaccine, increases in vaccinations correlate well with increases in incidence of ASD's. In a paper published in the journal Neurotoxicology by The Coalition for Safe Minds in 2001, the authors seek to determine the levels of mercury that could be expected upon hair analysis, based upon the amounts of mercury in vaccines routinely given to infants and children.(12). The paper predicts, based upon a proven model, that giving children all the usual vaccinations, using thimerosal containing vaccines would result in a hair concentration of greater than 1ppm (parts per million) of mercury for up to 365 days with various peaks during that period. 1ppm is the safe limit set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Research at the UCLA Medical Center in California has also shown that Thimerosal (when bound to human albumin protein) triggers an immune system reaction in autistic children, resulting in the production of antibodies (17). This indicates a possible autoimmune reaction as the immune system could react against any of the child's own tissues that happen to have Thimerosal bound to them. Obviously children are exposed to mercury from other sources as well so their actual mercury levels could be expected to be even higher than this. The paper notes that: exposure to low levels of mercury during critical stages of development has been associated with neurological disorders in children, including ADD, learning difficulties, and speech delays, the predicted hair Hg (mercury) concentration resulting from childhood immunizations is cause for concern. A paper published in March 2006 in Environmental Health Perspectives would seem to shed more light on the mechanisms by which thimerosal can damage a childs health. Researchers at University of California, Davis, have found that in mice at least, thimerosal can disrupt the immune system. This large, well funded study for the university's MIND Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is sure to be an important indicator of where future research should be focused. The researchers in this study looked at dendritic cells which can be described as messengers within the immune system. These cells take up invaders such as bacteria, viruses and other antigens such as vaccine ingredients and process them. They then migrate to the lymph nodes to present their information to other immune cells, which can activate a systemic immune response. The research shows that these dendritic cells, especially the normal biochemical signals they process, are highly sensitive to thimerosal. With low concentrations of thimerosal, an inflammatory response occurs and with higher concentrations the cell is actually killed. These reactions could lead to any number of unwanted, and uncontrolled, effects within the immune system. Autistic children often show signs of immunological dysfunction with allergies, gut disorders and frequent infections being common. The effects of thimerosal on the immune system, that this study demonstrates, provides one possible explanation of why this is the case. Of course, mercury is not the only heavy metal that can cause health problems and vaccinations are not the only source of exposure to mercury. Other possible sources of heavy metal exposure are contaminated food and water supplies. Fish is particularly associated with contamination as oceanic pollution becomes more concentrated as it moves up the food chain to predatory fish.. Chemical Exposure A number of researchers and institutions are now studying the possible role of exposure to chemicals in ASD's. A major study is underway at The UC Davis M.I.N.D. Institute, Schools of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, and the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Professor Isaac Pessah who is involved with this study states: Environmental exposure to mercury, pesticides and other contaminants during early childhood development could easily alter the normal function of a child's systems . The UC Davis Institute will conduct research using a large sample of 2000 autistic children and will look at possible chemicals and levels of these chemicals that the children were exposed to during early childhood to see if there is a correlation. The researchers are working on the assumption that there is a genetic susceptibility to autism in a proportion of children but there may be an environmental factor that has to be present during their early years that pushes their nervous system over the edge into autism . They study will also assess blood levels of environmental toxins in autistic subjects compared to healthy subjects and will aim to find out the impact of exposures on the brain's ability to send signals and on cell growth in the nervous system, as well as identify the underlying biochemical process. This is a large well funded study that should provide valuable evidence of any correlation between chemical exposures and ASD's. There is similar work going on in other locations around the world. There have already been a significant number of studies published that have tried to determine the role that environmental chemicals play in the development of autism spectrum disorders. Dr's Edelson and Cantor of the Environmental and Preventive Health Center of Atlanta in the US suggest that chronic exposure to toxic agents, i.e., xenobiotic agents, to a developing central nervous system may be the best model for defining the physiological and behavioral data found in these populations (children with ASD's) . In their own study of 18 autistic children the doctors carried out a range of tests to measure levels of toxic chemicals in the children's bodies and how well their livers were able to detoxify them. It was found that all of the children had liver detoxification profiles outside the normal range, indicating an increased toxic load on the liver. The results showed that 16 of the 18 children had levels of chemicals exceeding the maximum safe limit for adults. In the 2 children where high levels of chemicals weren't detected directly, they were found to have raised D-glucaric acid in their urine which is an indicator of a high level of toxins being metabolized by the liver. The paper goes on to discuss how these findings of toxicity could cause immune system disruption and lead to the behavioral symptoms associated with autism (13). In a report published 2004, 'toxic contaminants' are linked to increases in the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and associated neurodevelopment al and behavioral problems in developed countries. The author also suggests that exposure of the foetus to chemicals while still in the womb could lead to development of these disorders. Particular note is made of the high sensitivity of the unborn foetus to thyroid disturbance and the many chemicals in common use that could interfere with the thyroid function of mothers (14). Low Glutathione and Oxidative Stress Glutathione is one of the bodies most important antioxidants, especially in cells important to the process of detoxification and elimination of environmental toxins, primarily in the liver. Researchers at the biochemical genetics laboratory at Arkansas Children's Hospital Research Institute have found that about 80% of children with autism have reduced levels of glutathione and its precursor nutrients such as the amino acids, cysteine and methionine (18). Reduced levels of glutathione would increase the level of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when antioxidants aren't able to clear the body of free radicals (highly reactive chemicals), which can damage cells in the brain, gastrointestinal tract and immune system. Professor Jill James, who headed the research states: [Our findings] suggest that these kids would be more sensitive to an environmental exposure and would be less likely to detox from heavy metals, This is a very interesting fact when placed in the context of children developing autism after being given vaccinations containing mercury compounds. This is by no means the only study indicating that those with autism have decreased antioxidants and resulting increased oxidative stress. In a recent Turkish study of 27 autistic children and 30 healthy controls, findings such as increased Nitric Oxide (NO) in the autistic children were also indicative of increased oxidative stress (19). Gluten and Casein I'm sure everyone is familiar with the opiate drugs such as opium, morphine and heroin. It would be reasonable to ask what these very powerful and potentially damaging drugs have got to do with autism and children's health. All will be revealed shortly. As you are probably aware, gluten is a protein found in grains such as wheat, rye, oats and barley. Casein is a milk protein found in the milk of all the animals whose milk humans in the western world regularly consume, cows milk, sheep's milk and goats milk. As we've already talked about, autistic people often have gut problems including frequent gut dysbiosis. As a result, digestion is impaired resulting in the incomplete digestion of gluten and casein. What is disturbing is that when not properly digested, gluten and casein can end up as peptides (protein building blocks) with a chemical structure that resembles that of the opiates. There is a significant, and growing, amount of published research showing that gluteomorphin and casomorphin (the offending peptides) have been detected in the urine of autistic children (15, 16). These peptides can pass easily through the blood-brain barrier and interfere with the functioning of neurotransmitters such as Sheraton and dopamine, just as the opiate drugs do. As a result the patient suffers a range of neurological and psychological symptoms. Investigators at the UCLA Medical Center in California have also shown that both gluten and casein peptides trigger an immune response in children with autism, resulting in the production of antibodies to these substances (17). As a result of these findings, the gluten and casein free diet (GFCF) has been developed. By avoiding both gluten and casein, both children and adults with autism can be helped a lot. Learn more about the GFCF diet Parental Age Research has consistently made a connection between the increasing age of fathers and the incidence of autism. A major study published in 2008 which used data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 'Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network' found that the age of both mothers and fathers was linked to the risk of a child developing autism. The research published in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that older parents, both mothers and fathers, are more likely to have a child with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study results suggest that mothers aged 35 or older have a 30% greater chance of having an autistic child compared to mothers aged 25 to 29, while fathers older than 40 had a 40% higher risk than those aged 25 to 29. In addition, the study noted that firstborn children were the most likely to be affected by ASDs; firstborn offspring of 2 older parents being 3 times more likely to develop autism than third or later-born offspring of mothers aged 20\u201334 and fathers aged less than 4022.

I joined the forum tonight after finding my Website mentioned in one of the posts. I am a BIG proponent of the gluten-free, casein free diet for epilepsy and have been studying the benefits of this diet in neurological conditions (e.g. epilepsy, autism, ALS, MS, fibromyalgia, and others) for over 7 years now, I became an Internet medical literature researcher following my own phenomenal recovery once I discovered that I had celiac disease (gluten intolerance) and subsequently discovered my concurrent dairy and soy intolerance. I quickly went from a sickly 45 year old on 5 different prescriptions to a bullet-proof 53 year old who has not taken a prescription drug in over 7 years. Within a month of being gluten-free I was a totally different person. Gone were my pain, depression/chronic fatigue, food addictions, insomnia, gastrointestinal distress and much more. It was amazing to say the least and got my full attention as a patient and as a health professional. I began applying all that I had learned about gluten intolerance to my canine patients and watched as miracles happened. The mist amazing was the control of seizures. I read that celiac children who also suffered from epilepsy often had dramatic improvements in their seizure frequency and severity once on gluten-free diets. This grabbed my attention and I plunged into how and why this could be. I created my Website to chronicle both my findings and the testimonials of those who had utilized the diet. (I used to really dislike writing but that changed in a hurry.) I quickly found that there were other foods that played similar roles in neurodegenerative diseases and as I eliminated these, the success rates skyrocketed. Suddenly, I was writing about the \"big 4\" or \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" as I lovingly call them when I want to be melodramatic. These are gluten grains (wheat, barley, rye), dairy, soy and corn. These are the primary foods that are capable of inducing villous atrophy (damage to the villi of the intestinal tract, primarily those of the duodenum and jejunum) resulting in the malabsorption of the nutrients that are CRITICAL to the health of the brain, liver, immune system and every other tissue. The duodenum is responsible for the absorption of the vast majority of our calcium, iron, iodine, B complex, C. and trace minerals (e.g. zinc, magnesium, boron, lithium, manganese and others.) Wow! Imagine an individual that is deficient in these vital nutrients and you have a celiac, casein intolerant, soy or corn intolerant or a combination thereof. That is why celiacs have staggering rates of every illness that plagues mankind, including cancer, immune-mediated disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. How does this apply to autism (and epilepsy). Because, as the poster above states, things like thimersol are clearly contributing factors but not the sole cause of autism for the reason stated. If vaccines were THE cause, then all who received them would have autism. There has to be a distinguishing factor...or set of factors...that creates the autistic individual while at the same time determining the spectrum of affliction seen in autism. It is not a black and while condition, is it? Like so many other conditions, there is a spectrum of affliction, ranging from mild (the best of the worst) to severe (the worst of the worst). What determines this??? Well, as stated by many of the forum members, there are multiple factors at work. BUT, I am a form believer that the single biggest factor is diet. I have read...and now received...enough testimonials from mothers of autistic children who employed elimination diets like the GFCF diet or my G.A.R.D. and had miraculous results to say this with all certainty. If the diets were proper- non-harmful and fully nutritious- then the body could better handle the secondary insults/triggers thrown at it (e.g. thimersol, air pollution, fluoride, MSG, NutraSweet, carcinogens, and other known toxins). But what IS the distinguishing factor in autism (and epilepsy). Why does one child develop it and the other doesn't when they have been exposed to the same basic diet, environment and vaccines? I now agree with researchers who believe that VIRUSES are the true and ultimate cause and that everything else is causing/allowing/triggering the virus into causing the severe neurological signs seen in both autism and epilepsy. Everyone should do a search for \"autism, virus\" and read what researchers already know and what they suspect. Through the eyes of the viral model, +everything+ starts to make sense, including the role of thimersol, food lectins, environmental pollutants, fluoride and even the sedating effects of the casomorphins and gliadomorphins derived from casein (dairy) and gluten (gliadin) respectively. The testimonials of the mothers who utilize the GFCF and GARD diets also make perfect sense, as do the failures. The best of the worst will respond quickly and dramatically...miraculously.the worst of the worst respond more slowly. BUT, I have yet to have anyone who contacted me about their autistic of epileptic child nor report a measurable response. Most +are+ dramatic. Why? Because the foods that are restricted in the GARD (The Glutamate-Aspartate Restricted Diet/ Gut Absorption Recovery Diet) are doing soooooo much harm to those who are sensitized to the glycoproteins (lectins) as well as (casomorphins/gliadomorphins) and stimulants (glutamate, aspartate, and estrogens) they contain. These are the top 4 human, dog and cat food allergens for very good reason, with the allergies being created at the time they damage the intestinal villi. The allergies are screaming out at us to stop eating/feeding them...the acid reflux, chronic throat and ear infections, nasal congestion, IBS, asthma, eczemas, and other warning signs.How much clearer does it have to be? Well, there is one more common sign in the autistic and that is the food addiction that so many of them exhibit. How many autistic children are addicted to wheat and dairy products? Every time I talk to a mother of an afflicted child or see a news story about autism on TV, I hear about or observe them eating foods rich in dairy or wheat...the cereals, breads, pancakes/waffles, milk, pizza, mac and cheese, cookies, etc etc. Sound familiar. I have had numerous moms tell me how hard it is to get them to be in the same room with a vegetable or piece of fruit. They are addicted to the very thing (foods) that are making them sick, just like a drug addict or alcoholic. It is the nature of addiction. And this addiction speaks to the truth about the harm these foods are doing. There are +no+ healthy addictions. And we no know that this process can begin before birth. The prenatal effects of celiac disease, for example, are potentially catastrophic. Then comes the breast feeding. We also know that gluten, casein, et al pass right through mom's breast milk and can directly affect the nursing infant.If the child is an undiagnosed celiac or casein intolerant and mom is loading upon bread and cheese, then by the time that child is ready for vaccines, they can be immunologically incompetent and those vaccines can do severe harm, not only the thimersol but the modified live viruses themselves. We learned this the hard way in vet medicine with numerous cases of vaccine -induced disease. Once that child has (one of) the viruses that is likely to be the true culprit, then all they need is an unhealthy dose of immune incompetence and to be bombarded with lectins (dietary glycoproteins from the \"big 4\"), fluoride and other pollutants, and the casomorphins/gliadomorphins from dairy and wheat and their brain is severely dysfunctional. BUT...the good news??? Stop doing what we are doing and things can get better...and in a hurry. Believe the Success Stories on www.gfcfdiet.com. The failures are also explainable. Hopefully this post will point you in the right direction to help track down those failures and correct them. We MUST be strict. I will follow this post with what I call The Glaring Example. It is a post from another forum that puts everything in perspective. Lectins are powerful things. The worst of the worst can't tolerate the smallest quantity. Think \"peanut allergy\" and you will have the right perspective. I hope this helps, John John B.

The three rulings are the second step in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding begun in 2002 in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The proceeding combines the cases of 5,000 families with autistic children seeking compensation from the federal vaccine injury fund, which comes from a 75-cent tax on every dose of vaccine.Families of children hurt by vaccines for example, who suffer fatal allergic reactions are paid from it but are unable to sue the vaccine manufacturer. The fund has never accepted that vaccines cause autism; the omnibus proceeding, with nine test cases based on three different theories, was begun in 2002.The anti-vaccine groups also lost the first three cases, which were decided in February 2009 by the same three judges, known as special masters. All three rulings were upheld on their first appeals.Defenders of vaccines said they were pleased by Friday's decision, while opponents were dismissive, saying they would never get a fair ruling from the omnibus arrangement.In the three cases brought against the government, by the parents of Jordan King, Colin R. Dwyer and William Mead, all three special masters used strong language in dismissing the expert evidence from the families' lawyers.The master in the King ruling emphasized that it was \u201cnot a close case\u201d and \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that Jordan's autism was connected to his vaccines. The master in the Dwyer case wrote that many parents \u201crelied upon practitioners and researchers who peddled hope, not opinions grounded in science and medicine.\u201dPatricia Campbell-Smith, the master in the Mead case, also dismissed two subarguments made by a few opponents of vaccines, saying they \u201chave not shown either that certain children are genetically hypersusceptible to mercury or that certain children are predisposed to have difficulty excreting mercury.\u201dShe also echoed a contention by vaccine defenders that a shot is safer than a tuna sandwich. \u201cA normal fish-eating diet by pregnant mothers\u201d is more likely to deposit mercury in the brain than vaccines are, she wrote.In a telephone press conference after the rulings, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the inventor of a rotavirus vaccine from which he receives royalties, praised the decisions, saying: \u201cThis hypothesis has already had its day in scientific court, but in America we like to have our day in literal court. Fortunately, we now have these rulings.\u201dFears of thimerosal emerged more than a decade ago and have cast a pall over vaccines ever since, even though it has been removed from most of them. The fear has caused some parents to avoid them and made outbreaks of diseases like measles and whooping cough more likely.Even with this decision, Offit said, \u201cit's very hard to unscare people after you've scared them.\u201dThe Coalition for Vaccine Safety, a group of organizations that believe vaccines cause autism, dismissed the rulings.\u201cThe deck is stacked against families in vaccine court,\u201d said Rebecca Estepp, of the coalition's steering committee. \u201cGovernment attorneys defend a government program using government-funded science before government judges. Where's the justice in that?\u201d The coalition claims to represent 75,000 families.Amy Carson, founder of Moms Against Mercury, who has a son with brain damage, called the vaccine court arrangement \u201clike the mice overseeing the cheese.\u201dThe vaccine injury fund and the court overseeing it were created in 1988 after judgments in state court lawsuits over vaccines became so inconsistent and so expensive that vaccine companies started quitting the American market.The third theory, that measles vaccine causes autism, is still to be ruled on by the special masters. But Lisa Randall, a lawyer with the Immunization Action Coalition, which defends vaccines, said she believed some of the test cases had been \u201cabandoned\u201d by the families that brought them after the 2009 decisions dismissed a variant of the same theory.

Dwyer King Jordan Dwyer Patricia Campbell-Smith Mead Vaccine Education Center at Children Moms Against Mercury Lisa Randall Immunization Action Coalition VACCINE EDUCATION CENTER AT CHILDREN'S U.S. Court of Federal Claims Carson Read Stories Against Autism-Vaccine Link'; A special United States vaccine court dismissed three cases Friday that were attempting to establish a link between mercury-containing immunizations and autism, prompting outrage among parents convinced of the connection. Critics have accused the hearings of impropriety, citing the fact that the Department of Health and Human Services was a defendant in the case while producing and funding much of the evidence purporting to exonerate the vaccines at taxpayer expense. Mother Laura Bono, for example, one of the parents whose case was dismissed, called the process dysfunctional and said that the law only provides the illusion of having a day in court. Other parents were equally disappointed by the ruling. The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court, charged mother Rebecca Estepp of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges. Where's the justice in that? After the rulings, an attorney for the group also said it would seek congressional intervention and that several government experts had provided fraudulent testimony. Other organizations are also calling the proceedings into question. Find me another industry where the U.S. government defends their product in court and funds the science that exonerates them, said Generation Rescue founder J.B. Handley, also the father of an autistic child. The average citizen has no hope. Analysts said the decision dealt a severe blow to the more than 5,300 similar cases pending before the special court, part of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In 1986, the federal government created the courts and established a tax-funded National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to pay victims and protect drug companies from liability. In the court decisions, the judge-like Special Masters ruled that the science did not support the mercury-autism link. The Meads believe that [mercury-based preservative] thimerosal-containing vaccines caused William's regressive autism, wrote Special Master George Hastings, a former tax expert with the Department of Justice, in his ruling. The undersigned finds that the Meads have not presented a scientifically sound theory. The other two cases were thrown out using similar arguments. For years, countless parents of children with autism have blamed mercury in vaccines for the illness. Mercury is, after all, a known neurotoxin with devastating effects on the human body. But the movement was dealt another blow earlier this year when a respected medical journal retracted a prominent study claiming a link existed. However, the pro-mercury camp also came under fire recently. Dr. Poul Thorsen, a scientist working for the U.S. government who published one of the most important studies used to debunk the mercury-autism link, is now being investigated for embezzling millions of taxpayer dollars. The study in question has also attracted widespread criticism for its methodology. Despite the angered parents, however, some groups saw the court ruling as a positive step in putting the issue to rest. It's time to move forward and look for the real causes of autism, explained Autism Science Foundation President Alison Singer. There is not a bottomless pit of money with which to fund autism science. We have to use our scarce resources wisely. But the battle is still far from over, according to anti-mercury campaigners. Appeals to the vaccine court ruling are considered very likely. And last week, the Supreme Court agreed to review the law exempting vaccine makers from liability. The case against pharmaceutical giant Wyeth is expect to begin in the fall. After receiving the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, a six-month-old girl began suffering a series of complications including seizures. An appeals court in Pennsylvania ruled that the parents could not sue the drug maker because of the 1986 law creating the vaccine courts that specifically shielded manufacturers from liability. But a conflicting ruling in Georgia said some lawsuits could be brought under state law, so the Supreme Court is now expected to resolve the matter. The battle over whether mercury in vaccines is linked to the epidemic of autism will continue to rage for a long time to come. Polls suggest at least one in four parents still believe there is a connection. But regardless of what the truth regarding this issue is, federal laws purporting to exempt manufacturers from liability in the event of adverse reactions are not only unconstitutional, they are ridiculous. Why should tax payers assume the risk while drug companies rake in billions? The special courts and the law which created them should be dismantled so that evidence can be heard in a proper venue.

Reduction of autistic traits following dietary intervention and elimination of exposure to environmental substances. In Proceedings of 2003 International Symposium on Indoor Air Quality and Health Hazards, National Institute of Environmental Health Science, USA, and Architectural Institute of Japan, January 8-11, 2003, Tokyo, Japan, 2:206-216. Full Text Available Abstract: Effects of environmental exposure were isolated and studied in 49 autistic children. Elimination of food-related reactions entirely allowed effects of environmental chemicals to be thoroughly studied indefinitely in the absence of food-related symptoms. Initially unaffected by social contexts, the autistic subjects acted out the ways they were affected by their environment without the altering effects of societal influences; and severity of the adverse effects made observation and study easier. There was a strong correlation (P<.000) between environmental exposure levels and autistic symptoms and behaviors. There appeared to be nothing inherently wrong with autistic children studied. The children in the program (universal diet and clean room) returned to normal physically, in temperament, in awareness of surroundings and others, in emotions and empathy, and in ability to learn. Based on the results of the present study, a broad spectrum of severe and chronic autistic symptoms appear to be environmentally based, apparently caused by chronic exposure to volatile organic compounds, and appear to be fully reversible in the proper environment. ***** The Effect Of Environmental Chemical Exposures On Autistic Children (Word File) Karen M.

Slimak Autism One Conference Loyola University Scientific Studies Amalgam Websites Discussing Vaccines Autism Other Studies Parent Ratings of Behavioral Effects of Biomedical Interventions Report hear from parents with one or more children with autism that they believe or think that somehow their children contracted or developed autism as a result of some vaccinations as a baby or child. This is indeed a controversial question. The issue whether vaccines can cause autism is a concondrum of much arguement, pitting science against faith, doctors against parents, and parents against one another. As a researcher who is out to find the truth, I would like to share with you the research items and publications with the relevant references so that you, as a parent, can study the research and information presented therein, and to form an opinion or make a decision yourself. As there are numerous citations, it is important for you to read all these reports to have a good understanding before you form your own opinion. In a video below, you can watch Julie Gerberding, the head of the CDC, went on CNN s House Call with Dr. Sanjay Gupta to discuss the Hannah Poling case. Here is another video where Rober Kennedy talks about about vaccines and autism, and presents his view on this question - does vaccines cause autism. I will first present a brief extract of the publication or research report and then provide the reference link so that you can read the entire research or report as they were presented originally at their respective websites. Here are the relevant references: Health headlines often broadcast that one study or another has proven that vaccines do not cause autism. Look a little deeper, and what those studies have actually done is failed to prove that they do. Others claim to have indeed proven a connection, but their results are not embraced by the scientific community. Disagreements rage over the way studies are set up, and who funds them. Link to full report Any rite of passage that involves jabbing needles into small children is bound to worry more than a few parents. But that doesn t begin to explain why so many moms and dads are convinced despite mounting scientific evidence to the contrary that the triple vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) causes autism in some youngsters. The latest study exonerating the MMR vaccine comes from Denmark, where investigators looked at the health records of every child born from 1991 through 98, more than 537,000 children. No matter how researchers analyzed the data, there was no difference in the autism rates of children who received the MMR vaccine and those who did not. The Danish findings, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week, are persuasive for several reasons. Denmark s socialized medical system has generated one of the most complete health records of any country. So the investigators were able to document accurately both sides of the equation: those who were (or were not) vaccinated and those who developed autism. Even when other factors, such as age at vaccination, were taken into account, there was no difference in autism rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated children. There was no clustering of autism diagnoses in the weeks and months after vaccination. There was no difference in the number of diagnoses of other developmental disorders related to autism in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Link to Full report British researchers caused a furor in 1998 when they published a controversial report suggesting a link between the growing number of autism cases and the standard childhood vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Although other physicians criticized the authors for jumping to conclusions, many worried parents stopped immunizing their children. Now 10 of the 13 original authors have decided to retract the paper, acknowledging that their data were not strong enough to support their incendiary conclusion. Link to full report Nearly all of the leading health organizations including the CDC and the NIH say that there is no relationship between vaccines and autism. Yet many parents and smaller research groups are convinced there is more to the story, and the doubts about the safety of vaccines linger in the minds of many parents. How did this controversy get started and why is it still such a concern? Now, on to the concerns themselves. To begin with, it s important to note that there are not one but two vaccine controversies, and both are hot topics right now. Link to full report Issue number one relates to thimerosal. This is a mercury-based preservative which was used in many vaccines between the late 1980s to 2003. The type of mercury used in thimerosal is generally cleared from the body within six weeks, which in theory would render it harmless. But according to those researchers who believe that the preservative causes autism, babies born during that 20-year window were injected with many times the safe level as determined by the FDA and some, they feel, were genetically incapable of clearing the doses of mercury from their bodies. Mercury is, in fact, a neurotoxin, and the theory is that the recent leap in autism diagnoses can be directly tied to thimerosal. At present, the thimerosal controversy continues with evidence on both sides mounting up. The positive side, for new parents, is that thimerosal has now been removed from most vaccines and thimerosal-free vaccines are available across the board. The down side, of course, is that no one can say with absolute certainty that today s autistic youngsters were NOT harmed by thimerosal-laced vaccines. Link to full report Some scientists have tried to link an apparent rise in the incidence of autism to an increasing number of childhood vaccines that used to contain thimerosal. Thimerosal is an organic mercury compound (ethylmercury) that for a time was used as a preservative in vaccines against diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, and hepatitis B. In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released a statement indicating that some infants who received multiple injections of vaccines containing thimerosal might have gotten enough ethylmercury to exceed recommended guidelines. Shortly thereafter, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Public Health Service jointly recommended reducing or eliminating thimerosal in all vaccines. Link to full report While expounding the other day on the lost antiseptic mercurochrome (See The Straight Dope: What happened to Mercurochrome?), I mentioned that vaccines once contained an antibacterial and antifungal agent called thimerosal. Keeping vaccines safe is a good thing - nobody wants a repeat of the 1928 Australian case where a dozen kids died from staph-infected diphtheria vaccine drawn from a multidose vial. Unfortunately thimerosal, like mercurochrome, has the drawback of containing mercury, a toxin known to cause neurological disorders. Children are especially vulnerable. In 1999 the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Public Health Service determined that standard childhood vaccinations could lead to a dangerous accumulation of mercury. They called for thimerosal s elimination from vaccines, and within a few years it was mostly gone. Thimerosal hasn t totally disappeared. It continues to show up in some contact lens solutions, and as of last fall was still being used in certain vaccines for diseases including tetanus, meningitis, and flu - often ones used in multidose applications, where contamination presumably remains a concern. But according to the FDA, apart from the occasional flu shot, no vaccine routinely recommended for U.S. kids now contains more than a trace amount of the stuff.

A tribunal of three special masters in the Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., is conducting the no-fault proceeding where the petitioners need to prove causation by a preponderance of the evidence\ufffdbut not scientific certainty\ufffdto win damages. Hokkanen views the litigation before the so-called \ufffdVaccine Court\ufffd as a kind of \ufffdcourt of last resort\ufffd for parents of autistic children. Should the petitioners prevail, they will be eligible for compensation for pain and suffering, past and future medical expenses and loss of earning capacity. Link to full report The prevalence of autism has risen dramatically in the past two decades. Prevalence is an estimate of the number of affected persons at a point in time. The last issue of the NECC Research Newsletter discussed the first comprehensive prevalence studies conducted in the United States. These studies show that the prevalence of ASDs in 2003-2004 is somewhere between 1 in 139 and 1 in 181 children between the ages of 4 and 17. This implies that there are around 300,000 children diagnosed with an ASD. Most scientists feel the rise in prevalence is due to a combination of changes in the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and increased awareness of the disorder (e.g., Wing and Potter, 2002). However, some have suggested that the increased prevalence of ASDs corresponds with an increase in the number of vaccinations recommended for children. Correlation of two events is not sufficient evidence to assert that one caused the other as the two events could be unrelated. For example, if a child is born during a full moon, the birth and the full moon coincide but the full moon did not cause the birth and the birth did not cause the full moon. Therefore, further study of such correlations is necessary to reveal evidence to either support or disconfirm a causal hypothesis. One specific hypothesis of vaccines being linked to autism suggests that thimerosal, a preservative previously used in childhood vaccines that was removed from vaccines manufactured in the US in 1999, can cause autism. Thimerosal is still present in some versions of the flu vaccine. Several versions of this theory target different mechanisms for how thimerosal damages the child and causes autism. They all, however, state that some damage occurs to the developing child after vaccination. Advocates of the thimerosal causes ASDs hypothesis have also suggested that the prevalence of ASDs will substantially decrease subsequent to thimerosal being removed from childhood vaccines. Link to full report Perhaps parents biggest concern about vaccines is whether they can cause autism. So let s be clear. Despite what you may have read online or heard on television talk shows, there s no credible evidence linking the two. The main study that hinted at a connection involved just 12 children. And since its publication, most of the study authors have reversed their decisions, and the lead author is being disciplined for professional misconduct. Meanwhile, more than 20 other studies involving thousands of children have consistently demonstrated that neither vaccines nor the preservative thimerosal (a type of mercury that is no longer used, except in some flu shots) causes autism. So if that s the case, why did the Polings, of Athens, Georgia, who claimed that a five-shot vaccine series triggered their daughter Hannah s autism, win a payout from the federal government s Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)? Doesn t that prove a connection? No, and this is why: the VICP maintains a list of vaccine-related injuries that are automatically compensated, with basically no questions asked. In the Poling case, Hannah s rare enzyme deficiency caused her brain dysfunction. And it got worse when she developed a fever after her measles shot, so her family qualified for compensation. Link to full report The debate over a link between childhood vaccinations and autism has reached fever pitch, as evidenced in a major court ruling March 2008. The federal government conceded that standard vaccination practices contributed to the development of autism in nine-year-old Hannah Poling. While failing to admit to a clear-cut link, the government has nevertheless offered the Poling family compensation, citing that a pre-existing mitochondrial disorder that predisposed the toddler to autism was significantly aggravated by the immunization shots she received at nineteen months. Dr. Isaac Eliaz offers his thoughts on this unprecedented ruling, noting that vaccines in general\ufffdand especially those containing thimerosal, a mercury-derived preservative\ufffdare not completely safe. Not only do they expose infants and toddlers to toxic loads of mercury, but when administered concurrently, they are also potentially dangerous\ufffdand often unnecessary, as in the case of the Hepatitis B vaccination. These risk factors amount to what should rightly be considered a true health crisis for our children. Link to full report With record rates of immunizations in the U.S., the vaccines themselves are now under scrutiny by a small but vocal segment of the population. Concerned that the vaccines may pose greater risks than the diseases against which they protect, some parents are refusing them. So, in addition to developing new vaccines \ufffd Johns Hopkins researchers like Hopkins Children s pediatrician Neal Halsey are employing Johns Hopkins rigidly scientific approach to studying vaccines and any adverse effects. Halsey is director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which coordinated the scientific review of concerns, raised about a possible link between childhood diabetes and vaccines and found no evidence to support the hypothesis. When there was public concern in the late 1990s, however, that a preservative, thimerosal, that was used in some vaccines, could result in exposures that exceeded EPA guidelines for exposure to a related form of mercury, Halsey led a review for the Academy of Pediatrics in 1999 that recommended, as a precaution, thimerosol levels be reduced or removed from vaccines given to infants, and it was. Subsequent studies have not shown consistent evidence of harmful effects other than rare allergic reactions. Link to full report Your health is one of those things you don t think about too much unless something s wrong. People who are sick think about their health a lot. People who have sick loved ones think about health a lot, too. And for the past several years, some people whose loved ones have autism have thought about vaccines a lot. Vaccines aren t exactly a modern invention. After realizing that people who survived smallpox never got it again, people started inoculating themselves around 200 B.C., hoping that a little bit of exposure in the present would save them from a devastating illness in the future [source: National Museum of American History]. Unfortunately, primitive methods, which used a live virus from infected material, could result in the patient getting a full-blown case of the disease. Link to full report It is some people\ufffds hands, I can undo it, so very intelligent people that change maybe a trigger to some kids who have autism. I can not see it, you can not see it but I do not see a great study that should be done. The study should be done, videotaped. Santa Clause in kids of four months, nine months, one year, eighteen months have revealed. You give the kid the vaccine. You said key chains, show me the kid in four months and make our track. Show me the kid in health, smiling, socialite. Show me that. I mean I review a couple of this and we did make an icon and last month when I look at the kid that is what I saw. Believe me it could be a re-essence that we could do something. We understand that without these vaccines, it will distribute terrible welfare for that which can not find any justification with to say that seems quite autism. There is absolutely no indication that vaccines cause autism, more than that, they are now very well done prospective studies which they had shown that there are absolutely no link between autism and the immunization of our children. The studies have been published over the last two or three years. They were done both here and in Europe. They are done in a blinded fashion so that it compares children who were not vaccinated and children who were vaccinated and in a very definitive fashion. It was shown effects since did not increase the risks of those children having any neurologic out. Link to full report The debate over the safety and efficacy of vaccines is not new. While vaccines seem to be very effective in eradicating many terrible diseases, they are closely tied to the development of other serious health and developmental problems, including autism. It would appear that by using vaccines we have not improved the overall health of our children, but simply traded infectious disease for chronic disease. Vaccines contain many suspect ingredients known to cause serious health problems. At the top of that list is mercury, an extremely toxic substance. Mercury makes its way into vaccines through a preservative called thimerosal. Thimerosal is not a necessary ingredient in vaccines. It is used as a preservative so that vaccines can be packaged in multi-dose bottles and used on multiple children without becoming contaminated with bacteria. Single-use packaging eliminates the need for the toxic preservative. Link to full report My son was normal until he received his vaccines. His first shots were 2/10/92. By 4/19/02 there were signs he was not developing correctly. By next set of shots, he forgot how to vocalize, and eventually crawl or sit up. Pedicatrician noted his conditioning was worsening with each and every shot. How can doctors say there is no correlation between shots and autism? Comments anyone? Yes, I do think that vaccines cause autism. I just watched the segment on autism and I am appaled that the doctors would say that the thimerasol is out of the vaccines.. there is only one company that makes vaccines thimerasol free. and there is no one requiring doctors to use that vaccine. and the ones that say they are free of mercury\ufffdthey are not, they put it in they try to take it out, you cannot completely get the mercury out. Please get the right information. I have an autistic child that when we cleansed him of his vaccines and the mercury, he started making eye contact and the meltdowns lessened. Please get that information out. Link to full posts Do vaccines cause autism? It is a truism that nothing can ever be disproven (in fact, one of the most solid philosophical proofs is that neither science nor any other extant method of human discovery can prove any empirical claims either). My purpose here is not to debunk the vaccine myth. Others have done it better than I can. My purpose is to point out that, even if the myth were true, not vaccinating your children would be a poor solution. Link to full post On June 4, 2008, actress Jenny McCarthy, mother of a 6-year-old son with autism and spokesperson for the organization Talk About Curing Autism, led a Green Our Vaccines march and rally in Washington, D.C., with her boyfriend, actor-comedian Jim Carrey. McCarthy and many of the 8,500 people joining her were gathering to call for safer vaccines demanding, for instance, legislation to eliminate toxins, such as mercury and aluminum, from kids shots (mercury is part of the vaccine preservative thimerosal; aluminum makes vaccines more effective by stimulating the body s immune response) and requesting that Congress take a closer look at the mandatory immunization schedule. McCarthy is among those who believe that vaccines have played a role in the autism epidemic. Her new book, Mother Warriors, tells the stories of parents whose children have recovered from autism, and she has served as a voice for many mothers and fathers who are concerned about vaccines. If there is a connection between vaccines and autism, top health experts, including those from the CDC and the independent nonprofit Institute of Medicine, say they haven t found it. Their stance is based on at least 10 large-scale scientific studies. Parents need to know that the world s brightest scientists have concluded that there is no association between vaccines and autism, says CDC director Julie Gerberding, M.D. Link to full report A hypothesis linking childhood vaccines with autism has been the subject of an intense debate for almost a decade. On one side are the parents and families of autistic children, many of whom are convinced that the link between autism and vaccines is real. On the other side are researchers who have conducted numerous medical studies, some involving thousands of children, that have found no evidence that autism is linked to vaccines. As the debate rages on, parents of autistic children are accused of looking for someone to blame, and possibly to sue. Other people believe that the medical community and pharmaceutical companies know there s a connection between autism and vaccines and are conspiring to keep this information from the public. Link to full report I believe there is a link to autism being caused by certain vaccines, mainly the MMR vaccine. But they all are dangerous. The MMR vaccine is almost the only vaccine that people seem to have a problem with. Scientist s say they continue to do research, but I honestly believe that they may already have the answer, and are just keeping it from the Public. If it turned out that vaccines were linked to autism, many people would be suing these companies. My two year old brother, cannot speak. He does not have autism, but merely autism spectrum disorders (ASD). When he was one year old, he said his first word, Cocoa. He ran around all week, saying cocoa over and over again. Then he went to get his MMR shot. The next day, he didn t say cocoa anymore. And he has never said it since. autism spectrum disorder is a mild form of autism. I believe Vaccines link to autism, and that they need to change, if not stop, the way they are being given or created. Andrew Wakefield, the researcher who controlled the well-known study that claimed a link between autism and vaccinations had falsified the results to show that vaccinations caused autism. In fact, several of his subjects showed signs of autism before the vaccinations. The medical records of the children were obtained recently, and those show very different results from the ones that Andrew Wakefield claimed. He is defending himself against charges of professional misconduct for his ethical conduct regarding the study. In addition to falsifying the results, he also had accepted funding prior to begining the study to prove that the MMR vaccine was harmful, so it was a conflict of interest when he did this study.

Others argue that the injections also contained a form of mercury that overexcited certain brain cells. To settle this discrepancy, the Office of Special Masters of the claims court has instructed plaintiffs to carry out three tests for each of the theories. Thimerosal has been removed from standard children\ufffds vaccines, but remains in flu vaccines that are packaged as multiple doses. Unfortunately, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention says single dose flu vaccines are available only in limited numbers for the time being. Until more are produced for and distributed to the children in need of them, the threat of adverse thimerosal side effects remains. Link to full report Usually I make it a point not to write about the possible causes of autism, for a number of reasons. First, it\ufffds such an inflammatory topic, and my goal is to share what we\ufffdve learned with a community of parents, not to speculate or fan the flames on issues about which I have no direct evidence. Of course I follow the studies, and I have my opinions, but I\ufffdm not sure that sharing them in such a public venue is really of use to anyone, especially my son. Second, I have to be honest: we are very, very lucky. Isaac is on the mild to moderate end of the spectrum, and he doesn\ufffdt have any serious medical issues like intestinal disorders or seizures. So for us, the challenges tend to be more social than medical, and it\ufffds sometimes very difficult to know what\ufffds an expression of his personality versus any real pathology.

What I thought was interesting was Joe giving Mika B a look nod that seemed to say don t start anything I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall afterward to hear what those two had to say off camera afterward. Link to full report There is no research that proves autism spectrum disorder is caused by vaccinating children. There have always been theories, but no scientific proof. No studies show that the delay or omission of vaccines affect autism. ASD is diagnosed at a time when children are receiving vaccines. Parents of autistic children are often looking for what caused autism, and relate it to vaccines because they are happening at the same time. Much media attention is given to adverse effects of vaccines and little attention is given to success stories of vaccines, such as no one gets measles anymore. Link to full report Due to the comments I have recieved I must not have made it clear that I do 100% believe in getting your child vaccinated. My confusion is when is the best time to do it. Whilst waiting in line at Target today I was flipping through a magazine when I came across an article about Jenny McCarthy and how she helped her son beat autism. It was a very interesting article about the things she did (such as drastically changing his diet) to help him overcome his autism. And it got me to thinking do vaccines really cause autism, or do they not? The whole thing is very confusing to me, and I often don t know what to believe. I have done a lot of reading on the subject and what I have found is that almost all mothers ( I have read about) with autistic children have said that yes, after their child recieved their vaccination is when the signs of autism began to show. But most doctors (including my pediatrican) say that no, there has been no link found between vaccines and autism. I have also read that although vaccines dont cause autism, they can make it manifest itself in children that are genetically susceptible. I am no scientist, but just by looking at the numbers it is very convincing that vaccines do have something to do with it, being that 15 yrs ago it was like 1 in 10000 children will be diagnosed with autism, and now its around 1 in 150.

The result unfolds as this book. For the past eight years Kirby interviewed dozens of parents to find out how their children had developed autism. He pored over medical journals, clinical studies and government documents. The families he met and the things he learned shook him.

The change occurred soon after the children were given the first dose of the MMR vaccine (to prevent against measles, mumps and rubella), typically at around 12-15 months. These parents adamantly believe that their children\ufffds autism was caused by something in the MMR vaccine or in combination with other vaccines containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal. They insist that the timing of the onset of autistic symptoms is not a coincidence. Link to full report For many years a debate has raged on about whether there is a link between autism, the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine, and thimerosal, the mercury-derived preservative that was long used to keep vaccines from spoiling.

We hadn\ufffdt, until around the time Eli was getting the bulk of his vaccines. Autism rates in developed nations have been rising sharply over the past few decades, and no good cause has been found.

While the paper didn\ufffdt outright claim a causal link among the three, Dr. Wakefield did. In a press conference, he called for the combined MMR vaccine to be withdrawn. This was highly publicized in the UK, and led to a drop in MMR vaccinations. Since then 10 of the 12 co-authors have published a retraction, and the London Sunday Times has revealed that Dr. Wakefield had been paid in part by lawyers working on lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers. Link to full report Two particular vaccine-autism connections have been proposed within the past 15 years. At the outset, both were biologically plausible to any of us in medicine and biology. One suggested an association with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, and the other questioned whether thimerosal, a mercury-containing antibacterial compound used in some vaccines to prevent bacterial contamination, might be related to autism. Over the past decade, these hypotheses have been rigorously tested in numerous studies. Every methodologically sound study demonstrates no connection. Two of the most intuitive arguments follow. The MMR vaccine is given after 12 months of age. In a study by Scientific Institute at the University of Pisa, home videos of children younger than 2 who were later diagnosed with autism were compared with videos of developmentally typical children at the same ages. Behaviors were scored by observers who were blinded to the subsequent development of the children. Differences were clearly present, even at 6 months of age - before the MMR vaccine could have been given. Link to full report One of the main concerns of parents regarding vaccination of their infants is that vaccines are safe. A frequent \ufffdscare\ufffd about vaccines is whether they cause disorders of the brain or nervous system. The most common scare mentioned by the news media and anti-vaccination groups is that vaccines cause pervasive developmental delay in children, more commonly called autism. Numerous large research studies have shown that this is not the case. However, it is easy to see how this misunderstanding arose. There is considerable evidence that genes have a strong influence on the development of autism. The best evidence comes from studies of autism in twins. Investigators have shown that when one identical twin has autism, there is at least a 90 percent chance that the other twin (who has exactly the same genes) also will have autism. However, a fraternal twin, who does not share the same genes with the other twin, but who presumably shares other potential risk factors for autism both before and after birth, has only a 10 percent chance of developing autism if the other twin is affected. Link to full report To respond to these concerns about vaccine safety, the National Network for Immunization Information (NNii) writing team of Martin G. Myers, MD, and Diego Pineda have written a book titled, Do Vaccines Cause That?! A Guide for Evaluating Vaccine Safety Concerns. This 272-page book is divided in two sections. The first section tells readers how best to weigh and evaluate what they read or hear about vaccine safety, emphasizing how scientists determine whether a vaccine actually causes a specific effect. The second section deals specifically with vaccine safety concerns such as asthma, autism, and autoimmune diseases, among others. The overall theme is to help readers arrive at conclusions based on science.

Link to full report about this movie Concerns that vaccines may cause autism have been worrying parents since some research first introduced the theory in the late 1990s even amid mounting evidence that continues to prove otherwise. In light of more new studies disputing the autism-vaccines link, here are some relieving answers to your most pressing questions. In the late 1990s, some researchers started raising concerns over the amount of thimerosal a mercury-containing preservative found in many children s vaccines. Although thimerosal had been used as an anti-contamination agent for decades, until 1991 the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP) vaccination was the only thimerosal-containing shot recommended for infants and children. The hypothesis: As more thimerosal-containing vaccines like hepatitis B and Hib were added to the recommended schedule, researchers worried that babies were receiving too much of the chemical in too short a timeframe, which could potentially impact brain development. Link to full report Almost 70% of parents who refuse to vaccinate their children do so because they believe vaccines may cause harm. Indeed vaccines have been blamed for causing asthma, autism, diabetes, and many other conditions most of which have causes that are incompletely understood. Some parents believe that vaccines can \ufffdoverwhelm the immune system. To respond to these concerns about vaccine safety, the National Network for Immunization Information (NNii) writing team of Martin G. Myers, MD, and Diego Pineda have written a book titled, Do Vaccines Cause That?! A Guide for Evaluating Vaccine Safety Concerns. Link to full report In terms of vaccines causing autism, the big issue is with the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine was the only vaccine ever uttered in the same sentence as autism. This all came about from one article in 1998 by this guy, Dr. Wakefield, who is from England. He did a study on a dozen children, and he basically said that in these children it was possible that the autism was caused by the MMR vaccine. After that study, it took off in the media. Around the world vaccine rates for the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine decreased. There were rises in measles cases and measles-related deaths afterwards, despite hundreds of studies since then showing no absolute cause and effect between the MMR vaccine and autism. What s very interesting about this one study that really gained all the popularity with this debate between MMR and autism, is that several years ago it was actually retracted as solely a hypothesis and not true. 10 of Dr. Wakefield s investigators said it did not show that MMR caused autism. This would make a great Law and Order episode, but what happened was that Dr. Wakefield was funded by a law firm that was representing children and families suing vaccine companies for adverse effects, and he was receiving money from this company, which is obviously a conflict of interest. Thus, there has been, to date, no medical evidence showing a cause and effect relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. The hard thing is we just don t know what causes autism. Why the MMR vaccine also came up is there was a timal relationship. Autism is usually diagnosed at around 15 to 18 months of age, and we give the MMR vaccine at a year. However, even though there was a timal relationship, there s never been any proof of a cause and effect relationship. We feel not only MMR, but all vaccines, are safe. Link to full report At one time, there was a debate that Thiomersal (a mercury-based additive used as a preserative) was linked to childhood autism. However, almost all doctors and scientists studing this issue, as well as all major health agencies (CDC, World Health Organization, etc.) have found no link between vaccines and autism. In fact, many are concerned that this misconception will result in children going unvaccinated and causing an rise in preventable diseases (like measles). So where did this rumor come from? For autism to be diagnosed, the symptoms have to start?around three years of age. If childhood vaccines are given frequently during this time, it is not unlikely that a significant number of people will notice an association between a vaccine panel and the first onset of the symptoms of autism simply by chance.

Myers, MD, and Diego Pineda have written a book titled, Do Vaccines Cause That?! A Guide for Evaluating Vaccine Safety Concerns. Link to full report In 1998, the hepatitis B vaccine was initiated in a new program to vaccine newborns. This ill-conceived plan is often pointed to by researchers as a possible cause in the occurrence of autism. There are other researchers that point to the MMR vaccine as a cause of autism. It is possible, however, that both of these may be causes of autism for different reasons. Today, there really are no reasons for giving a child the hepatitis B vaccine, and this is backed up by many vaccine experts. Experts state that a newborns immune is undeveloped, and the immune system is unable to respond to vaccines. With this understanding it is obvious that vaccines, which are designed for the stimulation of the immune system, find nothing to stimulate. In short, if a new Morton s immune system lacks response than a vaccination, which means to generate a response is useless; however, it is believed that there is a connection between vaccines and autism. Link to full report Mercuric compounds are nephrotoxic and neurotoxic at high doses. Thimerosal, a preservative used widely in vaccine formulations, contains ethylmercury. Thus it has been suggested that childhood vaccination with thimerosal-containing vaccine could be causally related to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.

March 15, 2010 ? The Autism Consortium, an innovative research, clinical and family collaboration dedicated to catalyzing research and enhancing clinical care for families with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), announced today that the results of its comparison study of genetic testing methods for autism spectrum disorders is available from the journal Pediatrics through early online release in their eFirst pages today and will appear in the journal's April issue. The study revealed that chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) had the highest detection rate among clinically available genetic tests for patients with autism spectrum disorders and should be part of the initial diagnostic evaluation of all patients with ASDs unless a genetic diagnosis has already been made. The study, a collaboration between the Autism Consortium and Children's Hospital Boston, led by Consortium members Bai-Lin Wu, David Miller, Kira Dies, and Yiping Shen, examined 933 families (children and parents) who received clinical genetic testing for a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) between January 2006 and December 2008. The researchers compared the findings from three clinical genetic tests: G-banded karyotype and fragile X testing, the current standard battery of genetic testing, and chromosomal microarray analysis, for which testing guidelines have not yet been established. Chromosomal microarray analysis is similar to a karyotype, but can find much smaller chromosomal deletions and duplications. The results showed that chromosomal microarray analysis identified more genetic abnormalities associated with autism than the standard testing methods combined: Standard testing method G-banded karyotype testing yielded abnormal results in 19/852 patients (2.23%) Standard testing method Fragile X testing results were abnormal in 4/861 patients (0.46%) In contrast, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) identified deletions or duplications in 154/848 (18.2%) patients and 59/848 (7.0%) were clearly abnormal. As a result, chromosomal microarray was better than a karyotype for all but a small number of patients with balanced rearrangements, and those were not necessarily a cause of ASD. \"This is the largest study of clinical genetic testing for patients with autism spectrum disorders, and the results clearly show that chromosomal microarray analysis detects genetic abnormalities leading to ASD more often than a standard karyotype and fragile X testing,\" said David Miller, MD, PhD, assistant director of the DNA Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's. \"Chromosomal microarray was much better than a karyotype, but most clinical guidelines still recommend a karyotype and consider the microarray a second tier test.\" Because of the dramatic increase in variations identified using CMA, the Autism Consortium recommends that CMA should be included in the first tier of diagnostic testing for children with ASD symptoms who have no clear genetic cause. Genetic Testing Helps Families with Expectations, Securing Services \"This study demonstrates the importance of genetic testing for families and clinicians,\" says Laurie Demmer, MD, Chief, Division of Genetics and Metabolism at the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center. \"As we collect more data we will be able to determine the genetic causes of autism. More immediately though, these test results allow clinicians to confirm a genetic component for some families with children on the autism spectrum and even more importantly, gives families an end to the odyssey of trying to find a diagnosis for their child.\" There are many benefits for families to receive genetic testing: Genetic test results can confirm a genetic component to a child's ASD and allow families to more quickly access services. Using the test results clinicians can employ the experiences of other children who have the same condition. For example, providers are able to alert families to potential medical concerns that may have occurred in children with the same or similar diagnoses. Using new information for preventive surveillance, medical concerns can be addressed before symptoms even appear. Finally, parents might be given a window into what to expect in their child's future. Working together, clinicians and researchers are sharing knowledge about what they are seeing as young children with ASDs pass through the developmental stages. They can pass this along to parents of similar children so that time can be used to prepare and address challenges, and advocate for a child's anticipated needs. Genetic testing that identifies a specific cause for a patient's ASD diagnosis facilitates much more accurate genetic counseling about the chances that future children born to parents of a child with ASD would inherit the same genetic risk factor for ASD. Findings Expand Knowledge Base for Autism Researchers One of the Autism Consortium's most important objectives is spreading the word that in order to understand the causes of autism and develop new treatments, it is vitally important that families enroll in research. \"The Autism Consortium is extremely grateful to all of the families who have participated in our research studies,\" said Deirdre Phillips, Executive Director. \"We know that families are so busy dealing with their own day-to-day challenges and yet their participation adds to the pool of data and information needed to understand the causes of autism and to find effective treatments and therapies. The Autism Consortium encourages families to become vested partners in the research process, participating in studies whenever they can to provide the broadest possible foundation for new discoveries that will lead to new treatments.\" Autism genes have been difficult to identify because the disorder is complex, with a variety of causes stemming from many possible genes or combinations of genes. In addition, since people with autism tend not to have children, most of the genes identified thus far aren't inherited from a parent, but instead are mutated during embryonic development, making them hard to track through traditional genetic studies in families. Clinical genetic testing is adding to the body of knowledge that researchers are using to understand the genetics of autism. About the Genetic Testing Methods Evaluated Current genetic testing recommendations include fragile X testing and G-banded karyotyping to look for chromosomal abnormalities as first tier tests, which reveal changes in up to 3-5% of patients who do not have an obvious genetic condition such as Down syndrome. Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA), also called array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), is a molecular method for detecting genomic copy number changes, or deletions and duplications. Whole genome CMA detects clinically significant copy number changes in at least 10% of patients with a variety of developmental problems such as developmental delay, mental retardation, and multiple congenital anomalies. Research studies for patients with ASD suggest a similar detection rate of about 10% using CMA, but the diagnostic yield in large clinical cohorts had not been well investigated prior to this study. This study presents data on clinical genetic testing of a large cohort of ASD patients by G-banded karyotyping, fragile X testing, and CMA. ### About the Autism Consortium: The Autism Consortium is a scientific and clinical collaboration that includes 14 institutions, supported by a non-profit that is dedicated to facilitating research and improving clinical care. The mission of the Autism Consortium is to catalyze rapid advances in understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of autism by engaging, supporting, and fostering collaboration among a community of clinicians, researchers, donors and families in order to improve the care of children and families affected by autism and other neurological disorders. The Consortium brings together the best minds from across the region from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Medical Center, Boston University, Boston University School of Medicine, Broad Institute, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts General Hospital, the Lurie Family Autism Center at MGH for Children/LADDERS , McLean Hospital, The Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, UMASS Medical School, Worcester, and UMASS Memorial Health Care.

The money raised will help fund further research into autism. \"What we do in our research area is look to improve early detection of autism and research for better and more effective ways to deliver quality intervention to more people at a lower cost,\" said Dr. Christopher Smith, Vice President/Research Director for SARRC. Smith said the money raised will help fund more technology-based interventions and treatments. \"We want to do more telemedecine, which helps deliver treatments and interventions to more people,\" he said. Sanderson Ford Lincoln Mercury and Volvo, one of the presenting sponsors of the event, presented a $10,000 check to SARRC. David Kimmerle, president of Sanderson Ford Lincoln Mercury and Volvo, said he and his family have been touched by everyone at SARRC. \"We're just trying to make it easier for the families of kids affected by autism affected by the condition because they need our help,\" he said. The Arizona Diamondbacks Foundation gave $100,000 to the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center Tuesday. Other large donors during the 14-hour radiothon included Jaburg & Wilk, Attorneys at Law, $20,000, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, $15,000, and Tiffany & Bosco Law Firm, $10,000. The D-backs Foundation gave one of its three $100,000 Grand Slam grants to SARRC's Good Deed Works Training Center. It is a program created to provide teens with autism spectrum disorders training, mentoring and volunteer experiences at community venues. \"Through SARRC's new D-backs Good Deed Works program, everyone wins,\" said SARRC founder Denise Resnik. \"Our teens with autism increase their skill sets and build self-esteem, leading to greater independence. \"Peer mentors gain increased understanding and compassion for those with autism. And this year alone, 20 Valley non-profits will benefit from thousands of volunteer service hours and gain appreciation for the talents and abilities of individuals with autism.\" Parents of children with autism told stories of their children's success during the radiothon. Stephanie Papadopoulos said one of her triplets, Eleni, has autism. She said Eleni got her first friend at the age of 8 years, because of help from SARRC. Eleni's friend's mom heard Stephanie's story on the air and called in to donate. She was one of many. In the first 10 hours of the radiothon, over $270,000 was raised. The effort continues until 7 o'clock tonight. KTAR program director Russ Hill said the 14-hour radiothon is meant to \"raise awareness and funds for SARRC. \" \"Giving back is extremely important to the people who work at KTAR,\" Hill said. \"Hundreds of thousands of Valley residents tune into KTAR every day and it's important that we give back to the community. We're a part of the community and it's our way of giving back.\" Ned Foster and Connie Weber, hosts of \"Arizona's Morning News,\" and sports anchor Paul Calvisi opened the radiothon with an appeal to listeners to dig deep, even though the economy is strained, to help out. Calvisi joked with listeners that they should \"skip the right turn at Starbucks\" once a week and donate $12 a month to SARRC. SARRC is a resource for parents who have children with autism. It also funds research into autism. Scott Celley with TriWest Healthcare Alliance was among those joining the fund-raising effort. He said SARRC's reputation is known far and wide, extending to the U.S. Defense Department. The burdens of parents with partners serving overseas can be lightened by programs like SARRC has, Celley said. He said the U.S. owes military families who need help with their kids and SARRC is part of that equation. Sergio Penaloza's son was diagnosed with autism at 2 years old. He said his son struggled with his colors and speech, but with the help of SARRC's Jump Start program, the now 10-year-old is markedly improved. \"He's starting to correct himself. He's communicating at a higher level.\" Penaloza said. He said SARRC \"absolutely\" has been a part of his son's improvement. Right after his son was diagnosed, Penaloza said SARRC provided a \"roadmap\" of what resources parents have to help children with autism. Penaloza is on the Board of Directors of SAARC and his employer, Cox Communications, donated $5,000. They also matched, dollar-for-dollar, some call-in donations from listeners.

Symptoms may include: Significant problems developing nonverbal communication skills, such as eye-to-eye gazing, facial expressions, and body posture. Failure to establish friendships with children the same age. Lack of interest in sharing enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people. Lack of empathy. People with autism may have difficulty understanding another person's feelings, such as pain or sorrow. Verbal and nonverbal communication. Symptoms may include: Delay in, or lack of, learning to talk. As many as 40% of people with autism never speak.1 Problems taking steps to start a conversation. Also, people with autism have difficulties continuing a conversation after it has begun. Stereotyped and repetitive use of language. People with autism often repeat over and over a phrase they have heard previously (echolalia). Difficulty understanding their listener's perspective. For example, a person with autism may not understand that someone is using humor. They may interpret the communication word for word and fail to catch the implied meaning. Limited interests in activities or play. Symptoms may include: An unusual focus on pieces. Younger children with autism often focus on parts of toys, such as the wheels on a car, rather than playing with the entire toy. Preoccupation with certain topics. For example, older children and adults may be fascinated by video games, trading cards, or license plates. A need for sameness and routines. For example, a child with autism may always need to eat bread before salad and insist on driving the same route every day to school. Stereotyped behaviors. These may include body rocking and hand flapping. Symptoms during childhood Symptoms of autism are usually noticed first by parents and other caregivers sometime during the child's first 3 years. Although autism is present at birth (congenital), signs of the disorder can be difficult to identify or diagnose during infancy. Parents often become concerned when their toddler does not like to be held; does not seem interested in playing certain games, such as peekaboo; and does not begin to talk. Sometimes, a child will start to talk at the same time as other children the same age, then lose his or her language skills. They also may be confused about their child's hearing abilities. It often seems that a child with autism does not hear, yet at other times, he or she may appear to hear a distant background noise, such as the whistle of a train. With early and intensive treatment, most children improve their ability to relate to others, communicate, and help themselves as they grow older. Contrary to popular myths about children with autism, very few are completely socially isolated or \"live in a world of their own.\" Symptoms during teen years During the teen years, the patterns of behavior often change. Many teens gain skills but still lag behind in their ability to relate to and understand others. Puberty and emerging sexuality may be more difficult for teens who have autism than for others this age. Teens are at an increased risk for developing problems related to depression, anxiety, and epilepsy. Symptoms in adulthood Some adults with autism are able to work and live on their own. The degree to which an adult with autism can lead an independent life is related to intelligence and ability to communicate. At least 33% are able to achieve at least partial independence.2 Some adults with autism need a lot of assistance, especially those with low intelligence who are unable to speak. Part- or full-time supervision can be provided by residential treatment programs. At the other end of the spectrum, adults with high-functioning autism are often successful in their professions and able to live independently, although they typically continue to have some difficulties relating to other people. These individuals usually have average to above-average intelligence. Other symptoms Many people with autism have symptoms similar to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). But these symptoms, especially problems with social relationships, are more severe for people with autism. For more information, see the topic Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. About 10% of people with autism have some form of savant skills\ufffdspecial limited gifts such as memorizing lists, calculating calendar dates, drawing, or musical ability.1 Many people with autism have unusual sensory perceptions. For example, they may describe a light touch as painful and deep pressure as providing a calming feeling. Others may not feel pain at all. Some people with autism have strong food likes and dislikes and unusual preoccupations. Sleep problems occur in about 40% to 70% of people with autism.3 Other conditions Autism is one of several types of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), also called autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is not unusual for autism to be confused with other PDDs, such as Asperger's disorder or syndrome, or to have overlapping symptoms. A similar condition is called pervasive developmental disorder-NOS (not otherwise specified). PDD-NOS occurs when children display similar behaviors but do not meet the criteria for autism. It is commonly called just PDD. In addition, other conditions with similar symptoms may also have similarities to or occur with autism. depression routines echolalia anxiety sleep ADHD Pilot Sibling Workshop with P.A.L.S\ufffdLearning Center \ufffdMarch 19, 2010 From Grades 5th-12th More Info on How to Register Walk with Grant a Gift April 17th, 2010 at Town Square Las Vegas to Support Families Affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder!

What is autism? ? What causes autism? ? How is autism treated? ? Is my autistic child entitled to any benefits? ? Can medications help? ? Are there any alternative therapies that work? ? What can I do to help?What is autism?Autism is a brain disorder that can severely limit a child's ability to communicate or interact with others. National statistics for how many children are affected by autism don't yet exist. However, the National Institute for Mental Health estimates that three to six hildren out of every 1,000 suffer from autism. The condition strikes boys more often than girls. About half of all autistic children show developmental problems shortly after birth; the rest seem perfectly normal at first but lose their language and social skills usually between the ages of 18 months and 3 years. In many cases, the first sign of trouble comes when an infant or toddler seems to tune out everyone around him. Often, autistic children cry if they're cuddled or even touched, a heartbreaking development for any parent. Although autism can take many forms, certain features stand out as hallmarks of the disorder.\u2022Language. Children with autism are slow to pick up words, and some never learn to talk at all. Those who do speak may have excellent pronunciation, but they often struggle with the rhythm, intonation, and meaning of speech. Many children with autism simply echo whatever they hear. (If you ask, \"Would you like some milk?\" the child might respond with, \"You would like some milk.\") Others have rich vocabularies, but they may spend most of their time talking obsessively about favorite subjects; they may also have trouble understanding humor or irony. \u2022Social interactions. Children with autism tend to live in a shell. As infants, they may ignore sounds, faces, and other things that usually captivate babies. As they grow older, autistic children rarely make eye contact and prefer to play by themselves. Far from being simply shy, children with autism often act totally indifferent to others. They may, however, be fascinated with moving objects, such as cars or fans, and become greatly attached to an inanimate thing, such as a stick or rubberband. \u2022Intelligence. About three out of four children with autism suffer from serious mental retardation. But the brain abnormalities that make children autistic can also endow a select few with extraordinary, although highly specific, talents -- an exceptional memory, say, or unusual ability in art, math, or music. Some can draw complex three-dimensional images while their peers are still scribbling; others can recall the weather from every day in their childhood. Even these gifted children, however, can struggle with basic tasks such as reading and writing. A child who has mastered Tchaikovsky may be baffled by Dr. Seuss. \u2022Dangerous behaviors. Self-inflicted injuries are by far the most frightening aspect of having a child with autism. Autistic children sometimes bite themselves repeatedly or violently bang their heads against a wall whenever they feel stress or anxiety. \u2022Daily living. Children with autism often become fixated on certain activities or objects. They may spend hours every day pacing the same piece of floor or rocking back and forth in the same chair. Others constantly flap their arms or flip their ears. Autistic children also demand precise order and structure to their lives. They may perform exacting, highly complicated rituals for daily tasks such as eating or going to bed. A misplaced piece of silverware, an unfolded blanket, or any other change in their routine can send them into a rage. What causes autism?Nobody knows for sure what causes the condition. According to the Mental Health America, several studies indicate that it may stem from a combination of factors, including exposure to a virus in the womb, an immune system disorder, and genetics. One thing is certain: It's not the result of bad parenting.How is autism treated?Some children with autism will go on to have a normal adulthood, but the great majority have lifelong symptoms. While autism has no cure, many children with the condition learn to speak, read, write, and interact with others through behavioral and educational therapy. Such programs can also help them to master basic skills, such as using a toilet and getting dressed. Doctors recommend sometimes as much as 40 hours a week of highly structured training sessions. Using this approach, a therapist may spend hours repeatedly asking your child to make eye contact, rewarding each success with a smile or applause. This technique is also used less intensively in natural, everyday settings and can be especially effective when started early in a child's life. With proper training, you can turn a trip to the park into a quick lesson in social skills by praising your child for talking to and playing with other children.The success of any treatment program will depend on a variety of factors, but your child's intellectual level and amount of brain dysfunction will tend to dictate the best approach. For example, highly structured behavioral programs, which include methods for nonverbal communication, are most successful with children functioning at a lower-than-normal level. One of the most controversial issues is the use of corporal punishment and other aversive techniques to control autistic behaviors. Be aware that the majority of researchers deplore programs that use these methods. Whether the therapy is in-depth or more casual, experts agree that every child has his own talents and limitations. You'll need to keep informed about current research in the field and to work closely with your child's doctors to make sure he gets the help he needs. Is my autistic child entitled to any benefits?Yes. There are various laws in place to offer health and education services to families with a child who has autism or other developmental disabilities. These benefits include the following:\u2022Family training, counseling, and which agency takes the lead in coordinating these services, contact your local board of education and ask for a copy of the state's administrative code. If your child is diagnosed as autistic, you're eligible for early intervention services: education, counseling, and health services that are made available early in your child's life. To find the contact person for your state's early intervention program, get in touch with the National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities. You may also want to contact a local chapter of the Autism Society of America for further assistance.Don't assume, though, that your local school board will provide the best program for your child. These programs are often expensive and your school may not have sufficient trained staff. For these reasons, be prepared to act as your child's advocate by knowing the law, what resources are available in your area, and the latest research in the field.Can medications help?Although there's no medication specifically designed to treat autism, certain drugs may ease a few of your child's symptoms. Antidepressants such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine can make some children less aggressive, help them break out of repetitive behaviors, and cope with changes in their surroundings. However, these particular drugs are also part of a class of antidepressants that have been shown to increase suicidal tendencies in young people. As a result, the FDA requires these drugs to have a \u201cblack box\u201d warning, the most serious type of warning for a prescription drug. The drug risperidone may help children who have explosive outbursts control their rage. In extreme cases, tranquilizers may be needed to prevent self-inflicted injuries. Be sure to work with a doctor who has experience working with autistic children and will closely monitor your child's reaction to these medications. Be alert to side effects of some of the more potent medications.Are there any alternative therapies that work?Unfortunately, autism has spawned many false claims and just as many false hopes. Some experts offer facilitated communication, a process thought to let a nonverbal child express his thoughts by guiding another person's fingers on a keyboard. Many families have embraced the technique, but studies show that the words really come from the typist, not the child. Secretin, a hormone that controls digestion, is another alternative therapy that is not an effective treatment for autism. To protect yourself and your child, stick to treatments recommended by a qualified psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, or other specialist. You'll want to become an expert of sorts by keeping abreast of developments in research on autism and its treatment. This isn't as hard as it may sound: You'll learn an enormous amount by joining and becoming active in a local advocacy group and, if possible, by reading scientific journals that deal with autism.What can I do to help?Your child may act distant and aloof, but he definitely needs your love and attention. Help him by keeping his life as structured as possible, but also do what you can to slowly pull him out of his shell. If your child is pacing around a room, for instance, experts recommend joining him for a while and then leading him to a different room. Such small steps can result in a breakthrough. As one psychologist (and parent of an autistic child) put it, \"You need to enter their world to help guide them into yours.\"-- Chris Woolston, M.S., is a health and medical writer with a master's degree in biology.

Since I have been working on a Vermont system of care for individuals with ASD and advocating in Vermont and in Washington D.C. for more funding and support for families and individuals with ASD. Through my work I have seen the lack of supports for people with ASD and their families have, so I have created a business, Parenting Autism, to step in and help. Parenting Autism produces DVDs and workbooks to help parents parent on the spectrum.

Autism has no single cause. Researchers believe several genes, as well as environmental factors such as viruses or chemicals, contribute to the disorder. Studies of people with autism have found abnormalities in several regions of the brain, including the cerebellum, amygdala, hippocampus, septum, and mamillary bodies. Neurons in these regions appear smaller than normal and have stunted nerve fibers, which may interfere with nerve signaling. These abnormalities suggest that autism results from disruption of normal brain development early in fetal development. Other studies suggest that people with autism have abnormalities of serotonin or other signaling molecules in the brain. While these findings are intriguing, they are preliminary and require further study. The early belief that parental practices are responsible for autism has now been disproved. In a minority of cases, disorders such as fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, untreated phenylketonuria (PKU), and congenital rubella cause autistic behavior. Other disorders, including Tourette syndrome, learning disabilities, and attention deficit disorder, often occur with autism but do not cause it. For reasons that are still unclear, about 20 to 30 percent of people with autism also develop epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood. While people with schizophrenia may show some autistic-like behavior, their symptoms usually do not appear until the late teens or early adulthood. Most people with schizophrenia also have hallucinations and delusions, which are not found in autism. What role does genetics play? Recent studies strongly suggest that some people have a genetic predisposition to autism. Scientists estimate that, in families with one autistic child, the risk of having a second child with the disorder is approximately five percent, or one in 20, which is greater than the risk for the general population. Researchers are looking for clues about which genes contribute to this increased susceptibility. In some cases, parents and other relatives of an autistic person show mild social, communicative, or repetitive behaviors that allow them to function normally but appear linked to autism. Evidence also suggests that some affective, or emotional, disorders, such as manic depression, occur more frequently than average in families of people with autism. Do symptoms of autism change over time? Symptoms in many children with autism improve with intervention or as the children mature. Some people with autism eventually lead normal or near-normal lives. However, reports from parents of children with autism indicate that some children s language skills regress early in life, usually before age three. This regression often seems linked to epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity. Adolescence also worsens behavior problems in some children with autism, who may become depressed or increasingly unmanageable. Parents should be ready to adjust treatment for their child s changing needs. How can autism be treated? There is no cure for autism at present. Therapies, or interventions, are designed to remedy specific symptoms in each individual. The best-studied therapies include educational/behavioral and medical interventions. Although these interventions do not cure autism, they often bring about substantial improvement. Educational/behavioral interventions: These strategies emphasize highly structured and often intensive skill-oriented training that is tailored to the individual child. Therapists work with children to help them develop social and language skills. Because children learn most effectively and rapidly when very young, this type of therapy should begin as early as possible. Recent evidence suggests that early intervention has a good chance of favorably influencing brain development. Medication: Doctors may prescribe a variety of drugs to reduce self-injurious behavior or other troublesome symptoms of autism, as well as associated conditions such as epilepsy and attention disorders. Most of these drugs affect levels of serotonin or other signaling chemicals in the brain. Many other interventions are available, but few, if any, scientific studies support their use. These therapies remain controversial and may or may not reduce a specific person s symptoms. Parents should use caution before subscribing to any particular treatment. Counseling for the families of people with autism also may assist them in coping with the disorder. genetic brain genetic depression regression attention deficit disorder fragile x syndrome PKU Tourette www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/disorders/autism_fact_sheet.shtml Autism324 http://www.brainpop.com/health/diseasesinjuriesandconditions/autism/ Autism Living with autism can be really hard.

Although expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded that they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism. OAS_AD('ArticleFlex_1') \"Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration,\" special master George Hastings Jr. wrote. But, he added, Congress designed the victim-compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine, and that has not been done in this case. The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court. Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines. The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling covered one theory, and a second was dropped after that. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories. That doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available. The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had \"already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.\" But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them. \"It's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them,\" Offit said. On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. \"The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,\" Rebecca Estepp of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement. SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling. \"The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine-safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology,\" the group said. Advocacy group Autism Speaks said, \"The proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases.\" However, although research has found no overall connection between autism and vaccines, the group said it will back research to determine if some individuals might be at increased risk because of genetic or medical conditions. Meanwhile, in reaction to the concerns of parents, thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines in the United States. In Friday's action, the court ruled in three cases, each concluding that the preservative has no connection to autism. The trio of rulings can offer reassurance to parents who are scared about vaccinating their babies because of a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, are on the rise. The U.S. Court of Claims is different from many other courts: The families involved didn't have to prove the inoculations definitely caused the complex neurological disorder, just that they probably did. More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation through the government's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the rulings dealt with test cases to settle which if any claims had merit. Autism is best known for impairing a child's ability to communicate and interact. Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it's unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosis. Worry about a vaccine link first arose in 1998 when a British physician, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published a medical-journal article linking a particular type of autism and bowel disease to the measles vaccine. The study was later discredited. genetic genetic Autism Speaks United States Congress Andrew Wakefield Vaccine Injury Compensation Program U.S. Court of Federal Claims WASHINGTON George Hastings Jr. 10/03/13 Coalition for Vaccine Safety Philadelphia Paul Offit Rebecca Estepp SafeMinds British Offit www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2010/03/13/20100313autism0313.html Autism326 http://www.phxautism.org/ Welcome to the Autism Society of Greater Phoenix The Autism Society of Greater Phoenix is a group of people (mostly parents) who are dedicated to improving the quality of life of children and adults affected by autism by providing information, resources and support to the community, and especially to families affected by autism.

Autism327 http://www.thedenverchannel.com/health/22731483/detail.html New guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that all children be screened for autism at 18 months and 2 years old. A typical evaluation to diagnose autism can take two to four hours. But now a quick new screening test can help doctors determine if a toddler is at risk.Even before Ben Crowther's first birthday, his mom started worrying about autism.\"He wasn't imitating us. He wasn't pointing or clapping or playing any of those sort of interactive games, \" Katy Crowther said. IBSYS.ad.AdManager.registerPosition({ \"iframe\": pediatrician told her it was too early, Crowther pushed for autism testing at just 14 months. Early intervention has made all the difference.\"There's still a gap between Ben and his typical peers that you can see, but he has caught up tremendously,\" Crowther said.Rapid ABC is a new screening that uses simple activities to test for autism. Experts check to see how toddlers respond to activities like having their name called, looking at a book, being tickled and playing ball.The five-minute screening targets attention, reciprocity and communication in children ages 15 to 17 months. Once it's complete, a software program computes a score. If autism is suspected, the child will undergo further testing.\"There really isn't something quick and rapid like the ABC out there where pediatricians can interact for just three to five minutes,\" said Jenny Mathys, a social worker at the Emory Autism Center in Atlanta.\"It'll help parents and myself to feel comfortable that I'm doing everything I can to identify if there was an issue,\" said Jessica Sales, whose son, Cooper, was tested.The Rapid ABC test was developed by Emory University and Georgia Tech. Studies show it's accurate in identifying toddlers at risk for autism spectrum disorders who need further testing and intervention. Researchers said the goal now is to make the test part of regular pediatric checkups at 18 months and 24 months.AUTISM: Autism spectrum disorders are found in about one of every 110 children in the United States. ASDs are developmental disabilities that can cause significant communication, social and behavioral challenges. People who have an ASD usually handle information differently, and it affects each person in different ways, especially in regards to symptoms and severity. Autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder are types of ASDs. Autistic disorder, also coined \"classic autism,\" is characterized by language delays, social challenges and abnormal behaviors or interests. Asperger syndrome is considered a milder autistic disorder, without the language or intellectual disability. Pervasive developmental disorder includes people who only meet some of the criteria for autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome. Signs of ASDs typically begin before the age of 3. Many children experience symptoms such as obsessive interests, unusual reactions to the five senses, getting upset over minor changes, repeating of words, avoiding eye contact, not responding to their name by 12 months and not pointing at interesting objects. (Source: Centers For Disease Control)TRADITIONAL DIAGNOSIS: There is no blood test or easy diagnosis for ASDs. Instead, many doctors take notice to a child's behavior to make a diagnosis. In most cases, autism often appears by 18 months, and early diagnosis is key to a better chance for significant improvement for the child. There are two key steps to diagnosing ASDs: developmental screening and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. In most cases, an initial diagnosis takes two to four hours to complete. Many doctors believe children should be tested for developmental screenings at regular child checkups -- at 9 months, 18 months, 24 or 30 months -- and continued screening if the child is at high risk. If the doctor recognizes any delays in the way the child learns, speaks, moves or behaves, it is necessary to go to step 2. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation includes hearing/vision screenings, neurological testing, genetic testing and medical testing. (Source: Mayo Clinic)RAPID ABC: Rapid Attention Back and Forth Communication screener, or Rapid ABC, was developed by the Emory Autism Resource Center and Georgia Tech University. The Rapid ABC is designed to assess a child's risk for ASDs during a regular checkup in a pediatrician's office. The test takes three to five minutes and includes five activities. The activities test gesturing, attention level, body language and eye contact. All the results are then scanned and scored by a software program. This scanning system secures a continuity of care and keeps track of patient's history of behaviors to see regressions that can lead to early detection.

Admin. Code. If a student is found to have an impairment, the IEP team must also determine the need for special education services (PI 11.35). Autism Eligibility Checklist: Printable Only - Fillable - Spanish-Fillable Autism Evaluation Guide, Spring 2009 Programming A child who has been evaluated and found to meet the eligibility criteria and needs special education and related services has an individual education program (IEP) developed. The IEP is based on the individual needs of a particular student and the placement for the child is developed to implement the IEP in the least restrictive environment. Training Children with the impairment of autism frequently present unique challenges to teachers and support staff responsible for meeting the child's educational needs. Numerous statewide training opportunities are available throughout the year to assist in ongoing staff development designed to improve educational outcomes for children with autism. 2009-2010 Statewide Autism Training sponsored by Department of Public Instruction As in past school years, the Department of Public Instruction will offer two levels of statewide autism training for school personnel during the 2009-10 school year. Basic level training will provide an introduction to effective educational programming for students with autism. Advanced level training will focus on addressing challenging behavior exhibited by students with autism.

Genetic testing is crucial to identifying a cause for ASD in many children who do not have an easily recognizable genetic syndrome. Current guidelines exist for two types of genetic testing - G-banded karyotype and fragile X DNA testing. In the study, \"Clinical Genetic Testing for Patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders,\" published in the April issue of Pediatrics (released online March 15), researchers compared these two methods of genetic testing with a third method: chromosomal microarray (CMA). In a cohort of 933 patients with ASD, karyotype testing found 19 of 852 patients (2.2 percent) had abnormal genetic results, and fragile X testing was abnormal in 4 of 861 patients (0.4 percent). CMA identified abnormal results in 59 of 848 patients (7 percent), yielding the highest detection rate of the three tests. Study authors conclude that CMA testing should be a first-tier test in patients with ASD. Establishing a clear genetic diagnosis may lead to earlier services for children with autism, and thus improved outcomes.

Autism is a type of developmental disability characterized by problems with communication, social interaction and behavior. It is usually first seen in toddlers younger than age 3. Although the cause remains a mystery, some evidence suggests that autism may be genetic (inherited). Other evidence points to infection or perhaps the effects of an environmental toxin (poison). Some doctors believe autism may be the result of a specific brain injury or brain abnormality that occurred during development in the womb or in early infancy. Others have found evidence that the disorder is a result of abnormal levels of neurotransmitters (chemicals that send messages between cells in the brain and nerves), especially the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. Autism affects about 1 out of 1000 children, from all racial, ethnic, and social backgrounds. It is 3 to 4 times more prevalent in boys than in girls. Symptoms At birth, the autistic child often appears normal. The onset of symptoms may be noticed as early as the first year of life, but it may not be until the child is 2 or 3 years old that the parents realize something is wrong. Infants with autism may display abnormal responses to being touched. Instead of cuddling when they are picked up, they may stiffen or go limp. They also may not show normal developmental behaviors during the first year of life, such as smiling at the sound of their mother's voice, pointing out objects to catch someone's attention, reaching out to others with their hands or attempting one-syllable conversations. The child may not maintain eye contact, may appear unable to distinguish parents from strangers and typically shows little interest in others. Symptoms vary from mild to severe. Some typical behaviors associated with autism include: Disordered play An autistic toddler usually ignores other children and prefers to play alone. The child may spend hours repeatedly laying out objects in lines, sitting silently in an apparent trance-like state, concentrating on only one object or topic (and any attempt to divert the child can provoke an emotional outburst). Also, young children with autism are typically unable to engage in make-believe play. Disordered speech An autistic child may speak infrequently or remain totally silent. When the child does speak, the words may be an echo of what another person said. Speech patterns may be different. Instead of saying, \"I want a sandwich,\" the child may ask, \"Do you want a sandwich?\" Repetitive behaviors The autistic child may engage in repetitive behavior such as saying the same phrase over and over again or repeating a particular motion, such as clapping, finger-snapping, rocking, swaying and hand-flapping are also common. Abnormal behaviors Children with autism may develop obsessive routines. Some may also become hyperactive, aggressive, destructive or impulsive. Others may intentionally injure themselves. Unmistakable Signs of Autism in a Young Child Appears aloof; has difficulty interacting with others. Maintains little or no eye contact: resists cuddling or closeness. Cries, shows distress or throws frequent tantrums for no apparent reason Has difficulty expressing needs: has severe language deficits Uses gestures or points instead of using words. Does not respond to normal, interactive language cues Engages in echolalia - repreating words or phrases instead of using normal, responsive language Acts as if deaf, but tests normal in auditory checks Is unresponsive to normal teaching methods Is over-sensitive or undersensitive to pain; has no fear of danger Has an inappropriate attachment to objects Insists on sameness and order Exhibits obvious physical over-activity or inactivity Diagnosis The diagnosis is made based on your child's developmental history, observations of your child's behavior (alone and with others), and the results of tests that evaluate your child's language skills, motor coordination, hearing, and vision. In some cases, tests will be ordered to rule out other medical conditions that can sometimes look like autism. Expected Duration Autism is a life-long condition. Prevention Since the cause or causes of this disorder remain unknown, there is currently no way to prevent it. Treatment Currently, there is no cure for autistic disorders. However, a child's symptoms may improve after intense treatment involving: Education Educators will develop an individualized education program to address the child's specific educational problems. This typically includes speech and language therapy. Behavioral management Behavior modification strategies include positive reinforcement (rewarding \"good\" behavior) and \"time-outs.\" The goal is to enhance appropriate behavior and reduce inappropriate behaviors (such as self-inflicted injuries). Medications No single drug has been able to treat all symptoms of autism effectively. In some children, antipsychotic medications (such as thioridazine, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, haloperidol) may reduce some symptoms associated with autism, such as aggression, irritability and repetitive behavior, but these medications may also have side effects. Medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and clomipramine (Anafranil) may reduce repetitive actions and other anxiety-related behavior. Methylphenidate may be used to treat hyperactive or impulsive behavior. When To Call A Professional If your toddler does not try to communicate with others, as you would normally expect, repeats words or certain actions over and over, or does not seem to want to play with other children, contact your doctor. Also, call promptly if your child repeatedly tries to injure himself. Prognosis The difficult behaviors seen in autistic toddlers tend to improve between ages 6 and 10. However, problems may re-surface during the teen and young adult years, eventually calming down again in middle and later life. Some children with autism are able to live independently; others may struggle to maintain normal social interactions, communication and behaviors. Life expectancy depends on the presence of other conditions (such as epilepsy), as well as the overall general health of the autistic individual.

Researchers have identified structural differences in the brain of people with autism that may explain why they have problems communicating and socialising. The scientists used computerised imaging techniques to pinpoint differences in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Autism is a developmental disability that affects the way a person communicates and interacts with other people. People with autism cannot relate to others in a meaningful way. They also have trouble making sense of the world at large. As a result, their ability to develop friendships is impaired. They also have a limited capacity to understand other people's feelings. The scientists examined brain tissue from nine autistic patients and nine people who did not have the condition. They focused on structures within the brain known as cell minicolumns which play an important role in the way the brain takes in information and responds to it. The cell minicolumns of autistic patients were found to be significantly smaller, but there were many more of them. Researcher Dr Manuel Casanova said the increased amount of cell minicolumns in autistic people could mean that they are constantly in a state of overarousal. Their poor communication skills could be an attempt to diminish this arousal. Brainstem damage Previous research has suggested that autism is linked to damage to a part of the brain called the brainstem in the early stages of development. It is thought that this early injury might somehow interfere with the proper development or wiring of other brain regions resulting in the behavioural symptoms of autism. A spokesperson for the UK National Autistic Society said the new research was consistent with this theory. \"If the ability for complex communication is due to the subtle wiring of the millions of minicolumns found throughout the brain then any early impairments in development could explain the difficulties faced by people with autism spectrum disorders in the world. \"Potentially it might lead to an understanding of how to help these individuals although this is a long way off. Certainly the study reported is consistent with what is known about the difficulties people with autism spectrum disorders face in processing information.\" The frontal lobe of the brain is concerned with reasoning, planning, parts of speech and movement, emotions, and problem-solving. The temporal lobe is concerned with perception and recognition of sounds and memory. The new research was carried out by scientists at the Medical College of Georgia, the University of South Carolina, and the Downtown VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia. It is reported in Neurology, the scientific journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

A teacher calls on you in class and, even though you know the answer, you tremble with anxiety. For thousands of children suffering from Asperger's Syndrome, the social interaction of a typical day is like a terrifying visit to a foreign country where you don't speak the language or know the customs. The longer a child goes without treatment, the worse it gets. Kids can grow even more introverted, finding refuge in their own world because they can't understand what's going on outside. In Seattle, which along with the Bay Area has the highest reported cases of Asperger's, researcher Felice Orlich is working with Microsoft to help speed up the wait for those kids. \"The majority of kids who come (for treatment) just want to make friends and they don't know how,\" said Orlich, a clinical neuropsychologist with the University of Washington. \"They just don't get it.\" Microsoft Research and the Seattle university's Autism Center have developed a program called KidTalk that aims to teach much-needed social skills online. A pilot-test program begins in about a April, 2002. KidTalk looks much like a typical computer chat room, with lines of text from different participants running down one side of the screen and smiley-face icons representing the participants on the other. But instead of just letting the kids chat, the program presents them with a script for social interaction, such as a birthday party, and asks them to perform specific social tasks. Kids who participate well are rewarded with points and smiling faces. Those who don't chat or chat too much will see their oversized face icon move away from the group. A therapist moderates the session and can send messages to the participants privately, offering tips and rewards. Kids who suffer from Asperger's far more serious than social unease may not even be able to simply introduce themselves, let alone follow the subtle social context of a typical party. Isolated and frustrated, many kids also suffer from depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder and can grow angry, even violent, at even the most minor change in routine. While some get one-on-one therapy, many parents say group therapy is particularly helpful because kids learn to interact with kids their own age. Parents and researchers think online therapy might be more comfortable to Asperger's sufferers, who find solace in the familiar, rules-based structure of computer interaction. Many also feel much less anxiety when they can organize their thoughts and type them, rather than speak. The whole thing about Asperger's is that they need to understand more about the nonverbal-language skills. The nonverbal language that you use, which is all the facial expressions and the body language, is not something you can really learn (online).

Autism is a developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a broader category that includes autism in all its degrees of severity. Asperger s disorder or syndrome is also in the ASD group. Altogether, research indicates that about one in 150 individuals has an autism spectrum disorder. The What is Autism booklet generally concerns the disorder of autism, and it discusses the variation in symptoms and severity that are found in the disorder. Autism is three to five times more common in males and occurs in all social and ethnic groups. Family income, lifestyle and education do not affect the chance of occurrence. Autism interferes with the development of the brain in reasoning, social interaction and communication skills. People with autism typically have deficiencies in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions and leisure or play activities. The disorder makes it hard for them to communicate and relate to others. They may resist changes in routine, exhibit repeated body movements (hand flapping, rocking, etc.) and have unusual responses to people or attachments to objects. Sometimes aggressive or self-injurious behavior occurs. More than 1.5 million people in the U.S. (over 26,000 in South Carolina) have an autism spectrum disorders. Its prevalence rate now places it as one of the three most common developmental disabilities, much more common than Down syndrome. Yet the majority of the public, including some professionals in the medical, educational and vocational fields, are still unaware of how autism affects behavior. Progress is being made in developing more effective teaching methods and other interventions for individuals with autism. Is there more than one type of autism? Autism is considered to be a spectrum disorder, meaning that the symptoms and characteristics of autism can present themselves in a wide variety of combinations, from mild to severe. This is why the term autism spectrum disorders is sometimes used. Although autism is defined by a set of specific behaviors, children and adults can exhibit any combination of them with any degree of severity. The disorder can be difficult to diagnose because no objective test has been developed so far to identify it. There is no blood test, for example. Accurate diagnosis depends instead on perceptive observations of the child, ideally across several settings (home, school, clinic, etc.), by professionals who have substantial knowledge about autism. Even then, a parent may hear more than one label applied to the child: for example, autistic-like, communication disorder with autistic tendencies or high functioning autism. Different labels may be the result of differences in the professionals training, vocabulary and experience with autism. Some diagnostic criteria may confuse parents. The American Psychiatric Association s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM, now in its fourth, TR 2000, edition) groups several disorders into the category of pervasive developmental disorders or PDDs. They include autistic disorder, Asperger s disorder and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). One professional may tell parents their child has PDD-NOS (or simply PDD) because the child does not appear to meet the criteria for autistic disorder. The parents feel relieved that their child does not have autism. However, a second professional may diagnose the child as having autism or explain PDD-NOS as a type of autism. Similar confusion may occur when the diagnosis is Asperger?s disorder, which generally includes symptoms related to social awkwardness more so than difficulties with communication. For the most accurate diagnosis, parents are advised to seek out professionals with substantial knowledge about autism who will observe the child in different settings. Then, whatever the exact diagnosis turns out to be, parents need to remember that all children with autism spectrum disorderss are likely to benefit from similar approaches to education and treatment. In other words, the exact name may not make much difference when it comes to the types of intervention likely to help the individual child or adult. What causes autism? Medical researchers are exploring different explanations for the various forms of autism, including genetics and environmental factors early in prenatal development. Although no one specific cause of autism is known, current research links autism to biological or neurological differences in the brain. Brain scans indicate abnormalities in the structure of the brain, with significant differences in more than one area. In some families there appears to be a pattern of autism, although the pattern of actual inheritance is not yet clear. Autistic-like traits may be seen in other family members, as well as problems such as learning disabilities. This further suggests there may be a genetic basis to the disorder, although no one gene has been directly linked to autism. Several previous theories about the cause of autism have been proven false. Autism is not a mental illness. Children with autism are not unruly kids who choose not to behave. The disorder is not caused by bad parenting; in fact, no psychological factors have been shown to cause autism. How is autism diagnosed? There are no medical tests for diagnosing ASD. An accurate diagnosis must be based on observations of the child s communication, behavior and developmental levels. However, because some of the behaviors associated with autism are shared by other disorders, a doctor may order a variety of medical tests to rule out other causes. For example, a doctor may recommend genetic testing. Because the characteristics of ASD vary so much, diagnosis may be difficult for a practitioner who has limited training or experience with the disorder. Locating a medical specialist or diagnostician who has experience with autism is strongly recommended. Ideally a child should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team which may include a neurologist, psychologist, developmental pediatrician, speech/language therapist, learning consultant or other professionals who are knowledgeable about autism. Several screening tools have been developed to help professionals make an accurate diagnosis. They include: ADI-R Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised SCQ Social Communication Questionnaire ADOS Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule CARS Childhood Autism Rating Scale CHAT Checklist for Autism in Toddlers A brief observation in a single setting cannot present a true picture of an individual s abilities and behaviors. At first glance, the person with autism may appear to have mental retardation, a behavior disorder or even problems with hearing. It is important to distinguish autism from other conditions, since an accurate diagnosis can provide the basis for building an appropriate and effective educational and treatment program. What are the symptoms of autism? Children with autism often appear relatively normal in their development until the age of 18 to 24 months, when their parents notice delays in language, play or social interactions. The following areas are among those most frequently affected by autism. Degrees of severity can vary significantly from one individual to the next. Communication Skills: Language develops slowly or not at all; words are used without attaching the usual meaning to them; communicates with gestures instead of words; has short attention span. Social Interaction: Spends time alone rather than with others; shows little interest in making friends; is less responsive than others to social cues such as eye contact or smiles. Sensory Impairment: Unusual reactions to physical sensations such as oversensitivity to touch or under-responsiveness to pain; responses to sights, sounds, touch, smells and tastes may be affected to lesser or greater degrees. Play: Lack of spontaneous or imaginative play; does not imitate the actions of others; doesn\u2019t initiate pretend games. Behaviors: May be overactive or very passive; has tantrums for no apparent reason; may perseverate on a single item, idea, person, phrase or word; apparent lack of common sense; may display aggressive or violent behavior or injure self. There are great differences between individual people with autism. Some mildly affected individuals may exhibit only slight delays in language but have significant challenges with regard to social interactions. They may have average or above average verbal, memory or spatial skills but find it difficult to be imaginative or join in a game of softball with others. More severely affected individuals may need more assistance in handling day to day activities like crossing streets or making simple purchases. Contrary to popular belief, many children and adults with autism make eye contact, show affection, smile, laugh and express a variety of other emotions, although in degrees that vary from person to person. Like other children, children with autism respond to their environment in positive and negative ways. Autism may affect their range of responses and make it more difficult for them to control how their bodies and minds react. People with autism live normal life spans. Some of the behaviors associated with autism may change or disappear over time, although this will vary from one individual to the next. It can be difficult to predict which children will become more or less self-sufficient over time, but some adults with autism do live independently and find employment in their communities. Others will depend on the support of family and professionals. Adults with autism can benefit from vocational training, as well as training that will enable them to participate in social and recreational programs. They may live in a variety of residential settings, including living on their own, with family members, in group homes or supervised apartments and in structured residential care. Individuals with ASD may have other disorders which affect the functioning of the brain, such as epilepsy, mental retardation, or genetic disorders such as Fragile X syndrome. Many individuals with autism have test scores that fall in the range of mental retardation; however, experts question the validity of tests that require communication skills and an understanding of the purpose of the testing that students with autism often lack. Approximately one third of individuals with autism have seizures at some point during their lifetime, with onset frequently occurring during adolescence. Is there a cure for autism? Our knowledge about autism has grown tremendously since it was first described in 1943. Some of the early searches for \"cures\" now seem unrealistic in terms of today s understanding of brain-based disorders. To cure means \"to restore to health, soundness or normality.\" In the medical sense, there is no cure, as of yet, for the differences in the brain that result in autism. We are finding better ways to understand autism and help people live with its symptoms. Some symptoms may lessen as the child ages; others may disappear altogether. With appropriate intervention, many behaviors can be made less severe, sometimes to the point that to the untrained observer the individual may not appear to have autism. However, the majority of children and adults with autism will continue to exhibit some degree of symptoms throughout their lives. What are the most effective approaches to treating autism? Because of the spectrum nature of autism and the many combinations of behaviors that can occur, there is no single approach that will alleviate all symptoms in every case. Various types of therapies are available, including behavior training, speech/language therapy, sensory integration training, vision therapy, music therapy, auditory training, medications and dietary interventions. Experience has shown that individuals with autism respond well to a highly structured, specialized education and behavior training program that is tailored to the individual needs of the person. A well designed intervention approach will include some level of communication therapy, social skill development, sensory impairment therapy and behavior training. It will be delivered by professionals who are trained in autism and in a consistent, comprehensive and coordinated manner. The particularly severe challenges of some children may be addressed most effectively by a structured education and behavior program that contains a 1:1 teacher to student ratio or a small group environment. Students with autism should have training in vocational and community living skills at the earliest possible age. Learning to cross a street safely, make a simple purchase or ask for assistance are critical skills that may be difficult for even those with average intelligence to learn. Tasks that enhance independence, give more opportunity for personal choice or allow more freedom in the community are especially valuable. To be effective, any approach should be flexible in nature, rely on positive reinforcement, be re-evaluated on a regular basis and provide a smooth transition from home to school to community environments. A good program will also incorporate training and support systems for the caregivers. Rarely can a family, teacher, or other caregiver provide effective habilitation for a person with autism unless offered consultation or in-service training by a specialist knowledgeable about the disability. Just a generation ago, the vast majority of people with autism lived at least a part of their lives in institutions. As a result of appropriate and individualized services and programs, today even severely disabled individuals can be taught skills to allow them to develop to their fullest potential. Individuals with autism usually exhibit at least half of the traits that are listed on below. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and they will be different from one person to the next. They usually occur across many different situations and are consistently inappropriate for the person s age. Many traits can be addressed in carefully planned treatment plans. The following traits are seen in autism. In most individuals, at least half of the traits are exhibited. Difficulty mixing with other children Insistence on sameness; resists changes in routine Inappropriate laughing and giggling No real fear of dangers Little or no eye contact Sustained odd play Apparent insensitivity to pain Echolalia (repeating words or phrases) Prefers to be alone; has an aloof manner May not want cuddling or act cuddly May spin objects inappropriately Not responsive to verbal cues; acts as if deaf Inappropriate attachment to objects Difficulty in expressing needs; uses gestures or pointing instead of words Noticeable physical over activity or extreme under activity Displays extreme distress or has tantrums for no apparent reason Unresponsive to normal teaching methods Uneven gross and fine motor skills (for example, may not want to kick ball but can stack blocks) Laughing, crying, showing distress for reasons not apparent to others Tantrums beyond what is age appropriate pointing genetic brain genetic eye contact mental retardation echolalia ASD social interaction seizures fragile x syndrome Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders American Psychiatric Association pretend tantrums down syndrome PDD-NOS DSM Play: Lack South Carolina Echolalia Australia U.S Brisbane Children 's Hospital University of Queensland TR ADI-R Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised SCQ Social Communication ADOS Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule CARS Childhood Autism Rating Scale CHAT Checklist Little www.scautism.org/whatis.html screening autism diagnostic observation schedule ados cars childhood autism rating scale vision therapy music therapy Autism332 http://www.parenting.com/article/Baby/Health/New-Autism-Facts-and-Figures The latest autism prevalence rates were published at the end of last year, and the numbers were shocking. One in every 110 kids -- and 1 in every 70 boys -- in the U.S. is living with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the report showed. That's up from 1 in 150 -- and 1 in 94 boys -- only two years ago. But there is plenty of hopeful news, too: We're getting closer to understanding the possible causes. Groundbreaking research last year pinpointed what scientists are calling autism \"susceptibility\" genes, which regulate how the brain develops and how connections between cells are made. \"But you can have those genes and not develop the disorder,\" says Geraldine Dawson, Ph.D., the chief science officer at the advocacy organization Autism Speaks. The genes could be \"influenced,\" she says, by prenatal and environmental factors such as infections, medications, birth complications, and exposure to certain toxins. The hope is that, someday, we can identify children with genetic susceptibility and begin intervention much sooner. Autism is being detected earlier than ever. Researchers from the Yale Child Study Center have made important discoveries about the ways in which autistic children interact, paying more attention to nonsocial physical cues than social ones (for example, staring at their parents' mouths rather than their eyes when they speak). The scientists believe that this eye-tracking data could be used in the first few days of life to identify kids who may be vulnerable to ASD. At your child's 18- and 24-month checkups, your pediatrician should screen for autism spectrum disorders. Even before that, though, both you and she should be on the lookout for red flags, which include little eye contact; no babbling, pointing, or other communicative gestures by 12 months; no single words by 16 months; and loss of language or social skills at any age. New treatments are changing lives. A recent study from the University of Washington in Seattle detailed one of the biggest treatment breakthroughs in recent years: the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) intervention, a form of applied behavior therapy that, Dawson says, is appropriate for infants as young as 12 months. Amazingly, it \"could prevent a full-blown syndrome from developing,\" she adds. How? ESDM strategies capitalize on a child's everyday play to teach communication and learning skills. Kids in the study who got 20 hours of therapy a week for two years had an 18-point improvement in IQ and language gains, and many of them even had their diagnosis changed, from autism to milder conditions. If your child has been diagnosed, ask your physician about early intervention using applied behavior analysis and ESDM.

As I'm sure you've heard by now, no two people diagnosed with autism are the same... In fact there's a saying that I like to use when people ask about autism treatments: \ufffdIf You've Met One Child With Autism... Then You've Met One Child With Autism.\ufffd So, it's clear that treatment and education must be individualized to meet your child's needs and help them build the skills they will need throughout life. But, it's not just children that need an individual approach... A loved one with autism at any age can benefit from proven day-to-day treatment methods... It's true that the challenges do become different as your child matures into an adolescent, and a whole new set of issues will arise. Most of these new challenges are the normal issues parents of all teenager faces, however they are made much \"worse\" by autism. That's because teenagers with autism often have difficulty communicating with their peers and struggle to fit in, but at the same time, they often want to pull away from their parents. This can leave them with no one at all to talk or turn to. They also have the issue of \ufffdraging hormones\ufffd, alongside a limited ability to understand or appropriately manage sexual behaviors - which can lead a number of complications. Raising A Child With Autism Brings New Challenges To Your Family - You Must Be Prepared... Living with autism also brings added stress to the entire family. Brothers and Sisters may sometimes feel as though their needs aren't being met or aren't as important to you compared to the needs of their brother or sister with autism. Also, couples may find their lives revolving around the care of their child with autism and be unable to find time to be with each other. This is \"dangerous ground\" and if allowed to continue can lead to the breakdown of the relationship and the family. And, of course, there are the many financial stresses and concerns over the future of any child with autism. As people with autism have a normal life expectancy, naturally plans must be made for their adult life. Unfortunately, many people with autism are not able to lead independent lives and may not be able to hold down jobs or participate in their communities. But this doesn't have to be the case... To help them, you must start planning for their transition to the \ufffdadult\ufffd world early. So when your child is ready they can then be helped to find appropriate employment that includes his or her skills and interests, while keeping challenges linked to autism at a minimum. OK - let's stop here for a second... I'd like to make something clear right now... A diagnosis of autism definately SHOULD NOT be seen as a guarantee of a lesser life. In fact, all you need is the right advice and instruction to ensure your child with autism is placed and stays on the right path - Unfortunately, useful information you can trust can be hard to find... This is one of the reasons I carried out a survey of 500 of my newsletter subscribers, all who have loved ones with autism. The information I gathered from this pioneering study gives parents, caregivers and professionals \"tried and tested\" answers to the buring questions they have about living and treating autism. For Example...did you know that the top rated effectve treatment for autism is Applied Behavioural Analysis (based on a survey I carried out of 500 people who have loved ones with autism in 2007) This lack of relevant and critically important information is the reason I wrote a comprehensive book covering all the essentials anyone with a loved one with autism should know. The book has one simple goal - To make life better for all those whose lives have been touched by Autism... Since writing the first edition, my downloadable book (revised edition now available) has helped thousands get a better life for themselves, their family and most importantly their loved one with Autism. This is the downloadable book that will calm your fears, put your mind at ease and help you develop a workable plan for your family and your loved ones future. Social & Communication Challenges..

It shows that one in 110 American 8-year-olds is classified as having an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a 57 percent increase in ASD cases compared to four years earlier.The new findings, published Dec. 18 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), highlight the need for social and educational services to help those affected by the condition, said Beverly Mulvihill, Ph.D., a UAB associate professor of public health and co-author on the study.ASDs are a group of developmental disabilities such as autism and Asperger disorder that are characterized by delays or changes in childhood socialization, communication and behavior. GA_googleFillSlot(\"News_Science_300x250\"); This is a dramatic increase in the number of kids classified as autistic or documented on the spectrum of similar disorders, Mulvihill said. It is not entirely clear what is causing the rise, but we know major collaborative efforts are needed to improve the understanding and lives of people and families impacted. The MMWR study discusses possible factors that might contribute to the increase in ASD cases. They include a broader definition of autism disorders and a heightened awareness of ASD by parents, doctors, educators and other professionals. The findings do not address whether or not any of the increase is attributable to a true increase in the risk of developing ASD, more frequent and earlier diagnoses, and other factors.Data comes from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network, a collection of 11 sites in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Wisconsin. ADDM reviewers are uniformly trained to review and confirm cases; some children included in the study have documented ASD symptoms but never received a diagnosis.The study also found that boys are 4.5 times more likely than girls to have ASD, a finding that confirms earlier studies, says Martha Wingate, Dr.P.H., a UAB assistant professor of public health and study co-author. It still is not clear why males more frequently are affected, Wingate said. One thing we know for sure is that more research is needed to quantify the effects of single or multiple factors such as diagnosis patterns, inclusion of milder cases and other components. The ADDM sites are not selected based on any statistical pattern, but the 300,000-plus children included in the study represent 8 percent of the nation's 8-year-olds.The Alabama Autism Surveillance Project, located within the UAB Department of Health Care Organization and Policy, is a member of the ADDM network.

Autism is a behavioral syndrome, which means that its definition is based on patterns of behaviors that a person exhibits. Autism is not an illness or a disease. It is not contagious and, as far as we know, it is not acquired through contact with the environment. Autism is a neurological disability that is presumed to be present from birth and is always apparent before the age of three. Although autism affects the functioning of the brain, the specific cause of autism is unknown. In fact, it is widely assumed that there are most likely multiple causes, each of which may be manifested in different forms, or subtypes, of autism. Future research will help us understand the etiologies of autism. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an increasingly popular term that refers to a broad definition of autism including the classical form of the disorder as well as closely related disabilities that share many of the core characteristics. ASD includes the following diagnoses and classifications: (1) Pervasive Developmental Disorder?Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), which refers to a collection of features that resemble autism but may not be as severe or extensive; (2) Rett's syndrome, which affects girls and is a genetic disorder with hard neurological signs, including seizures, that become more apparent with age; (3) Asperger syndrome, which refers to individuals with autistic characteristics but relatively intact language abilities, and; (4) Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, which refers to children whose development appears normal for the first few years, but then regresses with the loss of speech and other skills until the characteristics of autism are conspicuous. Although the classical form of autism can be readily distinguished from other forms of ASD, the terms autism and ASD are often used interchangeably. Individuals with autism and ASD vary widely in ability and personality. Individuals can exhibit severe mental retardation or be extremely gifted in their intellectual and academic accomplishments. While many individuals prefer isolation and tend to withdraw from social contact, others show high levels of affection and enjoyment in social situations. Some people with autism appear lethargic and slow to respond, but others are very active and seem to interact constantly with preferred aspects of their environment. Behavioral Description Individuals with autism are characterized primarily by develop- mental difficulties in verbal and nonverbal communication, social relatedness, and leisure and play activities. All individuals with autism experience substantial problems with social interactions. In addition, people with autism often exhibit unusual, repetitive, and perseverative movements (including stereotyped and self-stimulatory behaviors), resistance to changes in routines and in other features of their environments, apparent oversensitivity or undersensitivity to specific kinds of stimulation, and extreme tantrums, aggression or other forms of acting out behavior. It is also observed that individuals with autism have uneven patterns of skill development. Some people display superior abilities in particular areas (such as music, mechanics, and arithmetic calculations), while other areas show significant delay. Diagnosis and Evaluation The principal source for diagnosing autism is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV,1994). Although children affected by autism are being identified at earlier ages than was the case previously, the diagnosis usually does not occur until sometime between two and three years of age. Diagnosticians are often reluctant to issue a formal diagnosis before the age at which complex language is expected to emerge. However, early intervention services can still be provided on the basis of developmental delay, even without a formal diagnosis of autism. A diagnosis of autism is often provided by developmental pediatricians, psychologists, child psychiatrists, or neurologists. At the time of (or prior to) diagnosis, a comprehensive evaluation is typically arranged. Such an evaluation usually includes a neurological examination, tests for biochemical abnormalities, and other assessments designed to rule out physical and diagnostic conditions. A battery of developmental and educational evaluations is also conducted to help develop an appropriate early intervention plan. Family involvement is integral to this entire process. Prevalence In 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (1999) estimated that a broad definition of autism may be present in as many as one person out of every 500. This estimate suggests that there are roughly 500,000 people in the United States who could be described as having autism or autism spectrum disorder. It is well established that autism occurs in four times as many boys as girls (NICHCY, 1999) and that there are no known racial, social, economic, or cultural distinctions. Although it is possible that there are some genetic linkages with some forms of autism, there are no associations with particular familial or cultural histories or practices. Earlier theories that implicated parents' behavior in the occurrence of autism have been thoroughly discredited. There have been occasional speculations about clusters of autism in some areas of the country, and it has been suggested that such clusters may be associated with environmental contaminants or regional medical practices. To date, however, there have been no clear data that support these speculations. Approaches to Intervention and Educational Support Since autism was first identified as a syndrome more than 50 years ago, a variety of intervention strategies have been suggested. These interventions and treatments have risen from a range of theoretical positions, but most have not proven to be effective with large numbers of children. This pattern continues today, with a large number of diverse treatment approaches being touted as uniquely effective in resolving patterns of autistic behavior. For the most part, such claims have not been substantiated in controlled research. The message for families, teachers, and other consumers is to be cautious when considering new, grandiose testimonials, and to be very thoughtful and selective when constructing plans for intervention and support. Even though autism has attracted an array of spurious treatments, a good deal of real progress has occurred, and some very credible approaches have been demonstrated repeatedly to be effective in improving the behaviors and adaptability of people with autism. Interventions that are derived from an educational and behavioral orientation have been shown to help children and adults affected by autism, primarily by teaching new skills that enable the person to function more successfully in the daily world of home, school, work, and community interactions. Years of research and experience have produced some relevant guidelines for providing instruction and intervention for individuals with autism. For example, it is important that interventions be developed on an individualized basis. The label of autism by itself is not prescriptive. It does not indicate what intervention should be provided or how intervention should be provided. As a set of general rules, it is widely agreed that people with autism respond better in a context where there is structure and clear guidelines regarding expectations for appropriate and inappropriate behavior. It is also recommended that the environ- ment include systems or materials, such as written or picture schedules, that can help the person to comprehend and predict the flow and sequence of activities. The focus of intervention and instructional efforts should be to develop functional skills that will be of immediate and ongoing value in the context of daily living. This typically includes strategies for enhancing a person's ability to communicate, to understand language, and to get along socially in complex home, school, work, and community settings. Another important guideline for intervention pertains to family involvement. To the greatest extent possible, family members should be encouraged to participate in all aspects of assessment, curriculum planning, instruction, and monitoring. Parents and other family members very often have the most useful information about an individual's history and learning characteristics, so effective intervention and instruction should take advantage of this vital resource. Furthermore, because families are so essential in the lives of people with autism, family support that helps strengthen the family system is regarded as a vital element in providing effective intervention for people with autism.

Glebe is great deal of variety among autistic people. Some autistic people may never learn to talk and may not be able work or to live independently. Others may do well in special supportive environments, working in sheltered setting. Still others are be totally independent and function fairly well. The last, or \"high-functioning,\" group is often not recognized. However, these do exist, and people need to recognize and understand the difficulties they face, and their unique ways of thinking, doing things, and experiencing the world. Most autistic people seem unusually \"reactive,\" and reactive to unusual things. An autistic person who seems to take major emergencies in stride may become upset over any surprise happening, even a minor one (like dropping pencil). Autistic people may often seem unemotional, but can be very emotional when something is important to them. Many are much more candid and expressive with their emotions than normal people. Autistic people tend to dislike, or at least be uninterested in, change. Many have strong attachments to objects, places, or routines, and become very upset if forced to abandon these things. Something that seems silly to others may be very important to an autistic person. Most autistic people have a few very intense interests, that may seem almost obsessive. These could be as ordinary as sports, as technical as neurology, or as odd as memorizing train schedules. Autistic people take their special interests very seriously. Autistic people are often aloof, and may be seen as extremely shy. However, while some may be very socially anxious, others are not anxious about people, but either uninterested, or are unaware of how to interact with or approach others. Some may not notice people, because of being absorbed by other things. Some are very interested in getting to know others, some may not care, and other may actively avoid social contact. However, it is a mistake to assume autistic people lack affection; some can be very affectionate toward those they know and care about. The lack of normal body language may make them seem more distant or unemotional than they actually are. Autistic people may do strange things, like rocking back-and-forth, flapping their hands in front of their eyes, humming, talking to themselves, spinning in circles, or repeating things. Some of this is just for fun, or out of excitement or distress. Sometimes, strange behaviors are to compensate with sensory problems. The repetitiveness is related to the natural repetitiveness and narrow focus of the autistic mind. Talking to oneself or giggling for no apparent reason is often the result of intense daydreaming or remembering, but may sometimes result from disregulated emotion, or be a form of echolalia. (Some ? estimated 25% ? also suffer from epileptic seizures of various kinds, some of which may cause strange behavior.)

Moore, Ph.D. Copyright 2005 revised 2006 There are not too many things in life more devastating than having a normal looking baby not meet normal developmental milestones and finding out that they have an incurable disorder called autism. Before 1980 only one in 2,500 children was diagnosed with autism disorder. Today the figure is closer to one in every 250 children born. The reason for this increase appears to escape the mainstream medical community. Whatever the reason, the effects are devastating to the individual with the diagnosis and to the entire family. To date, there is no known cure for Autism. However, there exists many treatments that can improve functioning. The purpose of this article is to explain an holistic approach to treat Autism, Aspergers Disorder and other Pervasive Developmental Disorders. Almost all the techniques presented in this paper are based on clinical experience and scientific research. Almost all of these techniques do not have the gold standard of a double blind placebo controlled research study to support claims of effectiveness. Treatment for autism is relatively new and are not backed by many funding sources. We present this information for your enlightenment so that you can choose the techniques that you feel will best help your loved one or the clients you serve. Resources for further information regarding particular treatments will be given as part of this article. Hopefully, some day, most of these techniques will have double blind placebo controlled research studies to verify their effectiveness. What are Autism? Autism, Aspergers Disorder, Retts Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorders Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) comprise a group of mental illnesses called Pervasive Developmental Disorders. Of the four disorders Autism and Aspergers Disorder are the most common. In simple terms, children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders do not meet the normal developmental milestones at the same time as other children. Certain social skills (e.g., two way play) are often never developed. Children with Autism do not learn to speak when their same age peers do. Speech development is the main difference between Autism and Aspergers Disorder. Children with Aspergers Disorder appear to develop normally in the area of speech. Children with the diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorders often have other symptoms besides developmental delays. These disorders can manifest in very severe terms that involve constant rocking, self harm through head banging, profound mental retardation, almost non-existent social skills and displaying an inability to learn to speak. These disorders can also appear to be very benign in forms that appear to be normal except in the area of social skills. Many would perceive these high functioning individuals as being odd. What is common in all children diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorders is a lack of two way or parallel play. Concepts of sharing and allowing others to dominate the play for an extended period of time appear to be unknown to these children, even those who have the mildest forms of Autism or Aspergers disorder. Other symptoms common to children with these disorders include: poor social skills inability to form meaningful relationships areas of poor academic achievement gastro-intestinal problems (including encopresis) food allergies, sensitivities and/or intolerances behavioral problem repetitive behaviors rocking behaviors inappropriate attachments to objects delays of speech unresponsiveness to verbal clues (may appear deaf yet has normal hearing) developmental vision problems sensitivity to loud noises or sounds at certain frequencies refuses to learn in the way a teacher wants, has their own way of learning information odd behaviors behavioral outbursts, tantrums, or rages excessive sensitivity to pain or lack of sensitivity to pain lack of fear to situations that would normally produce fear in children of similar age A child with a Pervasive Developmental Disorder may only have a few of the above symptoms. Others may seem to have every one of them. It is also common for children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders to have other mental health conditions as well. Common disorders that co-exist with Pervasive Developmental Disorders include Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Mood Disorders and Motor Tic Disorders. Having an additional disorder may make treatment even more complicated. Regardless of the co-existing disorders, every child diagnosed with a Pervasive Developmental Disorder is unique and should be considered as such. If you have a child with autistic symptoms, some of the following techniques may not apply to your child. For example, not all autistic children have developmental vision problems. Many of them do. Not all have gastro-intestinal problems, yet many of them do. And not all of them will be sensitive to wheat and dairy products. You will need to decide which techniques are important for your child s particular needs. Thus parents should use only the information presented in this article that they feel will meet the individual uniqueness of their child. For the sake of simplicity, the term autism will be used loosely in this article. In Europe, Pervasive Developmental Disorders are usually termed as autistic spectrum disorder to point out that there is a broad range of symptoms to these disorders. There is also a broad range of severity in children diagnosed with these disorders. In this paper, we will use the term autism to signify all disorders in the group of disorders called Pervasive Developmental Disorders. What causes autism and why the increase in diagnoses? It is amazing that we have a modern day epidemic and no one can agree upon the cause of the epidemic. One in 250 children is a large number of victims not to know the cause or etiology. There is little doubt that autism involves abnormal brain development. What is not known is what causes the brain to grow abnormally. Some scientist firmly believe the cause is related to the immunization vaccines. There are two main theories about how vaccines can cause the brain to grow abnormally. One view is that the mercury used as a preservative for the vaccine leads to abnormal brain development causing autism. The other theory suggests that the cause is due to a live virus within the vaccine getting into the brain causing the abnormal growth. Those who believe it is related to mercury poisoning feel that children with autism may have a genetic predisposition to process the mercury in the body differently than the children who are not affected with the vaccine. These are children who develop normally and then after the vaccine begin to produce the first signs of autism. Thus it is the mercury that stimulates the brain to grow abnormally. Many of the symptoms of mercury poisoning are very similar to the symptoms of autism. Vaccines may not be the only source of mercury toxicity. Every ten years the government collects blood and urine samples randomly from the general population to study the effects of environmental toxins. In the year 2000, the study discovered that a large number of women of child bearing age have enough mercury in their body (possibly from cosmetics) to be harmful to their unborn fetus. Could this be the source of mercury poisoning in addition to the vaccines? The other theory blaming the vaccine relates to the fact that live viruses are used in the preparation of the vaccines. The theory suggests that some of these viruses are able to get into the brain of some of the children receiving the vaccine. It may be a genetic factor causing the virus to get through the brain s natural barriers. Another factor could be some random factor that causes some vaccines to be more dangerous than others dosages of the same vaccine. What ever the factors involved it is the live virus that stimulates the brain to grow abnormally according to this theory. Some people may speculate that the rise in the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders is due to are ability to better diagnose these disorders. They speculate that we have always had children with these disorders but have not recognized them as abnormal. The problem with this theory is that there is just too much of a dramatic increase since the 1960's to account for such high numbers. While we may be better at diagnosing children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders, this fact does not account for the tremendous amount of increase in children being affected with Autism and Aspergers Disorder. We feel that we have a true epidemic and the number of children diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder is likely to continue to increase over time. Autism is not the only medical problem that is on the rise with children. Allergies is also on the rise. Some feel that our continual exposure to environmental toxins may account for the increase in these disorders. We feel that we should examine our increase use of plastics, batteries, cosmetics, and other products that may contribute to environmental toxins that we are constantly exposed to. Is it possible that exposure to environmental toxins could account for the increase in child health problems such as allergies, asthma and Pervasive Developmental problems? Or is the cause due to mercury used in the vaccines or is it the live virus used to make the vaccines? Could it be a combination of these factors? Could it be another factor? Much more research is needed to determine the specific cause for this modern day epidemic. However, we feel that the most probable cause relates to toxic substances found in our environment and/or vaccines that cause the brain to grow abnormally. Just as there is no known cause of Pervasive Developmental Disorders, there is no known cure. Not even medications can cure a child with Autism or Aspergers Syndrome. The abnormal brain growth defies modern interventions. However, there are many things that can be done to increase general functioning of a child with autism. Some of these techniques or a combination of these techniques may be able to get these children very close to behaving normally. This include behaving socially normal. We feel that the key to success lies ultimately in neuro-development. The more that abnormal neuro pathways are worked with to be made normal, the more skills a child will have. The more cognitive skills a child with Pervasive Developmental Disorders have the more the child will appear normal. The following is a brief presentation on some of the treatments available for children with autism. Almost all of these treatments have an impact on neuro-development. Nutrition The importance of eating the right food can not be overstated. Brain development requires the right chemicals and nutrients to help dendrites branch out to connect with other nerve cells. Research has demonstrated that some of the nuero-pathways of the frontal cortex are under developed in children with autism. Good nutrition is the foundation to help dendrite development and can help in the construction of new neuro-pathways when remediation work is underway. Good nutrition will help almost anyone to feel and function better. We all could do well with eating a variety of foods and taking supplemental vitamins. This is especially true for autistic children. While some children with autism will eat anything put before them, many are picky eaters. Many have a very limited amount of food that they are willing to eat. However, some will eat just about anything that is placed before them. Good nutrition is important for any child, especially for the child with autism disorder. Mothers can often compensate by adding multivitamins to their children s diets. Children who do not swallow pills or refuses chewable multivitamins can obtain vitamins through concentrated sprays. In general, the recommendations for autistic children are to increase their consumption of omega 3 fatty acids (e.g., cod liver oil, walnuts), vitamin D and natural (cis) forms of vitamin A. Additional supplements include Choline (use under supervision), DMG (Glconic from DaVinci Labs), Magnesium plus calcium, Vitamin B complex plus niacinamide and niacin and pantothenic acid, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin C. When considering the addition of vitamin supplements, use wisdom. Educate yourself about supplementation. Be careful not to over supplement a child. Try to understand how the supplement is supposed to work and know the correct amount of supplementation to get the desired response. More information about supplementation and how it can be applied to Pervasive Developmental Disorders can be obtained in the book Prescription for Nutritional Healing . Several Internet sites also have great recommendations and nutritional plans. We recommend www.parentsofallergicchildren.org. Nutritional plans are helpful because many children with autsim and Aspergers syndrom often have sensitivities to certain foods which impair functioning. Nutrition can also be useful to help detoxify children from toxic chemicals. Foods that are believed to help with the detoxification process are raw potatoes, asparagus, carrots, garlic, beets, dandelion greens, parsley and watermelon. It is recommended for everyone to drink lots of water to help flush out toxic materials from the body. Steamy baths and saunas are also helpful in helping the body to release toxins. The study of nutrition is also helpful in knowing how to deal with foods that may irritate or aggravate the immune system. Some autistic children may have sensitivity to certain foods. Common irritants are foods that contain lactose or gluten. Many children with autism are lactose and gluten intolerant. If you have an autistic child that has intestinal problems, chances are that gluten and/or casein are contributing to these problems. Homeopathic specialists have a method to determine if your child is allergic to certain foods. Their findings can be backed up by two types of medical allergy testing. We recommend the provocation/neutralization method of allergy testing and the Elisa/ACT LRA Tests. For more information about the Elisa/ACT LRA tests please visit the following website: www.parentsofallergicchildren.org/elisa_act_test.htm Toxicity assessment Again, the most probable cause of autism is a combination of toxic substances that were in the child s body during crucial neuro-developmental periods of that person s life. Some children may still have these toxic substances within their body. The body naturally attempts to rid itself of toxic chemicals over time. Some believe that some toxic chemicals are difficult to excrete and need assistance. It is believed that once these toxic chemicals (e.g., heavy metals) are out of the body, over all functioning may improve. Getting rid of all the toxic chemicals will not cure the child. The resulting neurological damage needs to be addressed. Additional efforts are needed to treat the child as explained in other sections of this article. These efforts have a higher chance of succeeding if the body is currently free of toxic substance. The first step in this process is to detect harmful substances within the body. One way to test for the presence of heavy metals within the body is through hair analysis. The body releases heavy metals very slowly so the likelihood of finding any in the urine or blood is very minute. However, the hair collects body excretions over time. If a body has heavy metal toxicity, evidence of this should be found in the hair. Thus hair analysis is viewed as a valid measure for long term toxicity while blood and urine samples are not. Hair analysis has been criticized by some as being to unreliable. A study reported sending the same hair to several labs and received different results from each lab. If someone is inclined to do hair analysis, we highly recommend the Great Smokey Mountain Laboratory in Tennessee. They are regarded as the best laboratory to do hair analysis. To have a hair analysis performed, contact a willing doctor. You can also order a testing kit from the Laboratory by visiting their web site at http://www.gsdl.com. Hair analysis can also be used as an outcome measure to determine the effectiveness of detoxification methods. In addition, some children seem to collect toxic substances easier than other children. It may be wise to obtain a hair analysis on a yearly basis. Once it has been determined that heavy metals or other toxic substances remain in the child s body, the next step is to rid the body of these chemicals. One method of doing this is through chelation. Chelation is a process of administering certain substances that attempt to rid the body of toxic elements and compounds that are often stored in the body. There are several ways to do chelation. The internal method (the child ingesting the chelation substances) is known to cause side effects (e.g., gut bugs) that can at first lead to improvement and then lead to a deterioration in functioning. For more information about this method and the possible side effects, please follow this link: http://www.healing-arts.org/children/holmes.htm. A possible safer approach is administering the chelation chemicals through the skin. This is called Transdermal Chelation. Only a few doctors do this technique but it is alleged to excrete the toxic metals without as many side effects of the other approach to chelation. As explained in the section under nutrition, there are natural methods to help the body detoxify from harmful chemicals. Medical chelation is often viewed as a more effective method. For more information on Transdermal Chelation, please follow this link: http://www.drbuttar.com/about/about.asp. Dr. Amy Yasko is a pioneer in the development of a holistic program to help children and adults detoxify and strengthen their body using nutritional supplements. More information can be found at http://www.holisticheal.com. Cognitive Development Some children with Autism Spectrum Disorder symptoms do well in school, while many do not. This is usually because some of them have developed very well cognitively and others have not. No brain is perfectly developed. Even normal children have areas of their brain development that can be improved. Improving cognitively in childhood always translates into a higher quality of life in adulthood. Most people feel that intelligence is a static phenomena and does not change over the life span. We disagree with this and encourage activities that are designed to increase intellectual functioning. Research has demonstrated that within a year of the correct intervention, IQ can be raised up to 24 points, if IQ is originally below 100. It can be raised on the average of 9 points if it is already above 100. A 24 point gain in IQ can get some retarded children within normal limits of intelligence. Again, any advancement in intelligence has a positive impact for the rest of the child s life. Currently there is a revolution within the cognitive development field. Many professionals are becoming involved in the neuro-developmental model. Basically the model states that with the right kind of intervention, neuro-pathways can be developed in order to strengthen cognitive functioning. There are several good models to choose from and some with a history of over 40 years. Some of the better models include The Structure of Intellect (SOI), Mel Levine s: All Kinds of Minds Institute, Pace Tutoring, and DORE. A listing of these and other neuro-developmental models with links to their Internet sites can be found at: www.yourfamilyclinic.com/ld/ldmodels.html. Getting benefit from one of these providers requires certain commitments in both cost and time. To benefit from neuro-developmental programs one must spend ample time through out the week on training exercises. The recommended time requirement is usually between 20 minutes to an hour per day, six days a week. The total cost is usually $3,000 per child. PACE tutoring has the most intensive training requiring an hour a day, six days a week. The benefit they offer is that the program is finished in three months or 90 days. They report an average gain of four years in reading and attention skills within that 90 day time period. Other models may take longer in the number of days but usually require less time per day. The end results from each program should be relatively similar. They all approach neuro-development slightly different so you have a broad choice of which will be most effective for your circumstance. The first step is to contact a provider of one of these neuro-developmental models. The practitioner will examine your child and let you know if they may be able to help or not. Your Family Clinic has a service to guide families in choosing the right developmental program and to assist them in any home schooling or home development they may choose to do. For more information about this service, just follow this link:http://www.yourfamilyclinic.com/ld/coach.html Social Development Lack of social skills is the essential component of all children with pervasive development disorders. The part of the brain devoted to the acquisition of social skills and understanding social cues are under developed in children with Autism and Aspergers Syndrom. Traditional techniques (e.g., behavior modification) have attempted to address the lack of eye contact and social problems common with children with Autism. Most of these techniques are viewed as very limited, having problems with generalization, and ineffective in solving the real problems related to social development. There is a social development program that we believe is effective in resolving the social problems of these children. The technique that we highly recommend is called Relationship Development Intervention. This is the most comprehensive system to teach social skills. It now has scientific evidence to its effectiveness. While the evidence does not meet the gold standard, it does offer significant encouragement. According to the initial research 50 percent of the participants in RDI were able to achieve social skills to the point that they no longer met the criteria for Autism. The authors were clear to point out that these children were by no means cured of their disorder, but their social skills were so developed that they no longer met the DSM criteria as having Autism. If the reader could only implement one suggestion from this article, RDI would be the one to implement. RDI is a pure neuro-developmental model and is the most likely to have permanent effects. There are no known side effects. In addition, in neuro-development, when goals are achieved, it is often the case that other problems clear up as well. In our opinion, it is the technique that will produced the most amount of effective treatment in the least amount of time and cost. The techniques are relatively simple. Everyday the coach or parent or teacher spends one on one time to teach social interaction. All the procedures are explained in a book. The book maps out social development into 26 stages. The coach or parent knows which level of development the child is at and what techniques need to be taught next. Improvement in social development can be easily measured by the checklist the book offers. More information can be obtained at the RDI Internet website at http://www.rdiconnect.com. This website offers parent training seminars and support networks. Auditory Training Autistic children are often sensitive to information they receive through their senses. Many are overly sensitive to light, smells, tastes and textures. Some are very sensitive to the sounds they hear. Auditory Processing is another component that should be examined when working with Autistic children. Some Autistic children become upset when they are around certain noises. One theory for this is because they are sensitive to a certain range of frequencies of sound. This sensitivity causes them to become irritated whenever they hear sound within this frequency range. A technique called auditory integration is a procedure to attempt to address this problem. First the child is introduced to a wide range frequency of sound. Then a band of frequency is identified that the child is sensitive to. The child is introduced to music and other sounds that do not include the frequency area. Then with repeated exposure, the frequency is slowly introduced a little at a time. The brain is allowed to get accustomed to the offending frequency. More information on this procedure can be found at www.auditoryintegration.net/AIT_home.html Many parents notice improvements in behaviors and cognitive abilities following this treatment. Some report that the treatment lasted a long time. Others found that when their child had a relapse in gastro-intestinal problems as a result of chelation, that their sensitivity to sound returned. More research is needed to identify which Autistic children benefit from this procedure and which do not. Some children may be sensitive to the sound of their own chewing. These children often do not chew their food because of this sensitivity. These children may have an overly sensitive trigeminal nerve. One treatment approach is to gently massage the trigeminal nerve until it is less sensitive. The procedure is described at Handle Institute s web site: http://www.handle.org/activity/facetap.html. Another related concern is auditory processing problems. Some Autistic Spectrum Disorder can pass a simple hearing test yet have problem processing the information that they hear. An auditory specialist can help detect auditory processing problems. Several companies have designed programs to help develop auditory skills. These include Fastforword and Tomitis. A relatively inexpensive program designed for the home user is Earobics. You can explore their website at www.earobics.com Near Point Vision Therapy Just as some children have trouble processing auditory information, many children with autism do not process visual information correctly. Developmental vision is concerned with how well the eyes and muscles controlling the eyes are working together. In addition it is concerned with the process in which the information from the eyes are interpreted in the brain. Developmental vision is all about helping children see things clearly and accurately so they can learn to read and interact with their environment better. One of the most common problems with some autistic children is convergence. Often these children will have one eye that focuses where it is supposed to and the other eye is aimed some where else. Developmental vision therapy works with the eyes through exercises designed to strengthen eye muscles and improve their coordination. Only developmental optometrist do the examinations necessary to detect and correct developmental vision problems. Most optometrists are not developmental optometrists. Most optometrists check for 20/20 vision and a person with developmental vision problems may have perfect 20/20 vision, but still not have the visual abilities to learn to read fluently. The College of Optometrists in Vision Development (at www.covd.org/index.html) has much information on developmental optometry. To find a doctor in your area go to www.covd.org/membersearch.php. To learn more about autism and developmental vision problems, we invite you to visit www.visionhelp.com/autism.htm. Attention Development Many children with Autism have problems with attention. Attention is the ability to hold concentration over a period of time. Some children with Attention Deficit Disorder have selective attention. If the activity is stimulating (e.g., video game) they can maintain concentration for hours at a time, if the activity is not very stimulating (e.g., home work), their ability to concentrate is short. If a child is unable to sit through a television program, the child either has developmental vision problems or has almost no attention skills. Attention skills can be developed through specific exercises. It can also be obtained through medication. If medication is the chosen route, then one must realize that once the medication has worn off, the attention abilities are gone until the next dosage. There are numerous exercises to increase attention. Some children with severe autistic characteristic will have to start with the easiest exercise which is to scratch their back. Gently scratching the child s back with a back scratcher is often a good place to begin working on attention skills. The activity is usually soothing. It may take a while for some to be able to remain at this activity for an extended time. You should work up to 20 minute period. Twenty minutes of attention is usually the goal because many activities at school require 20 minutes of sustained attention. The next level of attention building is being able to visually follow objects with the head held still. Often the parent has to hold the child s head as they move a pencil or puppet in front of their face from side to side requiring that the child focus on the object at all times. Complete instructions to this exercise and similar exercises can be found at the end of a shareware article at http://www.yourfamilyclinic.com/shareware/addbehavior.html. Another method to increase attention skills is through computer assisted programs. We feel that a game for the X box and Sony Play Station II for building attention skills is Dance Dance Revolution. It promotes a sense of timing and rhythm that has been linked to the development of concentration and attention skills. The similar game is available over the Intranet at www.flashflashrevolution.com. Interactive Metronome is a professional system developed to build attention skill. More information can be found at www.interactivemetronome.com. There are other companies that develop software that builds attention skills. Some of our favorite companies are Brain Train at www.braintrain.com and Locutur at www.learningfundamentals.com. A company that develops software to teach academic skills is Laureate Learning and can be found at www.llsys.com/parents/index.html. Attention skill exercises are usually fun and satisfying. They are satisfying because parents can see improvements within a relatively short period of time. We recommend doing attention exercises daily. After 30 days at 20 minutes a day, you should see significant gains in attention skills. If you do not, it is usually because you started off on a more advanced level than your child is prepared for. Some will need to start with back scratching and massages. Others can start at visual tracking exercises. Another cause for lack of success is that other senses (e.g., vision, hearing, touch) are not developed and are interfering with the child s ability to concentrate. If you have started at the right level, you should get positive results. These results should encourage your child to try other exercises to build up cognitive and relationship skills. Medications. For children with severe attention problems, we recommend a combination of medication and attention exercises. Medications used for attention skills are the psychostimulants (e.g., Ritalin, Adderal), Welbutrin, and Strattera. You will need to see a medical professional to obtain medication. For a complete list of the medications used for psychological problems, please follow this link: www.yourfamilyclinic.com/medical/medicationlist.html. Some children with Autism Spectrum Disorder will not require medication. Currently there are no medications that are approved by the Federal Drug Administration to treat PDD. However, medications are widely used to treat these children. Medications are often used to address particular symptoms that often are seen in children with PDD and to treat coexisting conditions such as Tourettes Syndrom, tic disorders, ADHD, psychotic behavior, epilepsy and other separate disorders. Thus a child with Autism may be on a number of different medications. Be careful with medications. Most of the undesirable side effects will usually improve within one or two weeks. If they do not, inform your doctor. Some medications help cognitive functioning. Other medications may interfere with cognitive functioning and may even interfere with neuro-developmental activities. Work with your doctor to find the best medication or combination of medications to address your child s symptoms yet help your child to function at an optimal level. Currently the most popular medications for children with PDD appear to be the antipsychotic medications (e.g., and the anti-depressant medications (Buspar, Zoloft, Prozac). For a list of medications used to treat psychological disorders, feel free to look one of our listings at www.yourfamilyclinic.medication.medicationlist.html. To see information regarding research on children with PDD and specific medications, we recommend a visit to http://www.patientcenters.com/autism/news/med_reference.html. For children with severe attention problems, we recommend a combination of medication and attention exercises. Medications used for attention skills are the psychostimulants (e.g., Ritalin, Adderal), Welbutrin, and Strattera. You will need to see a medical professional to obtain medication. For a complete list of the medications used for psychological problems, please follow this link: www.yourfamilyclinic.com/medical/medicationlist.html. Some people feel that medication should be used first to treat children with PDD. However, we feel that medication should be used as a last resort or when other methods of treatment have failed. We feel that once a child is on medication, then the goal of treatment should be neuro-development and good nutritional practices in an effort to have the child no longer require mediation. There are some children with Autism that medication can not be avoided given our current treatment technology. In addition, people with few resources in time and money may need to rely on medication as a primary form of treatment for children with PDD. EEG biofeedback Another way to improve cognitive skills and overall functioning is through EEG biofeedback. EEG biofeedback measures the brain waves of the child and displays them in ways that the child can understand (e.g., through a simple video game). The child is asked to change the brain waves. As the child becomes proficient at changing and controlling their brain waves, they get improvement in cognitive functioning. Adjusting brain waves is a very safe procedure and almost anyone can benefit from doing the procedure. The procedure is relatively costly since it usually involves about 40 to 80 sessions of therapy. There are two common approaches to this procedure. One is more expensive than the other. The most expensive method involves obtaining a brain map which involves gathering brain wave information from 16 to 19 sites on the head. The information is compared with reference groups and abnormal brain wave activities are listed. Recommendations for biofeedback in an effort to get the brain waves more normal is thus recommended. The less expensive procedure forgoes the brain map technique and the clients symptoms guide the placement of electrodes for biofeedback or a standard placement is used. It is still debatable as to which procedure is better. However, most people who use EEG biofeedback with children with Autism and ADHD report significant results. Parents can now do EEG biofeedback in their home through a system that works with the child's video game system. For just over $600.00, EEG biofeedback is now possible within your own home. For more information, please visit www.smartbraingames.com. It has been our experience that EEG biofeedback is an excellent way to improve functioning. It will not cure the client of Autistic symptoms but it usually will improve functioning significantly. It is been our experience that EEG biofeedback is an excellent way to improve functioning. It will not cure the client of Autistic symptoms but it usually will improve functioning significantly. Conclusion To the parent with an autistic child, the effects of the disorder can be devastating. We have seen parents do just about anything to help their children. Of all the techniques presented above, our favorites and the ones we feel most important are social development (e.g., RDI) and neuro-development. While there is no cure for autism, efforts should focus on increasing skills. Many of the negative outcomes associated with autism can be circumvented with the proper treatment. Parents should not rely on schools to do the neuro-development that is necessary to make significant gains. Most schools do not have the knowledge or training to do nuero-development. Remember, there are no short cuts. Medication will not develop cognitive skills. Medication can be helpful in reducing some of the symptoms. Neuro-developmental techniques require daily interventions. However, a parent should see positive results within 30 days if the correct neuro-developmental technique has been chosen. We have had some parents report positive results from the newer type of chelation therapy. EEG biofeedback can also improve general functioning. The nutritional and medical methods are often important considerations in treating children with autism. Some children may not be able to avoid medication because of severity of their symptoms. Parents should not rely solely on medication in the treatment of their child. While there is no cure for autism, we have developed many useful and effective treatments. With the proper help, it is not unrealistic to expect children with autism to be relatively normal and achieving normal developmental and social milestones with their peers. We feel that every parent of a child with Autism should have the following books: The Fabric of Autism: Weaving The Threads Into A Cogent Theory by Judith Bluestone, Handle Institute (May, 2004), ISBN: 0972023518 Children With Starving Brains: A Medical Treatment Guide for Autism Spectrum Disorder, Second Edition by Jaquelyn McCandless, M.D., Bramble Books; 2nd edition (January 1, 2003) ISBN: 188364710X Relationship Development Intervention with Children, Adolescents and Adults: Social and Emotional Development Activities for Asperger Syndrome, Autism, PDD, and NLD by Steven E.

A Successful Solution to Autism Natural Strategies and Secrets to Help Prevent and Overcome: Autism ADHD and ADD Aspergers Syndrome Many Other Epidemic Childhood Disorders A MUST for parents, health practitioners ... AND for any woman who ever intends to have a baby! Our kids are in deep trouble... You don't need to be the parent of a child with a disorder like autism or attention deficit disorder to realize theres an epidemic going on. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tells us that 1 in 150 children now face a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. In fact, autism is the fastest-growing serious developmental disability in the U.S. The CDC also divulges that about 1.6 million elementary school-aged children have been diagnosed with ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder). And these diseases are only two of the childhood disorders crushing our kids today. Donna Gates knows this. She considers autism to be the worlds wake up call. As a nutritional consultant, author and popular lecturer, Donna has helped thousands of people overcome candidiasis and other immune system disorders by looking first to the health of their digestive tract -- and what she calls your inner ecosystem, the complex network of microflora that must inhabit your intestines in order for you to thrive. Donna wrote her book The Body Ecology Diet (now in its 9th edition) after years of research to find a cure for her own candida-related health problems. Frustrated with conventional medicine, she embarked on a long course of study into many different healing concepts, including ancient Chinese medicine, macrobiotics, raw foods, and supplement therapy, just to name a few. Incorporating the most beneficial components of each concept into her own system of health and healing, her success inspired her to share the Body Ecology Diet (BED) with others. BEDROK Moms and Family Members Speak Out Two years ago my son was approaching two and we first had the diagnosis. I was pregnant. We went to hills of Texas to see the wildflowers. I remember trying to learn what Autism was all about. Anyway, that day two years ago at a park, a train roared by maybe only 50-100 ft away. My son never took notice. We tried to get him to see it, and he couldn't focus to see it. No focus. No interest. I remember a feeling in my stomach. I was sick and frightened. He just sat and stared at some grass endlessly. He had no language, no facial reciprocity, just a monotone stare. But he was adorable and I was terrified to lose him and was soon due with my second child. Anyway, two years later we went on that same trip (yesterday). My husband said he feels like we are living our life again. This time when the train roared by Tyler looked right at it and looked at us to let us know he saw it. We asked him questions about the train and got answers. It's orange and black, and fast, etc....Tyler ran around the park with direction and focus and joy. I had smiles and language and play all around me. Don't ever give up. We have a long way to go, but we are pushing forward. --Shannon A month into the Body Ecology Diet (also known as the BED), Ryan was flourishing. What we were witnessing was incredible! This was definitely the missing link for Ryan! I like to call this The Frosting on Ryan's Cake. Ryan's language thoroughly exploded! Prior to the BED, Ryan still had problems with enunciating the first letter of words. Mommy was ommy, Daddy was addy etc. His vocabulary was very limited and sounds such as grunting were frequently heard. NOT ANY MORE! Ryan was talking up a storm. He was actually putting sentences together! He started to sing songs and understand stories on Barney and Sesame Street. Ryan became more organized with play and started to use imagination play which was something he never did. He gave up his fixation for wheels, no more stimming, and he no longer is oblivious to his surroundings. Ryan now gets excited about all sorts of events, constantly asks inquisitive questions, and is active and involved in everyday functions. It's like Ryan is doing double time just catching up on everything that he couldn't do while he was locked away in his body of autism. What a wonderful feeling! He has even been called the Mayor of his class...because he is very sociable. He mingles with everyone, smiles all the time and has a wonderful gentle-hearted way about himself. His Pediatric Neurologist and Developmental Doctor were so pleased and absolutely amazed. They never thought they would see this type of reversal pattern in Ryan. They really never thought it could be done! What a blessing for a little boy who just 2 years earlier received such a grave and devastating diagnosis. May God bless you as He has done to us. --Deanna (Ryan's grandmother) Going to the Body Ecology Diet retreat was the turning point in Colin's life. In the two years prior to the retreat he had gained only one pound! In the seven months since the retreat Colin has gained 9 pounds, and is now at the 50th percentile and gaining on the growth charts! Because of this diet Colin is a very happy and energetic child, who enjoys gymnastics, karate, sledding and long nature walks. Although there have been a few bumps in the road with respect to his bowels, his symptoms predating the Body Ecology Diet have never returned! --Colleen Murphy Now, she has turned her attention to the children of our generation, particularly those with diseases such as autism and autism spectrum disorders. And to their parents, desperate for a solution. And yes, there is hope. You do not need to consider autism as an incurable illness, despite what mainstream medicine might say. Donna has seen marked progress, and even reversal, in many autistic children she has worked with. But thats not the whole story. If you (or anyone you care about) plans to have a baby in the future, Donna has a message for you, too: you can prevent autism by focusing on a few key principles regarding your own health before giving birth. She offers answers to the questions that are on the lips of most parents, parents-to-be, and concerned people today --probably even on yours... Whats Really Happening to Our Children? And What Can You Do to Fight Back? Not long ago, at a retreat center in southern Florida, a diverse group of concerned parents and professionals converged with a special goal: to understand why our children are falling victim to a multitude of illnesses--particularly autism--in such an epidemic fashion. However, understanding the 'why' wasnt enough... Over the course of this 3-day BEDROK Intensive Seminar, three leading health and nutrition experts (including Donna) focused on the 'how' you can help and most importantly, the 'what' --the exact steps you can take to prevent and treat childhood diseases such as autism. Now, if you're not familiar with the BEDROK Program, it stands for Body Ecology Diet Recovering Our Kids. Donna Gates, along with a group of parents of autistic children (now over 800 families strong), has researched and tested her popular and proven Body Ecology Diet in relation to the autistic community -- with astonishing results. The first group of autistic children ALL showed improvement. Parents watched as behaviors and symptoms disappeared one by one. And over the course of working with thousands of people (and their children), Donna found that autism isnt the only childhood problem helped by the Body Ecology Diet. She's seen natural strategies work, even when conventional medical treatment doesnt. With conditions affecting the neurological system. With ADD/ADHD and many more. The energy and power for change emanating from the speakers and participants at this seminar was so inspiring and life-affirming, Donna made sure to have it recorded. The content was so all-encompassing, it filled a full 12 CDs. The Natural Autism Solution: Dietary Secrets to Help Prevent and Overcome Autism, ADHD, Asperger's and other Epidemic Childhood Disorders This 12 CD Set from the Body EcologyTM Education Series presents parents, future parents, practitioners and everyone involved in the love and care of children with essential and proven insights and solutions for: Autism, Asperger's Syndrome or other autism spectrum disorder ADHD/ADD Numerous neurological disorders Other mental disorders, including schizophrenia Even seemingly unrelated conditions such as asthma, food intolerance and epilepsy Plus, you wont just listen to Donna speak.

In her clinic in Cambridge in the U.K., she specializes in nutrition for children and adults with behavioral and learning disabilities, and adults with digestive and immune system disorders. Her own son was diagnosed with autism at the age of three, which prompted her to begin an intensive study into the causes and treatments of autism. Of course, as the mother of a child diagnosed with such disabilities, she was acutely aware of the difficulties facing other parents like her. So, she has devoted much of her time to helping these families. Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride In addition to her Degree in Medicine, Dr. Campbell-McBride holds Postgraduate Degrees in both Neurology and Human Nutrition. Additionally, she practiced for five years as a neurologist and 3 years as a neurosurgeon. According to Dr. Campbell-McBride, if you are the parent of an autistic child, do not be swayed by the common doctor refrain Theres nothing that can be done . In fact, her son recovered by the age of 12 and is leading a normal life! Dr. Campbell Mc-Bride is firmly convinced that autism and many conditions affecting children are primarily digestive disorders. She will share with you many insights from her book Gut and Psychology Syndrome: Natural Treatment for Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Depression and Schizophrenia.

Published 16/04/2007 [Image source: Istockphoto] CharacteristicsCausesDiagnosisTreatmentDay-to-day lifeMore info Autism is a fairly new condition only having been recognised and named in the 1940s.We don't know exactly what causes it there are many myths and misconceptions. In fact, experts don't always agree exactly what autism actually is or how it should best be treated.What we call autism is actually one of a range of conditions collectively called autism spectrum disorders (ASD) other variants of ASDs are Asperger syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS).CharacteristicsChildren (and adults) with autism have difficulty in social interaction, communication, and imagination. They have trouble forming friendships, and difficulty understanding others. They don't fully understand the meaning of common gestures, facial expressions or tone of voice. They often appear aloof and indifferent to other people. They have difficulty understanding long sentences and instructions. They tend to be visual learners better at processing information that is shown to them rather than told to them.Not only are their communication skills poor, but they may have other odd quirks of behaviour; repetitive and ritualistic behaviours, hand flapping, spinning or running in circles, rocking, or lining up objects.Reality to them is a confusing jumble of events, people, places, sounds and sights; which often makes them anxious and distressed.Most people with autism have an intellectual disability as well, with an IQ below normal. Sometimes though, they have good memory skills, especially for things that they have seen or heard repeatedly. For example, they can sometimes remember all the dialogue of a favourite film or book. Children with Asperger syndrome are sometimes not diagnosed until they start school. Those with Asperger syndrome often struggle with social interactions, yet often have advanced vocabularies and can converse at length on 'favourite subjects'. These children usually have intellectual abilities in the normal range and may appear to be intellectually quite gifted in some respects, but struggle in other areas.Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) is the diagnosis given to children who have some of the characteristics of an ASD but not severley enough to be diagnosed as either autism or Asperger syndrome.TopCausesWe don't know exactly what causes ASD, but it is a developmental disorder of the brain. Studies of people with autism have found abnormalities in several areas of the brain, suggesting that it may be caused by a disruption of early foetal brain development. There is also a genetic predisposition to autism it tends to run in some families, is more likely in a family that already has one child with ASD and is almost certain in identical twins where one of the twins has ASD. It's likely that several genetic abnormalities are needed before a person is at risk of developing the condition. Despite being blamed in the past, there's no evidence of any link between the measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism.TopDiagnosisAutism spectrum disorders affect about one to two people in a thousand. Boys are more likely to be affected than girls. Symptoms appear in the first two or three years of life and last for life.The diagnosis is made on the basis of certain criteria by the American Psychiatric Association, or similar ones set out by the World Health Organisation (in Australia most health workers use the American Psychiatric Association criteria). The diagnosis is usually made by a team a doctor (usually a paediatrician or psychiatrist), plus a psychologist, speech therapist, occupational therapist and social worker. There must be at least two symptoms of impaired social interactivity and one symptom of restricted and repetitive behaviour and delay and abnormalities in language development, for a diagnosis of autism. Children with Asperger syndrome have normal cognitive development. Because autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed on the basis of abnormalities and delays in language development and social skills as well as the presence of repetitive non-functional rituals and abnormal behaviours, there can be disagreement amongst health workers as to the precise diagnostic criteria and how the different disorders within the group are defined and classified.TopTreatmentEarly interventionThere's no cure for these conditions, but they can be successfully managed. There is now definite evidence that early intervention and a combination of speech therapy, structured education, social skills training, behavioural therapy and parent education and training promotes adaptive and reduces maladaptive behaviours, improves communication, social skills and thinking skills in children with autism. Unfortunately, most children with autism in Australia receive insufficient hours of early intervention due in part to lack of government funding. Children may be treated at home or at school, but in general, they benefit from being at school with their peers. The treatment program needs to be individually tailored to the child. The earlier treatment begins, the better the result.Some treatment programs on offer have been shown not to work such as dietary modification, chelation therapy, and treatments which stimulate or desensitise the child's visual, auditory and other senses (sensorimotorintegration therapy).MedicationDrugs have a limited place in treatment though up to a third of children with autism develop epilepsy, which has to be treated with medication. They may need treatment for anxiety or depression and there are effective medications for disruptive and self-injurious behaviours.TopDay-to-day lifeThe condition is hard on parents. They may need specialised services, such as respite and residential care and parent education and skills training can help. About 15 per cent of children can go on to live a fairly normal life especially if the degree of disability is mild to begin with. People with autism spectrum disorder are not physically disabled in the way that, for example, a person with cerebral palsy is, and they live a normal life span. However, there is an increased risk that they might also suffer from other problems with the function of their brain such as epilepsy, Tourette Syndrome (tic disorder), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and some abnormalities of gait and motor skills.TopReviewed by Professor Bruce TongeProfessor Tonge is an academic child and adolescent psychiatrist, who is head of the Centre for Development Psychiatry and chairperson of the Division of Psychiatry at Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne.

Unfortunately, many families may remain in the dark for years before autism is properly diagnosed and treated. Now, however, new research is leading to a greater understanding of the causes and nature of the disorder, which should lead to improved treatment. New information indicates that early diagnosis is key, and that several genes may be involved. Genetic studies along with imaging studies may lead to biologically based diagnostic techniques that could help speed detection and allow early, more effective intervention. He acts aloof and withdrawn, and doesn't understand social cues. An introvert, his parents suspect. He also seems oddly obsessed with highways and recites road-related facts. A quirky little guy, they think. Later, however, a doctor diagnoses the child with autism. Approximately one out of every 250 to 166 babies will develop autism or a related disorder, which can impair a child's ability to interact socially and communicate. The brain disorder affects individuals differently, but all show abnormal responses to other people. Babies with autism also tend to start speaking later than normal, if at all. Those who can communicate may talk a lot about something they really like instead of having a back-and-forth conversation. Key to helping these children is the early detection of their autism, followed by specialized assistance. Once confirmed, several methods may be employed to treat and control the disorder. New research is leading to: A better understanding of the nature of autism and the major role of genetic factors. The development of biologically based diagnostic techniques that could help identify autism earlier, and thus improve treatment. Today, autism cannot be identified biologically with a simple medical test like a brain scan or a blood test. Instead, a diagnosis is made on the basis of behavioral symptoms observed or discussed in the doctor's office. Many children spend their first years of life undiagnosed and untreated. Forty percent of children with autism wait more than three years for a clear diagnosis, according to one survey. Other research indicates that most children are accurately diagnosed by 2 to 4 years of age, but in some cases not until age 6. Researchers believe that reducing the time lag in diagnosis may help children gain the full benefit of available interventions. Although there is no cure, research indicates that many with autism can respond well, especially early in life, to highly structured, specialized education programs designed to correct behaviors, teach social skills, and aid language. The young brain is thought to be particularly adept at modifying its connections and function. Researchers believe that starting interventions early may take advantage of this malleability and improve a person's function. To positively diagnose autism, two components are recommended. One is a \"well child\" check-up that includes a developmental screening test for a range of behaviors involving speech, social skills, and unusual movements. Then, if indicators of autism are found following this screening, a team of experts conducts a comprehensive evaluation. In order to help speed detection and start treatment earlier, scientists recently began to scrutinize the brains of those with autism and uncover specific biological signs of the disorder. Converging evidence from multiple groups of scientists suggests that portions of the autistic brain are actually enlarged in early life. Research continues on the use of medications to treat behavioral disturbances in autism. In other work, scientists hope to gain insight into the roots of the brain changes by studying genes and brain tissue. Our genes control brain development and function. Research suggests that several abnormal genes, including some that may alter brain architecture, likely play a role in autism. While no single gene for autism exists, about five genes recently have been identified as contributing to some cases, suggesting that multiple genetic differences work together to promote the disorder. Genes may interact with environmental factors, which also could play a role. Some of these genes appear to exert their effect at the synapse--the junction where nerve cells communicate with each other. Other work indicates that a gene may be responsible for controlling the number of nerve cells in a structure called the cerebellum that sits at the back of the brain (see illustration) and may contribute to abnormal brain function in autism. Once the genes that increase a person's risk of developing autism are clearly determined, scientists should be able to develop a simple blood test that establishes whether a newborn harbors any of these abnormal genes. Eventually, researchers also may be able to design methods that counter the genes' actions and treat the disorder, further breaking children free from the world of autism. As research moves forward, children with autism will be diagnosed sooner, treated with a greater array of options, and start to connect with peers, parents, and loved ones. Post-mortem studies and recently developed imaging techniques have helped to identify some of the major brain areas implicated in autism. The areas include the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and temporal lobe--particularly the amygdala. The disorder may result from the failure of various parts of the brain to work together.

Also see the separate page on ICD criteria for Atypical Contents ICD-10 Criteria for Childhood Autism F84.0 Childhood Autism Please see our separate note on Treatment, Mental Disorders and Basic Science for important caveats on the role and definition of diagnostic criteria. ICD-10 Criteria for Childhood Autism The following information is reproduced verbatim from the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders, World Health Organization, Geneva, 1992. (Since the WHO updates the overall ICD on a regular basis, individual classifications within it may or may not change from year to year; therefore, you should always check directly with the WHO to be sure of obtaining the latest revision for any particular individual classification.) F84.0 Childhood Autism A pervasive developmental disorder defined by the presence of abnormal and/or impaired development that is manifest before the age of 3 years, and by the characteristic type of abnormal functioning in all three areas of social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive behaviour. The disorder occurs in boys three to four times more often than in girls. Diagnostic Guidelines Usually there is no prior period of unequivocally normal development but, if there is, abnormalities become apparent before the age of 3 years. There are always qualitative impairments in reciprocal social interaction. These take the form of an inadequate appreciation of socio-emotional cues, as shown by a lack of responses to other people's emotions and/or a lack of modulation of behaviour according to social context; poor use of social signals and a weak integration of social, emotional, and communicative behaviours; and, especially, a lack of socio-emotional reciprocity. Similarly, qualitative impairments in communications are universal. These take the form of a lack of social usage of whatever language skills are present; impairment in make-believe and social imitative play; poor synchrony and lack of reciprocity in conversational interchange; poor flexibility in language expression and a relative lack of creativity and fantasy in thought processes; lack of emotional response to other people's verbal and nonverbal overtures; impaired use of variations in cadence or emphasis to reflect communicative modulation; and a similar lack of accompanying gesture to provide emphasis or aid meaning in spoken communication. The condition is also characterized by restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities. These take the form of a tendency to impose rigidity and routine on a wide range of aspects of day-to day functioning; this usually applies to novel activities as well as to familiar habits and play patterns. In early childhood particularly, there may be specific attachment to unusual, typically non-soft objects. The children may insist on the performance of particular routines in rituals of a nonfunctional character; there may be stereotyped preoccupations with interests such as dates, routes or timetables; often there are motor stereotypies; a specific interest in nonfunctional elements of objects (such as their smell or feel) is common; and there may be a resistance to changes in routine or in details of the personal environment (such as the movement of ornaments or furniture in the family home). In addition to these specific diagnostic features, it is frequent for children with autism to show a range of other nonspecific problems such as fear/phobias, sleeping and eating disturbances, temper tantrums, and aggression. Self-injury (e.g. by wrist-biting) is fairly common, especially when there is associated severe mental retardation. Most individuals with autism lack spontaneity, initiative, and creativity in the organization of their leisure time and have difficulty applying conceptualizations in decision-making in work (even when the tasks themselves are well within their capacity). The specific manifestation of deficits characteristic of autism change as the children grow older, but the deficits continue into and through adult life with a broadly similar pattern of problems in socialization, communication, and interest patterns. Developmental abnormalities must have been present in the first 3 years for the diagnosis to be made, but the syndrome can be diagnosed in all age groups. All levels of IQ can occur in association with autism, but there is significant mental retardation in some three-quarters of cases. Includes: autistic disorder infantile autism infantile psychosis Kanner's syndrome Differential Diagnosis Apart from the other varieties of pervasive developmental disorder it is important to consider: specific developmental disorder of receptive language (F80.2) with secondary socio-emotional problems; reactive attachment disorder (F94.1) or disinhibited attachment (F70-F79) with some associated emotional/behavioural disorder; schizophrenia autistic psychopathy (F84.5) ICD-10 copyright 1992 by World Health Organization.

Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disorder. Today autism occurs in 1 out of 92 children. Four out of five are boys. A diagnosis of autism affects the entire family. Statistics suggest that autism is growing at a rate of 10% to 17% per year. At this rate, there will be over 4 million Americans affected in the next decade. The economic costs for a family is overwhelming. Families can spend up to $100,000 per year for a child with autism. Most insurance companies don t cover the cost of early intervention or specialized programs. Children with autism often require 30 to 40 hours of intensive one on one therapy, few families can afford this level of care. The Parker Autism Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization dedicated to serving North Carolina children with autism spectrum disorders and their families. Parents need support emotionally and economically. The Parker Autism Foundation is here to help. Learn more...

Some people with autistic disorder are high functioning, with speech and intelligence intact. Others may be nonverbal and/or mentally retarded. Asperger Disorder Asperger disorder, sometimes referred to as Asperger syndrome, is a neurobiological disorder. In contrast to autistic disorder, individuals with Asperger disorder do not have a delay in spoken language development. However, they can have serious deficits in social and communication skills. They often have obsessive, repetitive routines and preoccupations with a particular subject matter. Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD/NOS) PDD/NOS is a diagnosis often considered for children who show some signs of autistic disorder, but who do not meet the specific diagnostic criteria for the other PDDs. Rett Disorder Rett disorder is a complex neurological disorder that affects mainly girls, but there are reports of males who this disorder. Rett disorder is genetic in origin, and is among the most common genetic cause of profound intellectual and physical disability in girls, occurring more commonly than 1 in 10,000 female births. Individuals with Rett disorder develop normally until 6 to 18 months of age followed by a developmental regression. This regression is followed by a deceleration of head growth, loss of purposeful hand movements and followed by the appearance of midline, stereotypic hand movements. A gene associated with Rett disorder was identified in 1999. Childhood Disintegrative Disorder Children with childhood disintegrative disorder develop normally for a relatively prolonged period (usually 2 to 4 years) before developing a condition that resembles autistic disorder. Typically language, interest in the social environment, and often toileting and self-care abilities are lost, and there may be a general loss of interest in the environment.

I want to help you find out for yourself just how valuable this amazing intervention is and how it can work for your child and your family. What are your most important needs when it comes to managing your life and helping your autistic child? Well, I have spoken to clients and parents in your situation and my situation. Here are some of the answers I have heard. We just want to feel normal again. We want to be able to control and help determine the outcome of our lives! We fear for the future of our child. What will happen to him after we are gone? How will he live? We want to be able to connect with our child but day after day we struggle and often feel like we are losing the battle!! How I Can Help YouAs an RDI\ufffd Program Certified Consultant, I can help you with all of these issues and more! How can I say that so quickly and easily? Because unlike some of the other behavioral modification interventions out there that claim to benefit and to give your child the skills to cope and function in this world, RDI\ufffd is about treating and remedying the CORE and the ROOTS of the autism itself. In RDI\ufffd lingo, these core roots are otherwise known as The Core Deficits of Autism. So let me give a quick tour on how I can help you with your most serious and urgent concerns! Sign up for my Free Autism Fact Sheet Series! First Name: Primary Email Address: What Quality Of Life Will Your Child Have When He Grows Up? One of the most profound questions and concerns that RDI\ufffd addresses is The Quality of Life for Your Child as he/she grows up into adulthood. Dr. Steve Gutstein, founder of RDI\ufffd began asking the hard but pertinent questions such as, What are we preparing these kids for? Yes, now they are two, but what will they look like when they are 12, 22, 32, etc? Are we giving them the life skills that they will need to provide them with a better quality of life? By quality of life he means, is the person able to live independently, hold down a job, have friends and intimate relationships? Unfortunately, if you look at current statistics, we find that the autism field has not been preparing them too well. Most adults on the Spectrum do not live independently, are not able to hold down a job and have very few if any meaningful relationships in their lives apart from their immediate family. RDI\ufffd addresses those quality of life issues that quite frankly no one else is looking at. One of the powerful tools that enable me to look into your child's spectrum is the RDA\ufffd.A Powerful Tool That I Use The RDA\ufffd (Relationship Development Assessment) is one of the very important tools and methods at my disposal. The RDA\ufffd enables me to see where your child has developmentally ?hit the wall? in their social communicative competency and is no longer able to progress on their own. As RDI\ufffd is not a one-size-fits-all type of intervention. Each home program is tailored to target each child?s specific developmental needs. One of the things my clients love about RDI\ufffd is how they feel after developing their new found parenting skills. How does it feel?? IT FEELS GREAT!! because for the first time in your life with your autistic child, it puts you-the parent into the driver?s seat and makes you feel empowered.How and Why RDI\ufffd WorksRDI\ufffd works on many levels. For instance, it works because it teaches your child to become engaged and connected to the real world and real people. There is no rote learning going on, but rather active participation from the child in real life situations. RDI\ufffd provides you and your child with the opportunity to reestablish the core parent/child relationship that did not develop prior to this intervention. And the fact that you have such an opportunity to discover and claim a relationship with your child that you did not have before is just one example of how profoundly gratifying and empowering RDI\ufffd can be. But make no mistake about it. RDI\ufffd is not about gratification, it is about bringing your child into the mainstream, into the social world where we all live. RDI\ufffd is still the single most important intervention we have utilized.? ?After the RDI\ufffd professional we had been working with retired, I was delighted to find Dr. Stacy Goresko to work with us. Her warm manner, sense of humor, flexibility and astute observations made her a good fit for us. As we have worked with her, I have also come to appreciate how much her background in communication gives her greater depth in the field of relationships and communication.? ?I would highly recommend both RDI\ufffd and Dr. Stacy Goresko to any parent who has a child on the autism spectrum, or even a child who has those same kinds of relationship challenges.? Sherrill Strong, LCSW and parent of a child with Asperger?s Syndrome See More What Kind of Skills Do People On The Spectrum Really Need?Teaching academic or trade skills to people on the Spectrum is certainly helpful, however what people on the spectrum really miss are the skills needed to competently function in a social dynamic world. In the following two videos you see a boy who has a great amount of skills. See Video of Child With Skills Playing the Piano. But in the next video you will see the same boy who has no real social communicative competence and is not able to engage with his mother in a spontaneous fashion. See Another Video of the Same Child Disengaged From His Mother Reading To Him. RDI\ufffd is the only treatment program that I am aware of that addresses this critical but missing piece. Another Important RDI\ufffd Process - Guided Participation Another process I use is called ?Guided Participation,? in which I teach you how to interact with your child at a level that is developmentally appropriate. The goal is to find a your child?s ?zone of proximal development? which is just beyond the child?s level of competence. As a RDI\ufffd Program Certified Consultant, I work closely with my clients to make sure we are providing their children with just enough challenge so that optimal learning can take place.You know, I can go on and on telling you why I think that RDI\ufffd is the present and future wave of autism treatment but there is one other thing that I think you will find to be quite gratifying about RDI\ufffd. It's Affordable!! Just how affordable?Why RDI\ufffd Is The Best Autism Intervention Value In Town!Most traditional home-based autism treatment programs can cost anywhere from twenty to forty thousand dollars a year!! (Yes, it costs the same as a year?s college tuition). In most other treatment models you hire people to come into your home and work with you child or you have to drive them to several therapists. At the end of the week or month you owe them a huge amount of money and hope that they are doing a good job. With RDI\ufffd the experience is very different. A year of treatment will only cost you and your family a fraction of that amount of money and this includes a very thorough assessment process, a treatment plan, and weekly consults. What is equally appealing is that you, as the parent, are investing in yourself. The money you are spending on your RDI\ufffd program is going toward right back to yourself as you learn how to become the ?professional? or what I like to call the ?primary treatment provider? for your own child. RDI\ufffd is based as a parent educational consultant model. As a certified consultant, I give you, the parents the skills, tools, education you will need so that you can carry out your own program and learn how to become the ?professional.? The more proficient you become, the better job I have done. So, essentially you are spending your money learning how to provide treatment to your son or daughter. Doesn?t that sound like a smart investment? ?We came to RDI\ufffd after 2 and 1/2 years of implementing a 30+ hour a week home ABA program for our son. The behavioral approach had enabled him to increase his receptive and functional language but we were saddened by his almost complete absence of social communication and a lack of facial expression and eye contact. Soon after switching our focus to developing an RDI\ufffd lifestyle we observed changes in our son: we began enjoying his company more and he started to show interest in us! We are very excited to get to know our son more and more as the years goes by.? ?Stacy's insight into the hope that RDI\ufffd gives is a result of her own extensive training and background and also the successes she has had with her own son. She is non-judgmental and positive in her suggestions and ongoing review of our activities. She helps us to see our son's development as a marathon and not a sprint and to take joy in all of his small steps forward. We feel gently guided by her and not driven to action by feelings of guilt. She has certainly helped us to see that having a positive, loving relationship with our son is the foundation for his future development. RDI\ufffd has really worked in addressing our son's development as a person and we are so grateful to Stacy for her guidance.?Kimberly A Fredenburgh See More How Do I Work With My Clients?Another one of the great things about my RDI\ufffd Autism Services is that I can work with you wherever you live.

The special U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that vaccines could not have caused the autism of an Oregon boy, William Mead, ending his family's quest for reimbursement. \"The Meads believe that thimerosal-containing vaccines caused William's regressive autism. As explained below, the undersigned finds that the Meads have not presented a scientifically sound theory,\" Special Master George Hastings, a former tax claims expert at the Department of Justice, wrote in his ruling. In February 2009, the court ruled against three families who claimed vaccines caused their children's autism, saying they had been \"misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment\". The families sought payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault system that has a $2.5 billion fund built up from a 75-cent-per-dose tax on vaccines. Instead of judges, three \"special masters\" heard the three test cases representing thousands of other petitioners. var adsonar_placementId=\"1425888\",adsonar_pid=\"151757\",adsonar_ps=\"-1\",adsonar_zw=224;adsonar_zh=93,adsonar_jv=\"ads.adsonar.com\"; They asked whether a combination vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, plus a mercury-containing preservative called thimerosal, caused the children's symptoms. MYSTERIOUS CONDITION More than 5,300 cases were filed by parents who believed vaccines may have caused autism in their children. The no-fault payout system is meant to protect vaccine makers from costly lawsuits that drove many out of the vaccine-making business. Autism is a mysterious condition that affects as many as one in 110 U.S. children. The so-called spectrum ranges from mild Asperger's Syndrome to severe mental retardation and social disability, and there is no cure or good treatment. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has reported several times that no link can be found between vaccines and autism. Supporters of the scientific community welcomed the ruling. \"It's time to move forward and look for the real causes of autism,\" said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation. \"There is not a bottomless pit of money with which to fund autism science. We have to use our scarce resources wisely.\" But advocates for the idea that vaccines are dangerous said they would not give up. \"We hope that Congress will intervene in what is clearly a miscarriage of justice to vaccine-injured children,\" said Jim Moody of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety. Autism Speaks, another advocacy group, said it would also not completely abandon the theory that vaccines might cause autism. The organization said it would invest \"in research to determine whether subsets of individuals might be at increased risk for developing autism symptoms following vaccination.\" But the group also said it was clear that if such a link did exist, it would be rare. \"While we have great empathy for all parents of children with autism, it is important to keep in mind that, given the present state of the science, the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement.

Autism is a neurological brain disorder that begins in early childhood, typically within the first three years of life, and persists throughout adulthood. \"Dad and service dog\" Autism affects the areas of the brain controlling language, social interaction, and creative and abstract thinking. Children and adults typically have deficiencies in verbal and non-verbal communications and social interactions. P.D.D. (Pervasive Developmental Disorder) is the umbrella term under which the following specific diagnoses are defined: Autistic Disorder Asperger\ufffd??s Disorder Retts Disorder Childhood Disintegrative Disorder P.D.D Not Otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Each disorder involves a unique complex of symptoms and only a qualified specialist in developmental disorders should evaluate and determine an accurate diagnosis. Opinions differ among researchers and clinicians as to the cause of Autism, some asserting a correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism, while others claim a genetic predisposition. At the present time, we have no conclusive, compelling explanation. \"Training day for dad\" As a \ufffd??spectrum\ufffd?? disorder, autism can present in a wide combination of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe and children can demonstrate any combination in any degree of severity. Contrary to an early belief, children with autism can make eye contact, smile, laugh and demonstrate affection, and in some cases, aggressive or self-injurious behaviors may be present. Mildly affected individuals may exhibit only slight delays in language development and greater challenges with social interaction. People with autism process and respond to information in unique ways. For instance, they might monologue on a favorite subject in spite of efforts by others to interject comments. As with all human beings, autistic individuals have their own distinct personalities, and more important than labels and terminology, is that children with autism can learn and function productively with appropriate education and treatment. <?XML:NAMESPACE PREFIX = O /> How do service dogs help children with autism? Service dogs for autism assist children in several ways: Service dogs provide the child/adult challenged with autism an opportunity to safely access different environments which result in improved communication and social skills. The autism service dog\ufffd??s presence offers a calming influence and provides a sense of security to the child and the parents. Abstract and concrete thinking advance, focus improves, and the length of attention span increases. Emotional outbursts occur less often. The important role of an autism service dog is affording the individual more independence and autonomy, helping those individuals become a viable part of the community at large genetic brain genetic eye contact childhood disintegrative disorder social interaction MMR Leo Kanner PDD-NOS autismservicedogsofamerica.com/autism.cfm diagnoses Autism354 http://www.kansascity.com/2010/03/12/1808139/court-says-thimerosal-did-not.html Court says thimerosal did not cause autism By RANDOLPH E. SCHMIDAP Science Writer More News $(document).ready(function() { replaceRelated(439);}); The vaccine additive thimerosal is not to blame for autism, a special federal court ruled Friday in a long-running battle by parents convinced there is a connection.While expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism.\"Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration,\" special master George Hastings Jr. wrote.But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case.The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court.The parents presented expert witnesses who argued mercury can have a variety of effects on the brain, but the ruling said none of them offered opinions on the cause of autism in the three specific cases argued. They testified that mercury can affect a number of biological processes, including abnormal metabolism in children.Special master Denise K. Vowell noted that in order to succeed in their action, the parents would have to show \"the exquisitely small amounts of mercury\" that reach the brain from vaccines can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts ... from other sources do not. The ruling said the parents were arguing that the effects from mercury in vaccines differ from mercury's known effects on the brain. Vowell concluded that the parents had failed to establish that their child's condition was caused or aggravated by mercury from vaccines.Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines.The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism.The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available.The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had \"already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.\"But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, \"it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them.\"On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children.\"The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,\" Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement.SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling.\"The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology,\" the goup said.

Autism is a developmental disorder that affects the brain. It is a complex condition that mostly impairs communication, social interaction and creative play. People with autism often have problems forming relationships, and interacting with and responding to the world. Signs of autism usually appear in the first three years of life and continue through adulthood. Autism belongs to a wide range of pervasive developmental disorders that include autism, autism spectrum disorders, Asperger's syndrome, and other conditions with similar features. The effect of autism ranges from mild social impairment to severe disability. Who gets Autism? Autism affects about 5 children per 10,000 in Australia. However, there is a concern that autism is being underdiagnosed and that the real rate may be as high as 60 children per 10,000. Males are affected 4 times more commonly than females. Predisposing Factors Autism is a very complex condition and its exact cause is unknown, although research is continuing. Genetics is believed to be the most important risk factor for autism, accounting for 90% of all cases of autism. However, the genetic component of autism is very complex, with multiple different genes involved. There is currently no genetic test available for autism. Other predisposing factors include agents that cause birth defects such as thalidomide and valproic acid, although these are very rare causes. Other identified risk factors include:Increasing maternal or paternal ageLow birth weight Prematurity In the past, there have been numerous other causes of autism suggested. However, there is no scientific basis to these claims. Autism is not caused by bad parenting, allergies, heavy metal poisoning or childhood vaccines. There is no evidence to link the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. Progression Autism is a disorder that first shows signs during infancy or childhood and then follows a steady course without significant lessening or worsening of symptoms. However, the progression does vary greatly between individuals. Although the core communication limitations remain, symptoms often become less severe in later childhood. Some adults with autism show improvement while others show decline. Generally, autistic children with above average intellectual abilities show the most improvement over time. Some areas do not appear to change over time, especially repetitive behaviour (e.g. rocking or spinning a plate) and obsession with order and routine. Autism is often associated with other medical conditions. The conditions that are more common are: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Depression in teenagers Intellectual disability Visual problems Seizures (fits) The rare conditions that are associated with autism include:Obsessive-compulsive disorder Tourette's syndromeFragile X syndrome Bowel infections Tuberous sclerosis One in four children with autism will develop seizures. These usually begin in early childhood, but can start as late as adolescence. The seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. There is usually a short period of unconsciousness, body shakes, unusual movements, or staring spells. Not everyone who has a seizure has epilepsy. Seizures can be treated by a variety of medications that can be discussed with your doctor. Autism can place considerable stress on the family of the child. This can lead to significant psychological problems for the family, such as depression and relationship difficulties.

Yet despite her difficulties, the pupil of Wicklow-based Saplings School is quickly becoming the poster girl for one of the most important breakthroughs in practical autism support services in decades. Since last summer, Grace and her mother Lisa have been using the popular iPhone technology to store pictures of everyday objects. The images, which are carried with the family at all times, are then used by Grace to communicate her needs something she is otherwise unable to do because her condition means she has a significantly reduced vocabulary. In the months that have followed, Grace\ufffds ability to communicate with her family and those around her has drastically improved due to the unprecedented list of images on offer, helping her overcome the more frustrating aspects of her condition. And as a result of the success, Telefonica O2 Ireland and a team of software developers have come together to launch a new iPhone application based on the Domicans\ufffd idea helping to ensure thousands of other children like Grace will benefit from the project. \"She has a little bit of speech but her vocabulary is very small, so having this type of support so easily to hand is very important for us,\" explained Grace\ufffds mother, Lisa. \"The iPhone was very new technology last year, it still is, but this has the potential to take off. At the moment families of children with autism are carrying around the Picture Exchange Communication System. That\ufffds basically a big book with plastic envelopes to put in pictures and their names. \"It\ufffds a good system but it\ufffds not very practical to bring around and it means the child stands out. But with this application you can carry as many images as you want and have them at your fingertips all the time. \"It\ufffds made such a difference to Grace because she can tell me exactly what she wants, which is so important for children with autism. \"She doesn\ufffdt always get what she wants, but there\ufffds a big difference between a frustration tantrum and a \ufffdI didn\ufffdt get my way\ufffd tantrum,\" the mother-of-two added. The \"Grace\" iPhone application which Lisa named after her daughter is available worldwide at a cost of 29.99 for five users. The device\ufffds developers, Telefonica O2 Ireland, the Irish Autism Action group and software expert Steve Troughton-Smith, believe it will prove vital to those affected by allowing each child to store their picture vocabulary before sharing them with their parents, carers and teachers.

This story is adapted from a broadcast audio segment; use audio player to listen to story in its entirety. New studies are often released -- and retracted -- on what causes autism spectrum disorder and what cures it. For example, the British medical journal, \"The Lancet\" recently retracted the frequently cited Wakefield study from 1998 which linked MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccines to autism.Just a few days later, the journal \"Autism Research\" published a study that said advanced maternal and paternal age is a risk factor for autism. So what does the latest data really say about autism causes and cures?Dr. Perri Klass and Dr. Eileen Costello are pediatricians and co-authors of \"Quirky Kids: Understanding and Helping Your Child Who Doesn't Fit In -- When to Worry and When Not to Worry.\" They've spent a good deal of time looking into what distinguishes autism facts from autism fiction.Autism is complicated because it encompasses an entire \"spectrum\" of behaviors and levels of function, according to Dr. Klass. \"That's kind of new. That wasn't around when I was in medical school, let alone when I was a child,\" she said.The behaviors can include difficulty with social cues and communication, repetitive acts and obsessional interests, among other things.In terms of the supposed causes of autism, vaccines are no longer on the list. This is something Dr. Costello is happy to see.\"I think the Wakefield study ... really caused a lot of fear and panic around the world, and caused a lot of parents to have anxiety about immunizing their children,\" she said. \"And it's a real blessing that the paper was retracted.\" What can cause autism are viruses, like influenza and herpes, that can affect pregnant women; as well as parental age. \"There is growing data that advanced parental age is a factor,\" said Costello.For autistic children, says Klass, behavior therapies can be more effective than looking for a cure in special diets and/or vitamin dosing. Costello confirmed this on a blog post for \"The Takeaway\": \"Although the autistic disorders are generally considered lifelong conditions, many children with mild symptoms to begin with will make significant progress with intensive behavioral therapies, the only approach to date with evidence to support it.\" \"That urge to get children looked at and diagnosed earlier rather than later, and get them help early, is where a lot of our attention and efforts should be going,\" said Klass.Read more of Costello's thoughts in \"The Top Five Autism Myths.\" \"The Takeaway\" is a national morning news program, delivering the news and analysis you need to catch up, start your day, and prepare for what s ahead.

Dr Fauziah consultant Dr Fauziah Zainal Abidin said even though such cases were minor in Malaysia, more awareness programme should be held for the community to rehabilitate these children. Fauziah said parents could easily identify whether their children are autistic when they are two years old. Boys are four times more likely to be autistic than girls. \ufffdThere is no medical detection or cure for autism, but early diagnosis and intervention could improve the life of the sufferer. We cannot cure autism completely but we can try to rehabilitate or modify the behaviour and learning skills. \ufffdRehabilitation should be done at the beginning between zero and six years old before they enter school. The teachers and tutors who handle these children should be trained well to control them in class and gain their attention to learning. \ufffdAutism is a lifelong disability. The parents could identify the symptoms from their children\ufffds emotions via facial gestures. They dislike jokes or mix with other people and show destructive behaviour. They problems using the toilet, feeding, and sleeping. They may also show extraordinary ability in mathematics and mechanical skills,\ufffd she said during an autism awareness talk and workshop at Marco Polo Hotel here yesterday. According to her, autism is related to genetics and never related to immunisation. The occurrence of ASD varies from child to child, from time to time, and in severity and manner. The four warning signs of autism are: children fail to make eye contact; cannot respond when their names are called; unable to make their needs known by pointing; and failing to imitate early actions (facial gestures). The diagnostic tools are \ufffdDiagnostic Interviews for Social and Communication Disorder\ufffd (DISCO), \ufffdAutism (ADI-R) and \ufffdAutism Diagnose Observation Schedule\ufffd (ADO-S). Fauziah also pointed out that even normal kids nowadays are weak in speaking properly as they watch too much television at home. Kids who are looked after by maids tend to watch television more than two hours each day. It tends to impair their speech. On the other hand, children who are cared for by grandmothers or grandfathers are more interactive.

While expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism. \"Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration,\" special master George Hastings Jr. wrote. But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case. The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court. The parents presented expert witnesses who argued mercury can have a variety of effects on the brain, but the ruling said none of them offered opinions on the cause of autism in the three specific cases argued. They testified that mercury can affect a number of biological processes, including abnormal metabolism in children. Special master Denise K. Vowell noted that in order to succeed in their action, the parents would have to show \"the exquisitely small amounts of mercury\" that reach the brain from vaccines can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts ... from other sources do not. The ruling said the parents were arguing that the effects from mercury in vaccines differ from mercury's known effects on the brain. Vowell concluded that the parents had failed to establish that their child's condition was caused or aggravated by mercury from vaccines. Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines. The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism. The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available. The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had \"already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.\" But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, \"it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them.\" On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. \"The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,\" Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement. SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling. \"The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology,\" the goup said. The advocacy group Autism Speaks said \"the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases.\" However, while research has found no overall connection between autism and vaccines, the group said it would back research to determine if some individuals might be at increased risk because of genetic or medical conditions. Meanwhile, in reaction to the concerns of parents, thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines in the United States. In Friday's action the court ruled in three different cases, each concluding that the preservative has no connection to autism. The trio of rulings can offer reassurance to parents scared about vaccinating their babies because of a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, are on the rise. The U.S. Court of Claims is different from many other courts: The families involved didn't have to prove the inoculations definitely caused the complex neurological disorder, just that they probably did. More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation through the government's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the rulings dealt with test cases to settle which if any claims had merit. Autism is best known for impairing a child's ability to communicate and interact. Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it's unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosis. Worry about a vaccine link first arose in 1998 when a British physician, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published a medical journal article linking a particular type of autism and bowel disease to the measles vaccine. The study was later discredited. Copyright 2010 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

ASDs include autistic disorder, \"pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" /> New data suggests that approximately 1 in 110 children have an ASD*. There is currently no cure for ASDs, however, children with an ASD can progress developmentally and learn new skills. The AAP strongly believes in the importance of early and continuous surveillance and screening for ASD to ensure that children are identified and receive access to services as early as possible. The sooner an ASD is identified, the sooner an intervention program can start. Scientific understanding of the cause of autism is far from complete. The AAP strongly supports ongoing studies funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health that are trying to get to the factors in our modern environment that may be responsible for autism. *MMWR Surveillance Summaries.

The definition of autism and related disorders, referred to collectively as autism spectrum disorder, is one of deep and continuing importance. It affects the public's perception, our own perceptions, insurance, funding levels, research efforts, diagnosis, and the care and treatment of our children. Definitions have always been the means by which we construct and analyze reality. As J. L. Austin points out, \"Language is equivalent to action.\" There are any number of definitions dealing with autism and autism spectrum disorder. Some like the DSM-IV run to several pages, with a menu list of options. Others are more concise. All share a common element. They all define autism as a disorder. The accepted definition of autism as a disorder can be traced to its origins, now discredited, as a psychiatric condition. A number of nearly invisible, domino-like side effects further compound the problem once disorder is accepted. A common practice in the field of psychiatry is a pair-wise noun/adjective labeling of condition and patient, such as schizophrenia/schizophrenic, psychosis/psychotic, and autism/autistic. Of course implicit in this noun/adjective pairing is a life-long condition. Explicit is the understanding that the child is the disorder. Autism defined as a disorder coupled with the implicit life-long adjective autistic speaks to its fictive roots revealing more about the meaning-makers than the illness. Acceptance frames our expectations. It is self-limiting. Autism has been forced into this Procrustean position as a consequence of antiquated, inherited language rather than of sound science. Life-long disorders are recognized, accepted, coped with, and managed. Diseases are detected, prevented, treated, and cured. Diseases are fought, disorders are tolerated. A disorder means out of order. A noise word \ufffd?? gobbledygook, jargon, coloring our thinking and downplaying the problem. One of our goals as parents is to educate as well as enlist the aid of the public. Communication is understood by what we encounter based on shared contexts and experiences. Who has ever experienced a disorder? The public's perception of autism is framed for failure. The public is mystified by autism because disorder perpetuates the mystery. Autism is a disease, where a disease is \"a pathological condition of a part, organ, or system of an organism resulting from various causes, such as infection, genetic defect, or environmental stress, and characterized by an identifiable group of signs or symptoms.\" genetic genetic gastrointestinal DSM-IV J.

The photographer at Sears didn't even have to joke with him to get him to grin for a family photo, recalls his father, Jeff Ransom, of Fort Oglethorpe. But soon after he reached 15 months, Benjamin seemed to change into a different child. He ceased smiling and avoided eye contact. His speech reverted from clear words into baby babble, and finally he stopped talking altogether, Mr. Ransom said. \"He just had a blank stare on his face,\" he said. After a year of failed speech therapy, Benjamin -- who is now 10 -- was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, an increasingly common diagnosis characterized by a difficulty in verbal and nonverbal communication and social interactions. Severity can range from very mild to debilitating. But despite medical evidence to the contrary, Mr. Ransom is convinced that a series of recommended vaccines his son received at 15 months -- including protection against measles, mumps and rubella, and Hib meningitis -- prompted the sudden change in his son, who stopped talking in the weeks following his vaccination. \"You're not going to convince me vaccines did not change my child,\" Mr. Ransom said. \"I saw it.\" PDF: IOM report on autism, vaccines EARLY SIGNS OF AUTISM * Lack or delay in spoken language * Repetitive use of language and/or motor mannerisms, e.g., hand-flapping, twirling objects * Little or no eye contact * Lack of interest in peer relationships * Lack of spontaneous or make-believe play * Persistent fixation on parts of objects Source: Autism Society of America LOCAL RESOURCES * Team Centers: 423-622-0500 * Siskin Children's 615-385-2077 * Orange Grove Center: 423-629-1451 CONFLICTING STUDIES Those who maintain there is a link between vaccines and autism often cite research by Dr. Mark Geier and his son David. But the Institute of Medicine has said those studies were flawed. The Geiers, who spoke in Chattanooga last year at an event organized by the Complementary Health Education Organizations, have done a number of studies analyzing data in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They claimed to have found a higher risk for complaints related to autism among children who received a thimserosal-containing vaccine. The Institute of Medicine, which analyzed research on the issue, wrote that the Geier studies have \"serious methodological flaws and their analytic methods were nontransparent, making their results uninterpretable.\" The American Academy of Pediatrics, in its critique of a 2003 Geier study, has said that reliance on this reporting system, in which most complaints are voluntary and reporting is inconsistent, is invalid. The debate over the connection between autism and vaccines, particularly those that contain thimerosal -- a preservative that contains mercury -- has been fueled by the alarming rise in the number of children diagnosed with the condition and the proliferation of Web sites, often led by advocacy groups for parents of children with autism, that argue vaccines cause autism, experts say. About one in every 110 children now has a form of autism spectrum disorder, according to the most recent estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts are struggling to tamp down fears they say are without scientific basis. They point out that symptoms of autism tend to emerge in the second year of life, regardless of vaccine status. Physicians also worry that parents refusing to vaccinate their children are opening the door to a resurgence of diseases, from polio to whooping cough, that had been virtually wiped out by the country's robust vaccination program. Outbreaks of measles and pertussis, or whooping cough, and Hib meningitis have been linked to parents refusing or delaying vaccination of their children, experts say. \"We definitely see the consequences of choosing not to vaccinate. That's why we take it so seriously,\" said Dr. Kelly Moore, medical director of the immunization program with the Tennessee Department of Health. NEED FOR EXPLANATION The vaccine-autism controversy has been brewing for years. This fall, the U.S. Supreme Court will take up a case to determine whether vaccine manufacturers can be sued by parents who allege their children were harmed by vaccines, The Associated Press reported. Frequently these kinds of cases involve autism, according to the AP. A special federal court ruled Friday that thimerosal is not to blame for autism, the AP reported. The court concluded the Oregon-based parents who filed the suit had failed to show a connection between the preservative and their son's autism. The ruling came in a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. For almost a decade, all recommended routine vaccines in the U.S., except some influenza shots, have been free of thimerosal. A study largely seen as the launch pad for fears over the vaccine-autism connection -- published in 1998 in the British medical journal Lancet -- was retracted last month for being flawed. The study's author claimed that leakage of the measles disease from the measles-mumps-rubella vaccines, which became standard in the mid-1980s, could cause autism. The MMR vaccine has never contained thimerosal. The vaccine-autism theory has taken such a deep hold in part because of the human desire to understand, said Dr. Leslie Rubin, pediatric developmental specialist with Team Centers, a private, nonprofit agency in Chattanooga serving people with developmental disabilities. Even before the MMR vaccine became standard in the mid-'80s, Dr. Rubin said he regularly met with parents searching answers for their child's sudden onset of autism symptoms around 18 months of age, a \"classic\" pattern in autism. Parents would say that they had recently moved or had another baby as a possible explanation for their child's condition, he recalled. \"We as human beings need explanations,\" he said. \"You can see how you can link it with something real, something tangible.\" PARENTS FEARFUL Despite the broad medical consensus that no credible scientific evidence has linked vaccines and autism, a significant number of parents are harboring fear and distrust of vaccines. About 11 percent of parents surveyed in 2009 said they had declined to give their child or children at least one recommended vaccine, according to the study published in the March 1 edition of the journal Pediatrics. Local doctors say they are encountering parents who are refusing or delaying recommended vaccinations for their children. Chattanooga pediatrician Dr. Peter Rawlings said he has had to stop seeing some patients whose parents refuse to get them vaccinated because he doesn't feel comfortable being complicit with what he feels could be termed child neglect. These parents are counting on the immunity of the general population that has been vaccinated to protect their children from these dangerous illnesses, he said. \"That's literally what a lot of these families are banking on, that there's enough herd immunity that they don't have to give it to their child,\" he said. But as more parents decide to forgo recommended vaccines that herd immunity breaks down, he said. Immune-compromised children who can't be vaccinated -- such as children with leukemia -- are then at greater risk of contracting a disease such as measles which, especially for them, could be deadly, experts say. \"Science is all over Internet\" Health officials emphasize that a litany of scientific data has found no causal link between autism and vaccines. In 2004, an Institute of Medicine committee released a report with that conclusion, citing five large epidemiological studies -- in the United States, United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden since 2001 -- that found no association between vaccines containing thimerosal or the MMR vaccine and autism. But some advocacy groups maintain that public health officials are conspiring to gloss over valid scientific evidence of real links between vaccines and autism, pointing to research compiled by advocacy groups and online publications such as Age of Autism and the Coalition for Safe Minds, which have helped unite a network of parents in an anti-vaccine campaign. \"The science is all over the Internet. It's just you're not getting it through the health department,\" said Tami Freedman, a board member of the Chattanooga chapter of the Complementary Health Education Organization, a nonprofit focused on natural health care as a means to improve health. Dr. Moore said part of the reason the fear of vaccines has taken such a hold is the proliferation of information on the Internet that can fuel a parent's search for answers to a highly mysterious condition. \"There is no filter on the Internet. Anyone can post anything,\" she said. \"The concern that I have is that people can make well-informed decisions and you make that by knowing the facts and not just the rumors.\" ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS Experts attribute the rise in diagnoses of autism at least in part to a broad expansion of the definition of autism to include individuals who might otherwise have been diagnosed with another condition such as Down syndrome. On the other end of the spectrum, those with Asperger's syndrome, a type of autism spectrum disorder, in the past may have been considered just eccentric. Staff Photo by Angela Lewis/Chattanooga Times Free Press Jeff Ransom plays with his son, Benjamin Ransom, in his business, Ben's Storage. Mr. Ransom says that Benjamin was developing normally until he was 15 months old, and after receiving vaccines, he developed symptoms of autism. Dr. Rubin said there is also an urgent need for research that explores the effect of environmental toxins that have become pervasive since the Industrial Revolution. For example, prenatal exposure to phthalates, which can be found in perfumes, make-up and nail polish, has been associated with behavioral and attention problems in children, according to a study published this year in Environmental Health Perspectives. \"Here is where the truth may lie,\" Dr. Rubin said. \"That's where we can all lobby the government to say, 'You know what? There are a lot of toxins causing harm to ourselves, our children, unborn babies, to the future of mankind, and we've got to begin to understand what these toxins can do.' That's where I'm fully into support of these kinds of advocacy groups.\" Mr. Ransom's son Ben now istalking and enrolled in mainstream public school classes, but he still requires speech and occupational therapy, his father said. Mr. Ransom said he will never stop believing vaccines changed his child. \"I went into a pediatrician's office, and I held my child down and let them give him a brain injury,\" Mr. Ransom said. Dr. Moore said she wants to emphasize to parents that they don't need to feel culpable for their child's autism. \"It is a very difficult situation, and I think what makes me most sad is that the parents believe this is something they did by letting their child be vaccinated. ... There's no reason to feel that kind of guilt because it wasn't something that they did,\" she said. pointing brain U.S. eye contact Internet United States MMR Institute of Medicine United Kingdom Geier Moore Sweden down syndrome U.S. Court of Federal Claims David British American Academy of Pediatrics Lancet AP Ben Denmark Pediatrics U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Mark Geier Associated Press Source: Sears Environmental Health Perspectives Coalition for Safe Minds Benjamin Ransom Jeff Ransom Fort Oglethorpe Benjamin Ransom Hib Autism Society of America LOCAL RESOURCES Team Centers: Siskin Children Institute: Autism Society of Middle Tennessee: Orange Grove Center: Chattanooga Complementary Health Education Organizations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System Kelly Moore Tennessee Department of Health EXPLANATION U.S. Supreme Court Oregon-based Leslie Rubin Team Centers Rubin Peter Rawlings Tami Freedman Complementary Health Education Organization Staff Photo Angela Lewis/Chattanooga Times Free Press Industrial Revolution 423-622-0500 siskin.org diagnoses occupational therapy Autism368 http://www.ojibwatea.com/autism.htm Back to Autism Questions ^ What are the Most Effective Approaches to Autism? Evidence shows that early intervention results in dramatically positive outcomes for young children with autism. While various pre-school models emphasize different program components, all share an emphasis on early, appropriate, and intensive educational interventions for young children. Other common factors may be: some degree of inclusion, mostly behaviorally-based interventions, programs which build on the interests of the child, extensive use of visuals to accompany instruction, highly structured schedule of activities, parent and staff training, transition planning and follow-up. Because of the spectrum nature of autism and the many behavior combinations which can occur, no one approach is effective in alleviating symptoms of autism in all cases. Various types of therapies are available, including (but not limited to) applied behavior analysis, auditory integration training, dietary interventions, discrete trial teaching, medications, music therapy, occupational therapy, PECS, physical therapy, sensory integration, speech/language therapy, TEACCH, and vision therapy. Studies show that individuals with autism respond well to a highly structured, specialized education program, tailored to their individual needs. A well designed intervention approach may include some elements of communication therapy, social skill development, sensory integration therapy and applied behavior analysis, delivered by trained professionals in a consistent, comprehensive and coordinated manner. The more severe challenges of some children with autism may be best addressed by a structured education and behavior program which contains a one-on-one teacher to student ratio or small group environment. However, many other children with autism may be successful in a fully inclusive general education environment with appropriate support. In addition to appropriate educational supports in the area of academics, students with autism should have training in functional living skills at the earliest possible age. Learning to cross a street safely, to make a simple purchase or to ask assistance when needed are critical skills, and may be difficult, even for those with average intelligence levels. Tasks that enhance the person's independence and give more opportunity for personal choice and freedom in the community are important. To be effective, any approach should be flexible in nature, rely on positive reinforcement, be re-evaluated on a regular basis and provide a smooth transition from home to school to community environments. A good program will also incorporate training and support systems for parents and caregivers, with generalization of skills to all settings. Rarely can a family, classroom teacher or other caregiver provide effective habilitation for a person with autism unless offered consultation or in-service training by an experienced specialist who is knowledgeable about the disability. A generation ago, the vast majority of the people with autism were eventually placed in institutions. Professionals were much less educated about autism than they are today; autism specific supports and services were largely non-existent. Today the picture is brighter. With appropriate services, training, and information, most families are able to support their son or daughter at home. Group homes, assisted apartment living arrangements, or residential facilities offer more options for out of home support. Autism-specific programs and services provide the opportunity for individuals to be taught skills which allow them to reach their fullest potential. Families of people with autism can experience high levels of stress. As a result of the challenging behaviors of their children, relationships with service providers, attempting to secure appropriate services, resulting financial hardships, or very busy schedules, families often have difficulty participating in typical community activities. This results in isolation and difficulty in developing needed community supports. Members of the ASA represent all walks of life from rural to metropolitan communities. Embracing the diversity of our group, the ASA seeks to provide an open forum for the exchange of ideas. At the very core of the ASA's philosophy is the belief that no single program or treatment will benefit all individuals with autism. Furthermore, the recommendation of what is \"best\" or \"most effective\" for a person with autism should be determined by those people directly involved?the individual with autism, to the extent possible, and the parents or family members. The ASA provides information to assist parents, educators, and others in the decision-making process. Providing information on available intervention options, rather than advocating for any particular theory or philosophy, is the focus at the ASA. Back to Autism Questions ^ Is There a Cure for Autism? Understanding of autism has grown tremendously since it was first described by Dr. Leo Kanner in 1943. Some of the earlier searches for \"cures\" now seem unrealistic in terms of today's understanding of brain-based disorders. To cure means \"to restore to health, soundness, or normality.\" In the medical sense, there is no cure for the differences in the brain which result in autism. However, better understanding of the disorder has led to the development of better coping mechanisms and strategies for the various manifestations of the disability. Some of these symptoms may lessen as the child ages; others may disappear altogether. With appropriate intervention, many of the associated behaviors can be positively changed, even to the point in some cases, that the child or adult may appear to the untrained person to no longer have autism. The majority of children and adults will, however, continue to exhibit some manifestations of autism to some degree throughout their entire lives. Back to Autism Questions ^ What is the Autism Society of America? Founded in 1965 by a small group of parents, the Autism Society of America (ASA) continues to be the leading source of information and referral on autism and the largest collective voice representing the autism community for more than 33 years. Today, more than 24,000 members are connected through a volunteer network of over 200 chapters across the United States. The mission of the Autism Society of America is to promote lifelong access and opportunities for persons within the autism spectrum and their families, to be fully included, participating members of their communities through advocacy, public awareness, education, and research related to autism. In addition to its volunteer Board of Directors, composed primarily of parents of individuals with autism, the ASA has a Panel of Professional Advisors, comprised of nationally known and respected professionals who provide expertise and guidance to the Society on a volunteer basis. The ASA is dedicated to increasing public awareness about autism and the day-to-day issues faced by individuals with autism, their families, and the professionals with whom they interact. The Society and its chapters share common goals of providing information and education, supporting research, and advocating for programs and services for the autism community. Back to Autism Questions ^ The Autism Society of America Foundation The Autism Society of America Foundation (ASAF) (new tab/window) was founded with the primary mission to raise and allocate funds for research to address the many unanswered questions about autism. We are still far from fully understanding autism and knowing how to prevent it. The ASAF has implemented action on several pressing autism research priorities as areas of initial focus: developing and publicizing up-to-date prevalence statistics; quantifying the societal and family economic consequences of autism; developing a national registry of individuals and families with autism who are willing to participate in research studies; and implementing a system to identify potential donors of autism brain tissue for research purposes and facilitating the donation process. In addition, the Foundation is contributing substantial funds for applied and biomedical research in the causes of and treatment approaches to autism.

Autism is a disorder of the brain. Symptoms of autism occur during the first three years of life, although an individual might not receive a diagnosis until much later. Individuals with autism have problems with communication and socializing with others. In young children, autism affects the development of ?typical? play behaviors. Autism is considered a developmental disorder in that some normal developmental milestones, such as when a child says their first words, are absent or abnormal. Autism is considered a pervasive developmental disorder in that these developmental differences affect many aspects of life and may last throughout a person's lifetime. Currently, there is no one specifically known cause of autism and no one treatment. Early special education programs using behavioral methods have proven to be the most helpful treatment for persons with autism. Frequently Asked Questions About Autism Q: How common is autism? A: Current research indicates that as many as 1 in 166 individuals have an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Males are four times more likely than females to have an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Q: What is an Autism Spectrum Disorder ? A: Three conditions that have similar symptoms but differ in terms of how severe they are and how they are expressed are sometimes called Autism Spectrum Disorders. There are different ways in which the hallmark characteristics of autism, most particularly within the social interaction area, are expressed. Many people do not exhibit all of the criteria for a diagnosis of autism but their characteristics are best described as fitting within the spectrum of autism. Autism spectrum disorders are generally considered to be: Autism: an individual shows 6 or more of 12 symptoms across three main areas, communication, social interaction and restricted activity/interests Asperger's Disorder or Syndrome: a form of autism where the individual is typically verbal and has a normal or above normal IQ , but exhibits problems with social skills and social use of language Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified or PDD-NOS: those who do not meet the full criteria for autism but display similar behaviors Q: How do I know if a person has autism? A: Unfortunately, there is no medical test that can be done to show that an individual has autism. Autism can be diagnosed by observing the person and looking at how they communicate and relate to others. A few of the behaviors that a diagnostician may look for include making eye contact with a person who is talking to them, showing interest in what other people are doing and engaging in play with others (if the individual is young). Difficulty in relating to people is a hallmark symptom of autism (see ?red flags? below). Q: What are the red flags of autism? A: Early Indicators or ?Red Flags? of Autism in Children Three and Under Currently, the criteria used to diagnose autism (The Diagnostic Statistical Manual ?IV ? TR) are designed for 3-year-olds. However, recent research has shown that certain behaviors in children younger than 3 may indicate a higher risk for developing autism. No single behavior or factor indicates a child may have autism but the presence of several symptoms could be cause for concern. Parents should watch for the following: Possible symptoms at 6 months: Not making eye contact with parents during interaction Not cooing or babbling Not smiling when parents smile Not participating in vocal turn-taking (baby makes a sound, adult makes a sound, and so forth) Not responding to peek-a-boo game At 14 months: No attempts to speak Not pointing, waving or grasping No response when name is called Indifferent to others Repetitive body motions such as rocking or hand flapping Fixation on a single object Oversensitivity to textures, smells, sounds Strong resistance to change in routine Any loss of language At 24 months: Does not initiate two-word phrases (that is, doesn't just echo words) Any loss of words or developmental skill (Source: Rebecca Landa , Center for Autism and Related Disorders at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore) Additional information on early signs of autism Q: Who can diagnose autism? Autism can be diagnosed by a medical doctor or a licensed psychologist. If a parent is concerned about the communication and social development of their child, they may see their general pediatrician or family doctor first. Frequently, the family will then be referred to a specialist who has specific experience with autism and other developmental disorders. This may be a developmental pediatrician, neurologist, psychiatrist or clinical psychologist with experience in the area of autism. Q: What types of assessments will be conducted during the diagnosis? A: There are several assessments that can be done to diagnose autism. Usually a diagnostician will conduct a structured observation period to observe the individual. The diagnostician may ask the individual to respond to several activities as they look for specific behaviors. A structured interview also may be conducted with parents or guardians. Structured interviews provide the diagnostician with information about the individual's past behavior and their behavior at home, school and in the community. A speech evaluation and/or psychological evaluation may be conducted during the diagnostic evaluation. Q: What should I do once an individual is diagnosed with autism? A: Once an individual has been diagnosed with autism it is important to begin intervention as early as possible. Early intervention usually focuses on intense skill building. Skills that are learned easily by typically developing persons can be difficult for someone with autism. For example, individuals with autism have difficulty understanding social cues and may need to be taught to pay attention to others, play with others and communicate with others. Many skills must be broken down into smaller components and taught systematically. Early intervention, preschool, school programs and behavioral health centers are available to provide intervention. In addition, in West Virginia , a family can contact the WVATC and receive services. The WVATC works closely with families, school system personnel and behavioral health centers to develop and implement intervention that is designed specifically for the individual with autism. pointing brain eye contact babbling social interaction Kennedy Krieger Institute Pervasive Developmental Autism: West Virginia Diagnostic Statistical Manual Rebecca Landa Center for Autism and Related Disorders Baltimore WVATC www.marshall.edu/coe/atc/autism.htm Autism37 http://www.healthnewsflash.com/conditions/autism.htm Introduction Understanding the Problem What is autism?

Keeping on Top of Your Condition Resources Sponsored Links Common Misspellings: autisim, autisum Autism Isolated in worlds of their own, people with autism appear indifferent and remote and are unable to form emotional bonds with others. Although people with this baffling brain disorder can display a wide range of symptoms and disability, many are incapable of understanding other people's thoughts, feelings, and needs. Often, language and intelligence fail to develop fully, making communication and social relationships difficult. Many people with autism engage in repetitive activities, like rocking or banging their heads, or rigidly following familiar patterns in their everyday routines. Some are painfully sensitive to sound, touch, sight, or smell. Children with autism do not follow the typical patterns of child development. In some children, hints of future problems may be apparent from birth. In most cases, the problems become more noticeable as the child slips farther behind other children the same age. Other children start off well enough. But between 18 and 36 months old, they suddenly reject people, act strangely, and lose language and social skills they had already acquired. As a parent, teacher, or caregiver you may know the frustration of trying to communicate and connect with children or adults who have autism. You may feel ignored as they engage in endlessly repetitive behaviors. You may despair at the bizarre ways they express their inner needs. And you may feel sorrow that your hopes and dreams for them may never materialize. But there is help-and hope. Gone are the days when people with autism were isolated, typically sent away to institutions. Today, many youngsters can be helped to attend school with other children. Methods are available to help improve their social, language, and academic skills. Even though more than 60 percent of adults with autism continue to need care throughout their lives, some programs are beginning to demonstrate that with appropriate support, many people with autism can be trained to do meaningful work and participate in the life of the community. Autism is found in every country and region of the world, and in families of all racial, ethnic, religious, and economic backgrounds. Emerging in childhood, it affects about 1 or 2 people in every thousand and is three to four times more common in boys than girls. Girls with the disorder, however, tend to have more severe symptoms and lower intelligence. In addition to loss of personal potential, the cost of health and educational services to those affected exceeds $3 billion each year. So, at some level, autism affects us all. The individuals referred to in this brochure are not real, but their stories are based on interviews with parents who have children with autism. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Understanding the Problem Paul Paul has always been obsessed with order. As a child, he lined up blocks, straightened chairs, kept his toothbrush in the exact same spot on the sink, and threw a tantrum when anything was moved. Paul could also become aggressive. Sometimes, when upset or anxious, he would suddenly explode, throwing a nearby object or smashing a window. When overwhelmed by noise and confusion, he bit himself or picked at his nails until they bled. At school, where his schedule and environment could be carefully structured, his behavior was more normal. But at home, amid the unpredictable, noisy hubbub of a large family, he was often out of control. His behavior made it harder and harder for his parents to care for him at home and also meet their other children's needs. At that time-more than 10 years ago-much less was known about the disorder and few therapeutic options were available. So, at age 9, his parents placed him in a residential program where he could receive 24-hour supervision and care. Alan As an infant, Alan was playful and affectionate. At 6 months old, he could sit up and crawl. He began to walk and say words at 10 months and could count by 13 months. One day, in his 18th month, his mother found him sitting alone in the kitchen, repeatedly spinning the wheels of her vacuum cleaner with such persistence and concentration, he didn't respond when she called. From that day on, she recalls, \"It was as if someone had pulled a shade over him.\" He stopped talking and relating to others. He often tore around the house like a demon. He became fixated on electric lights, running around the house turning them on and off. When made to stop, he threw a tantrum, kicking and biting anyone within reach. Janie From the day she was born, Janie seemed different from other infants. At an age when most infants enjoy interacting with people and exploring their environment, Janie sat motionless in her crib and didn't respond to rattles or other toys. She didn't seem to develop in the normal sequence, either. She stood up before she crawled, and when she began to walk, it was on her toes. By 30 months old, she still wasn't talking. Instead, she grabbed things or screamed to get what she wanted. She also seemed to have immense powers of concentration, sitting for hours looking at a toy in her hand. When Janie was brought to a special clinic for evaluation, she spent an entire testing session pulling tufts of wool from the psychologist's sweater. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top What is Autism? Autism is a brain disorder that typically affects a person's ability to communicate, form relationships with others, and respond appropriately to the environment. Some people with autism are relatively high-functioning, with speech and intelligence intact. Others are mentally retarded, mute, or have serious language delays. For some, autism makes them seem closed off and shut down; others seem locked into repetitive behaviors and rigid patterns of thinking. Although people with autism do not have exactly the same symptoms and deficits, they tend to share certain social, communication, motor, and sensory problems that affect their behavior in predictable ways. Difference in the Behaviors of Infants With and Without Autism Infants with Autism Normal Infants Communication Avoid eye contact Seem deaf Start developing language, then abruptly stop talking altogether Study mother's face Easily stimulated by sounds Keep adding to vocabulary and expanding grammatical usage Social relationships Act as if unaware of the coming and going of others Physically attack and injure others without provocation Inaccessible, as if in a shell Cry when mother leaves the room and are anxious with strangers Get upset when hungry or frustrated Recognize familiar faces and smile Exploration of environment Remain fixated on a single item or activity Practice strange actions like rocking or hand-flapping Sniff or lick toys Show no sensitivity to burns or bruises, and engage in self-mutilation, such as eye gouging Move from one engrossing object or activity to another Use body purposefully to reach or acquire objects Explore and play with toys Seek pleasure and avoid pain NOTE: This list is not intended to be used to assess whether a particular person has child autism. Diagnosis should only be done by a specialist using highly detailed background information and behavioral observations. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Social symptoms From the start, most infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, endearingly grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most children with autism seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention and affection or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to anger or affection. Unlike other children, they rarely become upset when the parent leaves or show pleasure when the parent returns. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of response. Children with autism also take longer to learn to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues-whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace-may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, \"Come here,\" always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or squinting and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with autism have problems seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with autism may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. Some people with autism also tend to be physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. Some lose control, particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They are capable at times of breaking things, attacking others, or harming themselves. Alan, for example, may fall into a rage, biting and kicking when he is frustrated or angry. Paul, when tense or overwhelmed, may break a window or throw things. Others are self-destructive, banging their heads, pulling their hair, or biting their arms. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Language difficulties By age 3, most children have passed several predictable milestones on the path to learning language. One of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it very clear that his answer is no. By age 2, most children begin to put together sentences like \"See doggie,\" or \"More cookie,\" and can follow simple directions. Research shows that about half of the children diagnosed with autism remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of autism do coo and babble during the first 6 months of life. But they soon stop. Although they may learn to communicate using sign language or special electronic equipment, they may never speak. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 8. Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. Some seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words. Others repeat the same phrase no matter what the situation. Some children with autism are only able to parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Without persistent training, echoing other people's phrases may be the only language that people with autism ever acquire. What they repeat might be a question they were just asked, or an advertisement on television. Or out of the blue, a child may shout, \"Stay on your own side of the road!\"-something he heard his father say weeks before. Although children without autism go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3. People with autism also tend to confuse pronouns. They fail to grasp that words like \"my,\" \"I,\" and \"you,\" change meaning depending on who is speaking. When Alan's teacher asks, \"What is my name?\" he answers, \"My name is Alan.\" Some children say the same phrase in a variety of different situations. One child, for example, says \"Get in the car,\" at random times throughout the day. While on the surface, her statement seems bizarre, there may be a meaningful pattern in what the child says. The child may be saying, \"Get in the car,\" whenever she wants to go outdoors. In her own mind, she's associated \"Get in the car,\" with leaving the house. Another child, who says \"Milk and cookies\" whenever he is pleased, may be associating his good feelings around this treat with other things that give him pleasure. It can be equally difficult to understand the body language of a person with autism. Most of us smile when we talk about things we enjoy, or shrug when we can't answer a question. But for children with autism, facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Their tone of voice also fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with autism are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, children with autism may simply scream or grab what they want. Temple Grandin, an exceptional woman with autism who has written two books about her disorder, admits, \"Not being able to speak was utter frustration. Screaming was the only way I could communicate.\" Often she would logically think to herself, \"I am going to scream now because I want to tell somebody I don't want to do something.\" Until they are taught better means of expressing their needs, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to others. The Story of Temple Grandin Temple Grandin, despite a lifelong struggle with autism, earned a doctoral degree in animal science. Today, she invents equipment for managing livestock and teaches at a major university. A woman of extraordinary accomplishments, she has also written several books on animal science, autism, and her own life. Yet at 6 months old, Temple had many of the full-blown signs of autism. When held, she would stiffen and struggle to be put down. By age 2, it was clear that she was hypersensitive to taste, sound, smell, and touch. Sounds were excruciating. Wearing clothes was torture: the feel of certain fabrics was like sandpaper grating her skin. Constantly buffeted by overpowering sensations, she screamed, raged, and threw things. At other times, she found that by focusing intently and exclusively on one item-her own hand, an apple, a spinning coin, or sand sifting through her fingers-she could withdraw into a temporary haven of order and predictability. As was customary at the time, a doctor advised that Temple be institutionalized. Her mother refused and placed her in a therapeutic program for children who were speech impaired. The classes were small and highly structured. Even though the program was not designed to treat autism, the methods worked for Temple. By age 4, she began to speak and by age 5 she was able to attend kindergarten in a regular school. Temple attributes her success to several key people in her life: her mother, who persisted in finding help; her therapist, who kept her from withdrawing into an inner world; and a high school teacher who helped transform her interest in animals into a career in animal science. Temple's insights into the needs of animals, a strongly developed ability to think visually \"in pictures,\" and an awareness of her own special needs led her to invent equipment that has helped both livestock and, remarkably, herself. After seeing a device used to calm cattle, she created a \"squeeze machine.\" The machine provides self- controlled pressure that helps her relax. She finds that after using the squeeze machine, she feels less aggressive and less hypersensitive. With her love of animals and her personal sensitivity as a guide, Temple has also designed humane equipment and facilities for managing cattle that are used all over the world. Her unusually strong visual sense allows her to plan and design these complex projects in her head. She can precisely envision new, complex facilities and how various pieces of equipment fit together before she draws a blueprint. Temple Grandin's story is a powerful affirmation that autism need not keep people from realizing their potential. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Repetitive behaviors and obsessions Although children with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. A child might spend hours repeatedly flicking or flapping her fingers or rocking back and forth. Many flail their arms or walk on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position. Experts call such behaviors stereotypies or self-stimulation. Some people with autism also tend to repeat certain actions over and over. A child might spend hours lining up pretzel sticks. Or, like Alan, run from room to room turning lights on and off. Some children with autism develop troublesome fixations with specific objects, which can lead to unhealthy or dangerous behaviors. For example, one child insists on carrying feces from the bathroom into her classroom. Other behaviors are simply startling, humorous, or embarrassing to those around them. One girl, obsessed with digital watches, grabs the arms of strangers to look at their wrists. For unexplained reasons, people with autism demand consistency in their environment. Many insist on eating the same foods, at the same time, sitting at precisely the same place at the table every day. They may get furious if a picture is tilted on the wall, or wildly upset if their toothbrush has been moved even slightly. A minor change in their routine, like taking a different route to school, may be tremendously upsetting. Scientists are exploring several possible explanations for such repetitive, obsessive behavior. Perhaps the order and sameness lends some stability in a world of sensory confusion. Perhaps focused behaviors help them to block out painful stimuli. Yet another theory is that these behaviors are linked to the senses that work well or poorly. A child who sniffs everything in sight may be using a stable sense of smell to explore his environment. Or perhaps the reverse is true: he may be trying to stimulate a sense that is dim. Imaginative play, too, is limited by these repetitive behaviors and obsessions. Most children, as early as age 2, use their imagination to pretend. They create new uses for an object, perhaps using a bowl for a hat. Or they pretend to be someone else, like a mother cooking dinner for her \"family\" of dolls. In contrast, children with autism rarely pretend. Rather than rocking a doll or rolling a toy car, they may simply hold it, smell it, or spin it for hours on end. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Sensory symptoms When children's perceptions are accurate, they can learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory information is faulty or if the input from the various senses fails to merge into a coherent picture, the child's experiences of the world can be confusing. People with autism seem to have one or both of these problems. There may be problems in the sensory signals that reach the brain or in the integration of the sensory signals-and quite possibly, both. Apparently, as a result of a brain malfunction, many children with autism are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin so disturbing that they can't focus on anything else. For others, a gentle hug may be overwhelming. Some children cover their ears and scream at the sound of a vacuum cleaner, a distant airplane, a telephone ring, or even the wind. Temple Grandin says, \"It was like having a hearing aid that picks up everything, with the volume control stuck on super loud.\" Because any noise was so painful, she often chose to withdraw and tuned out sounds to the point of seeming deaf. In autism, the brain also seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some children with autism seem oblivious to extreme cold or pain, but react hysterically to things that wouldn't bother other children. A child with autism may break her arm in a fall and never cry. Another child might bash his head on the wall without a wince. On the other hand, a light touch may make the child scream with alarm. In some people, the senses are even scrambled. One child gags when she feels a certain texture. A man with autism hears a sound when someone touches a point on his chin. Another experiences certain sounds as colors. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Unuasual abilities Some people with autism display remarkable abilities. A few demonstrate skills far out of the ordinary. At a young age, when other children are drawing straight lines and scribbling, some children with autism are able to draw detailed, realistic pictures in three-dimensional perspective. Some toddlers who are autistic are so visually skilled that they can put complex jigsaw puzzles together. Many begin to read exceptionally early-sometimes even before they begin to speak. Some who have a keenly developed sense of hearing can play musical instruments they have never been taught, play a song accurately after hearing it once, or name any note they hear. Like the person played by Dustin Hoffman in the movie Rain Man, some people with autism can memorize entire television shows, pages of the phone book, or the scores of every major league baseball game for the past 20 years. However, such skills, known as islets of intelligence or savant skills are rare. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Autism Symptoms & Diagnosis Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child. In many cases, their baby seemed \"different\" from birth-being unresponsive to people and toys, or focusing intently on one item for long periods of time. The first signs of autism may also appear in children who had been developing normally. When an affectionate, babbling toddler suddenly becomes silent, withdrawn, violent, or self-abusive, something is wrong. Even so, years may go by before the family seeks a diagnosis. Well-meaning friends and relatives sometimes help parents ignore the problems with reassurances that \"Every child is different,\" or \"Janie can talk-she just doesn't want to!\" Unfortunately, this only delays getting appropriate assessment and treatment for the child.

Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Diagnostic procedures To date, there are no medical tests like x-rays or blood tests that detect autism. And no two children with the disorder behave the same way. In addition, several conditions can cause symptoms that resemble autism symptoms. So parents and the child's pediatrician need to rule out other disorders, including hearing loss, speech problems, mental retardation, and neurological problems. But once these possibilities have been eliminated, a visit to a professional who specializes in autism is necessary. Such specialists include people with the professional titles of child psychiatrist, child psychologist, developmental pediatrician, or pediatric neurologist. Child Autism specialists use a variety of methods to identify the disorder. Using a standardized rating scale, the specialist closely observes and evaluates the child's language and social behavior. A structured interview is also used to elicit information from parents about the child's behavior and early development. Reviewing family videotapes, photos, and baby albums may help parents recall when each behavior first occurred and when the child reached certain developmental milestones. The specialists may also test for certain genetic and neurological problems. Specialists may also consider other conditions that produce many of the same behaviors and symptoms as autism, such as Rett's Disorder or Asperger's Disorder. Rett's Disorder is a progressive brain disease that only affects girls but, like autism, produces repetitive hand movements and leads to loss of language and social skills. Children with Asperger's Disorder are very like high-functioning children with autism. Although they have repetitive behaviors, severe social problems, and clumsy movements, their language and intelligence are usually intact. Unlike autism, the symptoms of Asperger's Disorder typically appear later in childhood. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Diagnostic criteria After assessing observations and test results, the specialist makes a diagnosis of autism only if there is clear evidence of: poor or limited social relationships underdeveloped communication skills repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities. People with autism generally have some impairment within each category, although the severity of each symptom may vary. The diagnostic criteria also require that these symptoms appear by age 3. However, some specialists are reluctant to give a diagnosis of autism. They fear that it will cause parents to lose hope. As a result, they may apply a more general term that simply describes the child's behaviors or sensory deficits. \"Severe communication disorder with autism-like behaviors,\" \"multi-sensory system disorder,\" and \"sensory integration dysfunction\" are some of the terms that are used. Children with milder or fewer symptoms are often diagnosed as having Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD). Although terms like Asperger's Disorder and PDD do not significantly change treatment options, they may keep the child from receiving the full range of specialized educational services available to children diagnosed with autism. They may also give parents false hope that their child's problems are only temporary. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Child Autism Causes It is generally accepted that autism is caused by abnormalities in brain structures or functions. Using a variety of new research tools to study human and animal brain growth, scientists are discovering more about normal development and how abnormalities occur. The brain of a fetus develops throughout pregnancy. Starting out with a few cells, the cells grow and divide until the brain contains billions of specialized cells, called neurons. Research sponsored by NIMH and other components at the National Institutes of Health is playing a key role in showing how cells find their way to a specific area of the brain and take on special functions. Once in place, each neuron sends out long fibers that connect with other neurons. In this way, lines of communication are established between various areas of the brain and between the brain and the rest of the body. As each neuron receives a signal it releases chemicals called neurotransmitters, which pass the signal to the next neuron. By birth, the brain has evolved into a complex organ with several distinct regions and subregions, each with a precise set of functions and responsibilities. Different parts of the brain have different functions The hippocampus makes it possible to recall recent experience and new information The amygdala directs our emotional responses The frontal lobes of the cerebrum allow us to solve problems, plan ahead, understand the behavior of others, and restrain our impulses The parietal areas control hearing, speech, and language The cerebellum regulates balance, body movements, coordination, and the muscles used in speaking The corpus callossum passes information from one side of the brain to the other But brain development does not stop at birth. The brain continues to change during the first few years of life, as new neurotransmitters become activated and additional lines of communication are established. Neural networks are forming and creating a foundation for processing language, emotions, and thought. However, scientists now know that a number of problems may interfere with normal brain development. Cells may migrate to the wrong place in the brain. Or, due to problems with the neural pathways or the neurotransmitters, some parts of the communication network may fail to perform. A problem with the communication network may interfere with the overall task of coordinating sensory information, thoughts, feelings, and actions. Researchers supported by NIMH and other NIH Institutes are scrutinizing the structures and functions of the brain for clues as to how a brain with autism differs from the normal brain. In one line of study, researchers are investigating potential defects that occur during initial brain development. Other researchers are looking for defects in the brains of people already known to have autism. Scientists are also looking for abnormalities in the brain structures that make up the limbic system. Inside the limbic system, an area called the amygdala is known to help regulate aspects of social and emotional behavior. One study of high-functioning children with autism found that the amygdala was indeed impaired but that another area of the brain, the hippocampus, was not. In another study, scientists followed the development of monkeys whose amygdala was disrupted at birth. Like children with autism, as the monkeys grew, they became increasingly withdrawn and avoided social contact. Differences in neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system, are also being explored. For example, high levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin have been found in a number of people with autism. Since neurotransmitters are responsible for passing nerve impulses in the brain and nervous systme, it is possible that they are involved in the distortion of sensations that accompanies autism. NIMH grantees are also exploring differences in overall brain function, using a technology called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify which parts of the brain are energized during specific mental tasks. In a study of adolescent boys, NIMH researchers observed that during problem-solving and language tasks, teenagers with autism were not only less successful than peers without autism, but the MRI images of their brains showed less activity. In a study of younger children, researcers observed low levels of activity in the parietal areas and the corpus callosum. Such research may help scientists determine whether autism reflects a problem with specific areas of the brain or with the transmission of signals from one part of the brain to another. Each of these differences has been seen in some but not all the people with autism who were tested. What could this mean? Perhaps the term autism actually covers several different disorders, each caused by a different problem in the brain. Or perhaps the various brain differences are themselves caused by a single underlying disorder that scientists have not yet identified. Discovering the physical basis of autism should someday allow us to better identify, treat, and possibly prevent it. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Factors affecting brain development But what causes normal brain development to go awry? Some NIMH researchers are investigating genetic causes-the role that heredity and genes play in passing the disorder from one generation to the next. Others are looking at medical problems related to pregnancy and other factors. Heredity. Several studies of twins suggest that autism- or at least a higher likelihood of some brain dysfunction-can be inherited. For example, identical twins are far more likely than fraternal twins to both have autism. Unlike fraternal twins, which develop from two separate eggs, identical twins develop from a single egg and have the same genetic makeup. It appears that parents who have one child with autism are at slightly increased risk for having more than one child with autism. This also suggests a genetic link. However, autism does not appear to be due to one particular gene. If autism, like eye color, were passed along by a single gene, more family members would inherit the disorder. NIMH grantees, using state-of-the-art gene splicing techniques, are searching for irregular segments of genetic code that the autistic members of a family may have inherited. Some scientists believe that what is inherited is an irregular segment of genetic code or a small cluster of three to six unstable genes. In most people, the faulty code may cause only minor problems. But under certain conditions, the unstable genes may interact and seriously interfere with the brain development of the unborn child. A body of NIMH-sponsored research is testing this theory. One study is exploring whether parents and siblings who do not have autism show minor autism symptoms, such as mild social, language, or reading problems. If so, such findings would suggest that several members of a family can inherit the irregular or unstable genes, but that other as yet unidentified conditions must be present for the full-blown disorder to develop. Pregnancy and other problems. Throughout pregnancy, the fetal brain is growing larger and more complex, as new cells, specialized regions, and communication networks form. During this time, anything that disrupts normal brain development may have lifelong effects on the child's sensory, language, social, and mental functioning. For this reason, researchers are exploring whether certain conditions, like the mother's health during pregnancy, problems during delivery, or other environmental factors may interfere with normal brain development. Viral infections like rubella (also called German measles), particularly in the first three months of pregnancy, may lead to a variety of problems, possibly including autism and retardation. Lack of oxygen to the baby and other complications of delivery may also increase the risk of autism. However, there is no clear link. Such problems occur in the delivery of many infants who are not autistic, and most children with autism are born without such factors. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Are There Accompanying Disorders? Several disorders commonly accompany autism. To some extent, these may be caused by a common underlying problem in brain functioning. Mental retardation Of the problems that can occur with autism, mental retardation is the most widespread. Seventy-five to 80 percent of people with autism are mentally retarded to some extent. Fifteen to 20 percent are considered severely retarded, with IQs below 35. (A score of 100 represents average intelligence.) But autism does not necessarily correspond with mental impairment. More than 10 percent of people with autism have an average or above average IQ. A few show exceptional intelligence. Interpreting IQ scores is difficult, however, because most intelligence tests are not designed for people with autism. People with autism do not perceive or relate to their environment in typical ways. When tested, some areas of ability are normal or even above average, and some areas may be especially weak. For example, a child with autism may do extremely well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low scores on the language subtests. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Seizures About one-third of the children with autism develop seizures, starting either in early childhood or adolescence. Researchers are trying to learn if there is any significance to the time of onset, since the seizures often first appear when certain neurotransmitters become active. Since seizures range from brief blackouts to full-blown body convulsions, an electroencephalogram (EEG) can help confirm their presence. Fortunately, in most cases, seizures can be controlled with medication. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Fragile X One disorder, Fragile X syndrome, has been found in about 10 percent of people with autism, mostly males. This inherited disorder is named for a defective piece of the X-chromosome that appears pinched and fragile when seen under a microscope. People who inherit this faulty bit of genetic code are more likely to have mental retardation and many of autism symptoms along with unusual physical features that are not typical of autism. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Tuberous Sclerosis There is also some relationship between autism and Tuberous Sclerosis, a genetic condition that causes abnormal tissue growth in the brain and problems in other organs. Although Tuberous Sclerosis is a rare disorder, occurring less than once in 10,000 births, about a fourth of those affected are also autistic. Scientists are exploring genetic conditions such as Fragile X and Tuberous Sclerosis to see why they so often coincide with autism. Understanding exactly how these conditions disrupt normal brain development may provide insights to the biological and genetic mechanisms of autism. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Finding Help and Hope Paul Adolescence was a good time for Paul. He seemed to relax and become more social. He became more affectionate. When approached, he would converse with people. For several months, drugs were used to help him control his aggression, but they were stopped because they caused unwanted side effects. Even so, he now rarely throws or breaks things. Two years ago, Paul's parents were able to take advantage of new scientific understanding about autism, and they enrolled him in an innovative program that provides full-time support, enabling him to live and work within the community. Today, at age 20, he has a closely supervised job assembling booklets for a publishing company. He lives in an attractive apartment with another man who has autism and a residence supervisor. Paul loves picnics and outings to the library to check out books and cassettes. He also enjoys going home each week to visit his family. But he still demands familiarity and order. As soon as he arrives home, he moves every piece of furniture back to the location that is familiar to him. Alan The summer Alan was 6, after years with no apparent progress, his language began to flow. Although he reversed the meaning of pronouns, he began talking in sentences that other people could understand. Now age 13, Alan has lost his constant obsession with lights, returning to it only when he feels stressed. He often burrows under a heavy pile of pillows, which seems to relax and comfort him. His fits of anger occur less often, but because he is bigger, he reacts with more force. Every now and then, he goes out of control, kicking, hitting, and biting. Once, at a shopping mall, he threw a tantrum so severe that his mother had to hold him down to control him. At the same time, he has successfully made the transition to middle school and he is learning more quickly than before. He seems more aware of his surroundings and remembers people. He still doesn't play with other children, but often sits watching them from a window. It's as if he has become aware that he is different. He also seems more aware of his own emotions and at times he says quietly, \"You sad.\" Janie Today, at age 4, Janie is enrolled in an intensive program in which she is trained at home by her mother and several specialists. She is beginning to show real progress. She now makes eye contact and has begun to talk. She can ask for things. As a result, she seems happier, less frustrated, and better able to form connections with others. She's also begun to show some remarkable skills. She can stack blocks and match objects far beyond her years. And her memory is amazing. Although her speech is often unclear, she can recite and act out entire television programs. Her parents' dream is that she will progress enough to enter a regular kindergarten next year. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Is There Reason for Hope? When parents learn that their child is autistic, most wish they could magically make the problem go away. They looked forward to having a baby and watching their child learn and grow. Instead, they must face the fact that they have a child who may not live up to their dreams and will daily challenge their patience. Some families deny the problem or fantasize about an instant cure. They may take the child from one specialist to another, hoping for a different diagnosis. It is important for the family to eventually overcome their pain and deal with the problem, while still cherishing hopes for their child's future. Most families realize that their lives can move on. Today, more than ever before, people with autism can be helped. A combination of early intervention, special education, family support, and in some cases, medication, is helping increasing numbers of children with autism to live more normal lives. Special interventions and education programs can expand their capacity to learn, communicate, and relate to others, while reducing the severity and frequency of disruptive behaviors. Medications can be used to help alleviate certain autism symptoms. Older children and adults like Paul may also benefit from autism treatments that are available today. So, while no cure is in sight, it is possible to greatly improve the day-to-day life of children and adults with autism. Today, a child who receives effective therapy and education has every hope of using his or her unique capacity to learn. Even some who are seriously mentally retarded can often master many self-help skills like cooking, dressing, doing laundry, and handling money. For such children, greater independence and self-care may be the primary training goals. Other youngsters may go on to learn basic academic skills, like reading, writing, and simple math. Many complete high school. Some, like Temple Grandin, may even earn college degrees. Like anyone else, their personal interests provide strong incentives to learn. Clearly, an important factor in developing a child's long-term potential for independence and success is early intervention. The sooner a child begins to receive help, the more opportunity for learning. Furthermore, because a young child's brain is still forming, scientists believe that early intervention gives children the best chance of developing their full potential. Even so, no matter when the child is diagnosed, it's never too late to begin autism treatments. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Can Social Skills and Behavior Be Improved? A number of treatment approaches have evolved in the decades since autism was first identified. Some therapeutic programs focus on developing skills and replacing dysfunctional behaviors with more appropriate ones. Others focus on creating a stimulating learning environment tailored to the unique needs of children with autism. Researchers have begun to identify factors that make certain autism treatment programs more effective in reducing- or reversing-the limitations imposed by autism. Treatment programs that build on the child's interests, offer a predictable schedule, teach tasks as a series of simple steps, actively engage the child's attention in highly structured activities, and provide regular reinforcement of behavior, seem to produce the greatest gains. Parent involvement has also emerged as a major factor in the success of autism treatments. Parents work with teachers and therapists to identify the behaviors to be changed and the skills to be taught. Recognizing that parents are the child's earliest teachers, more programs are beginning to train parents to continue the therapy at home. Research is beginning to suggest that mothers and fathers who are trained to work with their child can be as effective as professional teachers and therapists. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Autism Treatments: Developmental approaches Professionals have found that many children with autism learn best in an environment that builds on their skills and interests while accommodating their special needs. Programs employing a developmental approach provide consistency and structure along with appropriate levels of stimulation. For example, a predictable schedule of activities each day helps children with autism plan and organize their experiences. Using a certain area of the classroom for each activity helps students know what they are expected to do. For those with sensory problems, activities that sensitize or desensitize the child to certain kinds of stimulation may be especially helpful. In one developmental preschool classroom, a typical session starts with a physical activity to help develop balance, coordination, and body awareness. Children string beads, piece puzzles together, paint and participate in other structured activities. At snack time, the teacher encourages social interaction and models how to use language to ask for more juice. Later, the teacher stimulates creative play by prompting the children to pretend being a train. As in any classroom, the children learn by doing. Although higher-functioning children may be able to handle academic work, they too need help to organize the task and avoid distractions. A student with autism might be assigned the same addition problems as her classmates. But instead of assigning several pages in the textbook, the teacher might give her one page at a time or make a list of specific tasks to be checked off as each is done. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Autism Treatments: Behaviorist approaches When people are rewarded for a certain behavior, they are more likely to repeat or continue that behavior. Behaviorist training approaches are based on this principle. When children with autism are rewarded each time they attempt or perform a new skill, they are likely to perform it more often. With enough practice, they eventually acquire the skill. For example, a child who is rewarded whenever she looks at the therapist may gradually learn to make eye contact on her own. Dr. O. Ivar Lovaas pioneered the use of behaviorist methods for children with autism more than 25 years ago. His methods involve time-intensive, highly structured, repetitive sequences in which a child is given a command and rewarded each time he responds correctly. For example, in teaching a young boy to sit still, a therapist might place him in front of chair and tell him to sit. If the child doesn't respond, the therapist nudges him into the chair. Once seated, the child is immediately rewarded in some way. A reward might be a bit of chocolate, a sip of juice, a hug, or applause-whatever the child enjoys. The process is repeated many times over a period of up to two hours. Eventually, the child begins to respond without being nudged and sits for longer periods of time. Learning to sit still and follow directions then provides a foundation for learning more complex behaviors. Using this approach for up to 40 hours a week, some children may be brought to the point of near-normal behavior. Others are much less responsive to the treatment. However, some researchers and therapists believe that less intensive autism treatments, particularly those begun early in a child's life, may be more efficient and just as effective. So, over the years, researchers sponsored by NIMH and other agencies have continued to study and modify the behaviorist approach. Today, some of these behaviorist treatment programs are more individualized and built around the child's own interests and capabilities. Many programs also involve parents or other non-autistic children in teaching the child. Instruction is no longer limited to a controlled environment, but takes place in natural, everyday settings. Thus, a trip to the supermarket may be an opportunity to practice using words for size and shape. Although rewarding desired behavior is still a key element, the rewards are varied and appropriate to the situation. A child who makes eye contact may be rewarded with a smile, rather than candy. NIMH is funding several types of behaviorist treatment approaches to help determine the best time for autism treatment to start, the optimum treatment intensity and duration, and the most effective methods to reach both high- and low-functioning children. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Autism Treatments: Nonstandard approaches In trying to do everything possible to help their children, many parents are quick to try new treatments. Some autism treatments are developed by reputable therapists or by parents of a child with autism, yet when tested scientifically, cannot be proven to help. Before spending time and money and possibly slowing their child's progress, the family should talk with experts and evaluate the findings of objective reviewers. Following are some of the approaches that have not been shown to be effective in treating the majority of children with autism: Facilitated Communication, which assumes that by supporting a nonverbal child's arms and fingers so that he can type on a keyboard, the child will be able to type out his inner thoughts. Several scientific studies have shown that the typed messages actually reflect the thoughts of the person providing the support. Holding Therapy, in which the parent hugs the child for long periods of time, even if the child resists. Those who use this technique contend that it forges a bond between the parent and child. Some claim that it helps stimulate parts of the brain as the child senses the boundaries of her own body. There is no scientific evidence, however, to support these claims. Auditory Integration Training, in which the child listens to a variety of sounds with the goal of improving language comprehension. Advocates of this method suggest that it helps people with autism receive more balanced sensory input from their environment. When tested using scientific procedures, the method was shown to be no more effective than listening to music. Dolman/Delcato Method, in which people are made to crawl and move as they did at each stage of early development, in an attempt to learn missing skills. Again, no scientific studies support the effectiveness of the method. It is critical that parents obtain reliable, objective information before enrolling their child in any autism treatment program. Programs that are not based on sound principles and tested through solid research can do more harm than good. They may frustrate the child and cause the family to lose money, time, and hope. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Autism Treatments: Selecting a program Parents are often disappointed to learn that there is no single best treatment for all children with autism; possibly not even for a specific child. Even after a child has been thoroughly tested and formally diagnosed, there is no clear \"right\" course of action. The diagnostic team may suggest methods of autism treatments and service providers, but ultimately it is up to the parents to consider their child's unique needs, research the various options, and decide. Above all, parents should consider their own sense of what will work for their child. Keeping in mind that autism takes many forms, parents need to consider whether a specific program has helped children like their own. At the back of this pamphlet is a list of books and associations that provide more detailed information about each form of therapy and other resources. Exploring Options in Autism Treatments Parents may find these questions helpful as they consider various autism treatments: How successful has the program been for other children? How many children have gone on to placement in a regular school and how have they performed? Do staff members have training and experience in working with children and adolescents with autism? How are activities planned and organized? Are there predictable daily schedules and routines? How much individual attention will my child receive? How is progress measured? Will my child's behavior be closely observed and recorded? Will my child be given tasks and rewards that are personally motivating? Is the environment designed to minimize distractions? Will the program prepare me to continue the therapy at home? What is the cost, time commitment, and location of the program? Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top What Medications are Available? No medication can correct the brain structures or impaired nerve connections that seem to underlie autism. Scientists have found, however, that drugs developed to treat other disorders with similar symptoms are sometimes effective in treating the autism symptoms and behaviors that make it hard for people with autism to function at home, school, or work. It is important to note that none of the medications described in this section has been approved for autism by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is the Federal agency that authorizes the use of drugs for specific disorders. Medications used to treat anxiety and depression are being explored as a way to relieve certain autism symptoms. These drugs include fluoxetine (Prozac?), fluvoxamine (Luvox?), sertraline (Zoloft?), and clomipramine (Anafranil?). Some scientists believe that autism and these disorders may share a problem in the functioning of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which these medications apparently help. One study found that about 60 percent of patients with autism who used fluoxetine became less distraught and aggressive. They became calmer and better able to handle changes in their routine or environment. However, fenfluramine, another medication that affects serotonin levels, has not proven to be helpful. People with an anxiety disorder called obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), like people with autism, are plagued by repetitive actions they can't control. Based on the premise that the two disorders may be related, one NIMH research study found that clomipramine, a medication used to treat OCD, does appear to be effective in reducing obsessive, repetitive behavior in some people with autism. Children with autism who were given the medication also seemed less withdrawn, angry, and anxious. But more research needs to be done to see if the findings of this study can be repeated. Some children with autism experience hyperactivity, the frenzied activity that is seen in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Since stimulant drugs like Ritalin? are helpful in treating many people with ADHD, doctors have tried them to reduce the hyperactivity sometimes seen in autism. The drugs seem to be most effective when given to higher-functioning children with autism who do not have seizures or other neurological problems. Because many children with autism have sensory disturbances and often seem impervious to pain, scientists are also looking for medications that increase or decrease the transmission of physical sensations. Endorphins are natural painkillers produced by the body. But in certain people with autism, the endorphins seem to go too far in suppressing feeling. Scientists are exploring substances that block the effects of endorphins, to see if they can bring the sense of touch to a more normal range. Such drugs may be helpful to children who experience too little sensation. And once they can sense pain, such children could be less likely to bite themselves, bang their heads, or hurt themselves in other ways. Chlorpromazine, theoridazine, and haloperidol have also been used. Although these powerful drugs are typically used to treat adults with severe psychiatric disorders, they are sometimes given to people with autism to temporarily reduce agitation, aggression, and repetitive behaviors. However, since major tranquilizers are powerful medications that can produce serious and sometimes permanent side effects, they should be prescribed and used with extreme caution. Vitamin B6, taken with magnesium, is also being explored as a way to stimulate brain activity. Because vitamin B6 plays an important role in creating enzymes needed by the brain, some experts predict that large doses might foster greater brain activity in people with autism. However, clinical studies of the vitamin have been inconclusive and further study is needed. Like drugs, vitamins change the balance of chemicals in the body and may cause unwanted side effects. For this reason, large doses of vitamins should only be given under the supervision of a doctor. This is true of all vitamins and medications. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top What are the Educational Options? The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990 assures a free and appropriate public education to children with diagnosed learning deficits. The 1991 version of the law extended services to preschoolers who are developmentally delayed. As a result, public schools must provide services to handicapped children including those age 3 to 5. Because of the importance of early intervention, many states also offer special services to children from birth to age 3. The school may also be responsible for providing whatever services are needed to enable the child to attend school and learn. Such services might include transportation, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and any special equipment. Federally funded Parent Training Information Centers and Protection and Advocacy Agencies in each state can provide information on the rights of the family and child. By law, public schools are also required to prepare and carry out a set of specific instructional goals for every child in a special education program. The goals are stated as specific skills that the child will be taught to perform. The list of skills make up what is known as an \"IEP\"-the child's Individualized Educational Program. The IEP serves as an agreement between the school and the family on the educational goals. Because parents know their child best, they play an important role in creating this plan. They work closely with the school staff to identify which skills the child needs most. In planning the IEP, it's important to focus on what skills are critical to the child's well-being and future development. For each skill, parents and teachers should consider these questions: Is this an important life skill? What will happen if the child isn't trained to do this for herself? Such questions free parents and teachers to consider alternatives to training. After several years of valiant effort to teach Alan to tie his shoelaces, his parents and teachers decided that Alan could simply wear sneakers with Velcro fasteners, and dropped the skill from Alan's IEP. After Alan struggled in vain to memorize the multiplication table, they decided to teach him to use a calculator. A child's success in school should not be measured against standards like mastering algebra or completing high school. Rather, progress should be measured against his or her unique potential for self-care and self-sufficiency as an adult. Adolescence For all children, adolescence is a time of stress and confusion. No less so for teenagers with autism. Like all children, they need help in dealing with their budding sexuality. While some behaviors improve in the teenage years, some get worse. Increased autistic or aggressive behavior may be one way some teens express their newfound tension and confusion. The teenage years are also a time when children become more socially sensitive and aware. At the age that most teenagers are concerned with acne, popularity, grades, and dates, teens with autism may become painfully aware that they are different from their peers. They may notice that they lack friends. And unlike their schoolmates, they aren't dating or planning for a career. For some, the sadness that comes with such realization urges them to learn new behaviors. Sean Barron, who wrote about his autism in the book, There's a Boy in Here, describes how the pain of feeling different motivated him to acquire more normal social skills. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Can Child Autism be Outgrown? At present, there is no cure for autism. Nor do children outgrow child autism. But the capacity to learn and develop new skills is within every child. With time, children with autism mature and new strengths emerge. Many children with autism seem to go through developmental spurts between ages 5 and 13. Some spontaneously begin to talk-even if repetitively-around age 5 or later. Some, like Paul, become more sociable, or like Alan, more ready to learn. Over time, and with help, children may learn to play with toys appropriately, function socially, and tolerate mild changes in routine. Some children in treatment programs lose enough of their most disabling autism symptoms to function reasonably well in a regular classroom. Some children with autism make truly dramatic strides. Of course, those with normal or near-normal intelligence and those who develop language tend to have the best outcomes. But even children who start off poorly may make impressive progress. For example, one boy, after 9 years in a program that involved parents as co-therapists, advanced from an IQ of 70 to an IQ of 100 and began to get average grades at a regular school. While it is natural for parents to hope that their child will \"become normal,\" they should take pride in whatever strides their child does make. Many parents, looking back over the years, find their child has progressed far beyond their initial expectations. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Can Adults with Autism Live Independent Lives? The majority of adults with autism need lifelong training, ongoing supervision, and reinforcement of skills. The public schools' responsibility for providing these services ends when the person is past school age. As the child becomes a young adult, the family is faced with the challenge of creating a home-based plan or selecting a program or facility that can offer such services. In some cases, adults with autism can continue to live at home, provided someone is there to supervise at all times. A variety of residential facilities also provide round-the-clock care. Unlike many of the institutions years ago, today's facilities view residents as people with human needs, and offer opportunities for recreation and simple, but meaningful work. Still, some facilities are isolated from the community, separating people with autism from the rest of the world. Today, a few cities are exploring new ways to help people with autism hold meaningful jobs and live and work within the wider community. Innovative, supportive programs enable adults with autism to live and work in mainstream society, rather than in a segregated environment. By teaching and reinforcing good work skills and positive social behaviors, such programs help people live up to their potential. Work is meaningful and based on each person's strengths and abilities. For example, people with autism with good hand-eye coordination who do complex, repetitive actions are often especially good at assembly and manufacturing tasks. A worker with a low IQ and few language skills might be trained to work in a restaurant sorting silverware and folding napkins. Adults with higher-level skills have been trained to assemble electronic equipment or do office work. Based on their skills and interests, participants in such programs fill positions in printing, retail, clerical, manufacturing, and other companies. Once they are carefully trained in a task, they are put to work alongside the regular staff. Like other employees, they are paid for their labor, receive employee benefits, and are included in staff events like company picnics and retirement parties. Companies that hire people through such programs find that these workers make loyal, reliable employees. Employers find that the autistic behaviors, limited social skills, and even occasional tantrums or aggression, do not greatly affect the worker's ability to work efficiently or complete tasks. Like any other worker, program participants live in houses and apartments within the community. Under the direction of a residence coach, each resident shares as much as possible in tasks like meal-planning, shopping, cooking, and cleanup. For recreation, they go to movies, have picnics, and eat in restaurants. As they are ready, they are taught skills that make them more personally independent. Some take pride in having learned to take a bus on their own, or handling money they've earned themselves. Job and residence coaches, who serve as a link between the program participants and the community, are the key to such programs. There may be as few as two adults with autism assigned to each coach. The job coach demonstrates the steps of a job to the worker, observes behavior, and regularly acknowledges good performance. The job coach also serves as a bridge between the workers with autism and their co-workers. For example, the coach steps in if a worker loses self-control or presents any problems on the job. The coach also provides training in specific social skills, such as waving or saying hello to fellow workers. At home, the residence coach reinforces social and self-help behaviors, and finds ways to help people manage their time and responsibilities. At present, about a third of all people with autism can live and work in the community with some degree of independence. As scientific research points the way to more effective therapies and as communities establish programs that provide proper support, expectations are that this number will grow. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top How Do Families Learn to Cope? The task of rearing a child with autism is among the most demanding and stressful that a family faces. The child's screaming fits and tantrums can put everyone on edge. Because the child needs almost constant attention, brothers and sisters often feel ignored or jealous. Younger children may need to be reassured that they will not catch autism or grow to become like their sibling. Older children may be concerned about the prospect of having a child with autism themselves. The tensions can strain a marriage. While friends and family may try to be supportive, they can't understand the difficulties in raising a child with autism. They may criticize the parents for letting their child \"get away\" with certain behaviors and announce how they would handle the child. Some parents of children with autism feel envious of their friends' children. This may cause them to grow distant from people who once gave them support. Families may also be uncomfortable taking their child to public places. Children who throw tantrums, walk on their toes, flail their arms, or climb under restaurant tables to play with strangers' socks, can be very embarrassing. Janie's mother found that once she became willing to explain to strangers that her child has autism, people were more accepting. Paul's mother has learned to remind herself, \"This is a public place. We have a right to be here.\" Many parents feel deeply disappointed that their child may never engage in normal activities or attain some of life's milestones. Parents may mourn that their child may never learn to play baseball, drive, get a diploma, marry, or have children. However, most parents come to accept these feelings and focus on helping their children achieve what they can. Parents begin to find joy and pleasure in their child despite the limitations. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Support groups Many parents find that others who face the same concerns are their strongest allies. Parents of children with autism tend to form communities of mutual caring and support. Parents gain not only encouragement and inspiration from other families' stories, but also practical advice, information on the latest research, and referrals to community services and qualified professionals. By talking with other people who have similar experiences, families dealing with autism learn they are not alone. The Autism Society of America, listed at the close of this pamphlet, has spawned parent support groups in communities across the country. In such groups, parents share emotional support, affirmation, and suggestions for solving problems. Its newsletter, the Advocate, is filled with up-to-date medical and practical information. Coping StrategiesThe following suggestions are based on the experiences of families in dealing with autism, and on NIMH-sponsored studies of effective strategies for dealing with stress. Work as a family. In times of stress, family members tend to take their frustrations out on each other when they most need mutual support. Despite the difficulties in finding child care, couples find that taking breaks without their children helps renew their bonds. The other children also need attention, and need to have a voice in expressing and solving problems. Keep a sense of humor. Parents find that the ability to laugh and say, \"You won't believe what our child has done now!\" helps them maintain a healthy sense of perspective. Notice progress. When it seems that all the help, love, and support is going nowhere, it's important to remember that over time, real progress is being made. Families are better able to maintain their hope if they celebrate the small signs of growth and change they see. Take action. Many parents gain strength working with others on behalf of all children with autism. Working to win additional resources, community programs, or school services helps parents see themselves as important contributors to the well-being of others as well as their own child. Plan ahead. Naturally, most parents want to know that when they die, their offspring will be safe and cared for. Having a plan in place helps relieve some of the worry. Some parents form a contract with a professional guardian, who agrees to look after the interests of the person with autism, such as observing birthdays and arranging for care. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top What Hope Does Research Offer? Research continues to reveal how the brain-the control center for thought, language, feelings, and behavior-carries out its functions. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funds scientists at centers across the Nation who are exploring how the brain develops, transmits its signals, integrates input from the senses, and translates all this into thoughts and behavior. In recognition of growing scientific gains in brain research, the President and Congress have officially designated the 1990s as the \"Decade of the Brain.\" There are new research initiatives at NIH sponsored by NIMH, NICHD, NINDS, and NIDCD. As a result, today as never before, investigators from various scientific disciplines are joining forces to unlock the mysteries of the brain. Perspective gained from research into the genetic, biochemical, physiological, and psychological aspects of autism may provide a more complete view of the disorder. Every day, NIH-sponsored researchers are learning more about how the brain develops normally and what can go wrong in the process. Already, for example, scientists have discovered evidence suggesting that in autism, brain development slows at some point before week 30 of pregnancy. Scientists now also have tools and techniques that allow them to examine the brain in ways that were unthought of just a few years ago. New imaging techniques that show the living brain in action permit scientists to observe with surprising clarity how the brain changes as an individual performs mental tasks, moves, or speaks. Such techniques open windows to the brain, allowing scientists to learn which brain regions are engaged in particular tasks. In addition, recent scientific advances are permitting scientists to break new ground in researching the role of heredity in autism. Using sophisticated statistical methods along with gene splicing-a technique that enables scientists to manipulate the microscopic bits of genetic code-investigators sponsored by NIH and other institutions are searching for abnormal genes that may be involved in autism. The ability to identify irregular genes-or the factors that make a gene unstable-may lead to earlier diagnoses. Meanwhile, scientists are working to determine if there is a genetic link between autism and other brain disorders commonly associated with it, such as Tourette Disorder and Tuberous Sclerosis. New insights into the genetic transmission of these disorders, along with newly gained knowledge of normal and abnormal brain development should provide important clues to the causes of autism. A key to developing our understanding of the human brain is research involving animals. Like humans, other primates, such as chimpanzees, apes, and monkeys, have emotions, form attachments, and develop higher-level thought processes. For this reason, studies of their brain functions and behavior shed light on human development. Animal studies have proven invaluable in learning how disruptions to the developing brain affect behavior, sensory perceptions, and mental development and have led to a better understanding of autism. Ultimately, the results of NIMH's extensive research program may translate into better lives for people with autism. As we get closer to understanding the brain, we approach a day when we may be able to diagnose very young children and provide effective autism treatments earlier in the child's development. As data accumulate on the brain chemicals involved in autism, we get closer to developing medications that reduce or reverse imbalances. Someday, we may even have the ability to prevent the disorder. Perhaps researchers will learn to identify children at risk for autism at birth, allowing doctors and other health care professionals to provide preventive therapy before autism symptoms ever develop. Or, as scientists learn more about the genetic transmission of autism, they may be able to replace any defective genes before the infant is even born. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top What are Sources of Information and Support? Parents often find that books and movies about autism that have happy endings cheer them, but raise false hopes. In such stories, a parent's novel approach suddenly works or child autism is simply outgrown. But there really are no cures for child autism and growth takes time and patience. Parents should seek practical, realistic sources of information, particularly those based on careful research. Similarly, certain sources of information are more reliable than others. Some popular magazines and newspapers are quick to report new \"miracle cures\" before they have been thoroughly researched. Scientific and professional materials, such as those published by the Autism Society of America and other organizations that take the time to thoroughly evaluate such claims, provide current information based on well-documented data and carefully controlled clinical research. Back to Top Click Here for the Latest News on Autism Back to Top Keeping on Top of Your Condition Keeping in tune with your disease or condition not only makes treatment less intimidating but also increases its chance of success, and has been shown to lower a patients risk of complications. As well, as an informed patient, you are better able to discuss your condition and treatment options with your physician. A new service available to patients provides a convenient means of staying informed, and ensures that the information is both reliable and accurate.

Throughout the campaign, monetary donations will be collected at all Toys\"R\"Us and Babies\"R\"Us stores and online at Toysrus.com/AutismSpeaks. Autism Speaks is the nation's leading organization dedicated to increasing awareness of autism spectrum disorders; funding research into the causes, prevention and treatments for autism; and advocating for the needs of individuals with autism and their families. \"Autism impacts countless families, including those of our customers and employees,\" said Jerry Storch, Chairman and CEO, Toys\"R\"Us, Inc. \"As a company that loves kids, we are proud to lend our support once again to help Autism Speaks find the missing pieces of the autism puzzle by raising money and awareness for this disorder.\" Skill-Building Toys and Safe Play Tips As part of this philanthropic initiative, Toys\"R\"Us has created several programs to help parents and caregivers of children with autism. The company collaborated with Autism Speaks and the National Lekotek Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to making play accessible for children with disabilities, to identify toys that can help little ones with autism develop language, creativity and social skills, among others, while playing alongside siblings and friends. The \"Ten Toys That Speak To Autism,\" a special subset of the annual Toys\"R\"Us Toy Guide for Differently-Abled Kids, provides toy suggestions specifically for families and friends of children with autism. Research shows that children with cognitive, emotional or social limitations, including those with autism, are more prone to accidental injuries. With guidance from leading safety organizations and Autism Speaks, the Safe Play Tips are relevant for children with autism. These tips include: Avoid Trigger Toys: Opt for toys that have volume control for children who are adversely affected by loud noises. Read Labels for Ability: Choose toys that correspond with a child's learning level rather than merely matching a toy with his/her actual age. Never Leave a Child Unsupervised: It is especially critical that a child with special needs is properly supervised by an adult or trusted caregiver at all times. \"The \"R\"Us family and its customers have continually opened their hearts to support Autism Speaks in its mission to advocate for the nearly 750,000 children on the autism spectrum in this country,\" said Mark Roithmayr, President of Autism Speaks. \"Toys\"R\"Us, Inc. is such a valued partner, and we are excited about the fundraising potential of this year's program.\" Comprehensive information about the 2010 campaign is available on the company's dedicated website, Toysrus.com/AutismSpeaks. The \"Ten Toys That Speak To Autism\" and a full list of Safe Play Tips can be found here, as well as a blog titled \"Speaking About Autism,\" which offers updates and information throughout the nine-week fundraising effort. The website, as well as campaign signage in Toys\"R\"Us and Babies\"R\"Us stores, features the \"Faces of Autism,\" a striking series of portraits highlighting children with autism taken by photographer Thomas Balsamo. Walking the Walk for Autism Speaks In addition to the fundraising campaign, Toys\"R\"Us is kicking off its national sponsorship of Walk Now for Autism Speaks, a year-long series of more than 80 walk events in communities throughout North America. Teams of regional employees will walk alongside the company's iconic mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe and individuals with autism, their families and friends to raise money and awareness. All funds raised in Toys\"R\"Us and Babies\"R\"Us stores, online and through the Walk Now for Autism Speaks events will go directly to Autism Speaks to support research and advocacy efforts. Earlier this month, the Toys\"R\"Us Children's Fund kicked off the 2010 campaign by providing a $400,000 grant to Autism Speaks. Customers who donate $10 or more to Autism Speaks at any Toys\"R\"Us or Babies\"R\"Us store in the United States will receive a colorful, floral-themed reusable shopping bag designed by a talented artist with autism, James Hogarth, while supplies last. Since the partnership launched in 2007, Toys\"R\"Us, Inc., the Toys\"R\"Us Children's Fund and customer contributions have combined to provide Autism Speaks with more than $5.5 million. Last year's in-store and online fundraising campaign raised more than $1.9 million for Autism Speaks. This year, for the first time, Toys\"R\"Us, Canada will lend its support to the cause by collecting donations in its nearly 70 stores and online at Toysrus.ca. About Autism Autism is a complex neurobiological disorder that inhibits a person's ability to communicate and develop social relationships, and is often accompanied by behavioral challenges. Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed in one in 110 children in the United States, affecting four times as many boys as girls. The prevalence of autism increased 57 percent from 2002 to 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called autism a national public health crisis whose cause and cure remain unknown. About Toys\"R\"Us, Inc.

As explained below, the undersigned finds that the Meads have not presented a scientifically sound theory,\" Special Master George Hastings, a former tax claims expert at the Department of Justice, wrote in his ruling. In February 2009, the court ruled against three families who claimed vaccines caused their children's autism, saying they had been \"misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment\". The families sought payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault system that has a $2.5 billion fund built up from a 75-cent-per-dose tax on vaccines. Instead of judges, three \"special masters\" heard the three test cases representing thousands of other petitioners. They asked whether a combination vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, plus a mercury-containing preservative called thimerosal, caused the children's symptoms. MYSTERIOUS CONDITION More than 5,300 cases were filed by parents who believed vaccines may have caused autism in their children. The no-fault payout system is meant to protect vaccine makers from costly lawsuits that drove many out of the vaccine-making business. Autism is a mysterious condition that affects as many as one in 110 U.S. children. The so-called spectrum ranges from mild Asperger's Syndrome to severe mental retardation and social disability, and there is no cure or good treatment. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has reported several times that no link can be found between vaccines and autism. Supporters of the scientific community welcomed the ruling. \"It's time to move forward and look for the real causes of autism,\" said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation. \"There is not a bottomless pit of money with which to fund autism science. We have to use our scarce resources wisely.\" But advocates for the idea that vaccines are dangerous said they would not give up. \"We hope that Congress will intervene in what is clearly a miscarriage of justice to vaccine-injured children,\" said Jim Moody of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety. Autism Speaks, another advocacy group, said it would also not completely abandon the theory that vaccines might cause autism. The organization said it would invest \"in research to determine whether subsets of individuals might be at increased risk for developing autism symptoms following vaccination.\" But the group also said it was clear that if such a link did exist, it would be rare. \"While we have great empathy for all parents of children with autism, it is important to keep in mind that, given the present state of the science, the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement.

We have added additional information and/or commentary in italics. Definition of Autism Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life. The result of a neurological disorder that affects the functioning of the brain, autism impacts the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Children and adults with autism typically have difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. (Autism Coach - Children with severe symptoms may not be able to speak or have a limited range of speech. They may also have difficulty understanding others through spoken and/or written communication. Children and adults with milder symptoms can speak but often have difficulty understanding the give and take of social interactions, reading other people's emotions and motivations accurately, and have difficulty carrying out day to day activities independently and in a timely fashion. Even an adult diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome or High Functioning Autism and an IQ of over 130 may not be able to live independently unless he or she is able to get along with co-workers, cope with sensory distractions in the workplace, appropriately allocate money to pay for food, rent, health care and other essentials, and meet other challenges that may arise.) Autism is one of five disorders coming under the umbrella of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), a category of neurological disorders characterized by severe and pervasive impairment in several areas of development, including social interaction and communications skills (DSM-IV-TR). The five disorders under PDD are Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD), Rett's Disorder, and PDD-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). Each of these disorders has specific diagnostic criteria as outlined by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in its Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). (Autism Coach - Labels given to individuals with milder symptoms of autism include High Functioning Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD NOS). Sometimes an individual may have have additional issues and may also be labeled with Hyperlexia, ADD, or ADHD, Tourette's Syndrome or Learning Disabled (LD) although children with these labels are frequently not within the autism spectrum. Frequently, high-functioning children are unlabeled or mislabeled for many years until someone knowledgeable about high functioning autism comes into contact with them.) Prevalence of Autism Autism is the most common of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders, affecting an estimated 2 to 6 per 1,000 individuals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001). This means that as many as 1.5 million Americans today are believed to have some form of autism. And that number is on the rise. Based on statistics from the U.S. Department of Education and other governmental agencies, autism is growing at a rate of 10-17 percent per year. At these rates, it is estimated that the prevalence of autism could reach 4 million Americans in the next decade. The overall incidence of autism is consistent around the globe, but is four times more prevalent in boys than girls. Autism knows no racial, ethnic, or social boundaries, and family income, lifestyle, and educational levels do not affect the chance of autism's occurrence. (Autism Coach - Clusters of higher incidence of autism have been found in certain areas of the U.S. - Brick County, New Jersey is one such example. Also, according to an article in Wired Magazine, there appears to be a higher incidence of autism amongst the children of scientists, musicians, programmers, and engineers - with a cluster of autism occurring in Silicon Valley, California.) Common Characteristics of Autism While understanding of autism has grown tremendously since it was first described by Dr. Leo Kanner in 1943, most of the public, including many professionals in the medical, educational, and vocational fields, are still unaware of how autism affects people and how they can effectively work with individuals with autism. Contrary to popular understanding, many children and adults with autism may make eye contact, show affection, smile and laugh, and demonstrate a variety of other emotions, although in varying degrees. Autism is a spectrum disorder. The symptoms and characteristics of autism can present themselves in a wide variety of combinations, from mild to severe. Two children, both with the same diagnosis, can act very differently from one another and have varying skills. All children with autism can learn, function productively and improve with appropriate education and treatment. (Autism Coach - substantial, and not infrequently, huge improvements are being made by children within the autism spectrum when the children are under the age of five and the behavioral and bio-medical issues are addressed through a comprehensive intervention program.) Every person with autism is an individual, and like all individuals, has a unique personality and combination of characteristics. Some individuals mildly affected may exhibit only slight delays in language and greater challenges with social interactions. The person may have difficulty initiating and/or maintaining a conversation. Communication is often described as talking at others (for example, monologue on a favorite subject that continues despite attempts by others to interject comments). People with autism process and respond to information in ways that differ from neurotypical (non-autistic) people. (Autism Coach - how individuals within the autism spectrum perceive incoming information through sight, hearing, touch, taste and balance, store and organize this information and retrieve information from memory may be the underlying issues contributing to autistic behavior, according to recent research). Persons with autism may also exhibit some of the following traits. Insistence on sameness; resistance to change Difficulty in expressing needs; uses gestures or pointing instead of words Repeating words or phrases in place of normal, responsive language Laughing, crying, showing distress for reasons not apparent to others Prefers to be alone; aloof manner Tantrums Difficulty in mixing with others May not want to cuddle or be cuddled Little or no eye contact Unresponsive to normal teaching methods Sustained odd play Spins objects Inappropriate attachments to objects Apparent over-sensitivity or under-sensitivity to pain No real fears of danger Noticeable physical over-activity or extreme under-activity Uneven gross/fine motor skills Not responsive to verbal cues; acts as if deaf although hearing tests in normal range. In some cases, aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior may be present. For most of us, the integration of our senses helps us to understand what we are experiencing. For example, our senses of touch, smell and taste work together in the experience of eating a ripe peach: the feel of the peach fuzz as we pick it up, its sweet smell as we bring it to our mouth, and the juices running down our face as we take a bite. For children with autism, sensory integration problems are common. Their senses may be over-or under-active. The fuzz on the peach may actually be experienced as painful; the smell may make the child gag. Some children with autism are particularly sensitive to sound, finding even the most ordinary daily noises painful. Many professionals feel that some of the typical autism behaviors are actually a result of sensory integration difficulties. (Autism Coach - some children who appear to be undersensitive to sensory input, such as hearing, may actually be overly sensitive and have tuned out sound completely because it is so unpleasant for them.) There are many myths and misconceptions about autism. Contrary to popular belief, many autistic children do make eye contact; it just may be less or different from a non-autistic child. Many children with autism can develop good functional language and others can develop some type of communication skills, such as sign language or use of pictures. (Autism Coach - According to some autistic children who are able to communicate through speech, typing or letter boards, they only process one form of sensory input at a time. If they are looking, they can't hear - so frequently they look away from someone who is talking to them so they can concentrate on understanding what the speaker is saying.) Diagnosing Autism An diagnosis of autism is based on observation of the individual's communication, behavior, and developmental levels. However, because many of the behaviors associated with autism are shared by other disorders, various medical tests may be ordered to rule out or identify other possible causes of the symptoms being exhibited. Autism may also co-occur with other conditions such as Tourette's Syndrome, seizure disorders, ADD, ADHD, and depression. It is important to distinguish autism from other conditions, since an accurate diagnosis and early identification can provide the basis for building an appropriate and effective educational and treatment program. (Autism Coach - In our opinion, it is important to identify and address underlying and related medical conditions. However, as a wise parent once said, Labels are for cans, not for kids! Our children are not a collection of labels. We must look beyond labels to the whole child we love, determine our child's strengths and areas of deficit, and then create an intervention program that allows that child to use his or her strengths to lay the groundwork for new learning and the acquisition of new skills and abilities.) Early Diagnosis Research indicates that early diagnosis is associated with dramatically better outcomes for individuals with autism. The earlier a child is diagnosed, the earlier the child can begin benefiting from one of the many specialized intervention approaches. (Autism Coach - We can't emphasize enough how important it is to begin treatment as early as possible!) Diagnostic Tools The characteristic behaviors of autism spectrum disorders may or may not be apparent in infancy (18 to 24 months), but usually become obvious during early childhood (24 months to 6 years). The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) lists these five behaviors that signal further evaluation is warranted: Does not babble or coo by 12 months Does not gesture (point, wave, grasp) by 12 months Does not say single words by 16 months Does not say two-word phrases on his or her own by 24 months Has any loss of any language or social skill at any age Having any of these five red flags does not mean a child has autism, but because the characteristics of the disorder vary so much, a child should have further evaluations by a multidisciplinary team that may include a neurologist, psychologist, developmental pediatrician, speech/language therapist, learning consultant, or other professionals knowledgeable about autism. While there is no one behavioral or communications test that can detect autism, several screening instruments have been developed that are now used in diagnosing autism. CARS rating system (Childhood Autism Rating Scale), developed by Eric Schopler in the early 1970s, is based on observed behavior. Using a 15-point scale, professionals evaluate a child's relationship to people, body use, adaptation to change, listening response, and verbal communication. The Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) is used to screen for autism at 18 months of age. It was developed by Simon Baron-Cohen in the early 1990s to see if autism could be detected in children as young as 18 months. The screening tool uses a short questionnaire with two sections, one prepared by the parents, the other by the child's family doctor or pediatrician. The Autism Screening Questionnaire is a 40 item screening scale that has been used with children four and older to help evaluate communication skills and social functioning. The Screening Test for Autism in Two-Year Olds, being developed by Wendy Stone at Vanderbilt, uses direct observations to study behavioral features in children under two. She has identified three skills areas - play, motor imitation, and joint attention - that seem to indicate autism.

Autism FAQ What is Autism? Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life. The result of a neurological disorder that affects the functioning of the brain, autism and its associated behaviors have been estimated to occur in as many as 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2001). Autism is four times more prevalent in boys than girls and knows no racial, ethnic, or social boundaries. Family income, lifestyle, and educational levels do not affect the chance of autism's occurrence. Autism impacts the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Children and adults with autism typically have difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. The disorder makes it hard for them to communicate with others and relate to the outside world. In some cases, aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior may be present. Persons with autism may exhibit repeated body movements (hand flapping, rocking), unusual responses to people or attachments to objects and resistance to changes in routines. Individuals may also experience sensitivities in the five senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. It is estimated that some 500,000 to 1,500,000 people in the U.S. today have autism or some form of pervasive developmental disorder. Its prevalence rate makes autism one of the most common developmental disabilities. Yet most of the public, including many professionals in the medical, educational, and vocational fields, are still unaware of how autism affects people and how they can effectively work with individuals with autism. Is There More Than One Type of Autism? Several related disorders are grouped under the broad heading Pervasive Developmental Disorder or PDD-a general category of disorders which are characterized by severe and pervasive impairment in several areas of development (American Psychiatric Association 1994). A standard reference is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), a diagnostic handbook now in its fourth edition. The DSM-IV lists criteria to be met for a specific diagnosis under the category of Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Diagnosis is made when a specified number of characteristics listed in the DSM-IV are present. Diagnostic evaluations are based on the presence of specific behaviors indicated by observation and through parent consultation, and should be made by an experienced, highly trained team. Thus, when professionals or parents are referring to different types of autism, often they are distinguishing autism from one of the other pervasive developmental disorders. Individuals who fall under the Pervasive Developmental Disorder category in the DSM-IV exhibit commonalties in communication and social deficits, but differ in terms of severity. We have outlined some major points that help distinguish the differences between the specific diagnoses used: Autistic Disorder impairments in social interaction, communication, and imaginative play prior to age 3 years. Stereotyped behaviors, interests and activities. Asperger's Disorder characterized by impairments in social interactions and the presence of restricted interests and activities, with no clinically significant general delay in language, and testing in the range of average to above average intelligence. Pervasive Developmental Disorder- Not Otherwise Specified (commonly referred to as atypical autism) a diagnosis of PDD-NOS may be made when a child does not meet the criteria for a specific diagnosis, but there is a severe and pervasive impairment in specified behaviors. Rett's Disorder a progressive disorder which, to date, has occurred only in girls. Period of normal development and then loss of previously acquired skills, loss of purposeful use of the hands replaced with repetitive hand movements beginning at the age of 1-4 years. Childhood Disintegrative Disorder characterized by normal development for at least the first 2 years, significant loss of previously acquired skills. (American Psychiatric Association 1994) Autism is a spectrum disorder. In other words, the symptoms and characteristics of autism can present themselves in a wide variety of combinations, from mild to severe. Although autism is defined by a certain set of behaviors, children and adults can exhibit any combination of the behaviors in any degree of severity. Two children, both with the same diagnosis, can act very differently from one another and have varying skills. Therefore, there is no standard type or typical person with autism. Parents may hear different terms used to describe children within this spectrum, such as: autistic-like, autistic tendencies, autism spectrum, high-functioning or low-functioning autism, more-abled or less-abled. More important to understand is, whatever the diagnosis, children can learn and function productively and show gains from appropriate education and treatment. The Autism Society of America provides information to serve the needs of all individuals within the spectrum. Diagnostic categories have changed over the years as research progresses and as new editions of the DSM have been issued. For that reason, we will use the term autism to refer to the above disorders. What Causes Autism? Researchers from all over the world are devoting considerable time and energy into finding the answer to this critical question. Medical researchers are exploring different explanations for the various forms of autism. Although a single specific cause of autism is not known, current research links autism to biological or neurological differences in the brain. In many families there appears to be a pattern of autism or related disabilities - which suggests there is a genetic basis to the disorder - although at this time no gene has been directly linked to autism. The genetic basis is believed by researchers to be highly complex, probably involving several genes in combination. Several outdated theories about the cause of autism have been proven to be false. Autism is not a mental illness. Children with autism are not unruly kids who choose not to behave. Autism is not caused by bad parenting. Furthermore, no known psychological factors in the development of the child have been shown to cause autism. How is Autism Diagnosed? There are no medical tests for diagnosing autism. An accurate diagnosis must be based on observation of the individual's communication, behavior, and developmental levels. However, because many of the behaviors associated with autism are shared by other disorders, various medical tests may be ordered to rule out or identify other possible causes of the symptoms being exhibited. Since the characteristics of the disorder vary so much, ideally a child should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team which may include a neurologist, psychologist, developmental pediatrician, speech/language therapist, learning consultant, or another professional knowledgeable about autism. Diagnosis is difficult for a practitioner with limited training or exposure to autism. Sometimes, autism has been misdiagnosed by well-meaning professionals. Difficulties in the recognition and acknowledgment of autism often lead to a lack of services to meet the complex needs of individuals with autism. A brief observation in a single setting cannot present a true picture of an individual's abilities and behaviors. Parental (and other caregivers') input and developmental history are very important components of making an accurate diagnosis. At first glance, some persons with autism may appear to have mental retardation, a behavior disorder, problems with hearing, or even odd and eccentric behavior. To complicate matters further, these conditions can co-occur with autism. However, it is important to distinguish autism from other conditions, since an accurate diagnosis and early identification can provide the basis for building an appropriate and effective educational and treatment program. Sometimes professionals who are not knowledgeable about the needs and opportunities for early intervention in autism do not offer an autism diagnosis even if it is appropriate. This hesitation may be due to a misguided wish to spare the family. Unfortunately, this too can lead to failure to obtain appropriate services for the child. What are common symptoms of Autism? Children within the pervasive developmental disorder spectrum often appear relatively normal in their development until the age of 24-30 months, when parents may notice delays in language, play or social interaction. Any of the following delays, by themselves, would not result in a diagnosis of a pervasive developmental disorder. Autism is a combination of several developmental challenges. The following areas are among those that may be affected by autism: Communication: Language develops slowly or not at all; uses words without attaching the usual meaning to them; communicates with gestures instead of words; short attention span; Social Interaction: Spends time alone rather than with others; shows little interest in making friends; less responsive to social cues such as eye contact or smiles; Sensory Impairment: May have sensitivities in the areas of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste to a greater or lesser degree; Play: Lack of spontaneous or imaginative play; does not imitate others' actions; does not initiate pretend games; Behaviors: May be overactive or very passive; throws tantrums for no apparent reason; perseverates (shows an obsessive interest in a single item, idea, activity or person); apparent lack of common sense; may show aggression to others or self; often has difficulty with changes in routine. Some individuals with autism may also have other disorders which affect the functioning of the brain such as: Epilepsy, Mental Retardation, Down Syndrome, or genetic disorders such as: Fragile X Syndrome, Landau-Kleffner Syndrome, William's Syndrome or Tourette's Syndrome. Many of those diagnosed with autism will test in the range of mental retardation. Approximately 25-30 percent may develop a seizure pattern at some period during life. Every person with autism is an individual, and like all individuals, has a unique personality and combination of characteristics. There are great differences among people with autism. Some individuals mildly affected may exhibit only slight delays in language and greater challenges with social interactions. The person may have difficulty initiating and/or maintaining a conversation, or keeping a conversation going. Communication is often described as talking at others (for example, monologue on a favorite subject that continues despite attempts of others to interject comments). People with autism process and respond to information in unique ways. Educators and other service providers must consider the unique pattern of learning strengths and difficulties in the individual with autism when assessing learning and behavior to ensure effective intervention. Individuals with autism can learn when information about their unique styles of receiving and expressing information is addressed and implemented in their programs. The abilities of an individual with autism may fluctuate from day to day due to difficulties in concentration, processing, or anxiety. The child may show evidence of learning one day, but not the next. Changes in external stimuli and anxiety can affect learning. They may have average or above average verbal, memory or spatial skills but find it difficult to be imaginative or join in activities with others. Individuals with more severe challenges may require intensive support to manage the basic tasks and needs of living day to day. Contrary to popular understanding, many children and adults with autism may make eye contact, show affection, smile and laugh, and demonstrate a variety of other emotions, although in varying degrees. Like other children, they respond to their environment in both positive and negative ways. Autism may affect their range of responses and make it more difficult to control how their bodies and minds react. Sometimes visual, motor, and/or processing problems make it difficult to maintain eye contact with others. Some individuals with autism use peripheral vision rather than looking directly at others. Sometimes the touch or closeness of others may be painful to a person with autism, resulting in withdrawal even from family members. Anxiety, fear and confusion may result from being unable to make sense of the world in a routine way. With appropriate treatment, some behaviors associated with autism may change or diminish over time. The communication and social deficits continue in some form throughout life, but difficulties in other areas may fade or change with age, education, or level of stress. Often, the person begins to use skills in natural situations and to participate in a broader range of interests and activities. Many individuals with autism enjoy their lives and contribute to their community in a meaningful way. People with autism can learn to compensate for and cope with their disability, often quite well. While no one can predict the future, it is known that some adults with autism live and work independently in the community (drive a car, earn a college degree, get married); some may be fairly independent in the community and only need some support for daily pressures; while others depend on much support from family and professionals. Adults with autism can benefit from vocational training to provide them with the skills needed for obtaining jobs, in addition to social and recreational programs. Adults with autism may live in a variety of residential settings, ranging from an independent home or apartment to group homes, supervised apartment settings, living with other family members or more structured residential care. An increasing number of support groups for adults with autism are emerging around the country. Many self-advocates are forming networks to share information, support each other, and speak for themselves in the public arena. More frequently, people with autism are attending and/or speaking at conferences and workshops on autism. Individuals with autism are providing valuable insight into the challenges of this disability by publishing articles and books and appearing in television specials about themselves and their disabilities. What are the Most Effective Approaches? Evidence shows that early intervention results in dramatically positive outcomes for young children with autism. While various pre-school models emphasize different program components, all share an emphasis on early, appropriate, and intensive educational interventions for young children. Other common factors may be: some degree of inclusion, mostly behaviorally-based interventions, programs which build on the interests of the child, extensive use of visuals to accompany instruction, highly structured schedule of activities, parent and staff training, transition planning and follow-up. Because of the spectrum nature of autism and the many behavior combinations which can occur, no one approach is effective in alleviating symptoms of autism in all cases. Various types of therapies are available, including (but not limited to) applied behavior analysis, auditory integration training, dietary interventions, discrete trial teaching, medications, music therapy, occupational therapy, PECS, physical therapy, sensory integration, speech/language therapy, TEACH, and vision therapy. Studies show that individuals with autism respond well to a highly structured, specialized education program, tailored to their individual needs. A well designed intervention approach may include some elements of communication therapy, social skill development, sensory integration therapy and applied behavior analysis, delivered by trained professionals in a consistent, comprehensive and coordinated manner. The more severe challenges of some children with autism may be best addressed by a structured education and behavior program which contains a one-on-one teacher to student ratio or small group environment. However, many other children with autism may be successful in a fully inclusive general education environment with appropriate support. In addition to appropriate educational supports in the area of academics, students with autism should have training in functional living skills at the earliest possible age. Learning to cross a street safely, to make a simple purchase or to ask assistance when needed are critical skills, and may be difficult, even for those with average intelligence levels. Tasks that enhance the person's independence and give more opportunity for personal choice and freedom in the community are important. To be effective, any approach should be flexible in nature, rely on positive reinforcement, be re-evaluated on a regular basis and provide a smooth transition from home to school to community environments. A good program will also incorporate training and support systems for parents and caregivers, with generalization of skills to all settings. Rarely can a family, classroom teacher or other caregiver provide effective habilitation for a person with autism unless offered consultation or in-service training by an experienced specialist who is knowledgeable about the disability. A generation ago, the vast majority of the people with autism were eventually placed in institutions. Professionals were much less educated about autism than they are today; autism specific supports and services were largely non-existent. Today the picture is brighter. With appropriate services, training, and information, most families are able to support their son or daughter at home. Group homes, assisted apartment living arrangements, or residential facilities offer more options for out of home support. Autism-specific programs and services provide the opportunity for individuals to be taught skills which allow them to reach their fullest potential. Families of people with autism can experience high levels of stress. As a result of the challenging behaviors of their children, relationships with service providers, attempting to secure appropriate services, resulting financial hardships, or very busy schedules, families often have difficulty participating in typical community activities. This results in isolation and difficulty in developing needed community supports. Members of the ASA represent all walks of life from rural to metropolitan communities. Embracing the diversity of our group, the ASA seeks to provide an open forum for the exchange of ideas. At the very core of the ASA philosophy is the belief that no single program or treatment will benefit all individuals with autism. Furthermore, the recommendation of what is best or most effective for a person with autism should be determined by those people directly involved with the individual with autism, to the extent possible, and the parents or family members. The ASA provides information to assist parents, educators, and others in the decision-making process. Providing information on available intervention options, rather than advocating for any particular theory or philosophy, is the focus at the ASA. Is There a Cure? Understanding of autism has grown tremendously since it was first described by Dr. Leo Kanner in 1943. Some of the earlier searches for cures now seem unrealistic in terms of today's understanding of brain-based disorders. To cure means to restore to health, soundness, or normality. In the medical sense, there is no cure for the differences in the brain which result in autism. However, better understanding of the disorder has led to the development of better coping mechanisms and strategies for the various manifestations of the disability. Some of these symptoms may lessen as the child ages; others may disappear altogether. With appropriate intervention, many of the associated behaviors can be positively changed, even to the point in some cases, that the child or adult may appear to the untrained person to no longer have autism. The majority of children and adults will, however, continue to exhibit some manifestations of autism to some degree throughout their entire lives. What is the Autism Society of America? Founded in 1965 by a small group of parents, the Autism Society of America (ASA) continues to be the leading source of information and referral on autism and the largest collective voice representing the autism community for more than 33 years. Today, more than 24,000 members are connected through a volunteer network of over 200 chapters across the United States. The mission of the Autism Society of America is to promote lifelong access and opportunities for persons within the autism spectrum and their families, to be fully included, participating members of their communities through advocacy, public awareness, education, and research related to autism. In addition to its volunteer Board of Directors, composed primarily of parents of individuals with autism, the ASA has a Panel of Professional Advisors, comprised of nationally known and respected professionals who provide expertise and guidance to the Society on a volunteer basis. The ASA is dedicated to increasing public awareness about autism and the day-to-day issues faced by individuals with autism, their families, and the professionals with whom they interact. The Society and its chapters share common goals of providing information and education, supporting research, and advocating for programs and services for the autism community. Myths of Autism? MYTH!

Its prevalence rate makes it the second most common developmental disability-even more common than Down Syndrome. By conservative estimate, more than 400,000 people in the U.S. today have some form of autism. In North Carolina, between 25,000 and 30,000 individuals have been diagnosed with the condition. It is a lifelong disability with no known cure at this time. The symptoms of autism tend to appear very early in life, usually within the first three years. In general, these include: Significant problems in language development Significant problems with understanding and engaging in social interactions Inconsistent sensory response patterns-for instance, periods when hearing appears to function normally and periods of apparent deafness Uneven pattern of intellectual development Significant, highly-focused restriction of interests and activities The symptoms and characteristics of autism can present themselves in a variety of combinations and with a range of severity from mild to severe, so two children with the same diagnosis of autism can act very differently from one another and have very different skills, abilities and functioning levels.

Other characteristics include: engagement in repetitive activities, resistance to environmental change, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The range of severity can be from extremely mild to severe. Autism is a behavioral disorder, not an illness or disease. It typically appears by age three and is a lifelong condition. There is no known cure, although there are documented cases of symptoms being reduced and even some children losing their diagnosis alltogether. Although autism affects the functions of the brain, the specific cause is not known. FAST FACTS ABOUT AUTISM Autism Spectrum Disorder Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an increasingly popular term that refers to a broad definition of autism including the classic form of the disorder as well as closely related disabilities that share many of the core characteristics. Although the classic form of autism can be readily distinguished from other forms of ASD, the terms autism and ASD are often used interchangeably. ASD includes the following classifications: (1) Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) Refers to a collection of features that resemble autism but may not be as severe or extensive. Also known as mild or atypical autism. Many with PDD-NOS are deemed high functioning. (2) Asperger Syndrome (AS) Individuals with AS show crippling deficiencies in social skills. They have difficulties with transitions and prefer sameness. They often have obsessive routines and may be preoccupied with a particular subject of interest. They have a great deal of difficulty reading nonverbal cues (body language) and very often the individual with AS has difficulty determining proper body space. Often overly sensitive to sounds, tastes, smells, and sights, the person with AS may prefer soft clothing, certain foods, and be bothered by sounds or lights no one else seems to hear or see. Those with Asperger's typically have a normal to above average IQ and many (not all) exhibit exceptional abilities or talents in specific areas of interest. (3) Rett's Syndrome A rare disorder affecting girls. It's a genetic disorder with hard neurological signs, including seizures, that become more apparent with age. Hypotonia (loss of muscle tone) is usually the first symptom then followed by hand-wringing stereotypy. The syndrome affects approximately 1 in every 10,000-15,000 live female births. The gene causing the disorder has now been identified. (4) Childhood Disintegrative Disorder Refers to children whose development appears normal for the first few years, but then regresses with the loss of speech and other skills until the characteristics of autism are exhibited. Deterioration of intellectual, social, and language skills over a period of several months is commonly seen. Individuals with autism and ASD vary widely in ability and personality. In fact, it's been said that there are no two autistic individuals who are the same. They can fall anywhere on a spectrum, ranging from severe mental retardation all the way to being extremely gifted in their intellectual and academic accomplishments. While many individuals prefer isolation and tend to withdraw from social contact, others show high levels of affection and enjoy social situations. Some people with autism appear lethargic and slow to respond but others are very active and seem to interact constantly with preferred aspects of their environment.

Autism is a disorder that severely impairs a person's ability to communicate, interact socially, and think. Autism also impairs many processes throughout the body. It affects the brain and central nervous system, and a growing body of research indicates that the immune system, the gastro-intestinal tract and other bodily systems may also be affected. Some children seem to have autism from birth. Another group appears to develop normally up to sometime between 12 to 36 months and then lose abilities such as language and social skills. People with autism have great difficulty learning from the natural environment as most people do. A child with autism frequently shows little interest in the world or people around them. Many children with autism never learn to talk. Autism inhibits a child's growth and development to such a degree that a large portion of people with the disorder require lifelong support. Autism is diagnosed by the observation of commonly found symptoms, not by a blood test or other objective medical technique. And the number and severity of symptoms range greatly from person to person. Consequently, autism is consider a spectrum disorder with subgroups including Asperger\ufffds syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Delay-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) among others. How common is autism?Autism is an out-of-control epidemic growing at a rate of about 20% per year. Twenty-five years ago autism was an extremely rare condition--now it is the leading disabling disease of children in the United States. Twenty-five years ago autism afflicted 1 in 5,000 children, now 1 in 150 has it. Recent studies have shown autism spectrum disorders affecting as many as one in fifty boys in some regions. What causes autism?Autism is a list of symptoms rather than a biologically identifiable disease and a number medical conditions are know to cause autism including of tuberous sclerosis, and two genetic disorders are known to cause autistic symptoms , Rett\ufffds syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. In utero exposure to thalidomide is also known to cause autistic symptoms. However, these causes cannot explain the vast majority of cases. Up until the 1970s the prevailing accepted theory blamed autism on bad mothering. Fortunately, this scientifically invalid theory was completely discredited through the efforts of the parents of autistic children. A great deal of research has been done on the possibility that autism is a genetically determined disorder due to the high proportion of identical twins who both have autism, and the tendency of autism to affect multiple members of the same families. Despite the effort no gene has yet been identified as a reliable predictor of autism. And the growing incidence of autism argues against a genetic cause. Many researchers believe that the evidence indicates that genetically-susceptible children acquire autism through early exposure to some insult from the environment such as viruses, heavy metals, or possibly even vaccines. Is there a cure?There is no known wonder drug or treatment that can cure reliably cure autism. There are a wide variety of treatments and methods that have relieved some of the symptoms in some autism victims. Some people with autism can improve to the extent that they can attend ordinary schools, hold jobs and have relatively normal social lives. Some of the medical interventions that have helped some people with autism include: Intensive early educational intervention Physical therapy Occupational therapy Sensory integration therapy Speech therapy Chelation therapy Gluten/Casein-free diets Applied behavior Omega fatty acids Psychotropic drugs This list should not be construed as an endorsement of any particular therapy by Autism United but as an illustrative list of therapies that some parents have reported as efficacious. genetic brain genetic fragile x syndrome United States PDD-NOS Pervasive Developmental Delay-Not Otherwise Specified Physical therapy Occupational Anti-fungal Psychotropic www.autismunited.org/about-autism applied behavior analysis occupational therapy physical therapy Autism379 http://www.bradenton.com/2010/03/12/2127072/court-says-thimerosal-did-not.html But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case.The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court.The parents presented expert witnesses who argued mercury can have a variety of effects on the brain, but the ruling said none of them offered opinions on the cause of autism in the three specific cases argued. They testified that mercury can affect a number of biological processes, including abnormal metabolism in children.Special master Denise K. Vowell noted that in order to succeed in their action, the parents would have to show \"the exquisitely small amounts of mercury\" that reach the brain from vaccines can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts ... from other sources do not. The ruling said the parents were arguing that the effects from mercury in vaccines differ from mercury's known effects on the brain. Vowell concluded that the parents had failed to establish that their child's condition was caused or aggravated by mercury from vaccines.Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines.The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism.The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available.The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had \"already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.\"But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, \"it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them.\"On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. brain Congress U.S. Court of Federal Claims Denise K.

The study reports that a kind of genetic testing method known as a chromosomal microarray analysis \ufffd CMA for short \ufffd is about three times better at finding genetic variants related to autism-spectrum disorders than the two kinds of tests currently used. Researchers from Children\ufffds Hospital Boston and their colleagues ran the tests on DNA samples from 933 patients age 13 months to 22 years. All were diagnosed with autism-spectrum disorders. Here\ufffds how the tests stacked up: A karyotyping test, which analyzes the size, shape and number of chromosomes, found \ufffdabnormal results\ufffd in 2.23% of patients. A test for Fragile X syndrome, a genetic condition known to cause autistic behavior, found abnormal results in 0.46% of patients. The CMA test, which looked for telltale duplications and deletions of DNA, found abnormal results in 7.3% of patients. Clearly, the CMA test was most effective, and the study\ufffds authors say the test should be offered to patients as a first-line test. \ufffdCMA clearly detects more abnormalities than other genetic tests that have been the standard of care for many years,\ufffd said study coauthor Dr. David Miller, of the hospital\ufffds Division of Genetics and its Department of Laboratory Medicine, in a statement. \ufffdWe\ufffdre hoping this evidence will convince insurance companies to cover this testing universally.\ufffd However, for the overwhelming majority of patients who take it, the test won\ufffdt turn up anything suspicious. That\ufffds not necessarily surprising, considering that only about 15% of autism cases have a known genetic cause.

The money raised will help fund further research into autism. \"What we do in our research area is look to improve early detection of autism and research for better and more effective ways to deliver quality intervention to more people at a lower cost,\" said Dr. Christopher Smith, Vice President/Research Director for SARRC. Smith said the money raised will help fund more technology-based interventions and treatments. \"We want to do more telemedecine, which helps deliver treatments and interventions to more people,\" he said. Sanderson Ford Lincoln Mercury and Volvo, one of the presenting sponsors of the event, presented a $10,000 check to SARRC. David Kimmerle, president of Sanderson Ford Lincoln Mercury and Volvo, said he and his family have been touched by everyone at SARRC. \"We're just trying to make it easier for the families of kids affected by autism affected by the condition because they need our help,\" he said. The Arizona Diamondbacks Foundation gave $100,000 to the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center Tuesday. Other large donors during the 14-hour radiothon included Jaburg & Wilk, Attorneys at Law, $20,000, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, $15,000, and Tiffany & Bosco Law Firm, $10,000. The D-backs Foundation gave one of its three $100,000 Grand Slam grants to SARRC's Good Deed Works Training Center. It is a program created to provide teens with autism spectrum disorders training, mentoring and volunteer experiences at community venues. \"Through SARRC's new D-backs Good Deed Works program, everyone wins,\" said SARRC founder Denise Resnik. \"Our teens with autism increase their skill sets and build self-esteem, leading to greater independence. \"Peer mentors gain increased understanding and compassion for those with autism. And this year alone, 20 Valley non-profits will benefit from thousands of volunteer service hours and gain appreciation for the talents and abilities of individuals with autism.\" Parents of children with autism told stories of their children's success during the radiothon. Stephanie Papadopoulos said one of her triplets, Eleni, has autism. She said Eleni got her first friend at the age of 8 years, because of help from SARRC. Eleni's friend's mom heard Stephanie's story on the air and called in to donate. She was one of many. In the first 10 hours of the radiothon, over $270,000 was raised. The effort continues until 7 o'clock tonight. KTAR program director Russ Hill said the 14-hour radiothon is meant to \"raise awareness and funds for SARRC. \" \"Giving back is extremely important to the people who work at KTAR,\" Hill said. \"Hundreds of thousands of Valley residents tune into KTAR every day and it's important that we give back to the community. We're a part of the community and it's our way of giving back.\" Ned Foster and Connie Weber, hosts of \"Arizona's Morning News,\" and sports anchor Paul Calvisi opened the radiothon with an appeal to listeners to dig deep, even though the economy is strained, to help out. Calvisi joked with listeners that they should \"skip the right turn at Starbucks\" once a week and donate $12 a month to SARRC. SARRC is a resource for parents who have children with autism. It also funds research into autism. Scott Celley with TriWest Healthcare Alliance was among those joining the fund-raising effort. He said SARRC's reputation is known far and wide, extending to the U.S. Defense Department. The burdens of parents with partners serving overseas can be lightened by programs like SARRC has, Celley said. He said the U.S. owes military families who need help with their kids and SARRC is part of that equation. Sergio Penaloza's son was diagnosed with autism at 2 years old. He said his son struggled with his colors and speech, but with the help of SARRC's Jump Start program, the now 10-year-old is markedly improved. \"He's starting to correct himself. He's communicating at a higher level.\" Penaloza said. He said SARRC \"absolutely\" has been a part of his son's improvement. Right after his son was diagnosed, Penaloza said SARRC provided a \"roadmap\" of what resources parents have to help children with autism. Penaloza is on the Board of Directors of SAARC and his employer, Cox Communications, donated $5,000. They also matched, dollar-for-dollar, some call-in donations from listeners.

She had numerous things going on that day, but she was moving at a good pace mainly to get out of the rain that had begun falling. It was and remains a busy time for Els. Her husband, Ernie, was working that week but doing it at home rather than jetting off somewhere for an out-of-town tournament. It was The Honda Classic in nearby Palm Beach Gardens. An Els family tradition saw them open their home to a houseful of guests who routinely travel to South Florida for that tournament. With all that going on as a backdrop, Liezl was also thinking about another upcoming golf tournament. As she sat down at the spacious conference table, hanging on the wall behind her was an artist s rendering of the Els Center of Excellence, a proposed academic village that will bring together the components of education, medical treatment and research for children on the autism spectrum. The Els 7-year-old son, Ben, is autistic. A year ago, the first Els for Autism Pro-Am attracted PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players playing alongside amateurs and netted $725,000, which went to The Renaissance Learning Center, a non-profit Palm Beach County public charter school for autism. The plan is for the Renaissance Learning Center to eventually become part of the Els Center of Excellence. When complete, the facility will be a model for the nation, providing children on the autism spectrum with a self-contained educational environment. The second annual fundraising tournament was only 13 days away. Since going public about Ben s autism two years ago, the Elses have been passionate about not only helping their son but assisting others affected by autism. On that rainy South Florida day, Liezl sat down with Laury Livsey to talk about the tournament, their goals for the Els Center of Excellence and the progress Ben has made. How long was it before you knew Ben wasn t progressing like other children his age?He didn t have to grow for us to know that there was something not quite right. Right from the start he wasn t like Samantha (the Els daughter). But I think like an ostrich I did try and hide with my head in the sand and pretend that nothing was wrong. Everyone tries to be nice around you. They would say no, boys are slow in developing. My son only did this and this at that age, and my son only did that. And I think you take comfort from that for a while, although in your heart you know right from the word go that he is different. What did you think when you heard the word autism?Initially there were some other diagnoses, and eventually it became something somewhere on the autism spectrum. We took it from there. The diagnosis didn t change the treatment. It just gave us direction as a husband and wife and a way to make peace with who he was and why he was like that. How did you and Ernie deal with the news?As a woman, because historically we are the nurturers, I think it s easier for us to accept and move on and so be it. Men are more analytical, saying things like Why did it happen? How can I cure it? How can I stop it from happening to anyone else? I think the combination is what got us to the point where we wanted to put up this Center, so all those whys can be answered. On the other side, we can also take care of the kids who already have autism while we re taking care of the whys. Ben s condition is just part of your life now. Are you at peace with that?I think I always knew I was going to have a child with special needs. I don t know why. I don t have anyone with special needs in my family. I just knew if anybody was going to get that challenge, I probably would. I ve always said whatever happens, whatever kids are given to us, we will be given the strength to deal with it. I strongly believe in that. Always have and always will. When I look at our daily life, our family situation, and especially at Samantha, this beautiful little girl who is good at everything she puts her hands onto, she s just a wonderful, all-around child. Then I look at Ben, and Ben was given to us to keep our lives in perspective. Ben does not get affected by your bank balance. Ben doesn t care about how many cameras flash in your face. He s there to keep you sane. I shudder to think, really, what we would be like without Ben because of this fool s paradise we live in. He comes to set the record straight. He s the reality check. He s so real and so true and so honest and so funny. He helps us to understand what s really important and what life is really about. As you ve learned more about the autism spectrum, how did you come to the conclusion that you wanted to do something like the Els Center of Excellence?That was a problem for us. If we just went into research, what are we going to do with the kids who are already out there? Schools are definitely lacking, and those that are in existence are all really, really struggling. How did you land on what you re proposing, with everything under, essentially, one roof?We want to combine everything the research side as well as the schooling side and the therapy. If you listen to a lot of these parents, they are driving half of their day taking their kids to therapy. Here, the therapy and school will all be under one roof. We can have a big sports facility so we can even have special sports education for the kids there, which, again, is something that currently we have to go elsewhere for. It s either a half-hour north of us or a half-hour south of us. But if you show parents that this is all happening under one roof, I mean, how blissful. Let s make their lives, which have already been turned upside down, as easy and as comfortable as we can. You made the decision to go public with Ben s issue. How difficult was that? I have to admit that Ernie was the one who decided to go as public as we did two years ago. We had a conversation, and he said to me, I think the time is right for us to openly talk about this. We never knew what a big impact that would have, especially the fact that it was Ernie talking about it. It affected so many males out there. The letters, the phone calls, the e-mails we got, even the responses I got just walking along the golf course from men who came up saying that I had no idea what it meant to them that Ernie spoke about this and shared his pain and the time it took for him to get over this. That made it all worthwhile. How did things change for your family once you went public?From that point, our life became completely crazy. It was like it was someone else s life. There was a little bit of negative with questions about why we didn t come out earlier. Why were we doing it now? It was like it was the first moment that Ernie and I realized that our son had something different about him. You can t blame people. Everyone is so passionate about their kids and the help they ve given their children. You just have to say, this is how we handle it. With two years behind you after going public, are you used to being one of the faces of autism?It was tough, just the madness. If you have to compare it to anything, it s like winning a major. That madness that follows. It was similar to the madness of winning a major. The positives from it far, far outweighed the negatives, though. And in the beginning, I was the scared one. Should we? Shouldn t we? I was still wanting to hide. Now I guess I m leading the charge. Parents, charity, media. They wanted Ernie s time all of a sudden, and they just didn t want our time, they wanted the kids time, too. We knew that was going to happen, but we re so fiercely protective of our children at the same time. We live a public life every day, so it s weird. We are trying to protect the family, which is always the main concern and has always stayed the focus. But we want to give a little bit to help other people, and that is not a big suffering. That has to be said. Autism is such a unique disorder, and it seems there isn t a one-size-fits-all treatment. How will the Center help everybody who is touched by autism?One of my main goals is that we have to listen to everyone. It s probably impossible. But you have to take everyone s advice, read it through, run it past your panel of advisors and the people who are supposed to know everything in every field. Is this a viable thing? Do you think this can work, even for just one child? If so, then we owe it to that one child to train him or her or school him or her in that method. We have to really concentrate on individually teaching each of these kids. It s something that s happening already, but we d like to take it just that one step further. You changed your life dramatically at the same time, moving from England back to the U.S. Wasn t Ben s situation the main reason?We moved to America specifically for the schooling. Florida was always going to be our No. 1 choice, and we have an existing network of friends and colleagues down in this area. Of course we lived in Orlando prior, but this area has always been close to our hearts. Was there a specific school that drew you here?If you go down there, it s a little, bitty place. It s a one-story, pre-fab classroom, and they have 64 kids, with double that on the wait list. We found this perfect little school down the road, and it just all made sense for us to move here. It was the perfect spot. The teaching is great; it s the facilities that are tough. The Els Center of Excellence began taking shape in your minds then? It was already fundraising for a $10-million school but just a school. I started getting involved in that with them and helped with their fundraising. There is some wonderful, wonderful work being done research-wise out there, at the moment, and there are millions and millions of dollars being spent on it. But a much smaller proportion is being spent on the schooling of the kids. We really strongly thought we needed to put it into the school. We came up with a new idea. Why don t we do the school and do a research facility. From there, we started talking, and it grew and grew and grew and it ended up being a $30 million-plus project. So you go from helping with fundraising to it mushrooming into a $30-million project. How daunting has that been?The number was daunting but the project is exciting. When you lay it out and you see what your fundraising scheme is and how you need to do it, all of a sudden it s not that daunting anymore. If you tell someone you need $1 million from them tomorrow, it sounds tough. But if you ask someone if they would be willing to do a million dollars over five years which would be $200,000 a year towards a project that will after five years be self-sustainable, suddenly it s a project with an end result. That s basically our main fundraising basis. Will there be any other place in the world like what you re proposing?There aren t any other centers that incorporate everything that we want to incorporate. It s a good project. It has a huge future. It will be so wonderful if we can get one open to be a role model for others to follow. If people see something working, and it s successful and not that hard to do, then people will be much more willing to be involved in the next project. That s our aim not just to build this one but in Africa and throughout the rest of the world. The golf event is a major part of your fundraising goals. Are you impressed with the level of participation by your husband s fellow pros who are willing to help?Players are very sympathetic toward each other when it comes to things like this. We do see us as part of a family. They know Ernie has the event, and they ask to help. The fact that he is out there and is so open about Ben makes it so you re not going around explaining to people why you re having this day. They already know Ernie s son has autism. It s heartwarming because a lot of the amateurs who are paying to play, 75 percent of the people who are coming have a family member or a friend who has a child who is affected by the autism spectrum. At this point, autism is just a part of your family s life. What s a normal day like for Ben? He wakes up very early in the morning and storms into the room and says good morning to everyone. We have a room in our house where he can play a car-driving video game. He loves that, and it s perfect for me in early mornings because I can steer him there and he ll be busy with that. Ernie will take Samantha to school, and Ben goes about a half an hour after her. He has a teacher who helps him out at school, and she goes for half a day to do some one-on-one teaching with him. Just a little bit of extra work. She ll then bring him home in the afternoon after he s had his sport at school. And then it s whatever we can fit into the afternoon. His favorite thing to do is to go down to the beach to the turtle sanctuary. He ll go and check out the turtles. He absolutely loves that, to see what they re doing. He ll spend about 45 minutes there, then if it s a good day he goes to the beach for a while. He loves the ocean, loves the beach, loves the waves. His next favorite thing is the monkey bars. Then it s dinner and bedtime. Ernie will give him a bath. It s Ernie s favorite thing to do. Ben s not tough to put to bed. He loves his sleep. We just can t keep him in bed in the morning. Just a normal family, right?I m very lucky that I have help. We ve always had someone who is here to assist me. It helps when we re going in two different directions. In the mornings when Ben doesn t have to be at school that early, depending on his therapy, I can take him with, drop Samantha at the bus stop, come back and take Ben to his bus especially when Ernie is traveling. But on the mornings when he has to have an early morning, it s a challenge and it s always lovely to have an extra set of hands. Samantha is already 10 1/2 and she s a big help. She s very good with Ben, and you can send him to do a bunch of different things with her. She s a normal 10 1/2-year-old. She ll sometimes complain bitterly on the days when she doesn t want to do it. But she s very good with him, and she loves her brother. And he loves her.

These signs all begin before a child is three years old. Autism involves many parts of the brain. How it occurs is not well understood. There is no cure for Autism. The main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Many medications are used to treat autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. More than half of U.S. children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics. The Xcell-Center Autism treatment The XCell-Center's stem cell therapy is a drug-free alternative focused on affecting physical changes in the brain that can improve an autistic child's quality of life. These improvements usually translate into improved quality of life for their parents and siblings as well. In a recent pilot study of 10 autistic patients, more than 70% of the respondents showed improvement. Autism patients are treated by lumbar puncture; injecting the stem cells into the cerebrospinal fluid which transports them up the spinal canal and into the brain. Lumbar puncture is an outpatient procedure that requires patients to stay in Germany 4 or 5 nights. Bone Marrow Collection On the first day, bone marrow is collected from the patient's iliac crest (hip bone) using thin-needle mini-puncture under general anesthesia. The entire procedure normally takes about 30 minutes. Because the bone marrow collection procedure requires patients to sit still, it is performed under general anesthesia for children and older patients who for any reason cannot keep still. Once the bone marrow collection is complete, patients may return to their hotel and go about normal activities after a short recovery period in the clinic. More detailed information on the bone marrow collection procedure is available in the Bone Marrow Informed Consent document (PDF file). Laboratory Processing The next day, the stem cells are processed from the bone marrow in a state-of-the-art, government approved (cGMP) laboratory. In the lab, both the quantity and quality of the stem cells are measured. These cells have the potential to transform into multiple types of cells and are capable of regenerating or repairing damaged tissue. Stem Cell Implantation On the third day, the stem cells are implanted back into the patient by lumbar puncture. Lumbar Puncture A spinal needle is inserted between L4 and L5 vertebrae and a small amount of spinal fluid is removed. A portion of that spinal fluid is mixed with the stem cell solution which is then injected into back into the patient's spinal fluid, not the spinal cord. After the stem cells have been implanted, the patient will lie down in the recovery room for a few hours before returning to his or her hotel room. The lumbar puncture procedure is performed under general anesthesia for children and older patients who cannot sit still. Following Treatment Patients who are treated by lumbar puncture are required to stay in town on the day after their procedure for general safety purposes. They may return home on the fifth day. Treatment Results Follow-up statistics from 7 treated autism patients completed in September 2009 show that over 70% (5 of 7) experienced improvements after stem cell therapy. The mean age of the patients was 10 years, while the median age was 9.5 years. The oldest treated patient was 16 years of age and the youngest 5. There was no apparent correlation between positive outcome and the number of stem cells administered. Overall, patients reported improvements in cognition, language, social contact, eye contact, coordination, motor skills and awareness Below is a summary of results for 4 of the 5 patients who improved after treatment: Patient #1 - (M) Age 6 - Treated May 2009 Improved cognition and sensory processing Patient can now climb onto the trampoline by himself, and play on it for about 20 minutes. Before the treatment, he screamed when the parents put him onto the trampoline. Improved attention span - He watched TV for 30 minutes. Prior to stem cell transplantation, his attention span was a few seconds to no longer than a minute. Meaningless play has reduced The above improvements were confirmed by the patient's doctor Patient #2 - (M) Age 6 - Treated June 2009 Hand and finger motor skill improvement Improved handwriting Improved speech Eating more independently Can now ride a bicycle without fear Improved ability to socialize with others Improved cognition Patient #3 - (F) Age 16 - Treated July 2009 Improved motor skills and coordination More confident Calmer at school Grades have improved - especially math Patient #4 - (F) Age 11 - Treated January 2009 Better behaved Decreased hyperactivity Less insomnia - patient can now sleep through the night Improved attention span Less frustrated For safety information on 870 patients treated by lumbar puncture, please view our Lumbar Puncture Safety Statistics (PDF file).

The organization, which is the the nation s largest for autism advocacy, says self-advocate John Elder Robison is joining its scientific advisory board. Other members of the 30-person board, which is responsible for reviewing grant applications for millions of dollars worth of autism research,\ufffdare researchers and family members of those with autism. Robison, who wrote the book Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger\ufffds, teaches at Elms College in Chicopee, Mass. and previously served on the public review board for the National Institutes of Mental Health. It is essential that our grant funding reflects the needs and perspectives of the community we serve, namely, people with autism spectrum disorders, said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer at Autism Speaks, in a statement. We are very pleased to welcome John to our scientific review boards. His insight and skills will prove invaluable. For self-advocates, however, the appointment of one person with autism does not go far enough. They re calling for systemic change at Autism Speaks to include people with autism of varying perspectives at all levels throughout the organization. If you have an organization for women and you had an advisory board and it had one female on it, that would not be acceptable, says Scott Michael Robertson, vice president of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network. This doesn t really change anything. Even Robison acknowledges that he is just one voice. I\ufffdm aware that my vote is only one among thirty, but the fact that I myself am on the spectrum will make a difference, and I certainly believe in speaking up for whatever I support, Robison said.

Jacobson, Ph.D., BCBA One of the questions heard often in the field of developmental disabilities today is, What causes autism spectrum disorders (ASD)? Questions of cause are very difficult questions to address with full candor and confidence, not only in the case of autism spectrum disorders, but also in other conditions for which diagnosis is made based primarily on behavior. For example, some individuals speculate or assert that biological and/or toxic agents in the MMR vaccination cause autism. This article will focus upon that controversy to explore the complexities of cause and effect. The scientific method is a process by which researchers seek to answer a variety of questions. Some of these questions do not involve causes, while others do. For example, neurological or neuroscientific studies may attempt to determine differences typically present in the structure or neurochemical features of the brains of children with ASD, compared to the brains of same-aged children without diagnosed disabilities. In other words, the question posed is not what causes autism, but rather what differences exist in autistic versus non-autistic brains. On the other hand, some studies do attempt to identify causes such as causes of a disability. To do so, certain tasks must already have been accomplished. For example, the disability must be well-defined. The decision that the disability is present and that the disability is not present must be accurate. The group that is defined as having the disability must be as homogeneous as possible. That means, for example, researchers should consider the question of what causes autism separately from the question of what causes PDD or Asperger syndrome. This is not to suggest that autism, PDD and Asperger s are not a spectrum as typically thought, but rather that the question what causes autism? is a much more specific question than what causes autism spectrum disorders. There is also the consideration that, because the diagnosis of autism and other ASDs is based on breadth and severity of effects, logically, differences in brain structure or other features should be more apparent for these children. Assuming that we can accurately decide whether children have autism, and we are able to identify biological differences between these children accurately as well, we could then approach the question of cause in two ways. Taking into account possible multiple medical or neurological factors, we can conduct a detailed investigation into the backgrounds and developmental history of the children, identifying events that differ between diagnosed and non-diagnosed children. In this approach, we start with a group of children who are identified, and then look back on their histories. This is termed a retrospective study. Retroactive studies are important to conduct, but there are also challenges associated with them, including documenting that reported events occurred, reliance upon incomplete or differing clinical records, and the fact that universal screening for disabilities like autism usually does not exist, so only the children who happened to be identified and referred are included in the study. Children who are referred are likely to differ in several ways from those who are not referred, and some of these ways may be related to risk factors for autism. The preferred method for conducting a study of causes is to use a prospective approach. Prospectively, one begins by using outreach to screen a population of children for a disability, to detect instances of the disability that might not otherwise be identified, as well as those who would have been identified. Then, background and history data can be collected on a group that is more likely to actually represent children with autism or any other condition. Historical information could include vaccinations and other medical events (e.g., exposure to general anesthesia, recurrent health conditions), as well as information about child development. More ideally, a prospective study would follow children from birth, and all of the information needed to consider causes could be collected as events occur. This would assure that the information is more complete, and in a standardized form. In the case of autism, even though it is now being identified more frequently, this approach is very difficult to carry out; for each child who may develop autism, there may be from 250 to 1,000 other children who need to be screened and followed. For this reason, some researchers may attempt to use prospective approaches to study causes of autism within larger studies that look at child development in large population groups, and consider a variety of disabilities. This often means that information that is specific to risks for ASD may not be fully collected. Of course, there are other research designs that can shed light on causes of disabilities. Certainly genetic studies can indicate genetic factors that increase risk for a childhood-onset disability. Research with animals that involve brain surgery during early development that result in behavioral changes akin to those typical of a disability may also be suggestive. Basic research at the level of neurons and the effects of toxic substances and side-effects of medications may also be suggestive. But . . . there is no substitute for actually studying the occurrence of a condition among children prospectively. Why do we need scientific studies to indicate what the causes of a condition like autism might be? Why isn t it enough that some research might identify some differences between children with autism and their peers? First, some differences that are identified initially do not necessarily differentiate children with autism from those who are accurately diagnosed as not having autism. For example, research findings have suggested the unexpected presence of measles virus in the gastrointestinal tracks of children with autism, but subsequently at least one report has found this for children without autism as well. This does not mean, in and of itself, that the initial gastrointestinal findings are not possibly suggestive, but does point out the need for careful assessment of the likelihood that particular factors are plausible risk factors. In this case, scientific research needs to address why, if gastrointestinal measles is a risk factor or cause, or reflects a risk factor, some children are affected, and others are not. But, if many people develop a consensus that a given event--vaccination, for example--is regularly observed to occur shortly prior to detection of autism, is this not sufficient to warrant research on this issue? The short answer is yes whether observed by parents, clinicians, educators, or researchers, events that may be plausible causes or risk factors for a disability should reasonably be studied. Parents or others in the lives of children with disabilities may certainly detect events that are not apparent or considered by clinicians or researchers. But the fact that a belief is widely held is not, in itself, evidence that the belief is valid or accurate. The brains of human beings are structured and function in ways that are the joint product of evolution and experience. One of the well-known biases associated with human perception and thinking is the tendency to conclude that there is a cause and effect relationship between two events, when it can be shown through precise research that this is not the case. Carl Sagan, in his 1997 book, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, referred to such tendencies as irreducible human error. To err in this manner is human, but to insist that reliance on mere consensus is sufficient to accurately identify causes of events, such as the occurrence of autism, is folly. Errors of this type may be even more likely when the identification of a chain of cause and effect is especially important to the person making a judgment about cause and effect; many parents of children with autism believe that identifying the causes of autism, for their child and other children, is important. This may increase the chances that some or many may conclude that certain, unproven events are causes of the disorder, without solid evidence. However, this is a very human thing to do, and clinicians and researchers are prone to do this as well. The critical distinction that needs to be made is between correlation and causation. Correlation means that two events tend to occur together. When one does not occur, the other tends not to occur as well (called a positive correlation); or that when one occurs, the other tends not to occur (called a negative correlation). Sometimes correlations, like cause and effect, are perceived accurately, and sometimes they are not. But while necessary for showing cause and effect, correlation does not prove cause and effect. Sometimes correlation might be presumed, because of cultural factors; for example, autism is often diagnosed, by definition, at ages when children are subject to frequent vaccinations. Thus vaccinations and autism could be hypothetically correlated, despite the fact that there is no present scientific evidence that this is the case. Correlation does not in itself show causation, because the fact that two events occur together may be influenced, or caused, by a third factor that has been ignored, or that was not studied. Causation, on the other hand, requires a higher standard of proof than the fact that two events occur together (that is, have a positive correlation). Proving causation, or that an event is a risk factor for a disability, requires that several conditions be met: (1) the purported cause has to consistently or always occur before the purported effect; (2) when the purported cause occurs, the effect regularly occurs; and (3) when the purported cause does not occur, the effect tends not to occur, is less likely to occur than it does generally, or does not occur at all. Other criteria associated with the strengths of prospective studies also need to be met; for example, that the group of people studied is representative of the larger group of people with the condition (in this case, all children with autism or all children with ASD). This can be done by including all children in a general population with the condition, or by randomly sampling the children with the condition. But, if sampling is used, there also must be a sufficient number of children to generalize to the larger group of children, and the required number to do so increases as the complexity and range of issues under study increases. Where do we stand today in understanding the causes of autism? It is fair to say that researchers are developing a more complete understanding of the neurological factors associated with autism, but some degree of modesty is also appropriate with respect to the predictions that can be made or confidence with which particular neurological findings can be said to characterize autism. Many neuroscientific studies focus on specific aspects of the brain. Therefore, different aspects of the brain have been studied in different samples; there is seldom concrete evidence that these samples are very much alike, or that they represent a larger group of children with autism. This points out the need for independent researchers to conduct studies with other samples, to verify that the findings with one sample also apply to others. In addition, many neuroscientific studies include small numbers of subjects. As a result, such studies are not able to detect relatively subtle but consistent differences that may exist between individuals who have autism and those who do not, and the studies may not be representative of children with autism more generally. Advances in research design, including identification of subjects with better measures, are addressing these limitations. Neuroscientific knowledge about autism is steadily advancing, but there are, nonetheless, considerations that affect the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn today. One must also consider that the group of children diagnosed with autism is heterogeneous: some also have diagnoses of mental retardation, while others don t; some have seizure disorders, while others don t; some manifested regression or loss of attained skills, while others did not. Although there is a strong (and warranted) presumption that genetic factors play a strong role in the occurrence of autism, the heterogeneity of children with the condition and current research findings suggest that the relevant genetic factors are complex and multiple in nature. At this point one may reasonably argue that the behavioral condition of autism and ASD are final common pathways, or results, of differing genetic factors that there is no single genetic factor that accounts for occurrence of the condition. Events prior to birth have also been implicated by neuroscientific studies. It may also be that in some cases, environmental events, such as reactions to toxins, may play a role. It may be that all of these factors, and others, are involved as risks or causes. The Scientific Method Observe and describe a phenomenon or group of phenomena. Formulate a hypothesis to explain the phenomena. Use the hypothesis to predict the existence of other phenomena, or to quantitatively predict the results of new observations. Perform experimental tests of the predictions. Modify the hypothesis based upon the test results. Repeat steps 4 and 5. Replicate the tests by several independent experimenters and properly performed experiments.

Outcomes from the study were varied but included normalization of deep tendon reflexes and dermatomal subjective sensation, increased cervical range of motion and reduction of other health problems. Many of the children were taken off Ritalin, bladder and bowel control improved, some children started to speak and eye contact and attention span also improved in some children. Hyperactivity and aggressive behaviour were reduced in other children and five children were able to attend mainstream classes at school for the first time.

Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life and is the result of a neurological disorder that affects the normal functioning of the brain, impacting development in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Both children and adults with autism typically show difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. Autism is a spectrum disorder and it affects each individual differently and at varying degrees.40 What are the most common characteristics of autism? Every person with autism is an individual, and like all individuals, has a unique personality and combination of characteristics. Some individuals mildly affected may exhibit only slight delays in language and greater challenges with social interactions. They may have difficulty initiating and/or maintaining a conversation. Their communication is often described as talking at others instead of to them. (For example, a monologue on a favorite subject that continues despite attempts by others to interject comments).41 People with autism also process and respond to information in unique ways. In some cases, aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior may be present. Persons with autism may also exhibit some of the following traits: Insistence on sameness; resistance to change Difficulty in expressing needs, using gestures or pointing instead of words Repeating words or phrases in place of normal, responsive language Laughing (and/or crying) for no apparent reason; showing distress for reasons not apparent to other Preference to being alone; aloof manner Tantrums Difficulty in mixing with others Not wanting to cuddle or be cuddled Little or no eye contact Unresponsive to normal teaching methods Sustained odd play Spinning objects Obsessive attachment to objects Apparent over-sensitivity or under-sensitivity to pain No real fears of danger Noticeable physical over-activity or extreme under-activity Uneven gross/fine motor skills Non-responsive to verbal cues; acts as if deaf, although hearing tests in normal range What is the difference between autism and PDD? The term \"PDD\" is widely used by professionals to refer to children with autism and related disorders; however, there is a great deal of disagreement and confusion among professionals concerning the PDD label. Diagnosis of PDD, including autism or any other developmental disability, is based upon the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC, 1994), and is the main diagnostic reference of mental health professionals in the United States. According to the DSM-IV, the term \"PDD\" is not a specific diagnosis, but an umbrella term under which the specific diagnoses are defined.42 What does it mean to be \ufffdon the spectrum\ufffd? Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means it manifests itself in many different forms. A diagnosis can range from mild to severe, and though children who have it (i.e. are on the spectrum) are likely to exhibit similar traits, they're also as individual as the colors of a rainbow, each one managing a grab bag of symptoms. While one child may rarely speak and have difficulty learning how to read and write, another can be so high-functioning he's able to attend classes in a mainstream school. Yet another child may be so sensitive to the feel of fabric that all tags must be cut off before he wears a piece of clothing, while his friend who's also autistic may not have any sensory issues at all.43 How common is autism? According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects as many as 1 in every 150 children in the United States. Therefore, it is estimated that 1.5 million Americans may be affected with autism. Also, government statistics suggest the rate of autism is rising 10-17 percent annually. Unfortunately, the numbers appear to be continuing their upward climb. In fact, it is the most prevalent developmental disorder to date; according to the Centers for Disease Control, of the approximately 4 million babies born every year, 24,000 of them will eventually be identified as autistic. Also, recent studies suggest boys are more susceptible than girls to developing autism. In the United States alone, 1 out of 94 boys are suspected of being on the spectrum, with perhaps more going undiagnosed to this day. That said, girls appear to manifest a more severe form of the disorder than their male counterparts.44 How did my child develop autism? No one knows for sure. Though it's understandable to expect that a disorder as common as autism would have a known cause, in many ways it's still quite mysterious. Recent studies suggest a strong genetic basis for autism -- up to 20 sets of genes may play a part in its development. Genetics alone, however, can't account for all the cases, and so scientists are also looking into possible environmental origins, as well as other triggers.45 What causes autism? The simple answer is we don\ufffdt know. The vast majority of cases of autism are idiopathic, which means the cause is unknown. The more complex answer is that just as there are different levels of severity and combinations of symptoms in autism, there are probably multiple causes. The best scientific evidence available to us today points toward a potential for various combinations of factors causing autism \ufffd multiple genetic components that may cause autism on their own or possibly when combined with exposure to as yet undetermined environmental factors. Timing of exposure during the child\ufffds development (before, during or after birth) may also play a role in the development or final presentation of the disorder. A small number of cases can be linked to genetic disorders such as Fragile X, Tuberous Sclerosis, and Angelman\ufffds Syndrome, as well as exposure to environmental agents such as infectious ones ( maternal rubella or cytomegalovirus) or chemical ones ( thalidomide or valproate) during pregnancy. There is a growing interest among researchers about the role of the functions and regulation of the immune system, both within the body and the brain, in autism. Piecemeal evidence over the past 30 years suggests that people with autism may involve inflammation in the central nervous system. There is also emerging evidence from animal studies that illustrates how the immune system can influence behaviors related to autism.46 Are vaccines to blame? Though the debate over the role that vaccines play in causing autism grows more heated every day, researchers have still not found a definitive link between the two. According to organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization, there's just not enough evidence to support the contention that vaccines \ufffd specifically thimerosal-containing vaccines \ufffd cause children to develop autism. One study published in the medical journal Lancet faulting the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot has since been questioned by its own authors, and many others have also failed to pass scientific muster. Still, the accusations continue, largely from parents of children on the spectrum, and it's easy to understand why: There are still no answers to this day about what's causing a disorder that appears to steadily be expanding its reach.47 Is there a cure for autism? Unfortunately, experts have been unable thus far to come up with a cure for autism. Many treatments and therapies have surfaced since the disorder has grown more visible in the mainstream press, but reputable doctors have yet to agree on any that will reverse the diagnosis. But there's hope: Scientists are hard at work every day finding a solution for this growing problem. While advocacy groups have said for years that lack of funding for research is to blame for the dearth of definitive answers, a bill known as the Combating Autism Act, which would funnel millions of dollars to developing a cure, was passed through Congress and signed by the President ensuring that $162 million has been appropriated to fund autism research, services and treatment. Until such cure is discovered, parents have been relying on early intervention programs such as applied behavior analysis, or ABA, and play therapy to mitigate the behaviors associated with autism. For some, these treatments have proven to be very successful, helping kids on the spectrum lead a full and active life.48 How can I tell if a child has autism? No two children with autism are alike, but here are some signs that many of them share and that experts agree may be as recognizable as early as the toddler years, or even sooner. Children on the spectrum generally have difficulty relating to others; they may hardly speak, and if they do, they may not communicate in ways that other people can easily understand (they may screech loudly when they're upset, for example, instead of crying). They don't usually sustain eye contact \ufffd it's too intense -- and have trouble reading social cues. They're also prone to repetitive behaviors, flapping their hands constantly or uttering the same phrase over and over again. They may also be more sensitive than typically developing children, or dramatically less so, to sights, sounds and touch.49 What should I do if I suspect something is wrong with my child? Don't wait \ufffd talk to your doctor about getting child screened for autism. New research shows that children as young as one may exhibit signs of autism, so recognizing early signs and knowing developmental milestones is important. Early intervention is key.50 How do I get my child the help he needs? You can start by making sure he has a reputable healthcare team by his side. That means finding doctors, therapists, psychologists and teachers who understand and have experience with autism and can respond to his shifting needs appropriately. Ask your child's pediatrician to recommend a developmental pediatrician with whom you can consult about the next step. She, in turn, can guide you toward various intervention programs and suggest complementary therapies. It also helps to plug into an already existing network of parents facing the same challenges as you.51 How do I deal with this diagnosis? First, be kind to yourself. It's not easy to recover from the shock of learning your child has a developmental disorder that has no known cause or cure. Accept any and all feelings the diagnosis may elicit, and try not to blame yourself: It would've been impossible for you to figure out a way to shield your child from autism completely. The next step is to arm yourself with all the facts about the disorder. Knowledge is power, and the more you know, the more capable you'll feel about navigating the daunting autism gauntlet. That said, it's also important to give yourself a \ufffdbreak\ufffd from autism when it becomes too overwhelming. And if you find that the diagnosis has been so crippling that you've been unable to get past it, consider talking to a counselor or therapist. You can't \ufffd and aren't expected to \ufffd weather this storm alone.52 Will my child be able to attend school? Most likely yes. Much depends on where your child falls on the spectrum, but with your support, as well as that of doctors, therapists and teachers, your child should be able to attend school. In fact, it's his right: According to the Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1990, which mentions autistic children specifically, your child deserves access to a \ufffdfree and appropriate\ufffd education funded by the government, whether it be in a mainstream or special education classroom.53 What is Asperger's Syndrome? What distinguishes Asperger's Syndrome from autism is the severity of the symptoms and the absence of language delays. Children with Asperger's may be only mildly affected and frequently have good language and cognitive skills. To the untrained observer, a child with Asperger's may seem just like a normal child behaving differently. They may be socially awkward, not understanding of conventional social rules, or show a lack of empathy. They may make limited eye contact, seem to be unengaged in a conversation, and not understand the use of gestures. One of the major differences between Asperger's Syndrome and autism is that, by definition, there is no speech delay in Asperger's. In fact, children with Asperger's frequently have good language skills; they simply use language in different ways. Speech patterns may be unusual, lack inflection, or have a rhythmic nature or it may be formal, but too loud or high pitched. Children with Asperger's may not understand the subtleties of language, such as irony and humor, or they may not recognize the give-and-take nature of a conversation. Another distinction between Asperger's Syndrome and autism concerns cognitive ability. While some individuals with autism experience mental retardation, by definition a person with Asperger's cannot possess a \"clinically significant\" cognitive delay, and most possess average to above-average intelligence.54 Why is early intervention so important? Early intervention is defined as services delivered to children from birth to age 3, and research shows that it has a dramatic impact on reducing the symptoms of autism spectrum disorders. Studies in early childhood development have shown that the youngest brains are the most flexible. In autism, we see that intensive early intervention yields a tremendous amount of progress in children by the time they enter kindergarten, often reducing the need for intensive supports.55 What should we know about our younger or future children? Although autism is believed to have a strong environmental component, there is little doubt that autism is a disorder with a strong genetic basis. If you are expecting another child, or have plans to expand your family in the future, you may be concerned about the development of any younger siblings of your child with autism. Studies have estimated that families affected with one child with autism have roughly a 5-10% percent chance of having a second child with autism. This risk increases if two or more children in the family are already affected. More recent evidence suggests that early signs of autism may be seen in some children as young as 8-10 months of age. For example, infants who later develop autism may be more passive, are more difficult to soothe, or fail to orient when their name is called.

It can be appealed in federal court.The parents presented expert witnesses who argued mercury can have a variety of effects on the brain, but the ruling said none of them offered opinions on the cause of autism in the three specific cases argued. They testified that mercury can affect a number of biological processes, including abnormal metabolism in children.Special master Denise K. Vowell noted that in order to succeed in their action, the parents would have to show \"the exquisitely small amounts of mercury\" that reach the brain from vaccines can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts ... from other sources do not. The ruling said the parents were arguing that the effects from mercury in vaccines differ from mercury's known effects on the brain. Vowell concluded that the parents had failed to establish that their child's condition was caused or aggravated by mercury from vaccines.Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines.The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism.The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available.The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had \"already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.\"But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, \"it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them.\"On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children.\"The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges,\" Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement.SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling.\"The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology,\" the goup said.The advocacy group Autism Speaks said \"the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases.\"However, while research has found no overall connection between autism and vaccines, the group said it would back research to determine if some individuals might be at increased risk because of genetic or medical conditions.Meanwhile, in reaction to the concerns of parents, thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines in the United States.In Friday's action the court ruled in three different cases, each concluding that the preservative has no connection to autism.The trio of rulings can offer reassurance to parents scared about vaccinating their babies because of a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, are on the rise.The U.S. Court of Claims is different from many other courts: The families involved didn't have to prove the inoculations definitely caused the complex neurological disorder, just that they probably did.More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation through the government's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the rulings dealt with test cases to settle which if any claims had merit.Autism is best known for impairing a child's ability to communicate and interact. Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it's unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosis.Worry about a vaccine link first arose in 1998 when a British physician, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published a medical journal article linking a particular type of autism and bowel disease to the measles vaccine. The study was later discredited. genetic brain genetic Autism Speaks Congress Andrew Wakefield Vaccine Injury Compensation Program U.S. Court of Federal Claims Denise K.

Our plan is, with this money and the help of investors, to build a really worthwhile center. ... In this environment, obviously things are a little difficult to raise money.\"He had gone 54 tournaments worldwide without a victory, and it is little more than a coincidence that the longest stretch without winning in his career came right after going public that Ben was autistic.Els and his wife, Leizl, had known for a couple of years that the youngest of their two children had autism. It was only in 2008, after winning the Honda Classic, that he wanted the world to know, realizing that Els' stature in sports could only help raise awareness.As for the struggles with his golf? That was a battle for Els alone.He had a couple of close calls, although none in the majors, the most recent in Shanghai when he was 10 under for his round and had a one-shot lead when he tried a heroic shot over the pond \ufffd a cut 5-wood to take some distance off from a downhill like \ufffd and duffed it, making a bogey and settling for second place.\"I don't think the motivation was lacking,\" Els said. \"I just think that I went about it the wrong way. I was almost chasing my own tail a little bit. I was not looking after the smaller things. I was looking at the whole big picture on Thursday morning \ufffd 'Oh, I'm going to win the golf tournament' \ufffd and it takes four days of good play. It takes strategy. It takes mental strength. It takes patience.\"And I kind of let that all out of the window.\"It might have seemed as though the window was closing when Els turned 40 last year, a reminder of dwindling days.After a sluggish start to the year, he began working harder than ever. After leaving PGA National at the Honda Classic on the weekend, he stopped off at the Bear's Club to hit balls. When the tournament was over, he was back at Nicklaus' club each day until twilight, searching for the right ball flight.He found it in sharing the 54-hole lead with Charl Schwartzel, his 25-year-old protege from South Africa. Although Els looked wobbly coming down the stretch Saturday afternoon by missing short putts, he was practically flawless on Sunday.Els played bogey-free in the final round for a 6-under 66, with only two bad misses. He hooked one tee on No. 6, then played around the tree and lagged beautifully from 70 feet to get his par. On the 14th, the pivotal hole at Doral, he again went left and clipped a palm tree, leaving him in the rough and unable to get at the flag.He pitched on 25 feet right of the hole, hopeful of taking a bogey and moving on. With a one-stroke lead about to be erased, however, Els made the par putt on the last turn and was on his way.\"There's always a turning point,\" Schwartzel said. \"And it's amazing. You can just see it. When he knocked it in, I just sort of thought to myself, 'Don't let this be the turning point.' But in the back of your mind ... that was big for him, for his confidence.\"Els' daughter, 10-year-old Samantha, followed him on the weekend. With so much attention on Ben, he is mindful that Samantha gets equal time. She loves to run over to the side of the ropes as her father walks by, making sure he sees her.Els said Ben is still a few years away from grasping why so many are cheering for his father, the significance of a blue trophy that was the 17th on the PGA Tour for Els, and his 61st win worldwide.Still, the Big Easy said his boy would watch the video. He knows golf.\"He loves watching me practice,\" Els said. \"When I'm at the Bear's Club, he always comes out and gets on the range and watches me play. He tries to hit a couple of shots himself. He just loves being on the golf course with me. Yeah, we'll show him the tape. I think he'll get excited about it. I think it will be another couple of years before he understands what we've done, but that's no problem.\" Florida No. Grand Slam AP Autism Foundation Ben Adam Scott Jack Nicklaus Raymond Floyd \ufffd Palm Beach County Samantha DORAL Ernie Els.As CA Championship PGA National World Golf Championship Els Doral.The Big Easy Autism Charity Pro-Am Steve Stricker Robert Allenby.His Leizl Honda Classic Shanghai Club Nicklaus' Charl Schwartzel South Africa Doral Schwartzel Easy www.newstimes.com/sports/article/A-winner-again-Els-brings-focus-to-autism-407390.php 40739 Autism397 http://www.webjam.com/autistic_angels/autism Add to my webjam DIAGNOSIS AND CONSULTATION There are no medical tests for diagnosing autism. An accurate diagnosis must be based on observation of the individual's communication, behavior, and developmental levels. However, because many of the behaviors associated with autism are shared by other disorders, various medical tests may be ordered to rule out or identify other possible causes of the symptoms being exhibited. At first glance, some persons with autism may appear to have mental retardation, a behavior disorder, problems with hearing, or even odd and eccentric behavior. To complicate matters further, these conditions can co-occur with autism. However, it is important to distinguish autism from other conditions, since an accurate diagnosis and early identification can provide the basis for building an appropriate and effective educational and treatment program.A brief observation in a single setting cannot present a true picture of an individual's abilities and behaviors. Parental (and other caregivers' and/or teachers) input and developmental history are very important components of making an accurate diagnosis.EARLY DIAGNOSISResearch indicates that early diagnosis is associated with dramatically better outcomes for individuals with autism. The earlier a child is diagnosed, the earlier the child can begin benefiting from one of the many specialized intervention approaches treatment and educationDIAGNOSTIC TOOLSThe characteristic behaviors of autism spectrum disorders may or may not be apparent in infancy (18 to 24 months), but usually become obvious during early childhood (24 months to 6 years).As part of a well-baby/well-child visit, your child's doctor should do a developmental screening asking specific questions about your baby's progress. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) lists five behaviors that signal further evaluation is warranted:Does not babble or coo by 12 monthsDoes not gesture (point, wave, grasp) by 12 monthsDoes not say single words by 16 monthsDoes not say two-word phrases on his or her own by 24 monthsHas any loss of any language or social skill at any age.Having any of these five red flags does not mean your child has autism. But because the characteristics of the disorder vary so much, a child showing these behaviors should have further evaluations by a multidisciplinary team. This team may include a neurologist, psychologist, developmental pediatrician, speech/language therapist, learning consultant, or other professionals knowledgeable about autism.SCREENING INSTRUMENTS While there is no one behavioral or communications test that can detect autism, several screening instruments have been developed that are now being used in diagnosing autism:CARS rating system (Childhood Autism Rating Scale), developed by Eric Schopler in the early 1970s, is based on observed behavior. Using a 15-point scale, professionals evaluate a child's relationship to people, body use, adaptation to change, listening response, and verbal communication.The Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) is used to screen for autism at 18 months of age. It was developed by Simon Baron-Cohen in the early 1990s to see if autism could be detected in children as young as 18 months. The screening tool uses a short questionnaire with two sections, one prepared by the parents, the other by the child's family doctor or pediatrician.The Autism Screening Questionnaire is a 40 item screening scale that has been used with children four and older to help evaluate communication skills and social functioning.The Screening Test for Autism in Two-Year Olds is being developed by Wendy Stone at Vanderbilt and uses direct observations to study behavioral features in children under two. She has identified three skills areas that seem to indicate autism - play, motor imitation, and joint attention.CONSULTING WITH PROFESSIONALSWhether you or your child's pediatrician is the first to suspect autism, your child will need to be referred to someone who specializes in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders. This may be a developmental pediatrician, a psychiatrist or psychologist, and other professionals that are better able to observe and test your child in specific areas.This multidisciplinary assessment team may include some or all of the following professionals (they may also be involved in treatment programs):Developmental pediatrician - Treats health problems of children with developmental delays or handicaps.Child psychiatrist - A medical doctor who may be involved in the initial diagnosis. He/she can also prescribe medication and provide help in behavior, emotional adjustment and social relationships). - Specializes in understanding the nature and impact of developmental disabilities, including autism spectrum disorders. May perform psychological and assessment test, as well as help with behavior modification and social skills training. - Focuses on practical, self-help skills that will aid in daily living such as dressing and eating. May also work on sensory integration, coordination of movement, and fine motor skills.Physical therapist - Helps to improve the use of bones, muscles, joints, and nerves to develop muscle strength, coordination and motor skills.Speech/language therapist - Involved in the improvement of communication skills, including speech and language.Social Worker - May provide counseling services or act as case manager helping to arrange services and treatments.It is important that parents and professionals work together for the child's benefit. While professionals will use their experience and training to make recommendations about your child's treatment options, you have unique knowledge about his/her needs and abilities that should be taken into account for a more individualized course of action.Once a treatment program is in place, communication between parents and professionals is essential in monitoring the child's progress. Here are some guidelines for working with professionals:Be informed. Learn as much as you can about your child's disability so you can be an active participant in determining care. If you don't understand terms used by professionals, ask for clarification.Be prepared. Be prepared for meetings with doctors, therapists, and school personnel. Write down your questions and concerns, and then note the answers.Be organized. Many parents find it useful to keep a notebook detailing their child's diagnosis and treatment, as well as meetings with professionals.Communicate. It's important to ensure open communication - both good and bad. If you don't agree with a professional's recommendation, speak up and say specifically why you don't.GETTING PAST THE DIAGNOSISOften, the time immediately after the diagnosis is a difficult one for families, filled with confusion, anger and despair. These are normal feelings. But there is life after a diagnosis of autism. Life can be rewarding for a child with autism and all the people who have the privilege of knowing the child. While it isn't always easy, you can learn to help your child find the world an interesting and loving place. TREATMENT Add to my webjam Discovering that your child has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be an overwhelming experience. For some, the diagnosis may come as a complete surprise; others may have had suspicions and tried for months or years to get an accurate diagnosis. In either case, a diagnosis brings a multitude of questions about how to proceed. A generation ago, many people with autism were placed in institutions. Professionals were less educated about autism than they are today and specific services and supports were largely non-existent. Today the picture is much clearer. With appropriate services and supports, training, and information, children on the autism spectrum will grow, learn and flourish, even if at a different developmental rate than others.While there is no known cure for autism, there are treatment and education approaches that may reduce some of the challenges associated with the condition. Intervention may help to lessen disruptive behaviors, and education can teach self-help skills that allow for greater independence. But just as there is no one symptom or behavior that identifies individuals with ASD, there is no single treatment that will be effective for all people on the spectrum. Individuals can learn to function within the confines of ASD and use the positive aspects of their condition to their benefit, but treatment must begin as early as possible and be tailored to the child's unique strengths, weaknesses and needs.Throughout the history of the Autism Society of America, parents and professionals have been confounded by conflicting messages regarding what are, versus what are not, appropriate treatment approaches for children and adults on the autism spectrum.The purpose of this section is to provide a general overview of a variety of available approaches, not specific treatment recommendations. Keep in mind that the word treatment is used in a very limited sense. While typically used for children under 3, the approaches described herein may be included in an educational program for older children as well.It is important to match a child's potential and specific needs with treatments or strategies that are likely to be effective in moving him/her closer to established goals and greatest potential. ASA does not want to give the impression that parents or professionals will select one item from a list of available treatments. A search for appropriate treatment must be paired with the knowledge that all treatment approaches are not equal, what works for one will not work for all, and other options do not have to be excluded. The basis for choosing any treatment plan should come from a thorough evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses observed in the child.UNDERSTANDING YOUR OPTIONSTreatment approaches are constantly evolving as more is learned about the autism spectrum. There are many therapeutic programs, both conventional and complementary, that focus on replacing dysfunctional behaviors and developing specific skills.As a parent, it's natural to want to do something immediately. The literature states time and time again the importance of early treatment for individuals on the autism spectrum However, it is important not to rush in with changes. It does no good to push ahead with a treatment that is not appropriate for the individual or one that may be harmful. You also much consider the larger implications of beginning a new treatment. A child may have already learned to cope with his or her current environment and sudden changes or unexpected different expectations could be stressful and confusing. Various treatment approaches should be investigated and information gathered concerning various options before proceeding with any child's treatment.Parents will encounter numerous accounts from other parents about successes and failures with many of the treatment approaches mentioned. Professionals also differ in their theories of what they feel is the most successful treatment for autism. It can be frustrating! Parents do learn to sift through the information, examine options with a critical eye and make rational, educated decisions on what is appropriate given the individual circumstance. Parents live with the individual on the spectrum every day and best know his/her needs and the unique ways that autism impacts their lives. Parents must be empowered to trust their instincts as various options are explored, considered and implemented.The descriptions of treatment approaches provided here are for informational purposes only. They serve as overviews and should always be followed with contact with qualified professionals and should be discussed with parents or individuals on the spectrum who have person experiences. The Autism Society of America does not endorse any specific treatment or therapy.While doing research, parents and professionals will hear about many different treatments approaches, such as auditory training, discrete trial training, vitamin therapy, anti-yeast therapy, facilitated communication, music therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and sensory integration. These approaches can generally be broken down into three categories:Learning ApproachesBiomedical & Dietary ApproachesComplementary ApproachesSome of these treatment approaches have research studies that support their efficacy; others may not. Some parents will only want to try treatment methods that have undergone research and testing and are generally accepted by the professional community. But keep in mind that scientific studies are often difficult to do since each individual on the autism spectrum is different.For others, formal testing might not be a pre-requisite for them to try a treatment with their child. Even for those with scientific proof, the Autism Society of America recommends that all options available are investigated to determine the approach that is most appropriate.Experts agree though, that early intervention is important in addressing the symptoms associated with ASD. The earlier treatment is started, the more opportunity for the individual to reach their highest potential. Many of the approaches described can be used on children as young as age 2 or 3. They may also continue to be used in conjunction with special education programs or traditional elementary school for children who are mainstreamed.PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN UNDER AGE 3If a child is younger than 3 years old, he or she is eligible for early intervention assistance. This federally-funded program is available in every state, but may be provided by different agencies. Contact the local chapter of the Autism Society of America in your area for more specific information, search program listings in Autism Source\u2122 located on the web at http://www.autismsource.org/, or obtain a state resource sheet from the National Information Center for Children and Youth with Disabilities.This early education assistance may be available in two forms: home-based or school-based. Home-based programs generally assign members of an early intervention team to come to the home to train parents or caregivers to educate the child on the spectrum. School-based programs may be in a public school or a private organization. Both of these programs should be staffed by teachers and other professionals who have experience working with children with disabilities specifically autism. Related services should also be offered, such as speech, physical or occupational therapy, depending on the needs of each child. The program may be only for children with disabilities or it may also include typically developing peers.PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDRENFrom the age of 3 through the age of 21, every child diagnosed on the autism spectrum is guaranteed a free appropriate public education supplied by the local education agency. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal mandate that guarantees this education. Whatever the level of impairment, the educational program for an individual on the autism spectrum should be based on the unique needs of the student, and thoroughly documented in the IEP (Individualized Education Program). If this is the first attempt by the parents and the school system to develop the appropriate curriculum, conducting a comprehensive needs assessment is a good place to start. Consult with professionals who are well versed in the spectrum of autism and related conditions about the best possible educational methods that will be effective in assisting the student to learn and benefit from his/her school program. Educational programming for students with ASD often addresses a wide range of skill development, including: academics, language, social skills, self-help skills, behavioral issues, and leisure skills.Parents can and should be an active and equal participant in deciding on an appropriate educational plan for their child. Parents know the child best and can provide valuable information to teachers and other professionals who will be providing educational services. Collaboration between parents and professionals is essential; open communication will certainly lead to better evaluation of progress and improved outcomes for the student.To learn about other services specific to an area, contact resources in the community, such as the local ASA chapter, a local University Affiliated Program for Developmental Disabilities, the local ARC, Easter Seals, or Parent Training and Information Center. Be persistent but be patient it may take days or weeks to find the information you need. If a local resource is not able to provide the information or services sought, ask for a referral to another agency or local resource that may be helpful.EVALUATING APPROACHESBecause no two children on the autism spectrum have the exact same symptoms and behavioral patterns, a treatment approach that works for one child may not be successful with another. This makes evaluating different approaches difficult and that much more essential. There is little comparative research between treatment approaches. Primarily this is because there are too many variables that have to be controlled. So, it's no wonder that parents might be confused about what to do.The Autism Society of America has long promoted the empowerment of individual consumers (including people on the spectrum, parents and professionals) to critically examine a variety of available options and be forearmed with a set of parameters under which they can better determine associated threats and opportunities and, therefore, make informed decisions. Further, better educated consumers, would help control the embracing of unproven notions that may distract from effective courses of treatment for individuals with ASD.In the article Behavioral and Educational Treatment for Autistic Spectrum Disorders (Autism Advocate, Volume 33, No. 6), Bryna Siegel, Ph.D., suggests thinking about each symptom as an autism specific learning disability\u2026 that tells something about a barrier to understanding. Using this model, what the student can and cannot do well can be evaluated. \u2026take stock of which autistic learning disabilities are present, and then select treatments that address that particular child's unique autism learning disability profile. Understanding these learning differences is the first step in assessing whether a specific treatment approach may be helpful; understanding a child's strengths is equally important. For example, some children are good visual learners, while another child may need written, rather than oral, cues.Finding Treatment Programs in Your AreaOnce familiar with the treatments that are available and appropriate for individuals with ASD, parents begin to think about where they can receive these services. Treatments may be obtained through either the medical or educational community, depending on the nature of the treatment. There are also a variety of resources useful in finding qualified professionals or service providers in your area. There are several state agencies established to provide this type of information and support, including Protection and Advocacy agencies; Developmental Disabilities Councils; Vocational Rehabilitation Centers; Parent Training Centers; and Educational Resources. Local chapters of the Autism Society of America are run by parents of individuals on the autism spectrum and have been established to provide guidance, advice and referrals to programs and professionals in a specific geographic region. mental retardation Autism Society of America add ASD NICHD Disabilities Education Act Developmental Disabilities National Information Center for Children and Youth National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Individualized Education Program imitation IDEA ASA Simon Baron-Cohen Autistic Spectrum Disorders Easter Seals Autism Rating Scale No. Eric Schopler Wendy Stone Vanderbilt Autism Source&trade University Affiliated Program ARC Parent Training and Information Center ASD.In Autism Advocate Bryna Siegel Developmental Disabilities Councils Vocational Rehabilitation Centers Parent Training Centers www.autismsource.org/, www.webjam.com/autistic_angels/autism screening occupational therapy cars childhood autism rating scale physical therapy music therapy Autism398 http://wbztv.com/health/autism.mothers.age.2.1480131.html Study Links Child's Autism Risk To Mother's Age Required fields are marked with an asterisk(*) Recipient E-mail:* Your Name:* Your E-mail:* Add a Message: Send me a copy of this e-mail.

This set of signs distinguishes autism from milder autism spectrum disorders (ASD) such as Asperger syndrome.[2]Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare mutations.[3] In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects.[4] Other proposed causes, such as childhood vaccines, are controversial and the vaccine hypotheses lack convincing scientific evidence.[5] Most recent reviews estimate a prevalence of one to two cases per 1,000 people for autism, and about six per 1,000 for ASD, with ASD averaging a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio. The number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, at least partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.[6]Autism affects many parts of the brain; how this occurs is poorly understood. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. Early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help children gain self-care, social, and communication skills. There is no cure.[7] Few children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, but some become successful,[8] and an autistic culture has developed, with some seeking a cure and others believing that autism is a condition rather than a disorder.[9] Contents 1 Classification 2 Characteristics 2.1 Social development 2.2 Communication 2.3 Repetitive behavior 2.4 Other symptoms 3 Causes 4 Mechanism 4.1 Pathophysiology 4.2 Neuropsychology 5 Screening 6 Diagnosis 7 Management 8 Prognosis 9 Epidemiology 10 History 11 References 12 External links //<![CDATA[ if (window.showTocToggle) { var tocShowText = \"show\"; var tocHideText = \"hide\"; showTocToggle(); } //]]> genetic brain genetic mutations ASD social interaction birth defects repetitive behavior cognitive Prognosis Causes Page Classification ICD-10 F84.0 ICD-9 OMIM MeSH D001321 Vista Center for Autism, located in south Denver, is a treatment center for children with autism and related disorders serving families in Colorado and beyond since 2003.

Autism has long been considered a disorder that can range from mild to severe. Asperger's symptoms can vary, but the condition is generally thought of as a mild form and since 1994 has had a separate category in psychiatrists' diagnostic manual. Both autism and Asperger's involve poor social skills, repetitive behavior or interests, and problems communicating. But unlike classic autism, Asperger's does not typically involve delays in mental development or speech.The American Psychiatric Association's proposed revisions, announced Wednesday, involve autism and several other conditions. The suggested autism changes are based on research advances since 1994 showing little difference between mild autism and Asperger's. Evidence also suggests that doctors use the term loosely and disagree on what it means, according to psychiatrists urging the revisions.A new autism spectrum category recognizes that \"the symptoms of these disorders represent a continuum from mild to severe, rather than being distinct disorders,\" said Dr. Edwin Cook, a University of Illinois at Chicago autism researcher and member of the APA work group proposing the changes.The proposed revisions are posted online at http://www.DSM5.org for public comment, which will influence whether they are adopted. Publication of the updated manual is planned for May 2013.Dr. Mina Dulcan, child and adolescent psychiatry chief at Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital, said Aspies' opposition \"is not really a medical question, it's an identity question.\"\"It would be just like if you were a student at MIT. You might not want to be lumped with somebody in the community college,\" said Dulcan who supports the diagnostic change.\"One of the characteristics of people with Asperger's is that they're very resistant to change,\" Dulcan added. The change \"makes scientific sense. I'm sorry if it hurts people's feelings,\" she said.Harold Doherty, a New Brunswick lawyer whose 13-year-old son has severe autism, opposes the proposed change for a different reason. He says the public perception of autism is skewed by success stories ? the high-functioning \"brainiac\" kids who thrive despite their disability.Doherty says people don't want to think about children like his son, Conor, who will never be able to function on his own. The revision would only skew the perception further, leading doctors and researchers to focus more on mild forms, he said.It's not clear whether the change would affect autistic kids' access to special services.But Kelli Gibson of Battle Creek, Mich., whose four sons have different forms of autism, thinks it would. She says the revision could make services now designated just for kids with an \"autism\" diagnosis available to less severely affected kids ? including those with Asperger's and a variation called pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified.Also, Gibson said, she'd no longer have to use four different terms to describe her boys.\"Hallelujah! Let's just put them all in the same category and be done with it,\" Gibson said.

This publication gave the world its first look inside the world of Autism. Since this time Autism as grown to affect 1 in 150 and is most prevalent in males. What is Autism?Autism is one of many Autistic Spectrum Disorders(ASDs). It shares the spectrum with other well known disorders such as Aspergers Syndrome, Fragile X Syndrome and PDD , among others. Autism is a neurological disorder, this means that it is a disorder that affects the nervous system due to disease, injury, developmental abnormalities or toxins. It impairs the main functions of the Nervous System which is rooted in sensory, integration and motor skills. What Causes Autism? Researchers believe that Autism is caused by both genetics and environmental factors with genetics playing the role of susceptibility and environmental factors acting as triggers. Diabetes could be an example. Most people are more susceptible of contracting diabetes if their mother or father has it but may not ever develop it. In most cases of diabetes it can be controlled or prohibited by exercise and a proper diet but the genetic disposition is still there. What are the Signs and Symptoms? The effects of Autism are deeply rooted in three areas; communication, social interactions and repetitive behaviors. Most children with autism have little to no speech and if they posses speech it is not uncommon for that speech to be lost over time. They also possess an inability to interact with others, lack of eye contact, standoffish, do not like to be touched, intolerable to change. Other signs may be no real sense of danger, seems as deaf, spinning objects, inappropriate laughing or giggling, inappropriate attachment to objects, sustained play , sensory problems, bad motor skills. The signs and symptoms of Autism may vary from person to PDD aspergers fragile x syndrome Aspergers Syndrome Autistic Spectrum Disorders HistoryLeo Kanner Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact Fragile X Syndrome hubpages.com/hub/About-Autism Autism406 http://www.neighborheart.org/whatisautism.asp Autism is a complex brain disorder that inhibits a person's ability to communicate and develop social relationships, and is often accompanied by extreme behavioral challenges. In February 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that Autism Spectrum Disorders are diagnosed in one in 150 children in the United States, affecting up to seven times as many boys than girls. The diagnosis of autism has increased tenfold in the last decade. The CDC has called autism a national public health crisis whose cause and cure remain unknown. Facts and Figures Recent studies show the rate of autism occurs in 1 out of 150 births. The occurrence in boys is up to 7 times more prevalent than girls. Autism can often be detected as early 18 months of age. However, the average diagnosis age is still 5 years. While there is no known cause or cure for autism, we do know that intervention, particularly early-intervention, can help tremendously. To date there are no long-term studies on autism and what therapies are most effective. Therefore, it is up to the parents to research what is best for their child. Under federal mandates, basic services may be covered by local school districts or government entities. However, the cost of contemporary services most likely fall outside of their purview and are not covered by medical insurance and, therefore, fall squarely on the caretakers. Autism Myths There are many misleading myths concerning autism. It's imperative that people understand that these are, in fact, myths and that every person should be treated as an individual. Autism is an emotional disability. You can tell right away if someone has Autism. Children with Autism never make eye contact. Children with Autism cannot show affection. Children with Autism all exhibit the same traits. Children with Autism do not talk. Children with Autism do not smile. Children with Autism do not want friends. Children with Autism can perform amazing mental feats, such as memorizing the telephone book or multiplying large numbers in their heads. Children with Autism are completely cut off from human relationships. All of these statements are false. They are all myths. brain Autism Spectrum Disorders Autism eye contact United States CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Autism www.neighborheart.org/whatisautism.asp Autism407 http://www.pecanbread.com/BTVCautismchapter.html About Autism by Elaine Gottschall from Breaking the Vicious Cycle, 10th Edition, Copyright 2003 ? .in many autistic children, bacterial and fungal overgrowths are etiologically significant in the cascade of events that result in autism or one of the other autism spectrum disorders.? By Jaquelyn McCandless in Children with Starving Brains. ?A sensible and harmless form of warfare on the aberrant population of intestinal microbes is to manipulate their energy (food) supply through diet By depriving intestinal microbes of their energy source, their numbers gradually decrease along with the products they produce.? By Elaine Gottschall in Breaking the Vicious Cycle. ?Janie played with a doll for the first time ever today; I almost fainted. She initiated a hug and kiss for the first time ever in her 14 years of life.? From Mom of Janie with Down?s syndrome, autism and gastrointestinal issues after a short time on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet. The Specific Carbohydrate Diet has entered the world of autism through ?the back door?- the intestinal tract. And what may have first appeared to be ?the back door,? via the digestive system, is rapidly becoming one of the most scientifically researched areas in determining what may be one of the underlying causes of many autism spectrum disorders. Because the Specific Carbohydrate Diet?s goal is to heal the intestinal tract and to rid it of bacterial and fungal overgrowth, it is proving to be a very successful dietary intervention in treating many autistic children and leading them back to a life of normalcy. This chapter will review some of the research dealing with the Gut-Brain Axis in child developmental disorders. It will point out how dietary intervention with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet addresses and often overcomes conditions thought to be at the root of autism spectrum disorders as well as some cases of epilepsy and attention deficit disorder (ADD). The previous chapter, The Brain Connection, highlights the research of many years in which it had been shown that various neurological problems originate in the digestive system. And when the number of autistic children soared within the last two decades, attention has again been directed to the gastrointestinal tract. Parents of autistic children have always known that, among their children?s symptoms, there exists symptoms of chronic constipation, periods of diarrhea, and abdominal pain. But until recently, the parents? reports were treated as of no consequence. Now, fortunately, attention is being focused on these physical symptoms as well as on behavior, and many gastroenterologists are in agreement that ?these children are ill and are in distress and pain, and not just neurologically dysfunctional.? 1 Some physicians, recognizing that diet was playing a part in causing the intestinal symptoms focused their attention on treating these gastrointestinal symptoms as allergies and/or sensitivities. When testing these patients, they found evidence of sensitivities to various food components, mainly the gluten of grains and various components of dairy products. The behavior of many autistic children, although not all, showed improvement with the removal of these foods from their diet but, unfortunately, although behavior often improved, intestinal function did not. It was not unusual for the author to receive letters from parents as follows: ?My son is almost six years old and has autism. He was gluten/casein free for two years and while, during the first six months I thought I saw improvement in his exhibiting less stimmy (repeating the same action over and over again), his stimming returned. Even while on this diet, he still had constant stomach problems - being hospitalized four times for throwing up and dehydration. One time he suffered with a bowel obstruction; the other times they weren?t sure what brought on his violent vomiting attacks. No doctor even bothered to do a colonoscope. I have mentioned to our doctor for years that he seems to be addicted to potato chips, french fries, ketchup, and waffles. When I learned of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, it addressed this carbohydrate addiction and I intend starting this diet promptly.? And another letter from Patricia : ? Meanwhile, my younger child?s health was failing. He was on a strict gluten-free diet because of celiac disease. But it wasn?t helping. He was ghost white and rail thin, with little energy and with chronic diarrhea and black circles under his eyes. Deep down, I worried he was dying. The team of pediatric specialists we were seeing had no clue how to make my little boy healthy, nor did my daughter?s ?alternative? DAN (Defeat Autism Now) physician. Fortunately, for us, this was August. And every doctor treating my son was on vacation. In desperation, I picked up a book called Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health through Diet by Elaine Gottschall. A stranger had mailed this book to me two months earlier after meeting my Mother and hearing about my son?s deteriorating health. The book explained why my son wasn?t thriving on the regular celiac diet. His intestines were so damaged he couldn?t digest any grains, or complex carbohydrates. The next day, he started the so-called Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) described in this book. His stools became normal, and he started growing and gaining weight. He?s now a strong, healthy seven-year old. What about my daughter? She had no obvious digestion troubles, but she did have ?autism? and a recently discovered yeast overgrowth. One British researcher found a link between the MMR shot, intestinal problems, and autism. Wouldn?t a diet that promised to heal her intestines and help with yeast overgrowth be her best shot at normal life? We put Maria on a dairy-free version of the SCD. She had a terrible yeast die-off that lasted a week even though she was taking Nystatin, a popular antifungal drug. But once she recovered from the die-off, about a week later, we were confident she?d someday grow into an independent adult, thanks to this remarkable diet. Her remaining speech peculiarities, such as mixing up the order of words in a sentence, disappeared. Her eye contact became normal. By the time she was 4-1/2, one year after her diagnosis, no one would guess she was ever ?autistic.? These parents? reports are echoed throughout the autistic community: although various dietary proteins appear to aggravate behavioral symptoms, their removal is not addressing the gastrointestinal problems. In addition it becomes increasingly apparent that as a few dietary proteins are removed, more and more must be taken out of the diet to hopefully achieve and sustain progress until these children have little to eat in the way of nutritious food. Parents continuously complain of their children?s addiction to carbohydrates. Dr. J. O. Hunter in 1991 described this dilemma of treating patients with gastrointestinal symptoms as food allergies or sensitivities. He stated that patients who exhibit sensitivities do not follow classical Type I allergic reaction. If these intolerances are not allergies, then they may be a disorder of bacterial fermentation in the colon and the disorders might be more appropriately named ?enterometabolic (intestinal) disorders.?2 The Specific Carbohydrate Diet approaches these gas- trointestinal challenges in autism as it has been successfully doing for inflammatory bowel disease - as a disorder of bacterial fermentation and the ensuing problems which occur because of bacterial fermentation. These problems resulting from bacterial fermentation are: (1) production of excess amounts of short chain volatile fatty acids (organic acids): (2) lowering of the pH of the blood as these acids are absorbed: (3) overgrowth of bacteria as the undigested carbohydrates provide food for bacterial proliferation: (4) mutation of some bacteria such as E. coli because of the change in pH in their colonic environment; and (5) excess toxin production caused by the overgrowth of some pathological bacteria. Bacterial fermentation occurs when undigested carbohydrates escape digestion and absorption and end up in the lower parts of the small intestine and colon. Unlike diets that eliminate only certain proteins, based on tests showing sensitivities to proteins, and that allow unlimited intake of starches and sugars, the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) is designed to nourish the child optimally and to minimize bacterial fermentation. Coleman and Blass in 1985 in The Journal of Developmental Disorders reported the first evidence that autism might be linked to carbohydrate metabolism (digestion). 3 These researchers reported that the syndrome of Dlactic acidosis was found to be present in autistic children. Their work was based on reports of the 1970?s and 1980?s showing that undigested carbohydrates were being changed by bacterial action in the intestine to a substance, D-lactic acid. High amounts of D-lactic acid in the bloodstream have been found to cause bizarre behavioral symptoms. This book discusses earlier research relating to D-lactic acidosis in Chapter 7, The Brain Connection.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 There are two approaches to treating this abnormal production of D-lactic acid: (1) use of antibiotics to kill the bacteria producing the substance, a method often used med- ically, and (2) decreasing the amount of fermentable carbohydrates upon which bacteria feed in order to produce D-lactic acid. Since antibiotic therapy often is accompanied by other side effects, it seems reasonable to suggest dietary changes to accomplish the same thing or as a support for medical intervention with antibiotics. The year 2000 yielded landmark research in linking autism to the gastrointestinal tract. It was reported that among 385 children on the autism spectrum, significant gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 46% compared with only 10% of almost 100 children without autism confirming what parents already knew. 11 A flurry of remarkable scientific papers appeared, first, in the British medical journal, Lancet12 and then in The American Journal of Gastroenterology (Wakefield)13, demonstrating conclusively that serious intestinal pathology was found more than half of autistic patients. These intestinal problems ranged from moderate to severe including esophagitis, gastritis and enterocolitis along with the presence of lymphoid nodular hyperplasia. Some of these intestinal pathologies resembled Crohn?s disease as well as ulcerative colitis. As would be expected, from previous research done on intestinal problems (see pages 22-24), it was also found by Horvath et al 14 that there was low carbohydrate digestive enzyme activity (see diagrams of injured microvilli in the chapter on Carbohydrate Digestion) although the pancreatic function was normal. Horvath?s report concluded by saying unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders, especially reflux esophagitis and disaccharide malabsorption, may contribute to the behavioral problems of the non-verbal autistic patients. Additional reports from findings at Harvard Massachusetts General Hospital conclusively showed that carbohydrate digestion is being hampered at the locus of the intestinal absorptive cell.15 Initial autism research findings at Harvard Massachusetts General testing 400 autistic children found that (1) lactase deficiency was found in 55% of ASD children tested; (2) combined deficiency of disaccharidase enzymes was found in 15%; and (3) enzyme assays correlate well with hydrogen breath tests. (The hydrogen breath test measures the amount of hydrogen gas given off when intestinal microbes ferment unabsorbed carbohydrates.) This current work, on decrease in digestibility of dietary disaccharides leading to malabsorption, forms the basis for therapy of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet. Its goal is to keep disaccharide ingestion to a minimum by avoiding lactose, sucrose, maltose and isomaltose (remnants of starch digestion) and to provide a nutritious, healing diet without these double sugars and to deprive the microbial world of the intestine from a surplus of fermentable carbohydrates. It is well known that compounds arising in the intestinal tract can enter the bloodstream and cross the blood brain barrier.16 (Gastroenterologists have been aware of this in treating the neurological effects of liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy. Reports have been published on how these toxins from the intestinal tract affect neurotransmitter substances in the brain.17 Other research by E.R.Bolte18 in an effort to correlate autism behavioral symptoms to the intestinal tract, investigated how the toxin of one bacterium, Clostridium tetani, could find its way from the intestinal tract to the central nervous system via the vagus nerve. But there is still disagreement among researchers as to what constitutes the toxins from the gastrointestinal tract and what their origins are. Again, are they derived from proteins or are they products of intestinal bacterial action? This question was addressed in an outstanding research paper published in Neuropsychobiology in 2002 and authored by Dr. Harumi Jyonouchi et al.19 Dr. Jyonouchi?s group were the first to explain how bacterial toxins from the intestine can result in sensitivities to certain dietary proteins, and casts light on the conundrum of which comes first: allergies/sensitivities which might lead to intestinal inflammation, or bacterial and yeast overgrowth (infections) which can lead to sensitivities to certain dietary proteins. The question can be viewed as ?can the body?s innate immune system, by reacting to the toxins of certain bacterial cell walls, cause the sensitivities to proteins such as casein and gluten?? The authors suggest that the root cause of the food protein sensitivity may be an underlying sensitivity to endotoxin, which arises from the surfaces of gram-negative bacteria in the gut flora: the lipopolysaccharide component of the cell wall of certain bacteria present in the intestine.20 This response to an endotoxin of intestinal bacterial cells is considered an innate immune response, an ancient form of defense and coded in the genes as an inherited trait. This innate immune response to the bacterial toxin could stimulate the production of antibodies and cytokines, initiators of an inflammatory response, part of an adaptive immune response.21 Dr. Jyonouchi?s research is an attempt to answer the question of why there is gastrointestinal pathology in children exhibiting autism spectrum disorders and invites the research community to explore dietary intervention in order to ameliorate the behavioral symptoms of autism. It is the hope of the author that this book will be of help to the research community in understanding how the molecular components of commonly eaten foods affect this problem and how changing the child?s diet can, indeed, break the vicious cycle. Important note to parents of autistic children: When implementing The Specific Carbohydrate Diet, it is important to remember that during the first week to ten days, profound changes are occurring in the digestive tract: the hundreds of different families of microorganisms are changing their metabolic functions due to the lack of nutrients to which they have been accustomed and of which they are now being deprived Some children may do well even during the first week. But others will go through a period of adjustment which some refer to as ?detoxification.? It will be helpful during this period to find support from the many other parents who have been through this change. Going to the following websites can give you this support. It is especially important that you read the information on these websites relating to the introduction of dairy products. A decision can then be made if the Specific Carbohydrate Diet should be implemented with or without dairy. Pecanbread.com BreakingtheViciousCycle.info Footnotes: 1. Buie, T., H. Winter and R.

Until about 10 years ago the exact mechanisms controlling cellular responses to the endotoxin ? or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ? of Gram-negative bacteria were unknown. Now a considerable body of evidence supports a model where LPS or LPS-containing particles (including intact bacteria) form complexes with a serum protein known as LPS-binding protein; the LPS in the complex is subsequently transferred to another protein which binds LPS, CD14. The latter is found on the plasma membrane of most cell types of the myeloid lineage as well as in the serum in its soluble form. LPS binding of these two forms of CD 14 results in the activation of cell types of myeloid and nonmyeloid lineages respectively. 21. Medzhitov, R. and C. Janeway. 2000. Innate immunity.

In Wisconsin, at least one child is diagnosed with autism every day. Autism is now the most prevalent developmental disability\ufffdaffecting more children than cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, hearing loss, and vision impairment. In fact, more children will be diagnosed with autism than with childhood leukemia, diabetes, and cancer combined. Friends of Autism was established in 2000 as the only autism charity in Wisconsin dedicated to raising money to fund autism research, awareness, and education. Friends of Autism is powered by volunteers and relied upon by parents and professionals throughout the state.

At six months, children with autism spectrum disorder demonstrated behavior similar to other children, gazing at faces, sharing smiles, and vocalizing with similar frequency, researchers reported online in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. However, autistic children displayed fewer of these behaviors as as they got older, and from six months to 18 months the loss of social communication and skills typically became clear. While doctors typically caught early signs of autism, the declines were more subtle than previously suggested and most parents -- 83 percent -- did not report regression in the social behaviors and skills. Related WATCH: Mothers Age Linked to Autism 'Love Hormone' Oxytocin Shows Promise in AutismLancet Retracts Controversial Autism Paper \"These findings lead us to two major conclusions,\" Sally Ozonoff of University of California Davis Health System in Sacramento and colleagues wrote. \"First, the behavioral symptoms of autism spectrum disorder appear to emerge over time, beginning in the second half of the first year of life and continuing to develop for several years. adsonar_placementId=1280601;adsonar_pid=42750;adsonar_ps=-1;adsonar_zw=165;adsonar_zh=220;adsonar_jv='ads.adsonar.com'; \"Second, our most widely used and recommended practice for gathering information about symptom onset, parent-provided developmental history, does not provide a valid assessment of the slow decline in social communication that can be observed prospectively.\" Autism is thought to emerge in two ways: an early onset pattern and a regressive pattern. A majority of autistic children are thought to experience the early onset pattern, showing clear signs of the disease in the second year of life but in some cases showing signs before the first birthday. Those with the regressive pattern are thought to develop normally for the first year of life, then begin losing communications and social skills. regression American Academy of Child Adolescent Psychiatry 10013 Sacramento AC NewsSFP Hormone' Oxytocin Shows Promise Sally Ozonoff Psychiatric Association announced in February that the organization is revision the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV which helps health professionals identify mental health disorders. The fifth edition of the DSM will be officially released in 2013, but some of the new guidelines, especially for those that fall under the Autism Spectrum Disorders, propose that Asperger\ufffds syndrome should not be a separate diagnosis from other autistic disorders generating a furry of comments and concerns. Asperger\ufffds Syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects two-way social interaction, both verbal and nonverbal communication, and a reluctance to accept change. Patients also have an inflexibility of thought and an obsessively narrow area of interest. They require a structured environment and rely on routines. Asperger patients are often highly intelligent, excelling especially in math and science. They have excellent rote memory skills for remembering things such as facts, figures, and dates. In addition to a deficit in social skills, Asperger patients may also show delayed motor skills and a presence of \ufffdmotor clumsiness\ufffd. They may take longer pedaling a bike, catching a ball, or have trouble with other manipulative tasks such as opening a jar. The National Institutes of Health estimates that Asperger\ufffds syndrome affects about two out of every 10,000 children. It appears to affect boys more than girls. Unlike autism, language acquisition and cognitive development are not delayed and Asperger\ufffds is usually diagnosed later in childhood. Because the severity of the symptoms range within the syndrome and some experts do not recognize mild cases, often calling a patient \ufffdodd\ufffd or \ufffdeccentric\ufffd, the American Psychiatric Association Committee feels that reclassifying Asperger\ufffds patients as \ufffdhighly functioning autism\ufffd patients may help children get the services and support they need. Dr. Charles Raison, psychiatrist at Emory University, says that \ufffdit is more accurate to call it a form of autism. From a scientific point of view, I think the use of these spectrum ideas is much closer to the underlying biology.\ufffd Rosalyn Lord, Coordinator of CASSEL \ufffd a support group for Asperger\ufffds patients in the UK \ufffd maintains the conditions should remain separate diagnoses. At the Online Asperger Syndrome Information and Support (OASIS) Center, she writes that while both syndromes are characterized by a difficulty with social skills, autism is often interpreted as a withdrawal from normal life and the impairments are much greater than those of Asperger\ufffds. Children with autism often have little or no language and have a greater difficulty in learning. Those with Asperger are more verbal and have a cognitive ability that is usually above average. Both autistic and Asperger patients find the world confusing and frustrating, leading to behavioral problems that need special attention. Language and communication therapies can be helpful for both, but with different focuses. While autistic patients need encouragement to acquire more verbal skills, Asperger patients need help with understanding the subtleties of language \ufffd that everything said is not black and white. Parents of children with both conditions need to understand routines and structure that can be helpful for children diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder. OASIS gives this list of helpful strategies to help, especially with Asperger\ufffds Syndrome children: \ufffd Keep all your speech and instructions simple - to a level they understand. The use of lists or pictures may help. \ufffd Try to get confirmation that they understand what you are talking about/or asking - don't rely on a stock yes or no - that they like to answer with. \ufffd Explain why they should look at you when you speak to them. Encourage them, give praise for any achievement - especially when they use a social skill without prompting. \ufffd In some young children who appear not to listen - the act of 'singing' your words can have a beneficial effect. \ufffd Limit any choices to two or three items. \ufffd Limit their 'special interest' time to set amounts of time each day if you can. \ufffd Use turn taking activities as much as possible, not only in games but at home too. \ufffd Pre-warn them of any changes, and give warning prompts if you want them to finish a task. \ufffd Try to build in some flexibility in their routine, if they learn early that things do change and often without warning - it can help. \ufffd Don't always expect them to 'act their age' they are usually immature and you should make some allowances for this. \ufffd Try to identify stress triggers and avoid them if possible. \ufffd Promises and threats you make will have to be kept - so try not to make them too lightly. \ufffd Let them know that you love them and that you are proud of them. It can be very easy with a child who rarely speaks not to tell them all the things you feel inside. Autism Spectrum Disorders routines aspergers Asperger\ufffds Syndrome National Institutes of Health social interaction UK Diagnostic American Psychiatric Association cognitive \ufffd DSM Statistical Manual IV Asperger\ufffds Emory University American Psychiatric Association Committee Charles Raison CASSEL Developmental Disorder (PDD) is a neurological disorder that affects a child\ufffds ability to communicate, understand language, play, and relate to others. PDD represents a distinct category of developmental disabilities that share many of the same characteristics. The different diagnostic terms that fall within the broad meaning of PDD, include: \ufffd Disorder, and\ufffd Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). While there are subtle differences and degrees of severity among these conditions, treatment and educational needs can be very similar for all of them. In the diagnostic manual used to classify mental disorders, the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), \ufffdAutistic Disorder\ufffd is listed under the heading of \ufffdPervasive Developmental Disorders.\ufffd A diagnosis of autistic disorder is made when an individual displays 6 or more of 12 symptoms across three major areas: (a) social interaction, (b) communication, and (c) behavior. When children display similar behaviors but do not meet the specific criteria for autistic disorder (or the other disorders listed above), they may receive a diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, or PDD-NOS. Autism is one of the disabilities specifically defined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the federal legislation under which infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities receive early intervention, special education and related services. IDEA defines the disorder as \ufffda developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and nonverbal communication and social interaction, generally evident before age 3, that adversely affects a child\ufffds educational performance. Other characteristics often associated with autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences.\ufffd [See 34 Code of Federal Regulations \ufffd300.8(c)(1).] routines PDD childhood disintegrative disorder social interaction American Psychiatric Association Disabilities Education Act IDEA PDD-NOS Autism/Pervasive Developmental Disorder Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified DSM-IV-TR \ufffdPervasive Developmental Disorders.\ufffd A Federal Regulations www.nichcy.org/Disabilities/Specific/Pages/Autism.aspx Autism414 http://www.autismhangout.com/news-reports/ You must be the change you want to see in the world.

Autism is a life-long condition of a developmental disability, affecting the individual s understanding of what he/she sees, hears and senses. As a result, people with autism can have problems in social relationships, communication and behaviour. Autism affects approximately one in five hundred people and boys are more likely to be affected than girls. It affects all ethnic and social groups. The cause of autism remains unknown, however it is definitely not caused by poor parenting (as was once believed). Understanding of autism has improved greatly over the years, although there is no known cure. What are the features of autism? Autism is a developmental disability. A person with autism will have significant difficulties in several areas of his/her development. Individuals with autism typically show uneven skill development. All people with autism will have problems with communication, social interaction and behaviour, regardless of the level of intellectual functioning. The degree of severity of characteristics differs from person to person, but can include the following: Communication: Autism affects the ability of a person to understand the meaning and purpose of body language and the spoken and written word. There may be delay or absence in language development, difficulties understanding speech, difficulties using language, difficulties understanding and using gesture. Social Interaction: Social interaction is an essential part of life for most people. For people with autism being sociable is difficult. Problems usually occur with: understanding relationships, relating to others, maintaining eye contact, forming friendships, understanding other peoples thoughts and feelings. Some appear to withdraw and become isolated; others try very hard to be sociable but never seem to get it right. Variable Sensory Responses - may appear to be deaf, may appear to have selective hearing, may use peripheral vision, may show extreme fear reactions, apparent insensitivity to pain, may show lack of responsiveness to cold or heat, may overreact to any of these Intellectual Functioning - uneven pattern of skills, some things may be done quite well in relation to overall functioning eg memorising dates, numbers, advertising jingles, the majority of people with autism have varying degrees of intellectual disability Activities and Interests - Restricted range of activities and interests: unusual repetitive body movements eg hand flicking, spinning or rocking. walking on tip-toe, rigidity in routines, obsessive and ritualistic behaviour eg peeling paint/wallpaper, smelling food before eating, resistance to and difficulty adapting to change Play - lack of imaginative play eg make-believe games, play inappropriate to the function of the toy eg spinning wheels, lining up Textas, may have difficulty learning through imitations How is Autism diagnosed? Assessments are provided by most Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, specialist paediatricians and child psychiatrists, and private teams or clinics. If affected, most children will show signs of autism by two years of age, but a diagnosis may not be confirmed until three years of age, and sometimes older. The main criteria used for diagnosis are: qualitative impairment in verbal and non verbal communication qualitative impairment in reciprocal social interaction markedly restricted number of activities and interests and impaired imaginative play symptoms evident during first 30 months of life Autism may be diagnosed using the above criteria, or there may be varying amounts of disability in other areas of development which result in diagnosis of conditions called Asperger Syndrome or Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD - NOS). These developmental disabilities are referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorders. People with these disorders are affected differently, but all require specialised assistance and support. What is the Treatment for Autism? Behavioural and Developmental Therapy: There is no one therapy or approach to the treatment of autistic disorders. The needs of each person vary greatly. Specialised educational approaches enhance development in social, language, self-help, co-operation and other basic skills. These are best when provided controlled, consistent, predictable and organised routines to assist children to progress with learning. Early intervention is highly desirable. Most able. Most school aged children will be eligible for assistance with Government programs for students with disabilities and impairments. Children benefit greatly from being with their peers and may attend a specialist school, or a mainstream school with additional support. Medications: Medication has no specific role in autism; however some may be useful to manage co-existing conditions eg. anticonvulsants are required if epilepsy develops, and medications may be prescribed to treat aggression, depression, anxiety, etc, if they develop. These would be prescribed by a suitably qualified medical practitioner. Diet Therapy: All people benefit from a diet that is nutritionally adequate. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has produced dietary guidelines for Australians to promote healthy eating. Eating a wide variety of nutritious foods including grains and cereals, fruits, vegetables, dairy and meat foods daily is an important part of a healthy diet. Children need appropriate food and physical activity for normal physical growth and development. It is important to achieve an adequate food intake to balance the physical activity and growth of childhood and adolescence. There have been some suggestions that a casein-free/gluten-free diet may be beneficial in the treatment of Autism. Significant research into the role of this diet has been undertaken by the Autism Research Unit of the University of Sunderland, UK. It is strongly recommended that anyone considering such dietary management should seek the support of their medical practitioner and a knowledgeable dietitian. The dietary restrictions can be challenging. It is recommended that you discuss your child s diet with a dietitian to ensure that it includes all of the important nutrients for growthand development. How Can Orgran Products Assist Me? The entire range of Orgran products are gluten free casein free. For those choosing to follow a gluten-free/casein-free diet for the management of autism, Orgran products are ideal. For those wanting to follow general principles of healthy eating, you can enjoy the benefits of alternative grains, with Orgran products that are also low fat, and do not have added sucrose. Orgran s great range of pastas, crispbreads, bread and baking mixes, breakfast cereals, biscuits and fruit snacks are a delicious inclusion in a nutritious diet. Who Can I contact for More Support?

As parents, we must seek the truth. The emerging theory that Thimerosal, a preservative which is half mercury that was increased in vaccines during 1988 and 1991, continues to heat up the debate as to whether or not it fueled the dramatic increase in autism and other developmental disabilities in the United States and other countries around the world. AutismFACTS will look closely at this issue and all information, debates, and research concerning Thimerosal. Research will be looked at very closely as to validity, structure and usefulness. Who conducted the research? What type of research was done and how reliable is the information and conclusions? Is there criticism surrounding the research and how valid is that criticism? Debates surrounding Thimerosal will also be closely looked at. Are the points being made valid and true or are they speculative and unsupported? Where did the debate points begin? And who is making the arguments? Information extends into the political arena and this be closely looked at, as well. There are politicians who are supporting research into the cause of autism, including investigating Thimerosal, and there are those who are not. All political support and interference concerning various issues and Bills concerning autism will be explored and reported. AutismFACTS is dedicated to taking an unbiased and factual look at this issue. We, the public, cannot stand by blindly accepting any and all statements we hear, dismissing important research of any kind, nor can we reject any relevant information. We must stand together strong, seek answers and continue to ask questions. We must fight for research in all areas of autism and other developmental disabilities and find correct and safe ways to help our children. The controversy surrounding Thimerosal is strong because of the political and potential fallout concerning Federal Agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as private organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). However, the truth is not something that can be compromised for any reason and any controversy surrounding these agencies will be looked at as well. The same goes for any research or debate disputing their position. The truth must prevail, whichever way the truth turns. Let the chips fall where they may. United States Centers for Disease Control Food and Drug Administration FDA CDC American Academy of Pediatrics AAP Thimerosal Federal Agencies 1988 and 1991 autismfacts.com/ Autism421 http://www.webpediatrics.com/autism2.html Patients with autism have become an unwilling polygon for testing of just about any new behavioral modification or psychotropic drug that comes to the market. Again, the target of all these pharmaceutical is NOT autism as a disease, but only its symptoms. Methylphenidate, Pemoline have been used to control symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity. Propranolol has been used for explosive behavior and inhibitors and agonists, antidepressants (Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Sertraline, Clomipramine) are being used some of the classic autistic symptoms: perserveration, obsessions, rigidity, aggressiveness) and haloperidol, thoridazine, chlorpromazine control of aggressiveness, destructiveness and self-injury. Fluvoxamine and Risperidone appear to be overall effective in controlling some of the core symptoms of autism and repeated studies have confirmed their effectiveness. Risperidone has also shown promise in Asperger's syndrome. Quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic currently approved for treatment of schizophrenia, has shown some promise in Autistic Spectrum Disorders and mental retardation patients. 60 percent of patients with autism have responded favorably to the moderate to high doses of this medication. mental http://health.yahoo.com/nervous-symptoms/autism-symptoms/healthwise--hw152190.html Symptoms Core symptoms The severity of symptoms varies greatly between individuals, but all people with autism have some core symptoms in the areas of: Social interactions and relationships. Symptoms may include: Significant problems developing nonverbal communication skills, such as eye-to-eye gazing, facial expressions, and body posture. Failure to establish friendships with children the same age. Lack of interest in sharing enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people. Lack of empathy. People with autism may have difficulty understanding another person's feelings, such as pain or sorrow. Verbal and nonverbal communication. Symptoms may include: Delay in, or lack of, learning to talk. As many as 40% of people with autism never speak.1 Problems taking steps to start a conversation. Also, people with autism have difficulties continuing a conversation after it has begun. Stereotyped and repetitive use of language. People with autism often repeat over and over a phrase they have heard previously (echolalia). Difficulty understanding their listener's perspective. For example, a person with autism may not understand that someone is using humor. They may interpret the communication word for word and fail to catch the implied meaning. Limited interests in activities or play. Symptoms may include: An unusual focus on pieces. Younger children with autism often focus on parts of toys, such as the wheels on a car, rather than playing with the entire toy. Preoccupation with certain topics. For example, older children and adults may be fascinated by video games, trading cards, or license plates. A need for sameness and routines. For example, a child with autism may always need to eat bread before salad and insist on driving the same route every day to school. Stereotyped behaviors. These may include body rocking and hand flapping. Symptoms during childhood Symptoms of autism are usually noticed first by parents and other caregivers sometime during the child's first 3 years. Although autism is present at birth (congenital), signs of the disorder can be difficult to identify or diagnose during infancy. Parents often become concerned when their toddler does not like to be held; does not seem interested in playing certain games, such as peekaboo; and does not begin to talk. Sometimes, a child will start to talk at the same time as other children the same age, then lose his or her language skills. They also may be confused about their child's hearing abilities. It often seems that a child with autism does not hear, yet at other times, he or she may appear to hear a distant background noise, such as the whistle of a train. With early and intensive treatment, most children improve their ability to relate to others, communicate, and help themselves as they grow older. Contrary to popular myths about children with autism, very few are completely socially isolated or \"live in a world of their own.\" Symptoms during teen years During the teen years, the patterns of behavior often change. Many teens gain skills but still lag behind in their ability to relate to and understand others. Puberty and emerging sexuality may be more difficult for teens who have autism than for others this age. Teens are at an increased risk for developing problems related to depression, anxiety, and epilepsy. Symptoms in adulthood Some adults with autism are able to work and live on their own. The degree to which an adult with autism can lead an independent life is related to intelligence and ability to communicate. At least 33% are able to achieve at least partial independence.2 Some adults with autism need a lot of assistance, especially those with low intelligence who are unable to speak. Part- or full-time supervision can be provided by residential treatment programs. At the other end of the spectrum, adults with high-functioning autism are often successful in their professions and able to live independently, although they typically continue to have some difficulties relating to other people. These individuals usually have average to above-average intelligence. Other symptoms Many people with autism have symptoms similar to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). But these symptoms, especially problems with social relationships, are more severe for people with autism. For more information, see the topic Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. About 10% of people with autism have some form of savant skills\ufffdspecial limited gifts such as memorizing lists, calculating calendar dates, drawing, or musical ability.1 Many people with autism have unusual sensory perceptions. For example, they may describe a light touch as painful and deep pressure as providing a calming feeling. Others may not feel pain at all. Some people with autism have strong food likes and dislikes and unusual preoccupations. Sleep problems occur in about 40% to 70% of people with autism.3 Other conditions Autism is one of several types of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), also called autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is not unusual for autism to be confused with other PDDs, such as Asperger's disorder or syndrome, or to have overlapping symptoms. A similar condition is called pervasive developmental disorder-NOS (not otherwise specified). PDD-NOS occurs when children display similar behaviors but do not meet the criteria for autism. It is commonly called just PDD. In addition, other conditions with similar symptoms may also have similarities to or occur with autism. depression routines echolalia anxiety sleep ADHD Oxytocin Hormone May Treat Autism Study Shows Oxytocin May Improve Social Skills for Some People With Autism By Jennifer Warner WebMD Health News Reviewed By Louise Chang, MD Feb. 15, 2010 -- Oxytocin, the so-called hormone of love, may help promote social skills and social behavior in people with high-functioning autism. A new study shows people with high-functioning autism disorders, such as Asperger's syndrome, who were treated with oxytocin responded more strongly to others and displayed more appropriate social behaviors. Despite high intellectual abilities, people with high-functioning autism lack the social skills to engage appropriately with others in social situations. Oxytocin is nicknamed the hormone of love because it is known to promote mother-infant bonds. It is also thought to be involved in the regulation of emotions and other social behaviors. Other research has found that children with autism have lower levels of oxytocin than children without autism. In this study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers examined the effect of inhaled oxytocin on social behavior in 13 young adults with high-functioning autism in two separate experiments. A comparable group of 13 people without autism was also included in the study. In the first experiment, researchers observed the participants' social behavior in a computer ball-tossing game in which the players could choose between passing the ball to a good, bad, or neutral character. Typically, people with autism would exhibit little preference between the three choices, but in the experiment those treated with oxytocin engaged more with the good character and sent more balls to the good character than the bad one. People with autism who were given a placebo showed no difference in the way they responded to the three characters. The comparison group without autism sent more balls to the good character. In the second experiment, researchers measured the participants' attentiveness and responses to pictures of human faces. Those treated with oxytocin were more attentive to visual cues in the pictures and looked longer at the socially informative region of the face, namely the eyes. \"Thus, under oxytocin, patients respond more strongly to others and exhibit more appropriate social behavior and affect, suggesting a therapeutic potential of oxytocin through its action on a core dimension of autism,\" write researcher Elissar Andari of the Centre N\ufffdtional de la Recherche Scientifique in Bron, France, and colleagues. They say the results suggest further long-term studies are needed to examine the effects of oxytocin on social skills and behaviors in people with high-functioning autism.SOURCES: Andari, E.

The findings were expected to draw widespread attention because of the intense public interest in autism, but their true impact was expected to be simply in suggesting further avenues of research. Surprisingly, the age of the father plays little role unless the mother is younger than 30 and the father is over 40, according to the analysis of all births in California in the 1990s. The number of women over age 40 in California giving birth increased by 300% in the 1990s, while the diagnosis of autism increased by 600%. At first glance, it might seem that the rise in older pregnancies could be responsible for the rise in autism, which is now thought to affect as many as one child in every 100. But the authors, from UC Davis, calculate that older mothers account for less than 5% of the increase in autism diagnoses. \"There is a long history of blaming parents\" for the development of autism, said senior author Dr. Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences and a researcher at the UC Davis MIND Institute who has been studying potential causes for the autism increase. \"We're not saying this is the fault of mothers or fathers. We're just saying this is a correlation that will direct research in the future.\" Researchers have long known that the age of the parents plays a role in a child's risk of developing autism, but how big a role and how that role varies with the sex of the parent has remained confusing, with contradictory results reported in different studies. To investigate, Hertz-Picciotto, graduate student Janie E. Shelton and epidemiologist Daniel J. Tancredi of UC Davis analyzed all the singleton births in California during the 1990s for which information was available about the ages of both parents, a total of about 4.9 million births and 12,159 cases of autism. Because of the large sample size, they were able to show how the risk was affected by each parent's age. They reported in the February issue of the journal Autism Research that women over 40 were 77% more likely to deliver an autistic child than those younger than 25 and 51% more likely than those age 25 to 29, independent of the age of the father. For men over 40, there was a 59% increased risk of autism if the mother was younger than 30, but virtually no increased risk if the mother was over 30. The researchers also calculated that the recent trend toward delayed childbearing contributed about a 4.6% increase in autism diagnoses over the decade. \"Five percent is probably indicating that there is something besides maternal age going on because we are seeing a rise in every age group of parents,\" Shelton said. Also, noted Hertz-Picciotto, older women may be followed more closely during pregnancy, which would mean more ultrasounds - which a few researchers have suggested might play a role in autism. Older women are more likely to suffer gestational diabetes and to develop autoimmune disorders, both of which have been linked to an increased risk of autism. \"We still have a real long way to go\" in determining the causes of autism, she concluded. textSize() Copyright 2010, The Los Angeles Times Sphere.Inline.search(\"\", \"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/sfl-healthykey-family-autism-31110,0,1408716.story\"); E-mail Digg Twitter Facebook StumbleUpon Comments (0) Add comments Currently there are no comments.

Fred was two and a half years old, but had not begun to talk. He didn't babble like other children his age. Fred did not make eye contact, but his vision seemed fine. He loved watching his own hands. He could sit for hours watching his hands move back and forth. Fred was diagnosed with autism, a neurological disorder that disrupts normal development. Some children with autism can attend school with children their own age; others need special care. The Symptoms Autism is classified as a pervasive developmental disorder. The \"pervasive\" part of the name implies that the disorder is serious, or that it affects many areas of development. Symptoms vary greatly from person to person. People with autism may appear to daydream constantly or be unaware of people around them. Most children with autism prefer to play by themselves, and treat other people like furniture. The major symptoms of autism include: Symptoms of Autism Communication Problems Many people with autism are uncommunicative - they will not speak, gesture, or make facial expressions. When they do speak, the speech may be in a sing-song pattern or monotone (no variation in pitch, like playing a single note on an instrument). Other people with autism may talk at length with no regard to what another person says or does. Repetitive Motions Most people with autism enjoy repetitive motions, such as spinning objects, running water, or sniffing objects. A sense of routine is very important, and it can be extremely upsetting to them when part of their routine is changed. This could be something as trivial as changing the route to the grocery store or moving an item within the house. Problems with Social Interactions People with autism have trouble interpreting other people's facial expressions. Most of the time they will not make eye contact with others and have trouble making friends. Some people with autism are hypersensitive to sound and may get very upset when they hear sirens or dogs barking. Others are fascinated by faint noises such as the ticking of a watch. To some, bright lights are distressing, while others will stare at bright lights for hours. Many people with autism can not stand light touch: scratchy clothing could be unbearable. Others seem immune to pain and may hurt themselves. Mood swings are common. The Cause of Autism is Unknown It was once thought that poor parenting caused autism. This is definitely not true. Although the cause of autism is unclear, it is known that genetics do play a role. The disorder is seen often in identical twins: different studies have shown that if one identical twin has autism then there is a 63-98% chance that the other twin will have it. For non-identical twins (also called fraternal or dizygotic twins), the chance is between 0-10% that both twins will develop autism. The chance that siblings will be affected by autism is about 3%. Chance that both people will develop autism 63-98%Identical Twins 0-10%Fraternal Twins 3%Siblings Autism appears to be associated with other chromosomal abnormalities, such as Fragile X syndrome or brain abnormalities such as congenital rubella syndrome. A large number of people with these disorders are also diagnosed with autism. Furthermore, complicated births, such as difficult pregnancies, labor, or delivery may to contribute to the disorder. Diagnosis Autism is a behaviorally defined syndrome. There is no simple test for it. Usually parents notice that their child is not developing in the same way as other children the same age. A physician can perform a psychiatric exam, ruling out other disorders such as schizophrenia, selective mutism (when the child chooses not to speak but can speak if he wanted to), or mental retardation, to name a few. Other tests examine language skills. When all test results are examined, a physician can make a diagnosis. Treatment Although symptoms in children may lessen with age, autism is a lifelong disorder. Many people with autism will remain in institutionalized care and approximately 50% will remain without the ability to speak. Structured programs that do not allow the child to \"tune out\" have proved successful at helping many children gain language and some social skills. Many times children with autism will have other disorders, such as epilepsy (seizures), hyperactivity, and attention problems. Epilepsy, in particular, appears to get worse as autistic children get older. Drugs that inhibit the reuptake of the neurotransmitter called serotonin have some success in treating patients with autism. These drugs, such as Fluxoetine, slow the reuptake of serotonin by the neuron that releases it. Therefore, serotonin stays in the synapse for a longer time. Normal Synapse With Fluxoetine A Look at the Brain of a Person with Autism Brain imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been used to examine the brains of people with autism. However, results have been inconsistent. Abnormal brain areas in people with autism include the: Cerebellum - reduced size in parts of the cerebellum. Hippocampus and Amygdala - smaller volume. Also, neurons in these areas are smaller and more tightly packed (higher cell density). Lobes of the Cerebrum - larger size than normal. Ventricles - increased size. Caudate nucleus - reduced volume. Quick Facts About Autism Autism occurs in approximately four or five out of every 10,000 children in the U.S. Autism is the third most common developmental disorder in the U.S., affecting at least 500,000 people. Autism is seen more often in boys; four or five boys will have autism compared to one girl. But girls with autism are often more severely affected than boys and score lower on intelligence tests. Leo Kanner first described autism as the \"inability to relate themselves in the ordinary way to people and situations from the beginning of life\" in the 1943 paper \"Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact.\" Autism usually is seen within the first three years of life. Approximately 80% of people with autism function at a mentally retarded level (usually within the moderate range of retardation). Some people with autism are gifted in certain areas such as math or music. These are termed \"splinter skills.\" Autism has also been further reading: American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), 4th Edition, Washington, D.C., American Psychiatric Association, 1994.

The study revealed that chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) had the highest detection rate among clinically available genetic tests for patients with autism spectrum disorders and should be part of the initial diagnostic evaluation of all patients with ASDs unless a genetic diagnosis has already been made. <!-- = \"FF0000\"; //--> The study, a collaboration between the Autism Consortium and Children's Hospital Boston, led by Consortium members Bai-Lin Wu, David Miller, Kira Dies, and Yiping Shen, examined 933 families (children and parents) who received clinical genetic testing for a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) between January 2006 and December 2008. The researchers compared the findings from three clinical genetic tests: G-banded karyotype and fragile X testing, the current standard battery of genetic testing, and chromosomal microarray analysis, for which testing guidelines have not yet been established. Chromosomal microarray analysis is similar to a karyotype, but can find much smaller chromosomal deletions and duplications. The results showed that chromosomal microarray analysis identified more genetic abnormalities associated with autism than the standard testing methods combined: Standard testing method G-banded karyotype testing yielded abnormal results in 19/852 patients (2.23%) Standard testing method Fragile X testing results were abnormal in 4/861 patients (0.46%) In contrast, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) identified deletions or duplications in 154/848 (18.2%) patients and 59/848 (7.0%) were clearly abnormal. As a result, chromosomal microarray was better than a karyotype for all but a small number of patients with balanced rearrangements, and those were not necessarily a cause of ASD. \"This is the largest study of clinical genetic testing for patients with autism spectrum disorders, and the results clearly show that chromosomal microarray analysis detects genetic abnormalities leading to ASD more often than a standard karyotype and fragile X testing,\" said David Miller, MD, PhD, assistant director of the DNA Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's. \"Chromosomal microarray was much better than a karyotype, but most clinical guidelines still recommend a karyotype and consider the microarray a second tier test.\" Because of the dramatic increase in variations identified using CMA, the Autism Consortium recommends that CMA should be included in the first tier of diagnostic testing for children with ASD symptoms who have no clear genetic cause.

What is the treatment for autism? Is autism inherited? NHGRI Clinical Research on Autism Additional Resources for Autism What is autism? Autism - or more precisely the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) - represent a broad group of developmental disorders characterized by impaired social interactions, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors or severely limited activities and interests. The ASDs include a variety of medical autism diagnoses, which vary in the severity of the individual symptoms and include autistic disorder (sometimes called classical autism), Asperger's syndrome and a general diagnostic category called Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). Autism has become the most commonly diagnosed childhood developmental disorder. According to the Centers for Disease Control Prevention in 2007, autism spectrum disorders now affect 1 in every 150 children in the United States. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Education and other government agencies indicate that autism diagnoses are increasing at the rate of 10 to 17 percent per year. Autism can affect any individual and is not based on ethnic, racial or social background. The incidence of autism is the same all around the world. It is four times more common in boys than in girls. Top of page What are the symptoms of autism? Autism usually develops before 3 years of age and affects each individual differently and to varying degrees. It ranges in severity from relatively mild social and communicative impairments to a severe disability requiring lifelong parental, school and societal support. The hallmark symptom of autism is impaired social interaction. Children with autism may fail to respond to their name and often avoid eye contact with other people. They have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling because they don't understand social cues provided by tone of voice or facial expressions and they don't watch other people's faces to pick up on these cues. Many children with autism engage in repetitive movements such as rocking, spinning, twirling or jumping, or in self-abusive behavior such as hand biting or head-banging. Of children being diagnosed now with an autism spectrum disorder, about half will have mental retardation defined by nonverbal IQ testing and 25 percent will also develop seizures. Though most children show signs of autism in the first year of life, about 30 percent will seem fine and then regress in both their language and social interactions at around 18 months of age. About 30 percent of children with autism have physical signs of some alteration in early development such as physical features that differ from their parents (sometimes called dysmorphic features), small head size (microcephaly) or structural brain malformations. Top of page How is autism diagnosed? Diagnosis of autism is based on standardized testing plus a clinical evaluation by an autism specialist. These professionals are usually psychologists, psychiatrists, developmental pediatricians, pediatric neurologists or medical geneticists. The diagnosis of autism is made when there are a specific number of symptoms as defined by the Diagnostic and Standard Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Some commonly used diagnostic tests are the CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale), the ABC (Autism Behavior Checklist) and the GARS (Gilliam Autism Rating Scale). Formal diagnosis by an autism specialist usually depends on completing the ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale), and ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised). The CHAT (Checklist for Autism in Toddlers) is often used in pediatrican's offices to screen for autism symptoms. When physical features, small head size or brain malformations are present or there is a family history of relatives with autism, genetic testing such as chromosome analysis and single-gene testing is done. Top of page What is the treatment for autism? There is currently no cure for autism. However, autism can be managed and shaped at a young age, even as early as pre-school. Early intensive therapy can have a positive effect on development later in life. Treatment of autism involves medical and behavioral therapies to help children with conversational language and social interactions. Treatment also involves helping children decrease their repetitive, self-stimulatory behaviors, tantrums and self-injurious behavior. Medications can help treat specific symptoms such as aggressive or self-injurious behavior, inattention, poor sleep and repetitive behaviors. However, no medications are autism specific and medications should be used in conjunction with a family-centered, behavioral and educational program. Top of page Is autism inherited? Scientists are not certain what causes autism, but it's likely that both genetics and environment play a role. The causes of autism may be divided into 'idiopathic', (of unknown cause) which is the majority of cases, and 'secondary,' in which a chromosome abnormality, single-gene disorder or environmental agent can be identified. Approximately 15 percent of individuals with autism can be diagnosed with secondary autism; the remaining 85 percent have idiopathic autism. Exposure during pregnancy to rubella (German measles), valproic acid, and thalidomide, are recognized causes of secondary autism; however, it remains unclear whether those who develop autism after such an exposure are also genetically predisposed. The search for new environmental causes of secondary autism has centered primarily on childhood immunizations given around the time that regressive-onset autism is recognized. Both childhood immunizations and mercury in thimerosal, which was used as a preservative in some routine immunizations until 2001, have both been under scrutiny; however, no scientific evidence for a relationship between vaccines and autism has been identified. Researchers have identified a number of genes associated with autism. Studies of people with autism have found irregularities in several regions of the brain. Other studies suggest that people with autism have abnormal levels of serotonin or other neurotransmitters in the brain. These abnormalities indicate that autism usually results from the disruption of normal brain development early in fetal development caused by defects in genes that control brain growth and that regulate how neurons communicate with each other. These are preliminary findings and require further study. The risk that a brother or sister of an individual who has idiopathic autism will also develop autism is around 4 percent, plus an additional 4 to 6 percent risk for a milder condition that includes language, social or behavioral symptoms. Brothers have a higher risk (about 7 percent) of developing autism, plus the additional 7 percent risk of milder autism spectrum symptoms, over sisters whose risk is only about 1 to 2 percent. When the cause of autism is a chromosome abnormality or a single-gene alteration, the risk that other brothers and sisters will also have autism depends on the specific genetic cause.

Autism Dr. Molly McButter, Ph.D., is a much sought-after child psychologist working near Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. For the past several years, she's been counseling a suspiciously large number of well-to-do (but freaked out) moms and dads living in the Bay Area. They come to her from different cities and unique socioeconomic backgrounds, but they do have one thing in common: their kids have all started acting funny. \"Tommy,\" age two and a half, suddenly stopped recognizing his parents and 5-year-old sister. Instead of responding when called to, he'd sway back and forth in slow circles, pausing only to bonk his head repeatedly against a ceramic dog bowl. One day he ceased making eye contact with his family members altogether. He'd drag his head across the floor, walk on his toes, make odd gurgling sounds, and spend long hours filling and emptying buckets of sand in the sandbox. Then the screaming began; he'd wail inconsolably at all hours of the day and night, refusing to be held or comforted in any way. Shortly thereafter, he developed chronic diarrhea. Tommy's mother compared this incomprehensible phenomenon to someone coming into her perfectly healthy son's bedroom in the night, stealing his personality and ability to communicate, and then leaving behind the empty cardboard box of an utterly bewildered child. At age six, \"Kelly\" developed some eccentric habits of her own. She began tugging uncomfortably at the collar of her shirt or the footpads of her pajama bottoms. Sometimes she'd go as far as to rip all her clothes off during an otherwise routine trip to Safeway. At the corner Blockbuster, Kelly would windmill both of her arms and run sweeping down the aisle, knocking entire racks of video boxes onto the floor. When this caused a scene, she too would scream and lash out with her fists, biting her father and lifting up her shirt to bare her bee-stung breasts at flabbergasted customers. At home, she'd refuse to sleep more than a few minutes at a time. She began urinating in the fireplace and all four corners of the hardwood family room floor, making an exaggerated show of it whenever company came over for extended periods of time -- to the understandable consternation and embarrassment of her parents. And when \"Harrison\" reached the age of ten, his mother and father could no longer deny the disparity between his development and that of other children his age. He seemed to exist alternately in one of two possible states: passed out and sound asleep, or running tirelessly around the house from room to room wearing different wigs and clanging iron pots together. He developed an obsessive, breakfast time fascination with the Pocahontas-style illustration of the Indian princess on the Land O'Lakes spreadable butter tub. He would kick chairs, curse and shriek, and throw forks whenever it was time for her to return to the refrigerator. On his birthday, Harrison crept into his father's room as he lay sleeping, and stabbed him in the buttocks with a turkey thermometer. After a battery of tests, these children were diagnosed with varying degrees of autism, and Dr. McButter herself was responsible for delivering the bad news. She knows firsthand that the medical and psychiatric literature covering autism employs daunting words like \"hopeless\" and disparaging phrases like \"no known treatment\". Autism is a disorder which can seize upon someone instantly, or sneak up on them over the course of many months. It hinders the development of a person's ability to communicate, interact with other people and maintain normal contact with the outside world. The symptoms of autism are extremely noticeable and can be recognized as early as infancy. In most cases, a perfectly normal child will begin to regress: he or she loses the power of speech, abandons social skills, or gets stuck in infinite loops of obsessive physical activity. Most children completely withdraw into a world all their own. When parents learn their child is autistic, they describe it as one of the most traumatic, stressful events of their lives. Non-autistic people see autism as an enormous tragedy, and mothers and fathers alike experience continuing disappointment and grief at nearly all stages of an autistic child's life. Mostly this grief stems from profound sorrow over the loss of the \"normal\" child they'd been hoping for. In forty-eight states, one out of every 500 children has been diagnosed with autism. But two regions in the two remaining states -- the California Bay Area and a borough of New Jersey -- stand out: the ratio is a disturbing one in 250. Studies of the New Jersey phenomenon suggest contributing factors like environmental toxins and genetic predisposition, but age attributes of the mothers also apply. Teen mothers, as well as women in their thirties or forties are more likely to produce autistic children than a female in her twenties. New theories attempting to reconcile explanations for the Silicon Valley autism phenomenon are more sinister, and they've begun to orbit around moms and dads who met each other online. Before we explore that, let's turn our attention to the animal world for just a moment. Specialized dog factories offering their customers purebred terriers, greyhounds, German shepherds and the like are in the inbreeding business. It's been long understood that any sufficiently advanced mammal species requires a more dynamic population source. From the standpoint of maintaining a genetically healthy stock, limited mating options guarantee progressive genetic degeneration, brittle bones, deafness, heart problems and a substantial loss of vigor. Any one of these disabilities alone can saddle dog owners with the unhappy responsibility of wrangling unhealthy pets. But if you go to the Humane Society and adopt a dog, you're likely to find -- pardon the term -- a mutt, a mixed breed dog with rich, colorful DNA. These dogs are profoundly smarter, better adjusted to living with humans, and far more loving than their blue blooded cousins. In large cities, the men and women who hook up in bars get together because they find each other cute. Successful unions between such couples are more likely to produce cute kids with healthy, happy genes. After all, they're the output of parents who ostensibly came together with no similar genetic markers beyond physical appearance. Their offspring are mutts as well, and statistically predisposed to a healthier, happier life. In smaller cities (or rural areas where sexual intercourse is the preferred method of passing time because nobody has a car or a computer to escape the tedium of everyday life) people of similarly limited characteristics mix and mingle in a woefully homogenous petri dish. Such a localized gene pool is tantamount to a single block of low-income housing: there's far less opportunity for the population to enjoy the diversity required to encourage evolution, and there's a much greater chance of propagating genetic defects. The Internet as we know it is more of a puddle than a massive, unwieldy universe. Online portals like Orkut, Friendster, Tribe.Net, MySpace, Nerve, and Craigslist which foster the illusion of value by belonging to privatized, incestuous \"communities\" are inbreeding a new generation of individuals with genetic markings nearly identical to those of autism -- and its lesser cousin Asperger's. Asperger's syndrome is a Pervasive Development Disorder (PDD) characterized by severe and sustained impairment with social interaction. Adults with Asperger's have trouble feeling empathy for others, especially when it comes to decoding social cues like gestures, facial expressions and body language. Normal communicative behaviors like humor or the emotional nuances of sarcasm, idioms or metaphors are often wholly lost on sufferers of Asperger's. Relationship issues depicted in books, movies, and television programs will not be understood. While their reading recognition skills are excellent, language comprehension remains weak -- and it cannot be assumed that they fully understand what they so fluently read. People with autism and Asperger's can often be egocentric, meaning that in some cases they find it difficult to believe other people actually have their own thoughts, feelings, or opinions of their own. The pervasiveness of individual thoughts, feelings, and opinions in tech-savvy metropolitan areas (like Silicon Valley) might be cause for alarm. Steve Silberman, a Wired magazine reporter examined the autism phenomenon several years ago, limiting his focus primarily to men and women working in the software industry: \"It's a familiar joke that many of the hardcore programmers in IT strongholds like Intel, Adobe, and Silicon Graphics -- coming to work early, leaving late, sucking down Big Gulps in their cubicles while they code for hours -- are residing somewhere in Asperger's domain. Kathryn Stewart, director of the Orion Academy, a high school for high-functioning kids in Moraga, California, calls Asperger's syndrome the engineers' disorder. Bill Gates is regularly diagnosed in the press: His single-minded focus on technical minutiae, rocking motions, and flat tone of voice are all suggestive of an adult with some trace of the disorder. In Microserfs, novelist Douglas Coupland observes, 'I think all tech people are slightly autistic.'\" In January of 2001, Microsoft became the first major US corporation to offer its employees insurance benefits to cover the cost of behavioral training for their autistic children. But elsewhere, a building army of autistic offspring threatens to bankrupt families, school systems and states nationwide. Federal law mandates that special-needs students be removed from traditional classrooms and stationed inside the portables at the far, far end of the football field where they can receive specialized tutoring. Such a law requires hiring more expensive teachers (those with master's degrees in special education) who wrangle classrooms of five students as opposed to twenty-five. These classrooms also include deaf and blind students, children with head injuries or learning disabilities like dyslexia, severe emotional disorders or bipolar conditions. The alternative to this arrangement is equally expensive: a privatized care facility where you can park your kid in front of construction paper for the day. Meanwhile, as more and more women step up to claim their rightful place in online communities by blogging themselves silly, pumping up their perceived street value with mutually fanatical, hyperactive and hug-heavy \"testimonials,\" e-viting one another into their electroclash pilates tribes, staging impromptu stitch-n-bitch knitting circles or hosting day-long Burning Man \"decompression\" parties, mentally obtuse men and boys who might never have found a compatible female partner suddenly discover they can hurl an iPod out the window and crack one square in the head with increasing accuracy. As long as men and women continue to meet online based exclusively on shared interests, the mental stability of future generations remains in grave peril -- and new technologies will need to be developed to keep them alive. Office furniture, for instance, may need to be ergonomically redesigned to take advantage of the Hug Box, a three-dimensional calming mechanism developed specifically for autism sufferers. In cooperation with noted researcher Temple Grandin, the Hug Box is an ingenious pressurized snuggle system used for deep touch stimulation, producing a calming effect on autistic or otherwise attention deficient individuals. Hug Boxes are already being used in schools, clinics, and homes around the world. Each machine is 60\" tall, 60\" long and 32\" wide, constructed from 13-grade 3/4\" birch plywood which is sealed and lacquered for a smooth durable finish. All edges are rounded to ensure safety. The air controls are of outstanding quality and multiple safety devices are included. Remaining components are fashioned from wood, metal, and plastic. The overall look is that of traditional office cubicle, with a classy, contemporary style suitable for those working in the software, Internet, gaming or design industry. The operator places his head in the top area, against soft fuzzy padding. His hands slide through the bottom opening to manipulate a keyboard or control joystick. As the furry side panels close in at a slow pace, overstimulated nerves become calm. Employees who previously paced, panted or hid under their desks during a morning meeting will soon be able to make their way to the conference room in a much calmer state -- without the use of a plastic mouth guard or ironcage safety helmet. The Hug Box, adjustable in many ways, can be used by software engineers, QA testers, videogame \"producers,\" artistic \"directors,\" and special needs students. The machine has a series of slots and holes to accommodate a laptop, a 12-oz cup of coffee, a 17\" flat-panel display, and either a softcover O'Reilly reference or a rolled-up yoga mat. There are also slots which adjust the arm rests, sliders which allow for oversized head girths, and a hands-free speaker phone. In time, rather than clamoring for standup videogame units, Segways or Air Hockey tables, tomorrow's crop of autistic office workers borne of Orkut-sanctioned relationships or Friendster-branded marital unions will undoubtedly learn to love their complementary Hug Boxes. In a nation of eight million socially impaired Rain Mans unable to make human connections, at least everyone involved can boast they're a very good driver. The U.S. Department of Education recorded a nationwide autism increase of 600 percent between 1992 and 2004. The average child with autism will require $8 million in lifetime supervision and care. It's a disability with a normal life expectancy affecting boys five times more than girls -- although girls are more severely affected. In the United States, over one million individuals live with autism, making it more prevalent than Down Syndrome, diabetes, and cancer combined.

What causes Pervasive Developmental Disorders? What is the difference between autism and PDD-NOS? How do professionals tell the difference between autism and PDD-NOS? What is the difference between autism and Asperger's Syndrome? Does my child have an intellectual impairment (mental retardation)? How is this different from autism? What is the long term prognosis for children diagnosed with autism/PDD-NOS? My doctor says my child will never learn to talk. Is this true? How is autism/PDD-NOS diagnosed? What are the areas of concern? What should I do about my child's autism/PDD-NOS? What are the Pervasive Developmental Disorders? The Pervasive Developmental Disorders or Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental disabilities, which according to recent estimates, affect as many as 1-2 out of every 500 people. The Pervasive Developmental Disorders are also known as the autism-spectrum disorders, and they include Autistic Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), Asperger?s Disorder, Rett?s Disorder, and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. They affect up to 4-5 times as many boys as girls, occur in all cultures, and are present among all socioeconomic classes. They usually become noticeable between the ages of 1 and 3 years, and affect the way in which social behavior, communication (verbal and nonverbal communication), and attention/interests develop. There is a wide spectrum of impairment associated with the Pervasive Developmental Disorders, which can range from mild to severe. The PDDs do not describe a delay in development, but rather a difference or deviation in development in these three areas. Back to top What causes Pervasive Developmental Disorders? Pervasive Developmental Disorders are neurologically-based, medical disorders that are not caused by errors in parenting, a specific environmental toxin, poor prenatal care, etc. In a percentage of cases, there may be a genetic cause. Although scientists are making strides in identifying their cause(s), right now, there does not appear to be one specific cause for all cases. A physician or psychologist may diagnose one of these conditions using a medical model (following the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fourth Edition, DSM-IV). Alternatively, an education team may assign an educational eligibility (autism), based on a child's special needs for educational modifications. At the present time, there is no medical test that indicates an autism spectrum disorder; however, routine medical screenings (metabolic, genetic, and Fragile X) are recommended to rule out the presence of another identifiable condition. In either case, the diagnosis of a PDD is based on behavioral observations and clinical experience. Back to top What is the difference between Autism and PDD-NOS? Pervasive Developmental Disorder is a general category used to describe a pattern of behavioral differences (which may include deviations, excesses, or difficulties) in the areas of social relating, communication, and attention/interest. Children who demonstrate a number of characteristics or symptoms in these three areas, and whose problems are not better explained by other disorders, may receive a diagnosis of PDD. This diagnosis may also be applied if the child exhibits a variety of symptoms associated with Autism, but in an unusual pattern. It should be stressed that this is still a relatively new label, dating back only 15 years, so that some professionals may not be familiar with its correct use. In some cases, it has been incorrectly used synonymously with \"significant developmental delay? or ?general delay\" or \"developmental delay.\" Both Autism and PDD-NOS can occur in conjunction with a wide spectrum of intellectual ability. The defining feature must be a qualitative difference in social and language development for these diagnoses. Autism and PDD-NOS are subtypes of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders. It is common for a person to be given the general diagnosis of PDD, which indicates an autism spectrum disorder without clarifying the exact form of PDD. The differential diagnosis of the PDDs is based on a particular pattern or clustering of symptoms, and specific criteria on the number of symptoms that are observed. In both disorders, there is a higher likelihood of developing seizures than in individuals without autism. Back to top How do professionals tell the difference between autism and PDD-NOS? Primarily by the pattern and degree or number of characteristics observed or reported. However, there are difficulties associated with this differential diagnosis, and it often takes a clinician with extensive experience with both disorders to make the call. Problems may occur when a child's developmental level is quite low, so that assessing the areas of concern would be quite difficult at a similar age equivalent. A second problem occurs with children who are toddlers and young preschool-age children. Many of the behaviors that are considered crucial for diagnosis are still very variable in typically developing young children in this age range. Some children may receive a diagnosis of PDD-NOS as a toddler because they did not have any communicative behavior; later they may qualify for a diagnosis of autism as their communication develops and it becomes more evident that a qualitative difference exists in that area. For parents and educators, the important thing to focus on is not the specific label a child receives, but what can be done to help the child develop skills in the areas of concern. Back to top What is the difference between Autism and Asperger?s Disorder? Asperger?s Disorder was only added as a subtype of the PDDs in the DSM-IV in 1994, so its characteristics are still under a great deal of study. Similar to distinguishing Autism from PDD-NOS, there are specific criteria that distinguish Autism and Asperger?s. Some of the key differences between Autism and Asperger?s are that the individual could not have had a clinically significant language delay (although unusual patterns of communication and impaired nonverbal communication is generally present), and the individual must function within average to above average intellectual (cognitive) levels. There is currently much debate between professionals whether Asperger?s Disorder should really be distinguished from high-functioning Autism, and clinical experience is often important to determine how these diagnoses should be applied to a particular individual. Back to top Does my child have an intellectual impairment (mental retardation)? How is this different from Autism? Intellectual impairment (mental retardation) is a term used to describe individuals who follow a slower developmental path than others their age. ?Intellectual impairment? is the term generally used by educators and ?mental retardation? is the term used in the DSM-IV; however, these terms generally refer to the same types of learning difficulties. People with an intellectual impairment continue to develop skills and abilities as they grow, although they typically progress more slowly than their peer group. Intellectual Impairment is identified by comparing a person's intellectual performance on standardized tests with others in his/her age group, and by looking at how well that individual can function in adaptive skills (self-care, safety knowledge, independent living skills). Autism and PDD-NOS can be present in people who also have an intellectual impairment; however, they can also be present in individuals who have superior intellectual skills. It varies from individual to individual. However, because communication skills are an integral part of what most people consider intelligence, the problems people with autism show in this area may affect their ability to perform on standardized intelligence tests. Some individuals with Autism may receive a diagnosis of intellectual impairment or mental retardation due to suppressed performance in areas involving verbal expression or understanding, while performing above average in some other areas (such as memory and visual problem-solving). In such cases, the term is not particularly meaningful or predictive of long-term outcome. When assessing the skills of a child with a PDD, it is important to evaluate the skills that they show on an everyday basis in situations that are meaningful and familiar to them. Evaluation should not only focus on identifying a child?s intellectual level, but should aim to identify the child?s learning characteristics so that meaningful goals can be planned to help the child develop to his or her potential. Back to top What is the long-term prognosis for children diagnosed with Autism/PDD-NOS? Autism/PPD-NOS is a life-long disability, and individuals with Autism live a full lifetime. There are no cures, and even those individuals who proclaim themselves \"recovered\" continue to have difficulties with subtle social processes. However, with advances in education, early intervention, and research, today individuals with Autism/PDD have a greatly expanded range of outcomes as adults. In the past, the majority of individuals with Autism lived in institutional care as adults. Current trends, based on increased knowledge of how to educate children with Autism and the importance of early education, emphasize building skills and abilities in order to prepare young adults with Autism/PDD to work, to live in the community, and in some cases, to pursue higher education. Outcome appears to depend on both degree of overall impairment and intensity of educational/treatment effort. Prognosis is markedly better for individuals who develop verbal language before the age of 5 years Back to top My doctor says my child will never learn to talk. Is this true? For most children with Autism, there is no physical reason to preclude learning to use verbal communication. Unless there is a specific physical problem (such as deafness, absence of larynx/pharynx, focal lesion the brain), there is no reason to make such an assumption. It should be noted that speech does not frequently come easily to individuals with Autism, and research suggests that intensive efforts and education are often needed for children with Autism to develop speech. However, given the relationship between speech development and prognosis, aggressively pursuing verbal communication skills is highly recommended for young children with Autism/PDD-NOS. Back to top How is Autism/PDD-NOS diagnosed? What are the areas of concern? Individuals with Autism frequently display certain clusters of behavior that distinguish them from individuals who do not have Autism. Diagnosing this syndrome using the DSM-IV involves consideration of the following characteristics. Note: The child need not show all of these characteristics. I. Qualitative impairment in reciprocal social interactions: This refers to a developmental difference in the individual's interest and competence in achieving reciprocal interactions. It does not mean that the individual is not affectionate, or cannot make contact with other people, or is simply behind schedule in the development of social skills. What is different is the quality of interaction and interest. Behaviors suggesting this area may be affected include: difficulty understanding/perceiving the emotions of others difficulty sustaining interactions initiated by others poor, fleeting or abnormal eye contact lack of comfort-seeking when distressed difficulty making peer friendships appropriate to developmental level lack of social or emotional reciprocity lack of effort to share interests or enjoyment with others (may not show, point out or bring objects to share with others) in preschool children, lack of turn-taking play with peers (although the child may enjoy active and rough-and-tumble play) difficulty understanding social cues difficulty understanding and expressing his/her own emotions seeking touch and affection on own terms, but shunning affection when offered by others (not on own terms) preference for solitary play instead of group or paired play absence of symbolic play behavior, very literal and concrete in comprehension (e.g., would not use a block as a telephone) frequent or sustained giggling, laughing or crying without visible cause may appear deaf at times, yet hear sounds from a distance at other times (ignore voice when name is called, yet run to window when ice cream truck is two blocks away) II. Qualitative impairment in verbal and non-verbal communication and imaginative activities: Again, this does not refer to a delay in development, but rather a difference in the way verbal and nonverbal communication proceeds. Behaviors suggesting this area may be affected include: normal development of early babbling and first words which are later lost between the ages of 1 and 3 years, while other development appears to proceed on course difficulty developing verbal communication pulling adults to items of interest rather than pointing or gesturing lack of use of gestures, demonstration, mime to compensate for lack of verbal expression repeating phrases verbatim frequently (echolalia) repeating phrases (often from TV) out of context after a period of time has passed (delayed echolalia) using words out of communicative context (walks around saying \"hi daddy\" when daddy is at work, and nobody is present) answering question by parroting question back to you poor timing and content variation in topic difficulty taking turns in maintaining a conversation difficulty with abstract concepts (learns nouns better than verbs or adjectives) difficulty understanding the \"theme\" of a story inventing own words for objects and rigidly uses them (neologism) talking mainly about one restricted topic, or using one word repeatedly (perseveration) acting as if adults can read his/her mind question-like or sing-song cadence to their speech difficulties in imitation III. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities: engaging in repetitive non-functional body movements (for example, spinning or whirling around, flapping arms or hands, rocking, walking on tiptoes, looking at fingers (stereotypies) difficulty with changes or transitions under- or over-sensitivity to sensory stimuli (sounds, lights, textures, odors) restricted food preferences, sometimes related to food texture may explore environment in unusual ways (smelling objects, mouthing excessively, scratching, licking) develop attachments to objects that are not typical for children (must sleep with twigs) may carry around objects without ever playing with them, and become upset when they are taken away becomes fascinated with parts of objects (wheels, lines, writing) may spin objects that are round in shape may focus on ordering and reordering or categorizing toys instead of playing with them (lining up cars, amassing red blocks) plays with materials in the same sequence across a period of time where variation would be expected (has Ernie follow same route to hospital every time he plays with car mat) develops routines that are difficult to break may get upset over trivial changes in environment (moving a lamp) not interested in a wide variety of toys and materials peculiar insistence in selected items, sequences, or routines (will only drink milk out of a certain cup) does not ask for help, but figures out how to get what he/she wants OTHER CONCERNS: eating inedible objects undersensitive to pain attention span fleeting for most activities, yet can spend long periods of time focused on one activity of his/her own interest (can watch videos for hours, but can't sit for 30 seconds for other tasks) high overall activity level may need less sleep than typical children of the same age absence of fear or appreciation of dangerous situations self-injurious behavior that does not appear to be directed at achieving any result (head banging, eye poking, biting) uneven intellectual ability (skills show a great deal of variability) peculiar fascination with one specific medium (country music, TV station, Wheel of Fortune, preview guide), etc. more interested in credits and commercials than TV shows unusual fear reactions STRENGTHS: good memory, especially for visually presented information enjoys completing tasks with a set end point may have precocious interest in letters and numbers cuddly and affectionate with parents, usually on own terms mechanical aptitude (can program the VCR at age 2) higher skills/talents in art, music, math, balance enjoy vestibular stimulation (tosses, being turned upside down, etc) stamina good non-verbal problem solving abilities (can get what they want) Back to top What should I do about my child's Autism/PDD-NOS? The most successful approach to dealing with the symptoms of Autism involves systematic and intensive educational programming. You may want to pursue a second opinion regarding diagnosis; however, the most prudent approach is to assume that the diagnosis is correct and proceed to develop plans to deal with the language and social difficulties of the child through educational programming (including speech therapy, therapeutic play groups, etc.) while you are also looking for a second opinion. If the original diagnosis was incorrect, no valuable time will be lost.

[ More definitions and points of view | Asperger's Syndrome ] Autism (or PDD, PDD-NOS, \"autism spectrum disorder\") Autism (and the related pervasive developmental disorders) is a severe developmental disorder which, left unchecked, usually progresses to developmental disability at a young age. The causes of the disorder are largely unknown; they include genetic and environmental (chemical and biological) factors, or some interaction of the two. (Many in the psychoanalytic community once believed that lack of parental nurturing was the cause, but that is perhaps the only factor we now know is not important.) Symptoms may be present from or even before birth (yes, Moms can tell), or appear gradually or suddenly after two or more years of apparently normal development. Although some related conditions such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome cause measurable changes in brain activity, in most cases the only diagnostic information is the child's behavior. Other biological markers are sketchy: there is some evidence of altered neurotransmitter (serotonin) levels; some children show slight physical changes, such as the shape of their ears; there is a strong correlation with maleness and non-right-handedness; and there is correlation with certain genes. There is about a one in nine chance that a sibling will also have autism. The early symptoms may include grossly delayed language or motor development; atypical play, such as spinning, lining up, staring at, or feeling toys (but no pretend play); lack of peer play or friendships; stereotyped (repeated unchanging) body movements; or pronounced fears, crying fits, sleeplessness, or noise sensitivity. In place of the typical progression of skills, the young child with autism may develop some skills early, such as the ability to recognize letters and signs (or even read), or the ability to make people smile by flirting or acting silly. These strengths may mask the severity of the many real deficits. (It is a common misconception that children with autism must be withdrawn; some are, but others are perfectly friendly. Real, and tragic, isolation sets in later if they do not develop the social and communication skills expected of older children.) Older children may develop aggressive, hazardous, or self-injurious behavior to such a degree that they require institutional care. Most do develop language, but it may consist largely of \"echoed\" words and phrases. If functional language appears, it is frequently missing important social context. Asked to talk about a picture of an activity, for example, the child may say \"The boy's shirt is red and he has five fingers on his left hand and five fingers on his right hand.\" He may insist on extreme sameness, counting every step to the kitchen, tantruming if interrupted or the number of steps is not exactly 16. Although not all suffer severe symptoms, individuals with autism frequently have difficulty achieving independence, forming stable relationships, or being free of anxiety. There is strong evidence that many or even most children with autism are actually able to learn as much as typically developing children, given the right environment. For many, there may be no deficit at all in the 'underlying' (cognitive) brain functions , but for some reason the information does not get in and skills do not develop normally. There is, in effect, a learning 'blockage.' Some research points to the attention mechanism as a factor. As infants, children who later are diagnosed with autism are unable to switch attention from one stimulus to another as readily as their peers. (Can you read this and make sense of it while you are talking on the phone?) We also don't understand well the 'subtypes' or boundaries of autism. For any individual, professionals will differ on what deficits may be due to autism, and what may be due to other disorders, such as ADHD, \"nonverbal learning disorder,\" or other cognitive and learning difficulties. This leads to a proliferation of related official and not-quite-official diagnostic labels for people with different mixes of skills and deficits: hyperlexia, semantic-pragmatic disorder, Asperger's Syndrome, sensory integrative dysfunction, and so on. Many people put these into the bucket \"autism spectrum disorder.\" It is a very mysterious disorder. No one understands why our kids are the way they are, or can explain why their responses to everyday things can be so very strange. The particular excesses and deficits vary so greatly from one child to another that an explanation or strategy that seems to work for one child may be a disaster for another. We know mostly how little we know. One measure of a professional's ability to help your child is a willingness to admit how little he knows, and a commitment to use your child's progress as the only sure guide. Having said all this, here are a few things that are mostly true - likely to apply to most - or mostly false - concepts that may work for an individual child here or there but probably don't apply to most. Autism (and the related pervasive developmental disorders) is... Uncommon but not rare. The \"accepted\" incidence is around one per thousand, but many parents in the USA report a \"head count\" in their schools that gives an incidence closer to one in every two or three hundred. Research in England gives a total incidence of all autism spectrum disorders at one in 160. A severe disorder, one that substantially affects most life activities. When an evaluator or administrator speaks of \"mild autism\" or \"mild PDD,\" ask, \"What is a mild severe disorder?\" Genetically linked to some degree. Evidenced as an impairment in learning by social imitation. Spoken language, body language, the rules of play and friendship, are all typically learned at an amazingly early age by observing and imitating other's behaviors. If our kids are to learn those things at all, they need a lot of expert help. Related to overall brain functioning rather than one specific site. See Scientists Discover Biological Basis for Autism. Autism is probably not... Caused by entirely genetic or entirely environmental factors A \"sensory disorder,\" or a dysfunction of any specific sense (hearing, balance, vision, and so on). Exaggerated responses (fear, anxiety) to normal sensory stimuli are very common, but the response is probably not simply a normal response to an exaggerated or distorted sensation. (There may be a disorder in how sensory information is processed, but it is not likely as simple as \"too loud\" or \"not clear.\") Caused by vaccinations. The symptoms of autism often show up suddenly after one to three years of apparently normal development. Kids get lots of vaccinations during this time so the odds are significant that \"sudden autism\" will follow a shot. This is a case where only careful statistical analysis can untangle the facts. Highly treatable by drugs. There is no medication specific to autism. Some individuals do benefit from psychoactive medications such as SSRIs (used to treat depression and OCD), antipsychotics (schizophrenia), stimulants (ADHD), or anticonvulsants (bipolar disorder). Some get a lot of benefit, so careful trials may be warranted. The dosages may be different - often lower - than those used for the associated clinical condition.

Then she started talking about a new band, so Iris didn't have a chance to ask her any questions. It left her wondering: What is autism? How does someone get it? Can it be treated? What Is Autism? Autism is a developmental disorder that some people are born with it's not something you can catch or pass along to someone else. It affects the brain and makes communicating and interacting with other people difficult. People who have autism often have delayed language development, prefer to spend time alone, and show less interest in making friends. Another characteristic of autism is what some people describe as \"sensory overload\": Sounds seem louder, lights brighter, or smells stronger. Although many people with autism also have mental retardation, some are of average or high intelligence. Not everybody with autism has the exact same symptoms. Some people may have autism that is mild, whereas others may have autism that is more severe. Because it affects people differently, autism is known as a spectrum disorder. Two people with the same spectrum disorder may not act alike or have the same skills. As many as 1 in 150 people have autism, and it's more common in guys than in girls. Although doctors do not know exactly what causes it, many researchers believe autism is linked to differences in brain chemicals (neurotransmitters). These differences may be caused by something in our genes families who have one child with autism have a higher risk of having another child with autism or a similar disorder. Research suggests that in most cases it's probably a combination of genes that causes the disorder, not a single autism gene. Sometimes you may hear other developmental disorders mentioned in the same way as autism, such as Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and childhood disintegrative disorder. These disorders, along with autism, are all considered pervasive developmental disorders. People diagnosed with any of these disabilities have problems with social skills and communication. What Do Doctors Do? Autism is usually diagnosed at a very young age, when a child is 11/2 to 4 years old. There are no medical tests to determine whether someone has autism, although doctors may run various tests to rule out other causes of the symptoms. The best way to identify autism is to watch how a child behaves and communicates. Parents can help by telling the doctor how the child acts at home. Then a team of specialists which may include a psychologist, a neurologist, a psychiatrist, a speech therapist, and a developmental pediatrician will evaluate the child and compare levels of development and behavior with those of other kids the same age. Together, they will decide whether the child has autism or something else. How Is Autism Treated? Autism is not treated with surgery or medicine (although some people with autism may take medicine to improve certain symptoms, like aggressive behavior or attention problems). Instead, people who have autism are taught skills that will help them do the things that are difficult for them. The best results are usually seen with kids who begin treatment when they're very young and as soon as they're diagnosed. Special education programs that are tailored to the child's individual needs are usually the most effective form of treatment. These programs work on breaking down barriers by teaching the child to communicate (sometimes by pointing or using pictures or sign language) and to interact with others. Basic living skills, like how to cross a street safely or ask for directions, are also emphasized. A treatment program might also include any of the following: speech therapy, physical therapy, music therapy, changes in diet, medication, occupational therapy, and hearing or vision therapy. The same specialists who helped diagnose the condition usually work together to come up with the best combination of therapies to use in addition to the educational program. By the time they are teens, people with autism may be taking regular classes, attending special classes at the high school level, or attending a special school because of ongoing behavioral problems. What Are Teens With Autism Like? Because their brains process information differently, teens with autism may not act like other people you know (or each other, because the severity of symptoms of autism varies from person to person). They can have trouble talking and sometimes communicate with gestures instead of words. Some spend a lot of time alone, don't make friends easily (and may not act like they want to), and don't react to social cues like someone smiling or scowling at them. They often do not make eye contact when you are talking to them. They also find it hard to join in a game or activity with other people. If they are sensitive to sensory stimuli, they might draw back when hugged or startle easily when they hear a sudden noise, even if it's not very loud. Some teens with autism are passive and withdrawn, whereas others are overactive and may have tantrums or act aggressively when they are frustrated; it's important to realize that this is part of the disorder. Many teens with autism also continue to have intellectual limitations and learning problems. Because they don't have the ability to express emotions like anger and frustration in more acceptable ways, they might express themselves in ways that seem inappropriate. Many have difficulty coping with change and get anxious if their daily routine is altered. In more severe cases, a teen might fixate on different objects or ideas or display repetitive motions like rocking or hand flapping. One common misconception is that people with autism don't feel or show emotion. Although they can feel affection, they often don't express it the same way others do. To an outsider, this can come across as being cold or unemotional. Living With Autism Perhaps the most difficult part of coping with autism is interacting with other people every day. Because the brain of a teen with autism works a little differently, learning to communicate can be like learning a foreign language. This can make it hard for people with autism to express themselves or for others to understand them, so just talking with a classmate becomes stressful and frustrating. When even a casual conversation requires so much effort, it's hard to make friends. Teens with autism may have to think constantly about how other people will perceive their actions and make a conscious effort to pay attention to social cues the rest of us handle without even thinking. Basically, it takes a lot of work for someone with autism to do what comes naturally to most people. So if you know someone who has autism, be extra patient when you're talking with him or her. Don't expect a person with autism to look at things the same way you do. You should also realize that some behaviors you think are rude (like interrupting you when you're talking) come from a different perception of the world: It's tough for people who can't read social cues and recognize the natural pauses in a conversation to know when to jump in with their own thoughts. The more understanding and supportive you are, the more enjoyable your time together will be. Despite all the day-to-day hurdles, though, many people with autism lead fulfilling, happy lives on their own or with help from friends and family. Most teens with autism like school, and some can attend regular classes with everyone else. They have individual tastes and enjoy different activities, just like you do. Some people with autism go on to vocational school or college, get married, and have successful careers. Consider Temple Grandin, for example. Despite having autism, she was able to earn a PhD and become a college professor. She's even written a book about her experience called Thinking in Pictures: And Other Reports From My Life With Autism. Although she still struggles with the disorder almost daily, she leads a \"normal\" life, just like many other people with autism.

View Other ResourcesAutism 101 What Exactly is Autism?Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or autism is a developmental disability considered the result of a neurological condition affecting normal brain function, development and social interactions. Children and adults with autism find it difficult or impossible to relate to other people in a meaningful way and may show restrictive and/or repetitive patterns of behavior or body movements. While great strides are being made, there is no known cause, or a known singular effective treatment for autism. Learn About Signs and Symptoms There is no single behavior that is always typical of autism or any of the autistic spectrum disorders. Learn about the signs and symptoms. There is Hope Autism is a baffling, life-long disorder. And while there is no cause or cure, nor a known singular effective treatment, it is treatable. People with autism -- at any age -- can make significant progress through therapy and treatments, and can lead meaningful and productive lives. However, experts agree that early diagnosis and early intervention are critical - because the earlier people with autism get help, the better their outcomes will be in the future. Did you Know? The annual cost of providing services for people with autism is $90 million, in 10 years that number is projected to be $200 - 400 billion. With early diagnosis and intervention, the overall cost of treatment can be reduced by two-thirds over an individual with autism s lifetime. London School of Economics Study, 2001Opening the Door to AutismThere are five developmental disorders that fall under the Autism Spectrum Disorder umbrella and are defined by challenges in three areas: social skills, communication, and behaviors and/or interests. Autistic Disorder -- occurs in males four times more than females and involves moderate to severe impairments in communication, socialization and behavior. Asperger's Syndrome -- sometimes considered a milder form of autism, Asperger s is typically diagnosed later in life than other disorders on the spectrum. People with Asperger's syndrome usually function in the average to above average intelligence range and have no delays in language skills, but often struggle with social skills and restrictive and repetitive behavior. Rett Syndrome -- diagnosed primarily in females who exhibit typical development until approximately five to 30 months when children with Rett syndrome begin to regress, especially in terms of motor skills and loss of abilities in other areas. A key indicator of Rett syndrome is the appearance of repetitive, meaningless movements or gestures. Childhood Disintegrative Disorder -- involves a significant regression in skills that have previously been acquired, and deficits in communication, socialization and/or restrictive and repetitive behavior. Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) -- includes children that do not fully meet the criteria for the other specific disorders or those that do not have the degree of impairment associated with those disorders.

The clusters, including five in metropolitan Los Angeles and one in San Diego, are centered on regional developmental services centers in areas with highly educated parents, primarily Caucasians, with high incomes. In short, what they found were clusters of increased diagnostic rates for autism. In one respect, the results were not surprising because it has long been known that high-income, highly educated white parents are more likely to have their children diagnosed with autism and more likely to have them diagnosed at an early age. Looking at clustering is often a way to uncover leads about problems in the environment, said epidemiologist Irva Hertz-Picciotto, the senior author of the study. Mapping has a long history of being a way to get clues about causes of disease. She was, indeed, surprised by the findings -- not that there are clusters with parents with higher education, but that it was so consistent across the board. In virtually every cluster they identified, the rate of autism was about twice as high within the cluster as in adjacent regions. Hertz-Picciotto and her colleagues obtained birth records for 2,453,717 children born in the state between 1996 and 2000. By 2006, the children had all reached at least age 6, the age by which diagnosis of autism is generally accomplished. State records showed that about 9,900 autism cases were in the records of the Department of Developmental Services. The team reported in the journal Autism Research that they identified 10 clusters of autism among the 21 regional offices of the department and two potential clusters. The clusters were primarily in the high-population areas of Southern California and, to a lesser extent, in the San Francisco Bay area. The clusters were: -- The Westside Regional Center in Culver City, which serves western Los Angeles County, including Culver City, Inglewood and Santa Monica. -- The Harbor Regional Center, headquartered in Torrance, which serves southern Los Angeles County. -- The North Los Angeles County Regional Center, in Van Nuys, which serves the San Fernando and Antelope valleys. Two clusters were in this region. -- The South Central Regional Center in Los Angeles, which serves Compton and Gardena. -- The Regional Center of Orange County in Santa Ana. --The Regional Center of San Diego County, which serves San Diego and Imperial counties. -- The Golden Gate Regional Center in San Francisco, which serves San Francisco, Marin and San Mateo counties. There are two clusters in this area. -- The San Andreas Regional Center in Campbell, which serves Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Benito counties. Increased incidence was also noted in two other regions, the Central Valley Regional Center in Stockton and the Valley Mountain Regional Center in Fresno. The incidence of autism was not as high in those regions, however. Because the team analyzed birth locations and not the location of diagnosis, it is highly unlikely that the parents moved into the cluster regions to seek care, Hertz-Picciotto said. In the U.S., the children of older, white and highly educated parents are more likely to receive a diagnosis of autism or autism spectrum disorder, said lead author Karla C. Van Meter, who was a graduate student when the data were collected but is now at the Sonoma County Department of Public Health. For this reason, the clusters we found are probably not a result of a common environmental exposure. Instead, the differences in education, age and ethnicity of parents comparing births in the cluster versus those outside the cluster were striking enough to explain the clusters. The team is now looking elsewhere for possible causes. Some previous studies have hinted that exposure to pesticides may play a role and a study in Texas showed that exposure to mercury in the environment --but not in vaccines -- could be a causative agent. We are casting a wide net, looking at everything we can--pesticides, medical conditions in the mother, medications, flame retardants, etc., Hertz-Picciotto said. The problem, she conceded, is that, if the exposure is truly widespread, then linking it to autism will be very difficult. -- Thomas H. Maugh II Credit: UC Davis M.I.N.D.

World Autism Awareness Day is an event that falls annually on the 2nd of April. Unfortunately this year, this date happens to also be Good Friday. In order to be able to give full attention to the day, Autism Victoria decided to move the event back a day and celebrate on Thursday 1st April. We have been working on this event for the past 4 weeks and unfortunately last week the World body have advised a change of date to mid-March. As this notice has arrived far too late to change our plans we have decided to continue with the events in hand. Please join us on Thursday 1st April 2010 for a march from the Autism Victoria offices to the State Library. Once there, we will release 1000 multicoloured balloons into the sky to visually respect and represent the individuality of those on the Autism Spectrum. The balloons will also represent the number of Early Intervention hours the 1000 hours campaign is fighting for. Where? Autism Victoria 24 Drummond St, Carlton When? 12pm Thursday 1st April If you are not able to make it for the walk, please meet us at the State Library located at 328 Swanston St, Melbourne. We would really like to make an impact and to help to raise awareness of Autism Spectrum Disorders in the community. Please mark the date in your diary we look forward to seeing you there! Other Initiatives Planned Autism Victoria has also contacted a number of television programs including The Footy Show, Sunrise, The Morning Show and The Circle requesting presenters wear Autism Awareness Ribbons on their shows. We have also approached the producers of the Royal Children s Hospital Good Friday Appeal to request the ribbons been worn and to present a short piece on World Autism Awareness Day.

We received submissions from a wide cross-section of the community, from individuals and family members of those affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), to students, graphic designers, professionals in education and health sectors, and artists. The competition attracted national and international attention, and it is fantastic to see that that our conference has had such far-reaching effects to draw interest from individuals from such a wide variety of backgrounds. Due to the high standard of entries, we have invited all artists to showcase their submissions at the conference (at the Melbourne site as well as all our regional locations), which is sure be a highlight of the two-day event. We are pleased to present the winning logo entries for the 2010 Victorian Autism Conference. Our congratulations go out to our two winners, who have each been awarded a double pass to conference to be held on August 5th and 6th 2010. The winning logo was created by Josh Chan, and is displayed above. Our theme for this year s conference is Promoting Positive Practice Across the Spectrum, and an image submitted by Jaime Kelly, was selected to represent this year s theme. The image is available here. Keep an eye out for other conference material to be released soon! Conference Update In other conference news, the organising committee is very excited to confirm that planning is well underway for the Victorian Autism Conference, hosted by Autism Victoria, to be held on the 5th and 6th of August 2010. With Early Bird registrations opening mid-March and only a limited number of places, we recommend that you Save The Date now! With the aim of promoting lively discussion about strategies and information on Autism Spectrum Disorders to enhance the quality of life of families and individuals affected by ASD, this two day event, targeted at families, individuals and professionals with an interest in ASDs is shaping up to be a major event on the disability calendar. Whilst the conference itself is being conducted in Melbourne, it will also be held simultaneously in several key regional centres across the state to ensure that we maximise participation. With the assistance of live streaming and partner organisations, families and professionals living in regional or rural areas won t miss out on being involved in this exciting event. It is anticipated that we will be announcing the key regional satellite centres in the next Conference Update, so keep an eye out for the next eSpectrum! The VAC organising committee has been working tirelessly to ensure that this year s conference program is a spectacular success, and we are delighted to announce the involvement of Dr Richard Eisenmajer, Wendy Lawson and Chris Glennon. The call for presentations closed late February, and we are looking forward to shortly announcing the involvement of numerous other exciting speakers in the two-day program. Finally, we would like to announce some exciting opportunities for individuals and organisations to become involved in the conference via various sponsorship programs. Sponsorship is an investment that will yield a positive and rewarding return for you and your organisation. With significant exposure across the state, sponsorship involvement in this event presents an excellent opportunity to network and promote your business throughout the ASD and broader communities. We would encourage anyone interested in sponsorship opportunities to contact the committee at conference@autismvictoria.org.au. Campaign for Change - State and Federal Elections 4th March 2010 Call for Campaign Activists This is an unusual year within a political context with both the Victorian and Federal Governments facing an election. Interestingly, although Labour looks safe at a Federal level the State government is looking somewhat shakier. This provides us with an opportunity to try to influence the policies of all major parties as they recognise that small shifts may determine the election outcome. Autism Victoria intends to develop and submit position papers to State and Federal Government. To support this approach and to ensure we develop comprehensive and detailed position papers we invite our members to become involved in the process. I would like to stress that this work is not for the faint hearted as it requires much effort and commitment if we are to achieve any meaningful outcome. It will also mean the group will need to liaise with and co-ordinate action with other pressure groups at times. To this end the first stage is to gauge interest from members who may wish to come together and work on specific topics. I am keen to seek expressions of interest from members in the following areas: Early Childhood services Transition to and through school Current funding models for school support Transition to work and higher education Employment support Housing and Accommodation options Recreation and social networking Please note, subject to the level of interest, each working group will be required to develop specific program responses and to cost same. This will form the basis of the Autism Victoria election document and then the groups both individually and as a whole will develop a broad promotional campaign around the document. Please advise your expression of interest by email to ceo@autismvictoria.org.au. Please note the cut off date for expressions of interest will be the 31st of March. Murray Dawson-Smith Training for Teachers and Educational Support Staff 3rd March 2010 The Learning and Development team at Autism Victoria is offering a one-day training session in Melbourne to teachers and educational support staff who work with students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (including Autism and Asperger syndrome).

A Fair Go For All Letter-Writing Campaign 1st March 2010 Help increase funding for disability support services in Victoria A letter writing campaign has taken off to support the state-wide campaign A Fair Go For All. The letters aim to raise political awareness of the urgent need to increase funding of disability support services. With the State Budget (May) and 2010 State election (November) just around the corner, every letter sent will make a difference. We are calling on our members, support people, friends and professionals to Sign and Send letters to help support better outcomes for people with a disability. Letters to Community Services Minister Lisa Neville and Premier John Brumby aim to increase pressure on the current government to act on the findings of the Price Review: Out-of-Home Disability Services and address the true cost of providing support services. It also aims to apply pressure to respond to the recommendations of the Parliamentary inquiry into supported accommodation for people with a disability and/or mental illness. Now is the time to show your support. Current media attention on disability and the government s own data help the case for increased funding. Your letter, along with the hundreds of others from across Victoria, will make the difference. You can download example letters at the links below: Letter to Premier Brumby calling for A Fair Go For All Letter to Minister Neville calling for A Fair Go For All 2009 ASD Research Forum Proceedings available now! 16th November 2009 The 2009 ASD Research Forum was held on Tuesday 10th November. Around 100 delegates had the pleasure of attending to hear a fascinating summary of the latest research into the genetics of autism, presented by our keynote speaker, Dr Natasha Brown. The forum also provided an opportunity for participants to hear about some of the latest research findings in the autism field across Victoria. Please click here for a copy of the 2009 ASD Research Forum Proceedings. The Autism Victoria Service Directory 3rd April 2009 The Autism Victoria Service Directory is in desperate need of both updating and expanding! The service directory is one of the few central information sources in Victoria that families, individuals and professionals can utilise to discover or share ASD services that range from ASD specific counsellors and therapists to hairdressers or naturopaths who have experience with ASD children. The service directory has evolved from parents, carers and individuals wanting to share a helpful service or professional with the wider Victorian ASD community. Over the years the service directory has become a very useful tool for many people, as it can take the leg work out of navigating through the service maze that is not ASD specific. As awareness of ASD grows and more services designed to benefit those on the spectrum become available, it is important that Autism Victoria s service directory grows also, as we are often the first port of call for parents or individuals with a recent diagnosis.

Victorian Autism Conference www.autismvictoria.org.au/news/media.php Autism443 names Autistic disorder/Autism spectrum; Pervasive developmental delay Definition Autism is a complex developmental disorder that appears in the first 3 years of life, although it is sometimes diagnosed much later. It affects the brain s normal development of social and communication skills. <!-- google_ad_client = \"CE0000\"; //--> Autism is a spectrum that encompasses a wide range of behavior. The core features include impaired social interactions, impaired verbal and nonverbal communication, and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. The symptoms may vary from quite mild to quite severe. A related, milder condition is Asperger s syndrome. Causes, incidence, and risk factors Autism is a physical condition linked to abnormal biology and neurochemistry in the brain. The exact causes of these abnormalities remain unknown, but this is a very active area of research. It is likely a combination of factors that leads to Autism. Genetic factors seem to be important. For example, identical twins are much more likely than fraternal twins or siblings to both have Autism. Similarly, language abnormalities are more common in relatives of autistic children. Chromosomal abnormalities and other neurological problems are also more common in families with Autism. Autism may also be linked to certain changes or abnormalities along the digestive tract. This has raised question about whether diet or other factors may play a role in the disease. For example, there is some question of whether eating certain foods like wheat and milk may worsen symptoms of Autism. The theory is that proteins in these foods (gluten in grains and casein in dairy products) may cause the gut to become leaky in children with Autism. The leakiness introduces certain substances into the brain, possibly contributing to the behavioral problems associated with Autism. Research testing this theory is underway. The exact number of children with Autism is not known, but estimates suggest that roughly 1 in 1,000 children are affected. Autism affects boys 3 to 4 times more often than girls. Family income, education, and lifestyle do not seem to affect the risk of Autism. Some parents have heard that the MMR vaccine that children receive may cause Autism. This theory was based, in part, on two facts. First, the incidence of Autism has increased steadily since around the same time the MMR vaccine was introduced. Secondly, children with the regressive form of Autism (a type of Autism that develops after a period of normal development) tend to start to show symptoms around the time the MMR vaccine is given. This is likely a coincidence due to the age of children at the time they receive this vaccine. Several major studies have found NO connection between the vaccine and Autism, however. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention report that there is no proven link between Autism and the MMR vaccine. Some doctors attribute the increased incidence in Autism to newer definitions of Autism. The term Autism now includes a wider spectrum of children. For example, a child who is diagnosed with high-functioning Autism today may have been thought to simply be odd or strange 30 years ago. Symptoms Most parents of autistic children suspect that something is wrong by the time the child is 18 months old and seek help by the time the child is 2. Children with Autism typically have difficulties in verbal and nonverbal communication, social interactions, and pretend play. In some, aggression toward others or self may be present. Some children with Autism appear normal before age 1 or 2 and then suddenly regress and lose language or social skills they had previously gained. This is called the regressive type of Autism. People with Autism may perform repeated body movements, show unusual attachments to objects or have unusual distress when routines are changed. Individuals may also experience sensitivities in the senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste. Such children, for example, will refuse to wear itchy clothes and become unduly distressed if forced because of the sensitivity of their skin. Some combination of the following areas may be affected in varying degrees. Communication Is unable to start or sustain a conversation Develops language slowly or not at all Repeats words Reverses pronouns Uses nonsense rhyming Communicates with gestures instead of words Has a short attention span Social interaction Shows a lack of empathy Has difficulty making friends Is withdrawn Prefers to spend time alone rather than with others Is less responsive to eye contact or smiles Response to sensory information Has heightened or diminished senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste Seems to have a heightened or diminished response to pain May withdraw from physical contact because it is overstimulating or overwhelming Does not startle at loud noises Rubs surfaces or mouths objects Play Shows little pretend or imaginative play Doesn t imitate the actions of others Prefers solitary or ritualistic play Behaviors Uses repetitive body movements Shows a strong need for sameness Acts out with intense tantrums Has very narrow interests Demonstrates perseveration (an obsessive interest in a single item, idea, activity, or person) Displays an apparent lack of common sense Shows aggression to others or self Is overactive or is very passive Signs and tests Routine developmental screening should be performed for all children at all well-child visits to their pediatrician. Further evaluation is warranted if there is concern on the part of the clinician or the parents. This is particularly true whenever a child fails to meet any of the following language milestones: Babbling by 12 months Gesturing (pointing, waving bye-bye) by 12 months Single words by 16 months Two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months (not just echoing) Loss of any language or social skills at any age. These children might receive an audiologic evaluation, a blood lead test, and a screening test for Autism such as the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) or the Autism Screening Questionnaire. A clinician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of Autism is usually necessary for the actual diagnosis. DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR AUTISTIC DISORDER Because there is no biological test for Autism, the diagnosis will often be based on specific criteria laid out as A, B, and C in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV, as follows. A. A total of six or more items from (1), (2), and (3), with at least two from (1) and one each from (2) and (3): 1. Qualitative impairment in social interaction, manifest by at least two of the following: Marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors, such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures and gestures, to regulate social interaction Failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level Lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) Lack of social or emotional reciprocity 2. Qualitative impairment in communication, as manifest by at least one of the following: Delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) In individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the pointing genetic brain genetic sensitivity Autism eye contact babbling routines social interaction MMR Diagnostic eye gaze pretend tantrums aggression gesturing solitary American Academy of Pediatrics Autism Screening Questionnaire Statistical Manual IV Center for Disease Control and Prevention FFFFFF Picture Book by Celeste Shally (Author), David Harrington (Illustrator) Children with autism struggle to make friends and navigate social situations.

In 1943 Dr. Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital studied a group of 11 children and introduced the label early infantile autism into the English language. At the same time a German scientist, Dr. Hans Asperger, described a milder form of the disorder that became known as Asperger syndrome. Thus these two disorders were described and are today listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision)1 as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). All these disorders are characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior. The autism spectrum disorders can often be reliably detected by the age of 3 years, and in some cases as early as 18 months.2 Studies suggest that many children eventually may be accurately identified by the age of 1 year or even younger. The appearance of any of the warning signs of ASD is reason to have a child evaluated by a professional specializing in these disorders. Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child. In some cases, the baby seemed different from birth, unresponsive to people or focusing intently on one item for long periods of time. The first signs of an ASD can also appear in children who seem to have been developing normally. When an engaging, babbling toddler suddenly becomes silent, withdrawn, self-abusive, or indifferent to social overtures, something is wrong. Research has shown that parents are usually correct about noticing developmental problems, although they may not realize the specific nature or degree of the problem. The pervasive developmental disorders, or autism spectrum disorders, range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, to a milder form, Asperger syndrome. If a child has symptoms of either of these disorders, but does not meet the specific criteria for either, the diagnosis is called pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Other rare, very severe disorders that are included in the autism spectrum disorders are Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder. This brochure will focus on classic autism, PDD-NOS, and Asperger syndrome, with brief descriptions of Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder on the following page. Rare Autism Spectrum Disorders Rett Syndrome Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses -- she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech. Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.* Childhood Disintegrative Disorder Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome. The loss of such skills as vocabulary are more dramatic in CDD than they are in classical autism. The diagnosis requires extensive and pronounced losses involving motor, language, and social skills.*** CDD is also accompanied by loss of bowel and bladder control and oftentimes seizures and a very low IQ. *Rett syndrome.

What Are the Autism Spectrum Disorders? The autism spectrum disorders are more common in the pediatric population than are some better known disorders such as diabetes, spinal bifida, or Down syndrome.2 Prevalence studies have been done in several states and also in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Asia. Prevalence estimates range from 2 to 6 per 1,000 children. This wide range of prevalence points to a need for earlier and more accurate screening for the symptoms of ASD. The earlier the disorder is diagnosed, the sooner the child can be helped through treatment interventions. Pediatricians, family physicians, daycare providers, teachers, and parents may initially dismiss signs of ASD, optimistically thinking the child is just a little slow and will catch up. Although early intervention has a dramatic impact on reducing symptoms and increasing a child's ability to grow and learn new skills, it is estimated that only 50 percent of children are diagnosed before kindergarten. All children with ASD demonstrate deficits in 1) social interaction, 2) verbal and nonverbal communication, and 3) repetitive behaviors or interests. In addition, they will often have unusual responses to sensory experiences, such as certain sounds or the way objects look. Each of these symptoms runs the gamut from mild to severe. They will present in each individual child differently. For instance, a child may have little trouble learning to read but exhibit extremely poor social interaction. Each child will display communication, social, and behavioral patterns that are individual but fit into the overall diagnosis of ASD. Children with ASD do not follow the typical patterns of child development. In some children, hints of future problems may be apparent from birth. In most cases, the problems in communication and social skills become more noticeable as the child lags further behind other children the same age. Some other children start off well enough. Oftentimes between 12 and 36 months old, the differences in the way they react to people and other unusual behaviors become apparent. Some parents report the change as being sudden, and that their children start to reject people, act strangely, and lose language and social skills they had previously acquired. In other cases, there is a plateau, or leveling, of progress so that the difference between the child with autism and other children the same age becomes more noticeable. ASD is defined by a certain set of behaviors that can range from the very mild to the severe. The following possible indicators of ASD were identified on the Public Health Training Network Webcast, Autism Among Us.3 Possible Indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorders Does not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of age Does not speak one word by 16 months Does not combine two words by 2 years Does not respond to name Loses language or social skills Some Other Indicators Poor eye contact Doesn't seem to know how to play with toys Excessively lines up toys or other objects Is attached to one particular toy or object Doesn't smile At times seems to be hearing impaired Social Symptoms From the start, typically developing infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most children with ASD seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem indifferent to other people, and often seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although children with ASD are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to read. To parents, it may seem as if their child is not attached at all Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of the expected and typical attachment behavior. Children with ASD also are slower in learning to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues -- whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace -- may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, Come here always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with ASD have difficulty seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with ASD may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. Although not universal, it is common for people with ASD also to have difficulty regulating their emotions. This can take the form of immature behavior such as crying in class or verbal outbursts that seem inappropriate to those around them. The individual with ASD might also be disruptive and physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. They have a tendency to lose control, particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They may at times break things, attack others, or hurt themselves. In their frustration, some bang their heads, pull their hair, or bite their arms. Communication Difficulties By age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is \"no.\" Some children diagnosed with ASD remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of ASD coo and babble during the first few months of life, but they soon stop. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Some children may learn to use communication systems such as pictures or sign language. Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. They seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some ASD children parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Although many children with no ASD go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3. Some children only mildly affected may exhibit slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining a conversation. The give and take of normal conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. Another difficulty is often the inability to understand body language, tone of voice, or phrases of speech. They might interpret a sarcastic expression such as Oh, that's just great as meaning it really IS great. While it can be hard to understand what ASD children are saying, their body language is also difficult to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Also, their tone of voice fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Some children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, failing to pick up on the kid-speak that is common in their peers. Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with ASD are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, they may simply scream or grab what they want. Until they are taught better ways to express their needs, ASD children do whatever they can to get through to others. As people with ASD grow up, they can become increasingly aware of their difficulties in understanding others and in being understood. As a result they may become anxious or depressed. Repetitive Behaviors Although children with ASD usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or walking on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position. As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, rather than using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of the toys, the child may be tremendously upset. ASD children need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine -- in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, going to school at a certain time and by the same route -- can be extremely disturbing. Perhaps order and sameness lend some stability in a world of confusion. Repetitive behavior sometimes takes the form of a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners, train schedules, or lighthouses. Often there is great interest in numbers, symbols, or science topics. Problems That may Accompany ASD Sensory problems. When children's perceptions are accurate, they can learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory information is faulty, the child's experiences of the world can be confusing. Many ASD children are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin almost unbearable. Some sounds -- a vacuum cleaner, a ringing telephone, a sudden storm, even the sound of waves lapping the shoreline -- will cause these children to cover their ears and scream. In ASD, the brain seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some ASD children are oblivious to extreme cold or pain. An ASD child may fall and break an arm, yet never cry. Another may bash his head against a wall and not wince, but a light touch may make the child scream with alarm. Mental retardation. Many children with ASD have some degree of mental impairment. When tested, some areas of ability may be normal, while others may be especially weak. For example, a child with ASD may do well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low scores on the language subtests. Seizures. One in four children with ASD develops seizures, often starting either in early childhood or adolescence.4 Seizures, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, can produce a temporary loss of consciousness (a blackout ), a body convulsion, unusual movements, or staring spells. Sometimes a contributing factor is a lack of sleep or a high fever. An EEG (electroencephalogram -- recording of the electric currents developed in the brain by means of electrodes applied to the scalp) can help confirm the seizure's presence. In most cases, seizures can be controlled by a number of medicines called anticonvulsants. The dosage of the medication is adjusted carefully so that the least possible amount of medication will be used to be effective. Fragile X syndrome. This disorder is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. It was so named because one part of the X chromosome has a defective piece that appears pinched and fragile when under a microscope. Fragile X syndrome affects about two to five percent of people with ASD. It is important to have a child with ASD checked for Fragile X, especially if the parents are considering having another child. For an unknown reason, if a child with ASD also has Fragile X, there is a one-in-two chance that boys born to the same parents will have the syndrome.5 Other members of the family who may be contemplating having a child may also wish to be checked for the syndrome. Tuberous Sclerosis. Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain as well as in other vital organs. It has a consistently strong association with ASD. One to four percent of people with ASD also have tuberous sclerosis.6 The Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders Although there are many concerns about labeling a young child with an ASD, the earlier the diagnosis of ASD is made, the earlier needed interventions can begin. Evidence over the last 15 years indicates that intensive early intervention in optimal educational settings for at least 2 years during the preschool years results in improved outcomes in most young children with ASD.2 In evaluating a child, clinicians rely on behavioral characteristics to make a diagnosis. Some of the characteristic behaviors of ASD may be apparent in the first few months of a child's life, or they may appear at any time during the early years. For the diagnosis, problems in at least one of the areas of communication, socialization, or restricted behavior must be present before the age of 3. The diagnosis requires a two-stage process. The first stage involves developmental screening during well child check-ups; the second stage entails a comprehensive evaluation by a multidisciplinary team.7 Screening A well child check-up should include a developmental screening test. If your child's pediatrician does not routinely check your child with such a test, ask that it be done. Your own observations and concerns about your child's development will be essential in helping to screen your child.7 Reviewing family videotapes, photos, and baby albums can help parents remember when each behavior was first noticed and when the child reached certain developmental milestones. Several screening instruments have been developed to quickly gather information about a child's social and communicative development within medical settings. Among them are the Checklist of Autism in Toddlers (CHAT),8 the modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT),9 the Screening Tool for Autism in Two-Year-Olds (STAT),10 and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)11 (for children 4 years of age and older). Some screening instruments rely solely on parent responses to a questionnaire, and some rely on a combination of parent report and observation. Key items on these instruments that appear to differentiate children with autism from other groups before the age of 2 include pointing and pretend play. Screening instruments do not provide individual diagnosis but serve to assess the need for referral for possible diagnosis of ASD. These screening methods may not identify children with mild ASD, such as those with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome. During the last few years, screening instruments have been devised to screen for Asperger syndrome and higher functioning autism. The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ),12 the Australian Scale for Asperger's Syndrome,13 and the most recent, the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST),14 are some of the instruments that are reliable for identification of school-age children with Asperger syndrome or higher functioning autism. These tools concentrate on social and behavioral impairments in children without significant language delay. If, following the screening process or during a routine well child check-up, your child's doctor sees any of the possible indicators of ASD, further evaluation is indicated. Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation The second stage of diagnosis must be comprehensive in order to accurately rule in or rule out an ASD or other developmental problem. This evaluation may be done by a multidisciplinary team that includes a psychologist, a neurologist, a psychiatrist, a speech therapist, or other professionals who diagnose children with ASD. Because ASD's are complex disorders and may involve other neurological or genetic problems, a comprehensive evaluation should entail neurologic and genetic assessment, along with in-depth cognitive and language testing.7 In addition, measures developed specifically for diagnosing autism are often used. These include the Autism Diagnosis Interview-Revised (ADI-R)15 and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-G).16 The ADI-R is a structured interview that contains over 100 items and is conducted with a caregiver. It consists of four main factors -- the child's communication, social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and age-of-onset symptoms. The ADOS-G is an observational measure used to press for socio-communicative behaviors that are often delayed, abnormal, or absent in children with ASD. Still another instrument often used by professionals is the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS).17 It aids in evaluating the child's body movements, adaptation to change, listening response, verbal communication, and relationship to people. It is suitable for use with children over 2 years of age. The examiner observes the child and also obtains relevant information from the parents. The child's behavior is rated on a scale based on deviation from the typical behavior of children of the same age. Two other tests that should be used to assess any child with a developmental delay are a formal audiologic hearing evaluation and a lead screening. Although some hearing loss can co-occur with ASD, some children with ASD may be incorrectly thought to have such a loss. In addition, if the child has suffered from an ear infection, transient hearing loss can occur. Lead screening is essential for children who remain for a long period of time in the oral-motor stage in which they put any and everything into their mouths. Children with an autistic disorder usually have elevated blood lead levels.7 Customarily, an expert diagnostic team has the responsibility of thoroughly evaluating the child, assessing the child's unique strengths and weaknesses, and determining a formal diagnosis. The team will then meet with the parents to explain the results of the evaluation. Although parents may have been aware that something was not quite right with their child, when the diagnosis is given, it is a devastating blow. At such a time, it is hard to stay focused on asking questions. But while members of the evaluation team are together is the best opportunity the parents will have to ask questions and get recommendations on what further steps they should take for their child. Learning as much as possible at this meeting is very important, but it is helpful to leave this meeting with the name or names of professionals who can be contacted if the parents have further questions. Available Aids When your child has been evaluated and diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, you may feel inadequate to help your child develop to the fullest extent of his or her ability. As you begin to look at treatment options and at the types of aid available for a child with a disability, you will find out that there is help for you. It is going to be difficult to learn and remember everything you need to know about the resources that will be most helpful. Write down everything. If you keep a notebook, you will have a foolproof method of recalling information. Keep a record of the doctors' reports and the evaluation your child has been given so that his or her eligibility for special programs will be documented. Learn everything you can about special programs for your child; the more you know, the more effectively you can advocate. For every child eligible for special programs, each state guarantees special education and related services. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a Federally mandated program that assures a free and appropriate public education for children with diagnosed learning deficits. Usually children are placed in public schools and the school district pays for all necessary services. These will include, as needed, services by a speech therapist, occupational therapist, school psychologist, social worker, school nurse, or aide. By law, the public schools must prepare and carry out a set of instruction goals, or specific skills, for every child in a special education program. The list of skills is known as the child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). The IEP is an agreement between the school and the family on the child's goals. When your child's IEP is developed, you will be asked to attend the meeting. There will be several people at this meeting, including a special education teacher, a representative of the public schools who is knowledgeable about the program, other individuals invited by the school or by you (you may want to bring a relative, a child care provider, or a supportive close friend who knows your child well). Parents play an important part in creating the program, as they know their child and his or her needs best. Once your child's IEP is developed, a meeting is scheduled once a year to review your child's progress and to make any alterations to reflect his or her changing needs. If your child is under 3 years of age and has special needs, he or she should be eligible for an early intervention program; this program is available in every state. Each state decides which agency will be the lead agency in the early intervention program. The early intervention services are provided by workers qualified to care for toddlers with disabilities and are usually in the child's home or a place familiar to the child. The services provided are written into an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) that is reviewed at least once every 6 months. The plan will describe services that will be provided to the child, but will also describe services for parents to help them in daily activities with their child and for siblings to help them adjust to having a brother or sister with ASD.

Autism is a complex neurobiological disorder. It is part of a group of disorders known as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Today, 1 in 150 individuals is diagnosed with autism, making it more common than pediatric cancer, diabetes, and AIDS combined. It occurs in all racial, ethnic, and social groups and is four times more likely to strike boys than girls. Autism impairs a person's ability to communicate and relate to others. It is also associated with rigid routines and repetitive behaviors, such as obsessively arranging objects or following very specific routines. Symptoms can range from very mild to quite severe. 1 in 150 children is diagnosed with autism 1 in 94 boys is on the autism spectrum 67 children are diagnosed per day A new case is diagnosed almost every 20 minutes More children will be diagnosed with autism this year than with AIDS, diabetes cancer combined Autism is the fastest-growing serious developmental disability in the U.S. Autism costs the nation over $90 billion per year, a figure expected to double in the next decade Autism receives less than 5% of the research funding of many less prevalent childhood diseases Boys are four times more likely than girls to have autism There is no medical detection or cure for autism Autism was first identified in 1943 by Dr. Leo Kanner of Johns Hopkins Hospital. At the same time, a German scientist, Dr. Hans Asperger, described a milder form of the disorder that is now known as Asperger Syndrome. These two disorders are listed in the DSM IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) as two of the five developmental disorders that fall under the autism spectrum disorders. The others are Rett Syndrome, PDD NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder), and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. All of these disorders are characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills and social abilities, and also by repetitive behaviors. Autism spectrum disorders can usually be reliably diagnosed by age 3, although new research is pushing back the age of diagnosis to as early as 6 months. Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child or their child's failure to reach appropriate developmental milestones. Some parents describe a child that seemed different from birth, while others describe a child who was developing normally and then lost skills. Pediatricians may initially dismiss signs of autism, thinking a child will \ufffdcatch up,\ufffd and may advise parents to \ufffdwait and see.\ufffd New research shows that when parents suspect something is wrong with their child, they are usually correct. If you have concerns about your child's development, don't wait: speak to your pediatrician about getting your child screened for autism. Heavy Metal Detoxification May Help Some Children With Autism The debate about Vaccinations, heavy metals and Autism has been shifted by a recent court settlement. Jon S. Poling, the father of 9-year-old girl who received a government settlement from a federal vaccine compensation fund, published an item in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution regarding the way that the case has shifted the autism-vaccine debate.

People with autism have all different intelligence levels, ranging from those who have savant talents related to memory of facts, languages, music, or numbers to those with average intelligence to others with cognitive disabilities. The range of abilities for people with autism is wide. Autism generally is defined as impacting one\ufffds communication, social and imaginative skills. Some of what a person with autism may experience is being barraged by sensory information, which can lead to hypersensitivity to light, smell, sounds, tastes and textures/touch or shutting down of the senses (hypo-sensitivity). People with autism may respond by using rocking/flapping motions or focusing on fine details or objects that are used as a soothing mechanism. With this sensory overload, a person can become absorbed into what some have described as a separate interior world, different from the physical and social world around them. In addition, spatial, social, dexterity and other issues may impact them when interacting with others. They may find: Difficulty with processing body language, deciphering subtle facial expressions or visual recognition of someone by remembering their face; Performance anxiety of \ufffdgoing with the flow\ufffd since this social expectation and \ufffdsmall talk\ufffd is not clear nor explicit to them; Lack of social give-and-take conversational skills \ufffd not knowing when to stop talking and interrupting the conversational flow; Empathy that is not obvious to the other person since feeling responses may not be triggered by the same things or expressed the same as the other person; Awkward physical coordination. As those with Asperger Syndrome reach adulthood, they often have acquired ways to make these autistic traits less apparent in daily interactions with neuro-typical people (e.g. non-autistic people) and to decrease some of the sensory impact. They may become good mimickers of non-autistic people\ufffds behaviors, and ritualistic in their daily routines. For more information on autism spectrum diagnoses and the personal experiences of people with autism, see the organizations listed in the resources section at the end of this document. Top of page In Their Own Words: Why International Exchange Participation can be Beneficial People with high-functioning autism or Asperger Syndrome often identify as anthropologists, having to figure out the social habits of those around them. With this in mind, Autist Mary-Minn Sirag, who has traveled in Europe, lived in the Middle East and has a B.A. in art, French and classical languages, draws from her personal experiences about the liberating wonders and benefits of overseas travel for autistic people: \ufffdThe physical movement of boat and train travel resembles rocking, spinning and jumping up and down, which I think we do to ground ourselves physically; to know where our body is in relation to space and the ground beneath our feet. Travel imposes its own structural limitations, which encourages improvisation and creativity, and greatly enhances self-esteem. The novelty seduces us to think on our feet rather than being tempted into the auto-pilot we defensively seek. I don\ufffdt need to have everything be in order like at home. The intellectual stimulation of learning a new language gives us a rare and precious opportunity to shine. Many autists are superior at the categorical thinking and rote learning that mastery of foreign languages requires. Languages make for fun and productive special interests. They keep my brain occupied with something positive, fun and mentally invigorating. The incentive of novelty and lowered performance anxiety while traveling provides the right combination. Social faux-pas are often mistaken for cultural difference (it can be called \ufffdthe Ugly American syndrome\ufffd), which lowers social expectations and pressures on us.\ufffd Autism is a neurological difference, and people with autism or Asperger Syndrome can bring diversity and new ways of thinking to an inclusive exchange program. As Autist Jane Meyerding, Program Coordinator for the Jackson International Studies Program, writes: \ufffdEveryone has times when s/he feels a split between what's inside and what seems to be required by the outside environment\ufffdI think all of us will benefit when our societies acquire a wider appreciation of neuro-diversity. The assumption of neuro-universality is very like a form of ethnocentricity\ufffd.Our [autistic] strengths and weaknesses are likely to be unusual when compared to the social norm, and sometimes that will cause us problems in working and living comfortably with those who think the norm should be good enough for everybody. If people on the autism spectrum all \ufffdcame out\ufffd and worked towards increasing institutional flexibility to the point where our \ufffdspecial needs\ufffd could be accommodated, the world would be a much more comfortable, less alienating place for everyone else as well.\ufffd (http://ani.autistics.org/jane.html) Top of page Planning a Group Exchange With the information above in mind, the question then becomes how to implement inclusive ideas into the structure of a group exchange program. Autism Network International has techniques for gatherings (modified below from the ANI web site, www.ani.ac/autreat.html) that can be applied to group exchange programs to the benefit of people who are at any point on the autism spectrum and to those who are neuro-typical. Social Rules and Norms Begin with an orientation session to introduce participants with and without autism to the social features of the program: Provide information on accommodating sensory sensitivities (e.g. perfume and scented personal care products are not allowed or flash photography is allowed only with permission of everyone who is close enough to be affected by the flash); Supply name badges to be worn throughout to help people recognize each other and the host families/guides that they may need to identify and find on the program, and include interaction signal badges (e.g. different color badges can mean that interactions are not desired at that point in time, or that others are encouraged to initiate interaction);Discuss acceptable behavior (e.g. natural expressions of oneself or needed coping mechanisms, which for the autists in the group may include echoing back what is heard or rocking motions), and not acceptable behaviors (e.g. actions that infringe on the rights of others by violating their personal boundaries or their property boundaries, or by preventing them from participating in activities, or by causing undue distress through physical, verbal, or sensory assault); Mention options in the use of the space (e.g. location of the crash or meditative room as described below; warnings about sensory hazards of the space such as fire alarm testing or loud echoing in dormitory hallways; options for people who do not want to eat in the crowded dining hall);Distribute a written summary of the orientation information. Innovations for Autistic Accessibility A basic principle is that social interactions are only desirable if they are voluntary. The exchange is meant to provide opportunity, but not pressure, for social interactions. Here are some ways to allow for this: Request that the host organizers provide a crash or meditation room for people on the program to retreat to during the exchange, to take a break from sensory overload and from social pressures. Place a lamp with an incandescent bulb in the room, and keep any overhead fluorescent lights turned off. Even verbal people with autism are likely to have difficulty being verbal all the time, especially under conditions of sensory overload such as are likely to occur abroad. Many may struggle with speech at these times. It may not be convenient for them to leave and go off somewhere by themselves or sometimes they will still be interested in listening to presentations or being around friends, even if they aren't up to having interactions. A simple solution is to create color-coded interaction signal badges. Setting up guidelines can assist in everyone treating each other considerately. The absence of any expectation or pressure to socialize, and the knowledge that they\ufffdre free to withdraw at any time, seems to free many people with autism to want to socialize. Decompression and Re-entry While none of these experiences is universal for, or exclusive to, all people on the autism spectrum, some of the things that can occur when abroad or upon re-entry are: Many people with autism or Asperger Syndrome need to know ahead of time what they will encounter and what will be expected of them, so a clear structure and an opportunity to ask questions when planning to go abroad may be important.While many people with autism or Asperger Syndrome do have an immediate positive reaction to being abroad and away from typical social pressures to fit in, some may feel initially panicked or disoriented from this freedom \ufffd this usually is temporary and will lead to personal growth.Immersion experiences are often followed by some degree of sadness upon returning to the home environment. Top of page Strategies to Deal with Exchange Transitions Joshua Chen, who participated in a People to People Sports Ambassador exchange to Wales, and Ted Koehler who participated in a cultural exchange to Japan were both students when they went abroad. Because of their autism and Asperger Syndrome both really appreciated the structure found in the short-term program and in the societies visited. Here are some other components of an exchange that they, and Mary-Minn Sirag, an advocate and writer, suggests can be helpful: Schedule breaks throughout the day; Have a clear explanation of work/intern/volunteer related tasks (repetitive work may be helpful), and a structured program; Explain food options of the particular country and alternatives for food intolerances; also discuss how to culturally decline food that is offered but not wanted; Inform co-workers and/or homestay hosts and roommates of a participant's disability (with his/her consent); an autistic person with very predictable behavior may be helpful for fellow roommates; Invite participants with non-apparent disabilities, such as autism, to talk about their disabilities during orientation; for some individuals, self-disclosure to others on a group program can reduce anxiety and creates opportunities for others to better understand their access needs; Plan schedules and accommodations ahead of time \ufffd provide information about the trip as soon as possible to allow time for preparation; Provide a list of what could go wrong while traveling and living in another country; Encourage all participants to ask for as many details as possible regarding the host location to increase understanding of how the location may be challenging; Discuss the option of personal assistance (e.g. for personal budgeting, laundry, etc); Provide acceptance for being really good at some things, and really poor at others to shed the expectation of excellence in everything; Set rules in a housing/accommodation setting (e.g. curfew time, food you can help yourself to, when meals are served, clear and specific delineation of chores, if the host family prefers silence during mealtimes, areas of the house not open to guests, etc.); Allow immersion in one culture and location; Encourage self-advocacy. Top of page Airport Travel Dennis Debbaudt in his books and online essay \ufffdAutism Airport Travel Safety Tips\ufffd (http://www.sath.org/index.html?pageID=2371) advises that at security checkpoints the accompanying sensory-enhancing gauntlet of sounds, lights, and touch can tax the system of some people who have autism. The typical behavior or characteristics of a person with autism includes diverting the eyes, avoiding touch, and repeating phrases heard or seen (which in an airport could mean repeating warning signs about knifes, explosives or guns stored in luggage). If left unexplained, this behavior may cause unnecessary anxiety at security checkpoints and can escalate into misinterpretations and verbal and physical confrontations. He suggests that the person with autism or his/her travel companion carry a generic laminated card (also in the host country\ufffds language) explaining about autism, typical behaviors and how best to interact, which can be given to security authorities if needed. An example can be found on Debbaudt\ufffds website at: http://www.autismriskmanagement.com. In most cases, a family member of a person with a disability can request a special pass from the airline that allows an unticketed individual to accompany the passenger to his or her gate. Also, most airlines provide assistance to passengers with disabilities in boarding, deplaning and connecting with their flights as requested and youth travelers with disabilities have the option of traveling as unaccompanied minors for a fee. See Air Travel Tips for Passengers with Disabilities for more information. Top of page Exchange Staff and Participant Preparations Some exchange programs, especially those that provide scholarships, require applicants to interview in order to be selected for the international program. Interviews can be difficult for anyone, but may be especially hard for some people with autism, due to a lack of understanding of social interactions. While an interview may take the form of a conversation, all interviewees must be treated the same and asked the same set of questions. Remember, you may not ask any disability-related questions or request medical information before offering a position to an applicant. Below are a few techniques that may not only benefit an applicant with a form of autism, but all applicants. In addition to informing an applicant of their right to reasonable accommodations before an interview, you can: Prepare your applicants: Separate your interview into topic areas and state in clear terms each topic area as you progress through the interview. This will allow the applicant to focus his/her attention on each area of questions and calm nerves. For example, \"I have three or four questions about your experience working in an office. Are you ready?\"Use concise language and be specific: For example, you might usually ask an applicant what they are good at. Instead, be more specific. \"Are you good at keeping track of program schedules?\" or \"Can you volunteer in an office where many people come in and out at once?\" Direct questions allow an applicant to speak specifically to the skills that your international exchange program is looking for.Interview Wrap-Up: Tell an applicant, \"I have two last questions and then we'll wrap up in about five minutes.\" This allows applicants to prepare themselves for the end of the interview and include anything else they would like to say. It is also advisable to share the date by which they will hear from you. This information and further resources about inclusive interviewing/reasonable accommodations are available from the National Service Inclusion Project's \"Interviewing potential applicants using an inclusive process.\"Preparing for an exchange program also involves a lot of planning before departure. For exchange program staff to know the individual needs of participants, in this case for a person with Asperger Syndrome who has disclosed, a questionnaire adapted from the intake assessment form used by the Disability Services Office at the University of Minnesota for students entering college, may be useful in the education abroad setting. Some people with Asperger Syndrome may not request any adaptations or need any accommodations to be made. Ted Koehler found after his first day in Japan, he felt quite comfortable with his host family and in the city \ufffd a couple of times he felt anxious but it didn\ufffdt disrupt his experience as he could cope by thinking about his interests and phasing the feelings out. Others may choose to travel with the assistance of a friend or family member. Since some participants with Asperger Syndrome may not disclose, the ideas discussed in this tip sheet may make an international program inclusive in its initial design, thus setting a successful stage for neuro-diversity that can benefit all potential participants.

The result of a neurological disorder that affects the functioning of the brain, autism and its associated behaviors have been estimated to occur in as many as 1 in 500 individuals. Autism is four times more prevalent in boys than girls and knows no racial, ethnic, or social boundaries. Family income, lifestyle, and educational levels do not affect the chance of autism's occurrence. Autism impacts the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communications skills. Children and adults with autism typically have difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. The disorder makes it hard for them to communicate with others and relate to the outside world. In some cases, aggressive and/or self-injuries behavior may be present. Persons with autism may exhibit repeated body movements (hand flapping, rocking), unusual responses to people or attachments to objects, and resistance to changes in routines. Individuals may also experience sensitivities in the five senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. Its prevalence rate makes autism one of the most common developmental disabilities. Yet most of the public, including many professionals in the medical, educational, and vocational fields, are still unaware of how autism affects people and how they can effectively work with individuals with autism.

ASDs include autistic disorder, \"pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" /> New data suggests that approximately 1 in 110 children have an ASD*. There is currently no cure for ASDs, however, children with an ASD can progress developmentally and learn new skills. The AAP strongly believes in the importance of early and continuous surveillance and screening for ASD to ensure that children are identified and receive access to services as early as possible. The sooner an ASD is identified, the sooner an intervention program can start. Scientific understanding of the cause of autism is far from complete. The AAP strongly supports ongoing studies funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health that are trying to get to the factors in our modern environment that may be responsible for autism. *MMWR Surveillance Summaries.

The definition of autism and related disorders, referred to collectively as autism spectrum disorder, is one of deep and continuing importance. It affects the public's perception, our own perceptions, insurance, funding levels, research efforts, diagnosis, and the care and treatment of our children. Definitions have always been the means by which we construct and analyze reality. As J. L. Austin points out, \"Language is equivalent to action.\" There are any number of definitions dealing with autism and autism spectrum disorder. Some like the DSM-IV run to several pages, with a menu list of options. Others are more concise. All share a common element. They all define autism as a disorder. The accepted definition of autism as a disorder can be traced to its origins, now discredited, as a psychiatric condition. A number of nearly invisible, domino-like side effects further compound the problem once disorder is accepted. A common practice in the field of psychiatry is a pair-wise noun/adjective labeling of condition and patient, such as schizophrenia/schizophrenic, psychosis/psychotic, and autism/autistic. Of course implicit in this noun/adjective pairing is a life-long condition. Explicit is the understanding that the child is the disorder. Autism defined as a disorder coupled with the implicit life-long adjective autistic speaks to its fictive roots revealing more about the meaning-makers than the illness. Acceptance frames our expectations. It is self-limiting. Autism has been forced into this Procrustean position as a consequence of antiquated, inherited language rather than of sound science. Life-long disorders are recognized, accepted, coped with, and managed. Diseases are detected, prevented, treated, and cured. Diseases are fought, disorders are tolerated. A disorder means out of order. A noise word \ufffd?? gobbledygook, jargon, coloring our thinking and downplaying the problem. One of our goals as parents is to educate as well as enlist the aid of the public. Communication is understood by what we encounter based on shared contexts and experiences. Who has ever experienced a disorder? The public's perception of autism is framed for failure. The public is mystified by autism because disorder perpetuates the mystery. Autism is a disease, where a disease is \"a pathological condition of a part, organ, or system of an organism resulting from various causes, such as infection, genetic defect, or environmental stress, and characterized by an identifiable group of signs or symptoms.\" genetic genetic gastrointestinal DSM-IV J.

As explained below, the undersigned finds that the Meads have not presented a scientifically sound theory,\" special master George Hastings, a former tax claims expert at the Department of Justice, wrote in his ruling.In February 2009, the court ruled against three families who claimed vaccines caused their children's autism, saying they had been \"misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment\".The families sought payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault system that has a $2.5 billion fund built up from a 75-cent-per-dose tax on vaccines.Instead of judges, three \"special masters\" heard the three test cases representing thousands of other petitioners.They asked whether a combination vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, plus thimerosal, caused the children's symptoms.More than 5,300 cases were filed by parents who believed vaccines may have caused autism in their children. The no-fault payout system is meant to protect vaccine makers from costly lawsuits that drove many out of the vaccine business.Autism is a mysterious condition that affects as many as one in 110 U.S. children.

Evidence shows that early intervention results in dramatically positive outcomes for young children with autism. While various pre-school models emphasize different program components, all share an emphasis on early, appropriate, and intensive educational interventions for young children. Other common factors may be: some degree of inclusion, mostly behaviorally-based interventions, programs which build on the interests of the child, extensive use of visuals to accompany instruction, highly structured schedule of activities, parent and staff training, transition planning and follow-up. Because of the spectrum nature of autism and the many behavior combinations which can occur, no one approach is effective in alleviating symptoms of autism in all cases. Various types of therapies are available, including (but not limited to) applied behavior analysis, auditory integration training, dietary interventions, discrete trial teaching, medications, music therapy, occupational therapy, PECS, physical therapy, sensory integration, speech/language therapy, TEACCH, and vision therapy. Studies show that individuals with autism respond well to a highly structured, specialized education program, tailored to their individual needs. A well designed intervention approach may include some elements of communication therapy, social skill development, sensory integration therapy and applied behavior analysis, delivered by trained professionals in a consistent, comprehensive and coordinated manner. The more severe challenges of some children with autism may be best addressed by a structured education and behavior program which contains a one-on-one teacher to student ratio or small group environment. However, many other children with autism may be successful in a fully inclusive general education environment with appropriate support. In addition to appropriate educational supports in the area of academics, students with autism should have training in functional living skills at the earliest possible age. Learning to cross a street safely, to make a simple purchase or to ask assistance when needed are critical skills, and may be difficult, even for those with average intelligence levels. Tasks that enhance the person's independence and give more opportunity for personal choice and freedom in the community are important. To be effective, any approach should be flexible in nature, rely on positive reinforcement, be re-evaluated on a regular basis and provide a smooth transition from home to school to community environments. A good program will also incorporate training and support systems for parents and caregivers, with generalization of skills to all settings. Rarely can a family, classroom teacher or other caregiver provide effective habilitation for a person with autism unless offered consultation or in-service training by an experienced specialist who is knowledgeable about the disability. A generation ago, the vast majority of the people with autism were eventually placed in institutions. Professionals were much less educated about autism than they are today; autism specific supports and services were largely non-existent. Today the picture is brighter. With appropriate services, training, and information, most families are able to support their son or daughter at home. Group homes, assisted apartment living arrangements, or residential facilities offer more options for out of home support. Autism-specific programs and services provide the opportunity for individuals to be taught skills which allow them to reach their fullest potential. Families of people with autism can experience high levels of stress. As a result of the challenging behaviors of their children, relationships with service providers, attempting to secure appropriate services, resulting financial hardships, or very busy schedules, families often have difficulty participating in typical community activities. This results in isolation and difficulty in developing needed community supports. Members of the ASA represent all walks of life from rural to metropolitan communities. Embracing the diversity of our group, the ASA seeks to provide an open forum for the exchange of ideas. At the very core of the ASA's philosophy is the belief that no single program or treatment will benefit all individuals with autism. Furthermore, the recommendation of what is \"best\" or \"most effective\" for a person with autism should be determined by those people directly involved?the individual with autism, to the extent possible, and the parents or family members. The ASA provides information to assist parents, educators, and others in the decision-making process. Providing information on available intervention options, rather than advocating for any particular theory or philosophy, is the focus at the ASA. Back to Autism Questions ^ Is There a Cure for Autism? Understanding of autism has grown tremendously since it was first described by Dr. Leo Kanner in 1943. Some of the earlier searches for \"cures\" now seem unrealistic in terms of today's understanding of brain-based disorders. To cure means \"to restore to health, soundness, or normality.\" In the medical sense, there is no cure for the differences in the brain which result in autism. However, better understanding of the disorder has led to the development of better coping mechanisms and strategies for the various manifestations of the disability. Some of these symptoms may lessen as the child ages; others may disappear altogether. With appropriate intervention, many of the associated behaviors can be positively changed, even to the point in some cases, that the child or adult may appear to the untrained person to no longer have autism. The majority of children and adults will, however, continue to exhibit some manifestations of autism to some degree throughout their entire lives. Back to Autism Questions ^ What is the Autism Society of America? Founded in 1965 by a small group of parents, the Autism Society of America (ASA) continues to be the leading source of information and referral on autism and the largest collective voice representing the autism community for more than 33 years. Today, more than 24,000 members are connected through a volunteer network of over 200 chapters across the United States. The mission of the Autism Society of America is to promote lifelong access and opportunities for persons within the autism spectrum and their families, to be fully included, participating members of their communities through advocacy, public awareness, education, and research related to autism. In addition to its volunteer Board of Directors, composed primarily of parents of individuals with autism, the ASA has a Panel of Professional Advisors, comprised of nationally known and respected professionals who provide expertise and guidance to the Society on a volunteer basis. The ASA is dedicated to increasing public awareness about autism and the day-to-day issues faced by individuals with autism, their families, and the professionals with whom they interact. The Society and its chapters share common goals of providing information and education, supporting research, and advocating for programs and services for the autism community. Back to Autism Questions ^ The Autism Society of America Foundation The Autism Society of America Foundation (ASAF) (new tab/window) was founded with the primary mission to raise and allocate funds for research to address the many unanswered questions about autism. We are still far from fully understanding autism and knowing how to prevent it. The ASAF has implemented action on several pressing autism research priorities as areas of initial focus: developing and publicizing up-to-date prevalence statistics; quantifying the societal and family economic consequences of autism; developing a national registry of individuals and families with autism who are willing to participate in research studies; and implementing a system to identify potential donors of autism brain tissue for research purposes and facilitating the donation process. In addition, the Foundation is contributing substantial funds for applied and biomedical research in the causes of and treatment approaches to autism.

Autism is a disorder of the brain. Symptoms of autism occur during the first three years of life, although an individual might not receive a diagnosis until much later. Individuals with autism have problems with communication and socializing with others. In young children, autism affects the development of ?typical? play behaviors. Autism is considered a developmental disorder in that some normal developmental milestones, such as when a child says their first words, are absent or abnormal. Autism is considered a pervasive developmental disorder in that these developmental differences affect many aspects of life and may last throughout a person's lifetime. Currently, there is no one specifically known cause of autism and no one treatment. Early special education programs using behavioral methods have proven to be the most helpful treatment for persons with autism. Frequently Asked Questions About Autism Q: How common is autism? A: Current research indicates that as many as 1 in 166 individuals have an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Males are four times more likely than females to have an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Q: What is an Autism Spectrum Disorder ? A: Three conditions that have similar symptoms but differ in terms of how severe they are and how they are expressed are sometimes called Autism Spectrum Disorders. There are different ways in which the hallmark characteristics of autism, most particularly within the social interaction area, are expressed. Many people do not exhibit all of the criteria for a diagnosis of autism but their characteristics are best described as fitting within the spectrum of autism. Autism spectrum disorders are generally considered to be: Autism: an individual shows 6 or more of 12 symptoms across three main areas, communication, social interaction and restricted activity/interests Asperger's Disorder or Syndrome: a form of autism where the individual is typically verbal and has a normal or above normal IQ , but exhibits problems with social skills and social use of language Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified or PDD-NOS: those who do not meet the full criteria for autism but display similar behaviors Q: How do I know if a person has autism? A: Unfortunately, there is no medical test that can be done to show that an individual has autism. Autism can be diagnosed by observing the person and looking at how they communicate and relate to others. A few of the behaviors that a diagnostician may look for include making eye contact with a person who is talking to them, showing interest in what other people are doing and engaging in play with others (if the individual is young). Difficulty in relating to people is a hallmark symptom of autism (see ?red flags? below). Q: What are the red flags of autism? A: Early Indicators or ?Red Flags? of Autism in Children Three and Under Currently, the criteria used to diagnose autism (The Diagnostic Statistical Manual ?IV ? TR) are designed for 3-year-olds. However, recent research has shown that certain behaviors in children younger than 3 may indicate a higher risk for developing autism. No single behavior or factor indicates a child may have autism but the presence of several symptoms could be cause for concern. Parents should watch for the following: Possible symptoms at 6 months: Not making eye contact with parents during interaction Not cooing or babbling Not smiling when parents smile Not participating in vocal turn-taking (baby makes a sound, adult makes a sound, and so forth) Not responding to peek-a-boo game At 14 months: No attempts to speak Not pointing, waving or grasping No response when name is called Indifferent to others Repetitive body motions such as rocking or hand flapping Fixation on a single object Oversensitivity to textures, smells, sounds Strong resistance to change in routine Any loss of language At 24 months: Does not initiate two-word phrases (that is, doesn't just echo words) Any loss of words or developmental skill (Source: Rebecca Landa , Center for Autism and Related Disorders at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore) Additional information on early signs of autism Q: Who can diagnose autism? Autism can be diagnosed by a medical doctor or a licensed psychologist. If a parent is concerned about the communication and social development of their child, they may see their general pediatrician or family doctor first. Frequently, the family will then be referred to a specialist who has specific experience with autism and other developmental disorders. This may be a developmental pediatrician, neurologist, psychiatrist or clinical psychologist with experience in the area of autism. Q: What types of assessments will be conducted during the diagnosis? A: There are several assessments that can be done to diagnose autism. Usually a diagnostician will conduct a structured observation period to observe the individual. The diagnostician may ask the individual to respond to several activities as they look for specific behaviors. A structured interview also may be conducted with parents or guardians. Structured interviews provide the diagnostician with information about the individual's past behavior and their behavior at home, school and in the community. A speech evaluation and/or psychological evaluation may be conducted during the diagnostic evaluation. Q: What should I do once an individual is diagnosed with autism? A: Once an individual has been diagnosed with autism it is important to begin intervention as early as possible. Early intervention usually focuses on intense skill building. Skills that are learned easily by typically developing persons can be difficult for someone with autism. For example, individuals with autism have difficulty understanding social cues and may need to be taught to pay attention to others, play with others and communicate with others. Many skills must be broken down into smaller components and taught systematically. Early intervention, preschool, school programs and behavioral health centers are available to provide intervention. In addition, in West Virginia , a family can contact the WVATC and receive services. The WVATC works closely with families, school system personnel and behavioral health centers to develop and implement intervention that is designed specifically for the individual with autism. pointing brain eye contact babbling social interaction Kennedy Krieger Institute Pervasive Developmental Autism: West Virginia Diagnostic Statistical Manual Rebecca Landa Center for Autism and Related Disorders Baltimore WVATC Autism458 null Autism Autism is a developmental disability that affects a person's verbal and non-verbal communication, understanding of language, and socialization with peers. Other characteristics include: engagement in repetitive activities, resistance to environmental change, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The range of severity can be from extremely mild to severe. Autism is a behavioral disorder, not an illness or disease. It typically appears by age three and is a lifelong condition. There is no known cure, although there are documented cases of symptoms being reduced and even some children losing their diagnosis alltogether. Although autism affects the functions of the brain, the specific cause is not known. FAST FACTS ABOUT AUTISM Autism Spectrum Disorder Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an increasingly popular term that refers to a broad definition of autism including the classic form of the disorder as well as closely related disabilities that share many of the core characteristics. Although the classic form of autism can be readily distinguished from other forms of ASD, the terms autism and ASD are often used interchangeably. ASD includes the following classifications: (1) Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) Refers to a collection of features that resemble autism but may not be as severe or extensive. Also known as mild or atypical autism. Many with PDD-NOS are deemed high functioning. (2) Asperger Syndrome (AS) Individuals with AS show crippling deficiencies in social skills. They have difficulties with transitions and prefer sameness. They often have obsessive routines and may be preoccupied with a particular subject of interest. They have a great deal of difficulty reading nonverbal cues (body language) and very often the individual with AS has difficulty determining proper body space. Often overly sensitive to sounds, tastes, smells, and sights, the person with AS may prefer soft clothing, certain foods, and be bothered by sounds or lights no one else seems to hear or see. Those with Asperger's typically have a normal to above average IQ and many (not all) exhibit exceptional abilities or talents in specific areas of interest. (3) Rett's Syndrome A rare disorder affecting girls. It's a genetic disorder with hard neurological signs, including seizures, that become more apparent with age. Hypotonia (loss of muscle tone) is usually the first symptom then followed by hand-wringing stereotypy. The syndrome affects approximately 1 in every 10,000-15,000 live female births. The gene causing the disorder has now been identified. (4) Childhood Disintegrative Disorder Refers to children whose development appears normal for the first few years, but then regresses with the loss of speech and other skills until the characteristics of autism are exhibited. Deterioration of intellectual, social, and language skills over a period of several months is commonly seen. Individuals with autism and ASD vary widely in ability and personality. In fact, it's been said that there are no two autistic individuals who are the same. They can fall anywhere on a spectrum, ranging from severe mental retardation all the way to being extremely gifted in their intellectual and academic accomplishments. While many individuals prefer isolation and tend to withdraw from social contact, others show high levels of affection and enjoy social situations. Some people with autism appear lethargic and slow to respond but others are very active and seem to interact constantly with preferred aspects of their environment.

These signs all begin before a child is three years old.[1] Autism involves many parts of the brain; how this occurs is not well understood.[1] The two other autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and PDD-NOS, diagnosed when full criteria for the other two disorders are not met.[1] Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants.[1] In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects.[1] Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes, such as heavy metals, pesticides or childhood vaccines;[1] the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.[1] The prevalence of autism is about 1\ufffd2 per 1,000 people; the prevalence of ASD is about 6 per 1,000, with about four times as many males as females. The number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.[1] Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.[1] The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress.[1] Although early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills, there is no known cure.[1] Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.[1] An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be tolerated as a difference and not treated as a disorder.[1] Contents 1 Characteristics 1.1 Social development 1.2 Communication 1.3 Repetitive behavior 1.4 Other symptoms 2 Classification 3 Causes 4 Mechanism 4.1 Pathophysiology 4.2 Neuropsychology 5 Screening 6 Diagnosis 7 Management 8 Prognosis 9 Epidemiology 10 History 11 References 12 External links if (window.showTocToggle) { var tocShowText = \"show\"; var tocHideText = \"hide\"; showTocToggle(); } Characteristics Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder[1] that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without remission.[1] Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,[1] and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.[1] It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.[1] Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.[1] Social development Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification) from other developmental disorders.[1] People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals, or people with normal neural development, as leaving her feeling \"like an anthropologist on Mars\".[1] Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn taking, and are more likely to communicate by manipulating another person's hand.[1] Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers.[1] Most autistic children display moderately less attachment security than non-autistic children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.[1] Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition.[1] Contrary to common beliefs, autistic children do not prefer being alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect their quality of life more deeply.[1] There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and tantrums. A 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in non-autistic children with language impairments.[1] A 2008 Swedish study found that, of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD, those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as psychosis.[1] Communication About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.[1] Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (echolalia)[1][1] or reverse pronouns.[1] Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:[1] for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,[1][1] and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.[1] Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.[1][1] In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8\ufffd15 performed equally well, and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.[1] Repetitive behavior Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)[1] categorizes as follows. File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg A young boy with autism, and the precise line of toys he made Stereotypy is repetitive movement, such as hand flapping, making sounds, head rolling, or body rocking. Compulsive behavior is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in stacks or lines. Sameness is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted. Ritualistic behavior involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.[1] Restricted behavior is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game. Self-injury includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as eye poking, skin picking, hand biting, and head banging.[1] A 2007 study reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD.[1] No single repetitive behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.[1] Other symptoms Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.[1] An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants.[1] Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population.[1] Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some,[1] although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.[1] Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements).[1] An estimated 60%\ufffd80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking;[1] ASD is not associated with severe motor disturbances.[1] Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur;[1] this does not appear to result in malnutrition. Although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual;[1] studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between GI problems and ASD is unclear.[1] At some point in childhood, about two-thirds of individuals with ASD are affected by sleep problems; these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.[1] Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress.[1] Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children or those with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.[1] Classification File:Leo-Kanner.jpeg Leo Kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in 1943. Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.[1] These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.[1] Of the five PDD forms, Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; also called atypical autism) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.[1] Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development.[1] The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the autism spectrum disorders (ASD)[1] or sometimes the autistic disorders,[1] whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder, childhood autism, or infantile autism. In this article, autism refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, autism, ASD, and PDD are often used interchangeably.[1] ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as avoiding eye contact.[1] The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments\ufffdwho may be silent, mentally disabled, and locked into hand flapping and rocking\ufffdto high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication.[1] Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.[1] Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or high-functioning autism (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on IQ thresholds,[1] or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into syndromal and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound mental retardation or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as tuberous sclerosis.[1] Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism is unclear.[1] Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype,[1][1][1][1] or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.[1] Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subpopulations[1] and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, neurology and pediatrics.[1] Newer technologies such as fMRI can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism.[1] It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior, with the name Type 1 autism denoting rare autism cases that test positive for a mutation in the CNTNAP2 gene.[1] Causes Template:Main It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms.[1] However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.[1][1] File:Single Chromosome Mutations.png Deletion (1), duplication (2) and inversion (3) are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism.[1] Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants.[1][1] Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA but are heritable and influence gene expression.[1] Studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0.7 for autism and 0.9 for the broader autism phenotype, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population.[1] However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian (single-gene) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality like fragile X syndrome, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs has been shown to selectively cause ASD.[1] Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene.[1] The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variations\ufffdspontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis.[1] Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome.[1] Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with cell adhesion.[1] Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes.[1] All known teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.[1] Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies,[1] extensive searches are underway.[1] Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism, or may be important in future research, include certain foods, infectious disease, heavy metals, solvents, diesel exhaust, PCBs, phthalates and phenols used in plastic products, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs, vaccines,[1] and prenatal stress.[1] Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination, and this has given rise to theories that vaccines or their preservatives cause autism. Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations and higher likelihood of measles outbreaks.[1] Mechanism Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.[1] How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors.[1] The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.[1] Pathophysiology File:Autismbrain.jpg Autism affects the amygdala, cerebellum, and many other parts of the brain.[1] Unlike many other brain disorders such as Parkinson's, autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms.[1] Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems,[1] and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product.[1] Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception.[1] This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors.[1] Just after birth, the brain of an autistic child grows faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood. The early overgrowth seems to be most prominent in areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization.[1] Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following: An excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions.[1] Disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation.[1][1] Unbalanced excitatory\ufffdinhibitory networks.[1] Abnormal formation of synapses and by modulation of the neurexin\ufffdneuroligin cell-adhesion system,[1] or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic protein.[1] Disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy, which may explain why the two conditions are associated.[1] Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD.[1] Although some abnormalities in the immune system have been found in specific subgroups of autistic individuals, it is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to or secondary to autism's disease processes.[1] As autoantibodies are found in conditions other than ASD, and are not always present in ASD,[1] the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial.[1] Several neurotransmitter abnormalities have been detected in autism, notably increased blood levels of serotonin. Whether these cause structural or behavioral abnormalities is unclear.[1] Some data suggest an increase in several growth hormones; other data argue for diminished growth factors.[1] Also, some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than 5% of cases.[1] The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.[1] Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD.[1] However, individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS[1] and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object.[1] File:Powell2004Fig1A.jpeg Autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain (yellow) for a movement task compared to a control group (blue).[1] ASD-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks.[1] In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network, a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing, with intact connectivity of the task-positive network, used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking. In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of self-referential thought.[1] A 2008 brain-imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the cingulate cortex which differs in individuals with ASD.[1] The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes.[1] Evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals[1] and by a brain wave study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex.[1] Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex.[1] From studies based on event-related potentials, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for non-social stimuli.[1] For example, magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.[1] Neuropsychology Two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior. The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition. The empathizing\ufffdsystemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize\ufffdthat is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain\ufffdbut are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing;[1] this extension is controversial, as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects.[1] These theories are somewhat related to the earlier theory of mind approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the Sally\ufffdAnne test for reasoning about others' motivations,[1] and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in Pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis.[1] However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic emotions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.[1] The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing. Executive dysfunction hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in working memory, planning, inhibition, and other forms of executive function.[1] Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.[1] A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;[1] two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure[1] and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children.[1] Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.[1] A related theory\ufffdenhanced perceptual functioning\ufffdfocuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals.[1] These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism. Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.[1] A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.[1] Screening About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months.[1] As postponing treatment may affect long-term outcome, any of the following signs is reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist without delay: No babbling by 12 months. No gesturing (pointing, waving goodbye, etc.) by 12 months. No single words by 16 months. No two-word spontaneous phrases (other than instances of echolalia) by 24 months. Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.[1] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for ASD at the 18- and 24-month well-child doctor visits, using autism-specific formal screening tests.[1] In contrast, the UK National Screening Committee recommends against screening for ASD in the general population, because screening tools have not been fully validated and interventions lack sufficient evidence for effectiveness.[1] Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor CHAT on children aged 18\ufffd30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity (many false-negatives) but good specificity (few false-positives).[1] It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders.[1] Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture.[1] Genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical.[1] Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism.[1][1] Autism is defined in the DSM-IV-TR as exhibiting at least six symptoms total, including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction, at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication, and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome or childhood disintegrative disorder.[1] ICD-10 uses essentially the same definition.[1] Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.[1] A pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions.[1] A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.[1] A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider mental retardation, hearing impairment, and a specific language impairment[1] such as Landau\ufffdKleffner syndrome.[1] The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression.[1] Clinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.[1] Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,[1] consensus guidelines in the U.S. and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and fragile X testing.[1] A genotype-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.[1] As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics.[1] Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.[1] ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.[1] In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.[1] A 2009 U.S. study found the average age of formal ASD diagnosis was 5.7 years, far above recommendations, and that 27% of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years.[1] Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.[1] Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.[1] It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes.[1] Management Template:Main File:Opening a window to the autistic brain.jpg A three-year-old with autism points to fish in an aquarium, as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared-attention training on language development.[1] The main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs.[1] Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy.[1] Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options.[1] Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills,[1] and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors;[1] claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated.[1] Available approaches include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy.[1] Educational interventions have some effectiveness in children: intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children[1] and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children.[1] Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided.[1] It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up,[1] and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.[1] Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails.[1][1] More than half of U.S. children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics.[1] Aside from antipsychotics,[1] there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD.[1] A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications, the medications can have adverse effects,[1] and no known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments.[1] Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function after birth,[1] suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.[1] Although many alternative therapies and interventions are available, few are supported by scientific studies.[1][1][1] Treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance.[1] Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests.[1] Though most alternative treatments, such as melatonin, have only mild adverse effects[1] some may place the child at risk. A 2008 study found that compared to their peers, autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein-free diets;[1] in 2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism.[1] Treatment is expensive; indirect costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a U.S. study estimated an average lifetime cost of $Template:Formatprice (net present value in 2010 dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimateTemplate:Inflation-fn), with about 10% medical care, 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity.[1] Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems;[1] one 2008 U.S. study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD,[1] and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment.[1] U.S. states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services, shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance.[1] After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and estate planning.[1] Prognosis There is no known cure.[1] Children recover occasionally, so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD;[1] this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often recovery happens;[1] reported rates in unselected samples of children with ASD have ranged from 3% to 25%.[1] A few autistic children have acquired speech at age 5 or older.[1] Most children with autism lack social support, meaningful relationships, future employment opportunities or self-determination.[1] Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.[1] Few high-quality studies address long-term prognosis. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife.[1] Acquiring language before age six, having an IQ above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; independent living is unlikely with severe autism.[1] A 2004 British study of 68 adults who were diagnosed before 1980 as autistic children with IQ above 50 found that 12% achieved a high level of independence as adults, 10% had some friends and were generally in work but required some support, 19% had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living, 46% needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in ASD with a high level of support and very limited autonomy, and 12% needed high-level hospital care.[1] A 2005 Swedish study of 78 adults that did not exclude low IQ found worse prognosis; for example, only 4% achieved independence.[1] A 2008 Canadian study of 48 young adults diagnosed with ASD as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor (46%), fair (32%), good (17%), and very good (4%); 56% of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives, mostly in volunteer, sheltered or part-time work.[1] Changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children.[1] Epidemiology Template:Main File:US-autism-6-17-1996-2007.png Reports of autism cases per 1,000 children grew dramatically in the U.S. from 1996 to 2007. It is unknown how much, if any, growth came from changes in autism's prevalence. Most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1\ufffd2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD;[1] because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true prevalence.[1] PDD-NOS's prevalence has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000.[1] The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness,[1][1] though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out.[1] The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased;[1] a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.[1] Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with mental retardation and more than 5.5:1 without.[1] Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.[1] The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.[1] Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.[1] Autism is associated with several other conditions: Genetic disorders. About 10\ufffd15% of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian (single-gene) condition, chromosome abnormality, or other genetic syndrome,[1] and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.[1] Mental retardation. The fraction of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for mental retardation has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.[1] For ASD other than autism, the association with mental retardation is much weaker.[1] Anxiety disorders are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.[1] Epilepsy, with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of language disorder.[1] Several metabolic defects, such as phenylketonuria, are associated with autistic symptoms.[1] Minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population.[1] Preempted diagnoses. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for ADHD, Tourette syndrome, and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted.[1] History Template:See A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The Table Talk of Martin Luther contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.[1] According to Luther's notetaker Mathesius, Luther thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated.[1] The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.[1] The Wild Boy of Aveyron, a feral child caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.[1] The New Latin word autismus (English translation autism) was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia. He derived it from the Greek word aut\ufffds (?????, meaning self), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to \"autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance\".[1] The word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler's terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in German about child psychology.[1] Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.[1] Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.[1] Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably \"autistic aloneness\" and \"insistence on sameness\", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.[1] It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.[1] Kanner's reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia, and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to \"refrigerator mothers\". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.[1] As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.[1] Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD,[1] parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their autistic children's behaviors are perceived negatively by others,[1] and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.[1] The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.[1] Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.[1][1] References Template:Reflist External links Template:Commons cat Autism | Pervasive developmental disorders | Childhood psychiatric disorders | Communication disorders | Neurological disorders pointing genetic brain genetic mutations U.S. PCBs depression dna sensitivity Autism gastrointestinal eye contact mental retardation babbling regression echolalia PDD Internet ASD childhood disintegrative disorder social interaction anxiety fragile x syndrome sleep UK ABA Leo Kanner Kanner anticonvulsants teratogens birth defects repetitive behavior ADOS gene expression German conception Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Swedish cognitive tantrums adhd aggression Asperger Temple Grandin neural down syndrome malnutrition PDD-NOS ADI-R atypical English imitation Johns Hopkins Hospital Childhood Autism Rating Scale PDD-NOS British gesturing chromosome abnormality American Academy of Pediatrics Autism Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised Prognosis Causes Classification Mechanism Pathophysiology Neuropsychology Epidemiology DSM-IV-TR neurodevelopmental LFA HFA Greek Swiss Bleuler neurotypicals Canadian Google ADHD Gene Mars hearing impairment toe walking cell adhesion ASD: poor muscle tone heritability language impairment stereotypy Wikipedia Mirror Jump Wiki Yahoo CNTNAP2 File:Single Mendelian MNS UK National Screening Committee M-CHAT Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire First Year Inventory Metabolic National Autism Plan for Children Template:Main File:US-autism-6-17-1996-2007.png Reports Mendelian Tourette Table Talk of Martin Luther Luther Mathesius Hugh Blair Borgue Blair Wild Boy of Aveyron Jean Itard New meiosis screening applied behavior analysis aba diagnoses occupational therapy autism diagnostic observation schedule ados neuroimaging cars childhood autism rating scale behavior therapy neuropsychologist Autism460 null See more news releases in: Retail, Health Care & Hospitals, Children-related News, Corporate Social Responsibility, Not For Profit Toys\"R\"Us, U.S. Launches Fundraising Campaign to Help Autism Speaks Solve the Autism Puzzle Company Identifies \"Ten Toys That Speak To Autism\" and Introduces Safe Play Tips for Children on the Autism Spectrum WAYNE, N.J., Feb. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- Toys\"R\"Us, U.S. today announced that its fundraising campaign to benefit Autism Speaks will begin Sunday, February 28 and continue through Friday, April 30. Throughout the campaign, monetary donations will be collected at all Toys\"R\"Us and Babies\"R\"Us stores and online at Toysrus.com/AutismSpeaks. Autism Speaks is the nation's leading organization dedicated to increasing awareness of autism spectrum disorders; funding research into the causes, prevention and treatments for autism; and advocating for the needs of individuals with autism and their families. \"Autism impacts countless families, including those of our customers and employees,\" said Jerry Storch, Chairman and CEO, Toys\"R\"Us, Inc. \"As a company that loves kids, we are proud to lend our support once again to help Autism Speaks find the missing pieces of the autism puzzle by raising money and awareness for this disorder.\" Skill-Building Toys and Safe Play Tips As part of this philanthropic initiative, Toys\"R\"Us has created several programs to help parents and caregivers of children with autism. The company collaborated with Autism Speaks and the National Lekotek Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to making play accessible for children with disabilities, to identify toys that can help little ones with autism develop language, creativity and social skills, among others, while playing alongside siblings and friends. The \"Ten Toys That Speak To Autism,\" a special subset of the annual Toys\"R\"Us Toy Guide for Differently-Abled Kids, provides toy suggestions specifically for families and friends of children with autism. Research shows that children with cognitive, emotional or social limitations, including those with autism, are more prone to accidental injuries. With guidance from leading safety organizations and Autism Speaks, the Safe Play Tips are relevant for children with autism. These tips include: Avoid Trigger Toys: Opt for toys that have volume control for children who are adversely affected by loud noises. Read Labels for Ability: Choose toys that correspond with a child's learning level rather than merely matching a toy with his/her actual age. Never Leave a Child Unsupervised: It is especially critical that a child with special needs is properly supervised by an adult or trusted caregiver at all times. \"The \"R\"Us family and its customers have continually opened their hearts to support Autism Speaks in its mission to advocate for the nearly 750,000 children on the autism spectrum in this country,\" said Mark Roithmayr, President of Autism Speaks. \"Toys\"R\"Us, Inc. is such a valued partner, and we are excited about the fundraising potential of this year's program.\" Comprehensive information about the 2010 campaign is available on the company's dedicated website, Toysrus.com/AutismSpeaks. The \"Ten Toys That Speak To Autism\" and a full list of Safe Play Tips can be found here, as well as a blog titled \"Speaking About Autism,\" which offers updates and information throughout the nine-week fundraising effort. The website, as well as campaign signage in Toys\"R\"Us and Babies\"R\"Us stores, features the \"Faces of Autism,\" a striking series of portraits highlighting children with autism taken by photographer Thomas Balsamo. Walking the Walk for Autism Speaks In addition to the fundraising campaign, Toys\"R\"Us is kicking off its national sponsorship of Walk Now for Autism Speaks, a year-long series of more than 80 walk events in communities throughout North America. Teams of regional employees will walk alongside the company's iconic mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe and individuals with autism, their families and friends to raise money and awareness. All funds raised in Toys\"R\"Us and Babies\"R\"Us stores, online and through the Walk Now for Autism Speaks events will go directly to Autism Speaks to support research and advocacy efforts. Earlier this month, the Toys\"R\"Us Children's Fund kicked off the 2010 campaign by providing a $400,000 grant to Autism Speaks. Customers who donate $10 or more to Autism Speaks at any Toys\"R\"Us or Babies\"R\"Us store in the United States will receive a colorful, floral-themed reusable shopping bag designed by a talented artist with autism, James Hogarth, while supplies last. Since the partnership launched in 2007, Toys\"R\"Us, Inc., the Toys\"R\"Us Children's Fund and customer contributions have combined to provide Autism Speaks with more than $5.5 million. Last year's in-store and online fundraising campaign raised more than $1.9 million for Autism Speaks. This year, for the first time, Toys\"R\"Us, Canada will lend its support to the cause by collecting donations in its nearly 70 stores and online at Toysrus.ca. About Autism Autism is a complex neurobiological disorder that inhibits a person's ability to communicate and develop social relationships, and is often accompanied by behavioral challenges. Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed in one in 110 children in the United States, affecting four times as many boys as girls. The prevalence of autism increased 57 percent from 2002 to 2006. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called autism a national public health crisis whose cause and cure remain unknown. About Toys\"R\"Us, Inc.

The fifth edition of the DSM will be officially released in 2013, but some of the new guidelines, especially for those that fall under the Autism Spectrum Disorders, propose that Asperger\ufffds syndrome should not be a separate diagnosis from other autistic disorders generating a furry of comments and concerns. Asperger\ufffds Syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects two-way social interaction, both verbal and nonverbal communication, and a reluctance to accept change. Patients also have an inflexibility of thought and an obsessively narrow area of interest. They require a structured environment and rely on routines. Asperger patients are often highly intelligent, excelling especially in math and science. They have excellent rote memory skills for remembering things such as facts, figures, and dates. In addition to a deficit in social skills, Asperger patients may also show delayed motor skills and a presence of \ufffdmotor clumsiness\ufffd. They may take longer pedaling a bike, catching a ball, or have trouble with other manipulative tasks such as opening a jar. The National Institutes of Health estimates that Asperger\ufffds syndrome affects about two out of every 10,000 children. It appears to affect boys more than girls. Unlike autism, language acquisition and cognitive development are not delayed and Asperger\ufffds is usually diagnosed later in childhood. Because the severity of the symptoms range within the syndrome and some experts do not recognize mild cases, often calling a patient \ufffdodd\ufffd or \ufffdeccentric\ufffd, the American Psychiatric Association Committee feels that reclassifying Asperger\ufffds patients as \ufffdhighly functioning autism\ufffd patients may help children get the services and support they need. Dr. Charles Raison, psychiatrist at Emory University, says that \ufffdit is more accurate to call it a form of autism. From a scientific point of view, I think the use of these spectrum ideas is much closer to the underlying biology.\ufffd Rosalyn Lord, Coordinator of CASSEL \ufffd a support group for Asperger\ufffds patients in the UK \ufffd maintains the conditions should remain separate diagnoses. At the Online Asperger Syndrome Information and Support (OASIS) Center, she writes that while both syndromes are characterized by a difficulty with social skills, autism is often interpreted as a withdrawal from normal life and the impairments are much greater than those of Asperger\ufffds. Children with autism often have little or no language and have a greater difficulty in learning. Those with Asperger are more verbal and have a cognitive ability that is usually above average. Both autistic and Asperger patients find the world confusing and frustrating, leading to behavioral problems that need special attention. Language and communication therapies can be helpful for both, but with different focuses. While autistic patients need encouragement to acquire more verbal skills, Asperger patients need help with understanding the subtleties of language \ufffd that everything said is not black and white. Parents of children with both conditions need to understand routines and structure that can be helpful for children diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder. OASIS gives this list of helpful strategies to help, especially with Asperger\ufffds Syndrome children: \ufffd Keep all your speech and instructions simple - to a level they understand. The use of lists or pictures may help. \ufffd Try to get confirmation that they understand what you are talking about/or asking - don't rely on a stock yes or no - that they like to answer with. \ufffd Explain why they should look at you when you speak to them. Encourage them, give praise for any achievement - especially when they use a social skill without prompting. \ufffd In some young children who appear not to listen - the act of 'singing' your words can have a beneficial effect. \ufffd Limit any choices to two or three items. \ufffd Limit their 'special interest' time to set amounts of time each day if you can. \ufffd Use turn taking activities as much as possible, not only in games but at home too. \ufffd Pre-warn them of any changes, and give warning prompts if you want them to finish a task. \ufffd Try to build in some flexibility in their routine, if they learn early that things do change and often without warning - it can help. \ufffd Don't always expect them to 'act their age' they are usually immature and you should make some allowances for this. \ufffd Try to identify stress triggers and avoid them if possible. \ufffd Promises and threats you make will have to be kept - so try not to make them too lightly. \ufffd Let them know that you love them and that you are proud of them. It can be very easy with a child who rarely speaks not to tell them all the things you feel inside.

We have added additional information and/or commentary in italics. Definition of Autism Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life. The result of a neurological disorder that affects the functioning of the brain, autism impacts the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Children and adults with autism typically have difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. (Autism Coach - Children with severe symptoms may not be able to speak or have a limited range of speech. They may also have difficulty understanding others through spoken and/or written communication. Children and adults with milder symptoms can speak but often have difficulty understanding the give and take of social interactions, reading other people's emotions and motivations accurately, and have difficulty carrying out day to day activities independently and in a timely fashion. Even an adult diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome or High Functioning Autism and an IQ of over 130 may not be able to live independently unless he or she is able to get along with co-workers, cope with sensory distractions in the workplace, appropriately allocate money to pay for food, rent, health care and other essentials, and meet other challenges that may arise.) Autism is one of five disorders coming under the umbrella of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), a category of neurological disorders characterized by severe and pervasive impairment in several areas of development, including social interaction and communications skills (DSM-IV-TR). The five disorders under PDD are Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD), Rett's Disorder, and PDD-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). Each of these disorders has specific diagnostic criteria as outlined by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in its Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). (Autism Coach - Labels given to individuals with milder symptoms of autism include High Functioning Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD NOS). Sometimes an individual may have have additional issues and may also be labeled with Hyperlexia, ADD, or ADHD, Tourette's Syndrome or Learning Disabled (LD) although children with these labels are frequently not within the autism spectrum. Frequently, high-functioning children are unlabeled or mislabeled for many years until someone knowledgeable about high functioning autism comes into contact with them.) Prevalence of Autism Autism is the most common of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders, affecting an estimated 2 to 6 per 1,000 individuals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001). This means that as many as 1.5 million Americans today are believed to have some form of autism. And that number is on the rise. Based on statistics from the U.S. Department of Education and other governmental agencies, autism is growing at a rate of 10-17 percent per year. At these rates, it is estimated that the prevalence of autism could reach 4 million Americans in the next decade. The overall incidence of autism is consistent around the globe, but is four times more prevalent in boys than girls. Autism knows no racial, ethnic, or social boundaries, and family income, lifestyle, and educational levels do not affect the chance of autism's occurrence. (Autism Coach - Clusters of higher incidence of autism have been found in certain areas of the U.S. - Brick County, New Jersey is one such example. Also, according to an article in Wired Magazine, there appears to be a higher incidence of autism amongst the children of scientists, musicians, programmers, and engineers - with a cluster of autism occurring in Silicon Valley, California.) Common Characteristics of Autism While understanding of autism has grown tremendously since it was first described by Dr. Leo Kanner in 1943, most of the public, including many professionals in the medical, educational, and vocational fields, are still unaware of how autism affects people and how they can effectively work with individuals with autism. Contrary to popular understanding, many children and adults with autism may make eye contact, show affection, smile and laugh, and demonstrate a variety of other emotions, although in varying degrees. Autism is a spectrum disorder. The symptoms and characteristics of autism can present themselves in a wide variety of combinations, from mild to severe. Two children, both with the same diagnosis, can act very differently from one another and have varying skills. All children with autism can learn, function productively and improve with appropriate education and treatment. (Autism Coach - substantial, and not infrequently, huge improvements are being made by children within the autism spectrum when the children are under the age of five and the behavioral and bio-medical issues are addressed through a comprehensive intervention program.) Every person with autism is an individual, and like all individuals, has a unique personality and combination of characteristics. Some individuals mildly affected may exhibit only slight delays in language and greater challenges with social interactions. The person may have difficulty initiating and/or maintaining a conversation. Communication is often described as talking at others (for example, monologue on a favorite subject that continues despite attempts by others to interject comments). People with autism process and respond to information in ways that differ from neurotypical (non-autistic) people. (Autism Coach - how individuals within the autism spectrum perceive incoming information through sight, hearing, touch, taste and balance, store and organize this information and retrieve information from memory may be the underlying issues contributing to autistic behavior, according to recent research). Persons with autism may also exhibit some of the following traits. Insistence on sameness; resistance to change Difficulty in expressing needs; uses gestures or pointing instead of words Repeating words or phrases in place of normal, responsive language Laughing, crying, showing distress for reasons not apparent to others Prefers to be alone; aloof manner Tantrums Difficulty in mixing with others May not want to cuddle or be cuddled Little or no eye contact Unresponsive to normal teaching methods Sustained odd play Spins objects Inappropriate attachments to objects Apparent over-sensitivity or under-sensitivity to pain No real fears of danger Noticeable physical over-activity or extreme under-activity Uneven gross/fine motor skills Not responsive to verbal cues; acts as if deaf although hearing tests in normal range. In some cases, aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior may be present. For most of us, the integration of our senses helps us to understand what we are experiencing. For example, our senses of touch, smell and taste work together in the experience of eating a ripe peach: the feel of the peach fuzz as we pick it up, its sweet smell as we bring it to our mouth, and the juices running down our face as we take a bite. For children with autism, sensory integration problems are common. Their senses may be over-or under-active. The fuzz on the peach may actually be experienced as painful; the smell may make the child gag. Some children with autism are particularly sensitive to sound, finding even the most ordinary daily noises painful. Many professionals feel that some of the typical autism behaviors are actually a result of sensory integration difficulties. (Autism Coach - some children who appear to be undersensitive to sensory input, such as hearing, may actually be overly sensitive and have tuned out sound completely because it is so unpleasant for them.) There are many myths and misconceptions about autism. Contrary to popular belief, many autistic children do make eye contact; it just may be less or different from a non-autistic child. Many children with autism can develop good functional language and others can develop some type of communication skills, such as sign language or use of pictures. (Autism Coach - According to some autistic children who are able to communicate through speech, typing or letter boards, they only process one form of sensory input at a time. If they are looking, they can't hear - so frequently they look away from someone who is talking to them so they can concentrate on understanding what the speaker is saying.) Diagnosing Autism An diagnosis of autism is based on observation of the individual's communication, behavior, and developmental levels. However, because many of the behaviors associated with autism are shared by other disorders, various medical tests may be ordered to rule out or identify other possible causes of the symptoms being exhibited. Autism may also co-occur with other conditions such as Tourette's Syndrome, seizure disorders, ADD, ADHD, and depression. It is important to distinguish autism from other conditions, since an accurate diagnosis and early identification can provide the basis for building an appropriate and effective educational and treatment program. (Autism Coach - In our opinion, it is important to identify and address underlying and related medical conditions. However, as a wise parent once said, Labels are for cans, not for kids! Our children are not a collection of labels. We must look beyond labels to the whole child we love, determine our child's strengths and areas of deficit, and then create an intervention program that allows that child to use his or her strengths to lay the groundwork for new learning and the acquisition of new skills and abilities.) Early Diagnosis Research indicates that early diagnosis is associated with dramatically better outcomes for individuals with autism. The earlier a child is diagnosed, the earlier the child can begin benefiting from one of the many specialized intervention approaches. (Autism Coach - We can't emphasize enough how important it is to begin treatment as early as possible!) Diagnostic Tools The characteristic behaviors of autism spectrum disorders may or may not be apparent in infancy (18 to 24 months), but usually become obvious during early childhood (24 months to 6 years). The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) lists these five behaviors that signal further evaluation is warranted: Does not babble or coo by 12 months Does not gesture (point, wave, grasp) by 12 months Does not say single words by 16 months Does not say two-word phrases on his or her own by 24 months Has any loss of any language or social skill at any age Having any of these five red flags does not mean a child has autism, but because the characteristics of the disorder vary so much, a child should have further evaluations by a multidisciplinary team that may include a neurologist, psychologist, developmental pediatrician, speech/language therapist, learning consultant, or other professionals knowledgeable about autism. While there is no one behavioral or communications test that can detect autism, several screening instruments have been developed that are now used in diagnosing autism. CARS rating system (Childhood Autism Rating Scale), developed by Eric Schopler in the early 1970s, is based on observed behavior. Using a 15-point scale, professionals evaluate a child's relationship to people, body use, adaptation to change, listening response, and verbal communication. The Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) is used to screen for autism at 18 months of age. It was developed by Simon Baron-Cohen in the early 1990s to see if autism could be detected in children as young as 18 months. The screening tool uses a short questionnaire with two sections, one prepared by the parents, the other by the child's family doctor or pediatrician. The Autism Screening Questionnaire is a 40 item screening scale that has been used with children four and older to help evaluate communication skills and social functioning. The Screening Test for Autism in Two-Year Olds, being developed by Wendy Stone at Vanderbilt, uses direct observations to study behavioral features in children under two. She has identified three skills areas - play, motor imitation, and joint attention - that seem to indicate autism.

Autism FAQ What is Autism? Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life. The result of a neurological disorder that affects the functioning of the brain, autism and its associated behaviors have been estimated to occur in as many as 2 to 6 in 1,000 individuals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2001). Autism is four times more prevalent in boys than girls and knows no racial, ethnic, or social boundaries. Family income, lifestyle, and educational levels do not affect the chance of autism's occurrence. Autism impacts the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Children and adults with autism typically have difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. The disorder makes it hard for them to communicate with others and relate to the outside world. In some cases, aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior may be present. Persons with autism may exhibit repeated body movements (hand flapping, rocking), unusual responses to people or attachments to objects and resistance to changes in routines. Individuals may also experience sensitivities in the five senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. It is estimated that some 500,000 to 1,500,000 people in the U.S. today have autism or some form of pervasive developmental disorder. Its prevalence rate makes autism one of the most common developmental disabilities. Yet most of the public, including many professionals in the medical, educational, and vocational fields, are still unaware of how autism affects people and how they can effectively work with individuals with autism. Is There More Than One Type of Autism? Several related disorders are grouped under the broad heading Pervasive Developmental Disorder or PDD-a general category of disorders which are characterized by severe and pervasive impairment in several areas of development (American Psychiatric Association 1994). A standard reference is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), a diagnostic handbook now in its fourth edition. The DSM-IV lists criteria to be met for a specific diagnosis under the category of Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Diagnosis is made when a specified number of characteristics listed in the DSM-IV are present. Diagnostic evaluations are based on the presence of specific behaviors indicated by observation and through parent consultation, and should be made by an experienced, highly trained team. Thus, when professionals or parents are referring to different types of autism, often they are distinguishing autism from one of the other pervasive developmental disorders. Individuals who fall under the Pervasive Developmental Disorder category in the DSM-IV exhibit commonalties in communication and social deficits, but differ in terms of severity. We have outlined some major points that help distinguish the differences between the specific diagnoses used: Autistic Disorder impairments in social interaction, communication, and imaginative play prior to age 3 years. Stereotyped behaviors, interests and activities. Asperger's Disorder characterized by impairments in social interactions and the presence of restricted interests and activities, with no clinically significant general delay in language, and testing in the range of average to above average intelligence. Pervasive Developmental Disorder- Not Otherwise Specified (commonly referred to as atypical autism) a diagnosis of PDD-NOS may be made when a child does not meet the criteria for a specific diagnosis, but there is a severe and pervasive impairment in specified behaviors. Rett's Disorder a progressive disorder which, to date, has occurred only in girls. Period of normal development and then loss of previously acquired skills, loss of purposeful use of the hands replaced with repetitive hand movements beginning at the age of 1-4 years. Childhood Disintegrative Disorder characterized by normal development for at least the first 2 years, significant loss of previously acquired skills. (American Psychiatric Association 1994) Autism is a spectrum disorder. In other words, the symptoms and characteristics of autism can present themselves in a wide variety of combinations, from mild to severe. Although autism is defined by a certain set of behaviors, children and adults can exhibit any combination of the behaviors in any degree of severity. Two children, both with the same diagnosis, can act very differently from one another and have varying skills. Therefore, there is no standard type or typical person with autism. Parents may hear different terms used to describe children within this spectrum, such as: autistic-like, autistic tendencies, autism spectrum, high-functioning or low-functioning autism, more-abled or less-abled. More important to understand is, whatever the diagnosis, children can learn and function productively and show gains from appropriate education and treatment. The Autism Society of America provides information to serve the needs of all individuals within the spectrum. Diagnostic categories have changed over the years as research progresses and as new editions of the DSM have been issued. For that reason, we will use the term autism to refer to the above disorders. What Causes Autism? Researchers from all over the world are devoting considerable time and energy into finding the answer to this critical question. Medical researchers are exploring different explanations for the various forms of autism. Although a single specific cause of autism is not known, current research links autism to biological or neurological differences in the brain. In many families there appears to be a pattern of autism or related disabilities - which suggests there is a genetic basis to the disorder - although at this time no gene has been directly linked to autism. The genetic basis is believed by researchers to be highly complex, probably involving several genes in combination. Several outdated theories about the cause of autism have been proven to be false. Autism is not a mental illness. Children with autism are not unruly kids who choose not to behave. Autism is not caused by bad parenting. Furthermore, no known psychological factors in the development of the child have been shown to cause autism. How is Autism Diagnosed? There are no medical tests for diagnosing autism. An accurate diagnosis must be based on observation of the individual's communication, behavior, and developmental levels. However, because many of the behaviors associated with autism are shared by other disorders, various medical tests may be ordered to rule out or identify other possible causes of the symptoms being exhibited. Since the characteristics of the disorder vary so much, ideally a child should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team which may include a neurologist, psychologist, developmental pediatrician, speech/language therapist, learning consultant, or another professional knowledgeable about autism. Diagnosis is difficult for a practitioner with limited training or exposure to autism. Sometimes, autism has been misdiagnosed by well-meaning professionals. Difficulties in the recognition and acknowledgment of autism often lead to a lack of services to meet the complex needs of individuals with autism. A brief observation in a single setting cannot present a true picture of an individual's abilities and behaviors. Parental (and other caregivers') input and developmental history are very important components of making an accurate diagnosis. At first glance, some persons with autism may appear to have mental retardation, a behavior disorder, problems with hearing, or even odd and eccentric behavior. To complicate matters further, these conditions can co-occur with autism. However, it is important to distinguish autism from other conditions, since an accurate diagnosis and early identification can provide the basis for building an appropriate and effective educational and treatment program. Sometimes professionals who are not knowledgeable about the needs and opportunities for early intervention in autism do not offer an autism diagnosis even if it is appropriate. This hesitation may be due to a misguided wish to spare the family. Unfortunately, this too can lead to failure to obtain appropriate services for the child. What are common symptoms of Autism? Children within the pervasive developmental disorder spectrum often appear relatively normal in their development until the age of 24-30 months, when parents may notice delays in language, play or social interaction. Any of the following delays, by themselves, would not result in a diagnosis of a pervasive developmental disorder. Autism is a combination of several developmental challenges. The following areas are among those that may be affected by autism: Communication: Language develops slowly or not at all; uses words without attaching the usual meaning to them; communicates with gestures instead of words; short attention span; Social Interaction: Spends time alone rather than with others; shows little interest in making friends; less responsive to social cues such as eye contact or smiles; Sensory Impairment: May have sensitivities in the areas of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste to a greater or lesser degree; Play: Lack of spontaneous or imaginative play; does not imitate others' actions; does not initiate pretend games; Behaviors: May be overactive or very passive; throws tantrums for no apparent reason; perseverates (shows an obsessive interest in a single item, idea, activity or person); apparent lack of common sense; may show aggression to others or self; often has difficulty with changes in routine. Some individuals with autism may also have other disorders which affect the functioning of the brain such as: Epilepsy, Mental Retardation, Down Syndrome, or genetic disorders such as: Fragile X Syndrome, Landau-Kleffner Syndrome, William's Syndrome or Tourette's Syndrome. Many of those diagnosed with autism will test in the range of mental retardation. Approximately 25-30 percent may develop a seizure pattern at some period during life. Every person with autism is an individual, and like all individuals, has a unique personality and combination of characteristics. There are great differences among people with autism. Some individuals mildly affected may exhibit only slight delays in language and greater challenges with social interactions. The person may have difficulty initiating and/or maintaining a conversation, or keeping a conversation going. Communication is often described as talking at others (for example, monologue on a favorite subject that continues despite attempts of others to interject comments). People with autism process and respond to information in unique ways. Educators and other service providers must consider the unique pattern of learning strengths and difficulties in the individual with autism when assessing learning and behavior to ensure effective intervention. Individuals with autism can learn when information about their unique styles of receiving and expressing information is addressed and implemented in their programs. The abilities of an individual with autism may fluctuate from day to day due to difficulties in concentration, processing, or anxiety. The child may show evidence of learning one day, but not the next. Changes in external stimuli and anxiety can affect learning. They may have average or above average verbal, memory or spatial skills but find it difficult to be imaginative or join in activities with others. Individuals with more severe challenges may require intensive support to manage the basic tasks and needs of living day to day. Contrary to popular understanding, many children and adults with autism may make eye contact, show affection, smile and laugh, and demonstrate a variety of other emotions, although in varying degrees. Like other children, they respond to their environment in both positive and negative ways. Autism may affect their range of responses and make it more difficult to control how their bodies and minds react. Sometimes visual, motor, and/or processing problems make it difficult to maintain eye contact with others. Some individuals with autism use peripheral vision rather than looking directly at others. Sometimes the touch or closeness of others may be painful to a person with autism, resulting in withdrawal even from family members. Anxiety, fear and confusion may result from being unable to make sense of the world in a routine way. With appropriate treatment, some behaviors associated with autism may change or diminish over time. The communication and social deficits continue in some form throughout life, but difficulties in other areas may fade or change with age, education, or level of stress. Often, the person begins to use skills in natural situations and to participate in a broader range of interests and activities. Many individuals with autism enjoy their lives and contribute to their community in a meaningful way. People with autism can learn to compensate for and cope with their disability, often quite well. While no one can predict the future, it is known that some adults with autism live and work independently in the community (drive a car, earn a college degree, get married); some may be fairly independent in the community and only need some support for daily pressures; while others depend on much support from family and professionals. Adults with autism can benefit from vocational training to provide them with the skills needed for obtaining jobs, in addition to social and recreational programs. Adults with autism may live in a variety of residential settings, ranging from an independent home or apartment to group homes, supervised apartment settings, living with other family members or more structured residential care. An increasing number of support groups for adults with autism are emerging around the country. Many self-advocates are forming networks to share information, support each other, and speak for themselves in the public arena. More frequently, people with autism are attending and/or speaking at conferences and workshops on autism. Individuals with autism are providing valuable insight into the challenges of this disability by publishing articles and books and appearing in television specials about themselves and their disabilities. What are the Most Effective Approaches? Evidence shows that early intervention results in dramatically positive outcomes for young children with autism. While various pre-school models emphasize different program components, all share an emphasis on early, appropriate, and intensive educational interventions for young children. Other common factors may be: some degree of inclusion, mostly behaviorally-based interventions, programs which build on the interests of the child, extensive use of visuals to accompany instruction, highly structured schedule of activities, parent and staff training, transition planning and follow-up. Because of the spectrum nature of autism and the many behavior combinations which can occur, no one approach is effective in alleviating symptoms of autism in all cases. Various types of therapies are available, including (but not limited to) applied behavior analysis, auditory integration training, dietary interventions, discrete trial teaching, medications, music therapy, occupational therapy, PECS, physical therapy, sensory integration, speech/language therapy, TEACH, and vision therapy. Studies show that individuals with autism respond well to a highly structured, specialized education program, tailored to their individual needs. A well designed intervention approach may include some elements of communication therapy, social skill development, sensory integration therapy and applied behavior analysis, delivered by trained professionals in a consistent, comprehensive and coordinated manner. The more severe challenges of some children with autism may be best addressed by a structured education and behavior program which contains a one-on-one teacher to student ratio or small group environment. However, many other children with autism may be successful in a fully inclusive general education environment with appropriate support. In addition to appropriate educational supports in the area of academics, students with autism should have training in functional living skills at the earliest possible age. Learning to cross a street safely, to make a simple purchase or to ask assistance when needed are critical skills, and may be difficult, even for those with average intelligence levels. Tasks that enhance the person's independence and give more opportunity for personal choice and freedom in the community are important. To be effective, any approach should be flexible in nature, rely on positive reinforcement, be re-evaluated on a regular basis and provide a smooth transition from home to school to community environments. A good program will also incorporate training and support systems for parents and caregivers, with generalization of skills to all settings. Rarely can a family, classroom teacher or other caregiver provide effective habilitation for a person with autism unless offered consultation or in-service training by an experienced specialist who is knowledgeable about the disability. A generation ago, the vast majority of the people with autism were eventually placed in institutions. Professionals were much less educated about autism than they are today; autism specific supports and services were largely non-existent. Today the picture is brighter. With appropriate services, training, and information, most families are able to support their son or daughter at home. Group homes, assisted apartment living arrangements, or residential facilities offer more options for out of home support. Autism-specific programs and services provide the opportunity for individuals to be taught skills which allow them to reach their fullest potential. Families of people with autism can experience high levels of stress. As a result of the challenging behaviors of their children, relationships with service providers, attempting to secure appropriate services, resulting financial hardships, or very busy schedules, families often have difficulty participating in typical community activities. This results in isolation and difficulty in developing needed community supports. Members of the ASA represent all walks of life from rural to metropolitan communities. Embracing the diversity of our group, the ASA seeks to provide an open forum for the exchange of ideas. At the very core of the ASA philosophy is the belief that no single program or treatment will benefit all individuals with autism. Furthermore, the recommendation of what is best or most effective for a person with autism should be determined by those people directly involved with the individual with autism, to the extent possible, and the parents or family members. The ASA provides information to assist parents, educators, and others in the decision-making process. Providing information on available intervention options, rather than advocating for any particular theory or philosophy, is the focus at the ASA. Is There a Cure? Understanding of autism has grown tremendously since it was first described by Dr. Leo Kanner in 1943. Some of the earlier searches for cures now seem unrealistic in terms of today's understanding of brain-based disorders. To cure means to restore to health, soundness, or normality. In the medical sense, there is no cure for the differences in the brain which result in autism. However, better understanding of the disorder has led to the development of better coping mechanisms and strategies for the various manifestations of the disability. Some of these symptoms may lessen as the child ages; others may disappear altogether. With appropriate intervention, many of the associated behaviors can be positively changed, even to the point in some cases, that the child or adult may appear to the untrained person to no longer have autism. The majority of children and adults will, however, continue to exhibit some manifestations of autism to some degree throughout their entire lives. What is the Autism Society of America? Founded in 1965 by a small group of parents, the Autism Society of America (ASA) continues to be the leading source of information and referral on autism and the largest collective voice representing the autism community for more than 33 years. Today, more than 24,000 members are connected through a volunteer network of over 200 chapters across the United States. The mission of the Autism Society of America is to promote lifelong access and opportunities for persons within the autism spectrum and their families, to be fully included, participating members of their communities through advocacy, public awareness, education, and research related to autism. In addition to its volunteer Board of Directors, composed primarily of parents of individuals with autism, the ASA has a Panel of Professional Advisors, comprised of nationally known and respected professionals who provide expertise and guidance to the Society on a volunteer basis. The ASA is dedicated to increasing public awareness about autism and the day-to-day issues faced by individuals with autism, their families, and the professionals with whom they interact. The Society and its chapters share common goals of providing information and education, supporting research, and advocating for programs and services for the autism community. Myths of Autism? MYTH!

Its prevalence rate makes it the second most common developmental disability-even more common than Down Syndrome. By conservative estimate, more than 400,000 people in the U.S. today have some form of autism. In North Carolina, between 25,000 and 30,000 individuals have been diagnosed with the condition. It is a lifelong disability with no known cure at this time. The symptoms of autism tend to appear very early in life, usually within the first three years. In general, these include: Significant problems in language development Significant problems with understanding and engaging in social interactions Inconsistent sensory response patterns-for instance, periods when hearing appears to function normally and periods of apparent deafness Uneven pattern of intellectual development Significant, highly-focused restriction of interests and activities The symptoms and characteristics of autism can present themselves in a variety of combinations and with a range of severity from mild to severe, so two children with the same diagnosis of autism can act very differently from one another and have very different skills, abilities and functioning levels.

Autism is a disorder that severely impairs a person's ability to communicate, interact socially, and think. Autism also impairs many processes throughout the body. It affects the brain and central nervous system, and a growing body of research indicates that the immune system, the gastro-intestinal tract and other bodily systems may also be affected. Some children seem to have autism from birth. Another group appears to develop normally up to sometime between 12 to 36 months and then lose abilities such as language and social skills. People with autism have great difficulty learning from the natural environment as most people do. A child with autism frequently shows little interest in the world or people around them. Many children with autism never learn to talk. Autism inhibits a child's growth and development to such a degree that a large portion of people with the disorder require lifelong support. Autism is diagnosed by the observation of commonly found symptoms, not by a blood test or other objective medical technique. And the number and severity of symptoms range greatly from person to person. Consequently, autism is consider a spectrum disorder with subgroups including Asperger\ufffds syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Delay-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) among others. How common is autism?Autism is an out-of-control epidemic growing at a rate of about 20% per year. Twenty-five years ago autism was an extremely rare condition--now it is the leading disabling disease of children in the United States. Twenty-five years ago autism afflicted 1 in 5,000 children, now 1 in 150 has it. Recent studies have shown autism spectrum disorders affecting as many as one in fifty boys in some regions. What causes autism?Autism is a list of symptoms rather than a biologically identifiable disease and a number medical conditions are know to cause autism including of tuberous sclerosis, and two genetic disorders are known to cause autistic symptoms , Rett\ufffds syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. In utero exposure to thalidomide is also known to cause autistic symptoms. However, these causes cannot explain the vast majority of cases. Up until the 1970s the prevailing accepted theory blamed autism on bad mothering. Fortunately, this scientifically invalid theory was completely discredited through the efforts of the parents of autistic children. A great deal of research has been done on the possibility that autism is a genetically determined disorder due to the high proportion of identical twins who both have autism, and the tendency of autism to affect multiple members of the same families. Despite the effort no gene has yet been identified as a reliable predictor of autism. And the growing incidence of autism argues against a genetic cause. Many researchers believe that the evidence indicates that genetically-susceptible children acquire autism through early exposure to some insult from the environment such as viruses, heavy metals, or possibly even vaccines. Is there a cure?There is no known wonder drug or treatment that can cure reliably cure autism. There are a wide variety of treatments and methods that have relieved some of the symptoms in some autism victims. Some people with autism can improve to the extent that they can attend ordinary schools, hold jobs and have relatively normal social lives. Some of the medical interventions that have helped some people with autism include: Intensive early educational intervention Physical therapy Occupational therapy Sensory integration therapy Speech therapy Chelation therapy Gluten/Casein-free diets Applied behavior Omega fatty acids Psychotropic drugs This list should not be construed as an endorsement of any particular therapy by Autism United but as an illustrative list of therapies that some parents have reported as efficacious. genetic brain genetic fragile x syndrome United States PDD-NOS Pervasive Developmental Delay-Not Otherwise Specified Physical therapy Occupational Anti-fungal Psychotropic applied behavior analysis occupational therapy physical therapy Autism468 null But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case.The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court.The parents presented expert witnesses who argued mercury can have a variety of effects on the brain, but the ruling said none of them offered opinions on the cause of autism in the three specific cases argued. They testified that mercury can affect a number of biological processes, including abnormal metabolism in children.Special master Denise K. Vowell noted that in order to succeed in their action, the parents would have to show \"the exquisitely small amounts of mercury\" that reach the brain from vaccines can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts ... from other sources do not. The ruling said the parents were arguing that the effects from mercury in vaccines differ from mercury's known effects on the brain. Vowell concluded that the parents had failed to establish that their child's condition was caused or aggravated by mercury from vaccines.Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines.The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism.The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available.The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had \"already had its day in science court and failed to hold up.\"But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, \"it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them.\"On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. brain Congress U.S. Court of Federal Claims Denise K.

The money raised will help fund further research into autism. \"What we do in our research area is look to improve early detection of autism and research for better and more effective ways to deliver quality intervention to more people at a lower cost,\" said Dr. Christopher Smith, Vice President/Research Director for SARRC. Smith said the money raised will help fund more technology-based interventions and treatments. \"We want to do more telemedecine, which helps deliver treatments and interventions to more people,\" he said. Sanderson Ford Lincoln Mercury and Volvo, one of the presenting sponsors of the event, presented a $10,000 check to SARRC. David Kimmerle, president of Sanderson Ford Lincoln Mercury and Volvo, said he and his family have been touched by everyone at SARRC. \"We're just trying to make it easier for the families of kids affected by autism affected by the condition because they need our help,\" he said. The Arizona Diamondbacks Foundation gave $100,000 to the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center Tuesday. Other large donors during the 14-hour radiothon included Jaburg & Wilk, Attorneys at Law, $20,000, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, $15,000, and Tiffany & Bosco Law Firm, $10,000. The D-backs Foundation gave one of its three $100,000 Grand Slam grants to SARRC's Good Deed Works Training Center. It is a program created to provide teens with autism spectrum disorders training, mentoring and volunteer experiences at community venues. \"Through SARRC's new D-backs Good Deed Works program, everyone wins,\" said SARRC founder Denise Resnik. \"Our teens with autism increase their skill sets and build self-esteem, leading to greater independence. \"Peer mentors gain increased understanding and compassion for those with autism. And this year alone, 20 Valley non-profits will benefit from thousands of volunteer service hours and gain appreciation for the talents and abilities of individuals with autism.\" Parents of children with autism told stories of their children's success during the radiothon. Stephanie Papadopoulos said one of her triplets, Eleni, has autism. She said Eleni got her first friend at the age of 8 years, because of help from SARRC. Eleni's friend's mom heard Stephanie's story on the air and called in to donate. She was one of many. In the first 10 hours of the radiothon, over $270,000 was raised. The effort continues until 7 o'clock tonight. KTAR program director Russ Hill said the 14-hour radiothon is meant to \"raise awareness and funds for SARRC. \" \"Giving back is extremely important to the people who work at KTAR,\" Hill said. \"Hundreds of thousands of Valley residents tune into KTAR every day and it's important that we give back to the community. We're a part of the community and it's our way of giving back.\" Ned Foster and Connie Weber, hosts of \"Arizona's Morning News,\" and sports anchor Paul Calvisi opened the radiothon with an appeal to listeners to dig deep, even though the economy is strained, to help out. Calvisi joked with listeners that they should \"skip the right turn at Starbucks\" once a week and donate $12 a month to SARRC. SARRC is a resource for parents who have children with autism. It also funds research into autism. Scott Celley with TriWest Healthcare Alliance was among those joining the fund-raising effort. He said SARRC's reputation is known far and wide, extending to the U.S. Defense Department. The burdens of parents with partners serving overseas can be lightened by programs like SARRC has, Celley said. He said the U.S. owes military families who need help with their kids and SARRC is part of that equation. Sergio Penaloza's son was diagnosed with autism at 2 years old. He said his son struggled with his colors and speech, but with the help of SARRC's Jump Start program, the now 10-year-old is markedly improved. \"He's starting to correct himself. He's communicating at a higher level.\" Penaloza said. He said SARRC \"absolutely\" has been a part of his son's improvement. Right after his son was diagnosed, Penaloza said SARRC provided a \"roadmap\" of what resources parents have to help children with autism. Penaloza is on the Board of Directors of SAARC and his employer, Cox Communications, donated $5,000. They also matched, dollar-for-dollar, some call-in donations from listeners.

These signs all begin before a child is three years old. Autism involves many parts of the brain. How it occurs is not well understood. There is no cure for Autism. The main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Many medications are used to treat autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. More than half of U.S. children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics. The Xcell-Center Autism treatment The XCell-Center's stem cell therapy is a drug-free alternative focused on affecting physical changes in the brain that can improve an autistic child's quality of life. These improvements usually translate into improved quality of life for their parents and siblings as well. In a recent pilot study of 10 autistic patients, more than 70% of the respondents showed improvement. Autism patients are treated by lumbar puncture; injecting the stem cells into the cerebrospinal fluid which transports them up the spinal canal and into the brain. Lumbar puncture is an outpatient procedure that requires patients to stay in Germany 4 or 5 nights. Bone Marrow Collection On the first day, bone marrow is collected from the patient's iliac crest (hip bone) using thin-needle mini-puncture under general anesthesia. The entire procedure normally takes about 30 minutes. Because the bone marrow collection procedure requires patients to sit still, it is performed under general anesthesia for children and older patients who for any reason cannot keep still. Once the bone marrow collection is complete, patients may return to their hotel and go about normal activities after a short recovery period in the clinic. More detailed information on the bone marrow collection procedure is available in the Bone Marrow Informed Consent document (PDF file). Laboratory Processing The next day, the stem cells are processed from the bone marrow in a state-of-the-art, government approved (cGMP) laboratory. In the lab, both the quantity and quality of the stem cells are measured. These cells have the potential to transform into multiple types of cells and are capable of regenerating or repairing damaged tissue. Stem Cell Implantation On the third day, the stem cells are implanted back into the patient by lumbar puncture. Lumbar Puncture A spinal needle is inserted between L4 and L5 vertebrae and a small amount of spinal fluid is removed. A portion of that spinal fluid is mixed with the stem cell solution which is then injected into back into the patient's spinal fluid, not the spinal cord. After the stem cells have been implanted, the patient will lie down in the recovery room for a few hours before returning to his or her hotel room. The lumbar puncture procedure is performed under general anesthesia for children and older patients who cannot sit still. Following Treatment Patients who are treated by lumbar puncture are required to stay in town on the day after their procedure for general safety purposes. They may return home on the fifth day. Treatment Results Follow-up statistics from 7 treated autism patients completed in September 2009 show that over 70% (5 of 7) experienced improvements after stem cell therapy. The mean age of the patients was 10 years, while the median age was 9.5 years. The oldest treated patient was 16 years of age and the youngest 5. There was no apparent correlation between positive outcome and the number of stem cells administered. Overall, patients reported improvements in cognition, language, social contact, eye contact, coordination, motor skills and awareness Below is a summary of results for 4 of the 5 patients who improved after treatment: Patient #1 - (M) Age 6 - Treated May 2009 Improved cognition and sensory processing Patient can now climb onto the trampoline by himself, and play on it for about 20 minutes. Before the treatment, he screamed when the parents put him onto the trampoline. Improved attention span - He watched TV for 30 minutes. Prior to stem cell transplantation, his attention span was a few seconds to no longer than a minute. Meaningless play has reduced The above improvements were confirmed by the patient's doctor Patient #2 - (M) Age 6 - Treated June 2009 Hand and finger motor skill improvement Improved handwriting Improved speech Eating more independently Can now ride a bicycle without fear Improved ability to socialize with others Improved cognition Patient #3 - (F) Age 16 - Treated July 2009 Improved motor skills and coordination More confident Calmer at school Grades have improved - especially math Patient #4 - (F) Age 11 - Treated January 2009 Better behaved Decreased hyperactivity Less insomnia - patient can now sleep through the night Improved attention span Less frustrated For safety information on 870 patients treated by lumbar puncture, please view our Lumbar Puncture Safety Statistics (PDF file).

Jacobson, Ph.D., BCBA One of the questions heard often in the field of developmental disabilities today is, What causes autism spectrum disorders (ASD)? Questions of cause are very difficult questions to address with full candor and confidence, not only in the case of autism spectrum disorders, but also in other conditions for which diagnosis is made based primarily on behavior. For example, some individuals speculate or assert that biological and/or toxic agents in the MMR vaccination cause autism. This article will focus upon that controversy to explore the complexities of cause and effect. The scientific method is a process by which researchers seek to answer a variety of questions. Some of these questions do not involve causes, while others do. For example, neurological or neuroscientific studies may attempt to determine differences typically present in the structure or neurochemical features of the brains of children with ASD, compared to the brains of same-aged children without diagnosed disabilities. In other words, the question posed is not what causes autism, but rather what differences exist in autistic versus non-autistic brains. On the other hand, some studies do attempt to identify causes such as causes of a disability. To do so, certain tasks must already have been accomplished. For example, the disability must be well-defined. The decision that the disability is present and that the disability is not present must be accurate. The group that is defined as having the disability must be as homogeneous as possible. That means, for example, researchers should consider the question of what causes autism separately from the question of what causes PDD or Asperger syndrome. This is not to suggest that autism, PDD and Asperger s are not a spectrum as typically thought, but rather that the question what causes autism? is a much more specific question than what causes autism spectrum disorders. There is also the consideration that, because the diagnosis of autism and other ASDs is based on breadth and severity of effects, logically, differences in brain structure or other features should be more apparent for these children. Assuming that we can accurately decide whether children have autism, and we are able to identify biological differences between these children accurately as well, we could then approach the question of cause in two ways. Taking into account possible multiple medical or neurological factors, we can conduct a detailed investigation into the backgrounds and developmental history of the children, identifying events that differ between diagnosed and non-diagnosed children. In this approach, we start with a group of children who are identified, and then look back on their histories. This is termed a retrospective study. Retroactive studies are important to conduct, but there are also challenges associated with them, including documenting that reported events occurred, reliance upon incomplete or differing clinical records, and the fact that universal screening for disabilities like autism usually does not exist, so only the children who happened to be identified and referred are included in the study. Children who are referred are likely to differ in several ways from those who are not referred, and some of these ways may be related to risk factors for autism. The preferred method for conducting a study of causes is to use a prospective approach. Prospectively, one begins by using outreach to screen a population of children for a disability, to detect instances of the disability that might not otherwise be identified, as well as those who would have been identified. Then, background and history data can be collected on a group that is more likely to actually represent children with autism or any other condition. Historical information could include vaccinations and other medical events (e.g., exposure to general anesthesia, recurrent health conditions), as well as information about child development. More ideally, a prospective study would follow children from birth, and all of the information needed to consider causes could be collected as events occur. This would assure that the information is more complete, and in a standardized form. In the case of autism, even though it is now being identified more frequently, this approach is very difficult to carry out; for each child who may develop autism, there may be from 250 to 1,000 other children who need to be screened and followed. For this reason, some researchers may attempt to use prospective approaches to study causes of autism within larger studies that look at child development in large population groups, and consider a variety of disabilities. This often means that information that is specific to risks for ASD may not be fully collected. Of course, there are other research designs that can shed light on causes of disabilities. Certainly genetic studies can indicate genetic factors that increase risk for a childhood-onset disability. Research with animals that involve brain surgery during early development that result in behavioral changes akin to those typical of a disability may also be suggestive. Basic research at the level of neurons and the effects of toxic substances and side-effects of medications may also be suggestive. But . . . there is no substitute for actually studying the occurrence of a condition among children prospectively. Why do we need scientific studies to indicate what the causes of a condition like autism might be? Why isn t it enough that some research might identify some differences between children with autism and their peers? First, some differences that are identified initially do not necessarily differentiate children with autism from those who are accurately diagnosed as not having autism. For example, research findings have suggested the unexpected presence of measles virus in the gastrointestinal tracks of children with autism, but subsequently at least one report has found this for children without autism as well. This does not mean, in and of itself, that the initial gastrointestinal findings are not possibly suggestive, but does point out the need for careful assessment of the likelihood that particular factors are plausible risk factors. In this case, scientific research needs to address why, if gastrointestinal measles is a risk factor or cause, or reflects a risk factor, some children are affected, and others are not. But, if many people develop a consensus that a given event--vaccination, for example--is regularly observed to occur shortly prior to detection of autism, is this not sufficient to warrant research on this issue? The short answer is yes whether observed by parents, clinicians, educators, or researchers, events that may be plausible causes or risk factors for a disability should reasonably be studied. Parents or others in the lives of children with disabilities may certainly detect events that are not apparent or considered by clinicians or researchers. But the fact that a belief is widely held is not, in itself, evidence that the belief is valid or accurate. The brains of human beings are structured and function in ways that are the joint product of evolution and experience. One of the well-known biases associated with human perception and thinking is the tendency to conclude that there is a cause and effect relationship between two events, when it can be shown through precise research that this is not the case. Carl Sagan, in his 1997 book, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, referred to such tendencies as irreducible human error. To err in this manner is human, but to insist that reliance on mere consensus is sufficient to accurately identify causes of events, such as the occurrence of autism, is folly. Errors of this type may be even more likely when the identification of a chain of cause and effect is especially important to the person making a judgment about cause and effect; many parents of children with autism believe that identifying the causes of autism, for their child and other children, is important. This may increase the chances that some or many may conclude that certain, unproven events are causes of the disorder, without solid evidence. However, this is a very human thing to do, and clinicians and researchers are prone to do this as well. The critical distinction that needs to be made is between correlation and causation. Correlation means that two events tend to occur together. When one does not occur, the other tends not to occur as well (called a positive correlation); or that when one occurs, the other tends not to occur (called a negative correlation). Sometimes correlations, like cause and effect, are perceived accurately, and sometimes they are not. But while necessary for showing cause and effect, correlation does not prove cause and effect. Sometimes correlation might be presumed, because of cultural factors; for example, autism is often diagnosed, by definition, at ages when children are subject to frequent vaccinations. Thus vaccinations and autism could be hypothetically correlated, despite the fact that there is no present scientific evidence that this is the case. Correlation does not in itself show causation, because the fact that two events occur together may be influenced, or caused, by a third factor that has been ignored, or that was not studied. Causation, on the other hand, requires a higher standard of proof than the fact that two events occur together (that is, have a positive correlation). Proving causation, or that an event is a risk factor for a disability, requires that several conditions be met: (1) the purported cause has to consistently or always occur before the purported effect; (2) when the purported cause occurs, the effect regularly occurs; and (3) when the purported cause does not occur, the effect tends not to occur, is less likely to occur than it does generally, or does not occur at all. Other criteria associated with the strengths of prospective studies also need to be met; for example, that the group of people studied is representative of the larger group of people with the condition (in this case, all children with autism or all children with ASD). This can be done by including all children in a general population with the condition, or by randomly sampling the children with the condition. But, if sampling is used, there also must be a sufficient number of children to generalize to the larger group of children, and the required number to do so increases as the complexity and range of issues under study increases. Where do we stand today in understanding the causes of autism? It is fair to say that researchers are developing a more complete understanding of the neurological factors associated with autism, but some degree of modesty is also appropriate with respect to the predictions that can be made or confidence with which particular neurological findings can be said to characterize autism. Many neuroscientific studies focus on specific aspects of the brain. Therefore, different aspects of the brain have been studied in different samples; there is seldom concrete evidence that these samples are very much alike, or that they represent a larger group of children with autism. This points out the need for independent researchers to conduct studies with other samples, to verify that the findings with one sample also apply to others. In addition, many neuroscientific studies include small numbers of subjects. As a result, such studies are not able to detect relatively subtle but consistent differences that may exist between individuals who have autism and those who do not, and the studies may not be representative of children with autism more generally. Advances in research design, including identification of subjects with better measures, are addressing these limitations. Neuroscientific knowledge about autism is steadily advancing, but there are, nonetheless, considerations that affect the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn today. One must also consider that the group of children diagnosed with autism is heterogeneous: some also have diagnoses of mental retardation, while others don t; some have seizure disorders, while others don t; some manifested regression or loss of attained skills, while others did not. Although there is a strong (and warranted) presumption that genetic factors play a strong role in the occurrence of autism, the heterogeneity of children with the condition and current research findings suggest that the relevant genetic factors are complex and multiple in nature. At this point one may reasonably argue that the behavioral condition of autism and ASD are final common pathways, or results, of differing genetic factors that there is no single genetic factor that accounts for occurrence of the condition. Events prior to birth have also been implicated by neuroscientific studies. It may also be that in some cases, environmental events, such as reactions to toxins, may play a role. It may be that all of these factors, and others, are involved as risks or causes. The Scientific Method Observe and describe a phenomenon or group of phenomena. Formulate a hypothesis to explain the phenomena. Use the hypothesis to predict the existence of other phenomena, or to quantitatively predict the results of new observations. Perform experimental tests of the predictions. Modify the hypothesis based upon the test results. Repeat steps 4 and 5. Replicate the tests by several independent experimenters and properly performed experiments.

(25) carried out a series of chiropractic adjustments on 26 autistic children over a 9-month period. Twelve were found to have a left atlas laterality and 14 had a right atlas laterality. Outcomes from the study were varied but included normalization of deep tendon reflexes and dermatomal subjective sensation, increased cervical range of motion and reduction of other health problems. Many of the children were taken off Ritalin, bladder and bowel control improved, some children started to speak and eye contact and attention span also improved in some children. Hyperactivity and aggressive behaviour were reduced in other children and five children were able to attend mainstream classes at school for the first time. Behavioural data, recorded by the teachers and parents, showed significant improvements in most cases.

Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life and is the result of a neurological disorder that affects the normal functioning of the brain, impacting development in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Both children and adults with autism typically show difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. Autism is a spectrum disorder and it affects each individual differently and at varying degrees.40 What are the most common characteristics of autism? Every person with autism is an individual, and like all individuals, has a unique personality and combination of characteristics. Some individuals mildly affected may exhibit only slight delays in language and greater challenges with social interactions. They may have difficulty initiating and/or maintaining a conversation. Their communication is often described as talking at others instead of to them. (For example, a monologue on a favorite subject that continues despite attempts by others to interject comments).41 People with autism also process and respond to information in unique ways. In some cases, aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior may be present. Persons with autism may also exhibit some of the following traits: Insistence on sameness; resistance to change Difficulty in expressing needs, using gestures or pointing instead of words Repeating words or phrases in place of normal, responsive language Laughing (and/or crying) for no apparent reason; showing distress for reasons not apparent to other Preference to being alone; aloof manner Tantrums Difficulty in mixing with others Not wanting to cuddle or be cuddled Little or no eye contact Unresponsive to normal teaching methods Sustained odd play Spinning objects Obsessive attachment to objects Apparent over-sensitivity or under-sensitivity to pain No real fears of danger Noticeable physical over-activity or extreme under-activity Uneven gross/fine motor skills Non-responsive to verbal cues; acts as if deaf, although hearing tests in normal range What is the difference between autism and PDD? The term \"PDD\" is widely used by professionals to refer to children with autism and related disorders; however, there is a great deal of disagreement and confusion among professionals concerning the PDD label. Diagnosis of PDD, including autism or any other developmental disability, is based upon the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC, 1994), and is the main diagnostic reference of mental health professionals in the United States. According to the DSM-IV, the term \"PDD\" is not a specific diagnosis, but an umbrella term under which the specific diagnoses are defined.42 What does it mean to be \ufffdon the spectrum\ufffd? Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means it manifests itself in many different forms. A diagnosis can range from mild to severe, and though children who have it (i.e. are on the spectrum) are likely to exhibit similar traits, they're also as individual as the colors of a rainbow, each one managing a grab bag of symptoms. While one child may rarely speak and have difficulty learning how to read and write, another can be so high-functioning he's able to attend classes in a mainstream school. Yet another child may be so sensitive to the feel of fabric that all tags must be cut off before he wears a piece of clothing, while his friend who's also autistic may not have any sensory issues at all.43 How common is autism? According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects as many as 1 in every 150 children in the United States. Therefore, it is estimated that 1.5 million Americans may be affected with autism. Also, government statistics suggest the rate of autism is rising 10-17 percent annually. Unfortunately, the numbers appear to be continuing their upward climb. In fact, it is the most prevalent developmental disorder to date; according to the Centers for Disease Control, of the approximately 4 million babies born every year, 24,000 of them will eventually be identified as autistic. Also, recent studies suggest boys are more susceptible than girls to developing autism. In the United States alone, 1 out of 94 boys are suspected of being on the spectrum, with perhaps more going undiagnosed to this day. That said, girls appear to manifest a more severe form of the disorder than their male counterparts.44 How did my child develop autism? No one knows for sure. Though it's understandable to expect that a disorder as common as autism would have a known cause, in many ways it's still quite mysterious. Recent studies suggest a strong genetic basis for autism -- up to 20 sets of genes may play a part in its development. Genetics alone, however, can't account for all the cases, and so scientists are also looking into possible environmental origins, as well as other triggers.45 What causes autism? The simple answer is we don\ufffdt know. The vast majority of cases of autism are idiopathic, which means the cause is unknown. The more complex answer is that just as there are different levels of severity and combinations of symptoms in autism, there are probably multiple causes. The best scientific evidence available to us today points toward a potential for various combinations of factors causing autism \ufffd multiple genetic components that may cause autism on their own or possibly when combined with exposure to as yet undetermined environmental factors. Timing of exposure during the child\ufffds development (before, during or after birth) may also play a role in the development or final presentation of the disorder. A small number of cases can be linked to genetic disorders such as Fragile X, Tuberous Sclerosis, and Angelman\ufffds Syndrome, as well as exposure to environmental agents such as infectious ones ( maternal rubella or cytomegalovirus) or chemical ones ( thalidomide or valproate) during pregnancy. There is a growing interest among researchers about the role of the functions and regulation of the immune system, both within the body and the brain, in autism. Piecemeal evidence over the past 30 years suggests that people with autism may involve inflammation in the central nervous system. There is also emerging evidence from animal studies that illustrates how the immune system can influence behaviors related to autism.46 Are vaccines to blame? Though the debate over the role that vaccines play in causing autism grows more heated every day, researchers have still not found a definitive link between the two. According to organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization, there's just not enough evidence to support the contention that vaccines \ufffd specifically thimerosal-containing vaccines \ufffd cause children to develop autism. One study published in the medical journal Lancet faulting the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot has since been questioned by its own authors, and many others have also failed to pass scientific muster. Still, the accusations continue, largely from parents of children on the spectrum, and it's easy to understand why: There are still no answers to this day about what's causing a disorder that appears to steadily be expanding its reach.47 Is there a cure for autism? Unfortunately, experts have been unable thus far to come up with a cure for autism. Many treatments and therapies have surfaced since the disorder has grown more visible in the mainstream press, but reputable doctors have yet to agree on any that will reverse the diagnosis. But there's hope: Scientists are hard at work every day finding a solution for this growing problem. While advocacy groups have said for years that lack of funding for research is to blame for the dearth of definitive answers, a bill known as the Combating Autism Act, which would funnel millions of dollars to developing a cure, was passed through Congress and signed by the President ensuring that $162 million has been appropriated to fund autism research, services and treatment. Until such cure is discovered, parents have been relying on early intervention programs such as applied behavior analysis, or ABA, and play therapy to mitigate the behaviors associated with autism. For some, these treatments have proven to be very successful, helping kids on the spectrum lead a full and active life.48 How can I tell if a child has autism? No two children with autism are alike, but here are some signs that many of them share and that experts agree may be as recognizable as early as the toddler years, or even sooner. Children on the spectrum generally have difficulty relating to others; they may hardly speak, and if they do, they may not communicate in ways that other people can easily understand (they may screech loudly when they're upset, for example, instead of crying). They don't usually sustain eye contact \ufffd it's too intense -- and have trouble reading social cues. They're also prone to repetitive behaviors, flapping their hands constantly or uttering the same phrase over and over again. They may also be more sensitive than typically developing children, or dramatically less so, to sights, sounds and touch.49 What should I do if I suspect something is wrong with my child? Don't wait \ufffd talk to your doctor about getting child screened for autism. New research shows that children as young as one may exhibit signs of autism, so recognizing early signs and knowing developmental milestones is important. Early intervention is key.50 How do I get my child the help he needs? You can start by making sure he has a reputable healthcare team by his side. That means finding doctors, therapists, psychologists and teachers who understand and have experience with autism and can respond to his shifting needs appropriately. Ask your child's pediatrician to recommend a developmental pediatrician with whom you can consult about the next step. She, in turn, can guide you toward various intervention programs and suggest complementary therapies. It also helps to plug into an already existing network of parents facing the same challenges as you.51 How do I deal with this diagnosis? First, be kind to yourself. It's not easy to recover from the shock of learning your child has a developmental disorder that has no known cause or cure. Accept any and all feelings the diagnosis may elicit, and try not to blame yourself: It would've been impossible for you to figure out a way to shield your child from autism completely. The next step is to arm yourself with all the facts about the disorder. Knowledge is power, and the more you know, the more capable you'll feel about navigating the daunting autism gauntlet. That said, it's also important to give yourself a \ufffdbreak\ufffd from autism when it becomes too overwhelming. And if you find that the diagnosis has been so crippling that you've been unable to get past it, consider talking to a counselor or therapist. You can't \ufffd and aren't expected to \ufffd weather this storm alone.52 Will my child be able to attend school? Most likely yes. Much depends on where your child falls on the spectrum, but with your support, as well as that of doctors, therapists and teachers, your child should be able to attend school. In fact, it's his right: According to the Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1990, which mentions autistic children specifically, your child deserves access to a \ufffdfree and appropriate\ufffd education funded by the government, whether it be in a mainstream or special education classroom.53 What is Asperger's Syndrome? What distinguishes Asperger's Syndrome from autism is the severity of the symptoms and the absence of language delays. Children with Asperger's may be only mildly affected and frequently have good language and cognitive skills. To the untrained observer, a child with Asperger's may seem just like a normal child behaving differently. They may be socially awkward, not understanding of conventional social rules, or show a lack of empathy. They may make limited eye contact, seem to be unengaged in a conversation, and not understand the use of gestures. One of the major differences between Asperger's Syndrome and autism is that, by definition, there is no speech delay in Asperger's. In fact, children with Asperger's frequently have good language skills; they simply use language in different ways. Speech patterns may be unusual, lack inflection, or have a rhythmic nature or it may be formal, but too loud or high pitched. Children with Asperger's may not understand the subtleties of language, such as irony and humor, or they may not recognize the give-and-take nature of a conversation. Another distinction between Asperger's Syndrome and autism concerns cognitive ability. While some individuals with autism experience mental retardation, by definition a person with Asperger's cannot possess a \"clinically significant\" cognitive delay, and most possess average to above-average intelligence.54 Why is early intervention so important? Early intervention is defined as services delivered to children from birth to age 3, and research shows that it has a dramatic impact on reducing the symptoms of autism spectrum disorders. Studies in early childhood development have shown that the youngest brains are the most flexible. In autism, we see that intensive early intervention yields a tremendous amount of progress in children by the time they enter kindergarten, often reducing the need for intensive supports.55 What should we know about our younger or future children? Although autism is believed to have a strong environmental component, there is little doubt that autism is a disorder with a strong genetic basis. If you are expecting another child, or have plans to expand your family in the future, you may be concerned about the development of any younger siblings of your child with autism. Studies have estimated that families affected with one child with autism have roughly a 5-10% percent chance of having a second child with autism. This risk increases if two or more children in the family are already affected. More recent evidence suggests that early signs of autism may be seen in some children as young as 8-10 months of age. For example, infants who later develop autism may be more passive, are more difficult to soothe, or fail to orient when their name is called. Some of these early signs may be noticed by parents, others may only be observed with the help of a trained clinician.56 pointing genetic brain genetic Americans sensitivity eye contact mental retardation PDD social interaction United States ABA Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders American Psychiatric Association Centers for Disease Control Congress cognitive tantrums Tuberous Sclerosis DSM-IV Washington DC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Asperger American Academy of Pediatrics World Health Organization Lancet Fourth Edition Angelman\ufffds Syndrome Combating Autism Act Disabilities Act applied behavior analysis aba diagnoses Autism477 null Bipolar Kids - Helping your child find calm in the mood storm.

While there is disagreement about the magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors, researchers have found seven genes prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic. Some estimate that autism occurs in as many as one United States child in 166, however the National Institute of Mental Health gives a more conservative estimate of one in 1000. For families that already have one autistic child, the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in twenty. Although autism is about 3 to 4 times more common in boys, girls with the disorder tend to have more severe symptoms and greater cognitive impairment. Diagnosis is based on a list of psychiatric criteria, and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used. Autism may not be physiologically obvious. A complete physical and neurological evaluation will typically be part of diagnosing autism. Some now speculate that autism is not a single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways. By definition, autism must manifest delays in \"social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play,\" with \"onset prior to age 3 years\", according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The ICD-10 also requires symptoms to be \"manifest before the age of three years.\" There have been large increases in the reported incidence of autism, for reasons that are heavily debated by researchers in psychology and related fields within the scientific community. Some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and social events, but there are no indications that a cure from autism is possible with current technology or advances in medicine. History The word autism was first used in the English language by Swiss psychiatrist Eugene Bleuler in a 1912 issue of the American Journal of Insanity. It comes from the Greek word for \"self\". Bleuler used it to describe the schizophrenic's seeming difficulty in connecting with other people. However, the classification of autism did not occur until the middle of the twentieth century, when in 1943 psychiatrist Dr. Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore reported on 11 child patients with striking behavioral similarities, and introduced the label early infantile autism. He suggested \"autism\" from the Greek 'autos', meaning \"self\", to describe the fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people. Although Kanner's first paper on the subject was published in a now defunct journal, The Nervous Child, almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. At the same time an Austrian scientist, Dr. Hans Asperger, made similar observations, although his name has since become attached to a different, \"higher-functioning\", form of autism known as Asperger's syndrome. However, widespread recognition of Asperger's work was delayed by World War II in Germany, and by the fact that his seminal paper wasn't translated into English for almost 50 years. The majority of his work wasn't widely read until 1997. These two conditions are today listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision 1) as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in communication skills, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior. Few clinicians today use only the DSM-IV criteria, which are based on the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones, to diagnose autism. Terminology Look up autism, autistic in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.When referring to someone diagnosed with autism, the term autistic is often used. However, the terms person with autism or person who experiences autism can be used instead. These are referred to as person-first terminology. The autistic community generally prefers the term autistic for reasons that are fairly controversial. This article uses the term autistic. Characteristics There is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the sensory system of autistics, which is quite different from the sensory system of other people, since certain stimulations can affect an autist differently than a non-autist, and the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another. Nevertheless, professionals within pediatric care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible. However, some people do not believe in treatment for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can do more harm than good. Social Development Typically, developing infants are social beings - early in life they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as non-autistic children. Children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected attachment behavior. Children with autism often also appear to lack a \"theory of mind\", the ability to see things from another person's perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's different knowledge, feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. The social alienation of autistic and Asperger's people can be so intense from childhood that many of them have imaginary friends as companionship.Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not be able to regulate their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation or self-injurious behaviours. Individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react negatively to changes in them. It is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior, self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations. Sensory System A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in sensory integration dysfunction. Children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in speech, language or motor skills; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement. One common example is an individual with autism hearing. A person with autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual. Or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people (see cocktail party effect). However, this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic person. Communication Difficulties By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is \"no.\" Speech development in people with autism takes different paths. Some remain mute throughout their lives with varying degrees of literacy; communication in other ways - images, visual clues, sign language, and typing may be far more natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the teenage years. Still, inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware. Once given appropriate accommodations, some will happily converse for hours, and can often be found in online chat rooms, discussion boards or websites and even using communication devices at autism-community social events such as Autreat. Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in. Many people with autism have a strong tonal sense, and can often understand spoken language. Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining typical conversations. The \"give and take\" of non-autistic conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in \"parallel monologue\"?taking turns expressing views and information. Just as \"neurotypicals\" (people without autism) have trouble understanding autistic body languages, vocal tones, or phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism. In particular, autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words. The body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the auditory system of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the things that can lead to problems. Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic body language, and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed or prone to self-injurious behaviors. Repetitive Behavior Patterns Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or \"stimming,\" may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine - in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route - can be extremely disturbing to them. People with autism sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about computers, movie schedules or lighthouses. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or science topics. Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine. Effects in Education Children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day. These unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student. Because they have trouble understanding people?s thoughts and feelings, they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them. They do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying. This inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught.Some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way. Because of this, many teachers create ?visual schedules? for their autistic students. This allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress. Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. Autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. They feel self-conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts. By allowing them to work with peers they can make friends, which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise. By doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom. A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child. The aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class. This allows a partially one-on-one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need. There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child?s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them. Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations by writing Social Stories can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other Cognitive Behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions. Types of Autism Autism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly dysfunctional and apparently mentally handicapped to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional (\"normal\") to the general public. In terms of both classification and therapy, autistic individuals are often divided into those with an IQ<80 referred to as having \"low-functioning autism\" (LFA), while those with IQ>80 are referred to as having \"high-functioning autism\" (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ. The terms low and high functioning are controversial and not all autistics accept these labels. Further, these two labels are not currently used or accepted in autism literature. This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA. For example, some professionals refuse to recognize autistics who can speak or write as being autistic at all, because they still think of autism as a communication disorder so severe that no speech or writing is possible. As a consequence, many \"high-functioning\" autistic persons, and autistic people with a relatively high IQ, are underdiagnosed, thus making the claim that \"autism implies retardation\" self-fulfilling. The number of people diagnosed with LFA is not rising quite as sharply as HFA, indicating that at least part of the explanation for the apparent rise is probably better diagnostics. Asperger's and Kanner's Syndrome In the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of \"[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play\", while a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome observes \"no clinically significant delay\" in these areas. While the DSM-IV does not include level of intellectual functioning in the diagnosis, the fact that those with Asperger's syndrome tend to perform better than those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that Asperger's syndrome is synonymous with \"higher-functioning autism,\" or that it is a lesser disorder than autism. Similarly, there is a popular conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning in fact have Asperger's syndrome, or that both types are merely 'geeks' with a medical label attached. The popular depiction of autism in the media has been of relatively severe cases, for example, as seen in the films Rain Man (autistic adult) and Mercury Rising (autistic child), and in turn many relatives of those who have been diagnosed in the autistic spectrum choose to speak of their loved ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism. Autism as a Spectrum Disorder Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as autistic spectrum disorders. A related continuum is Sensory Integration Dysfunction, which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our senses. Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap. There are two main manifestations of classical autism, regressive autism and early infantile autism. Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and often around 18 months. Although this causes some controversy over when the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some believe that it is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the mother's body and is transferred to the fetus. The triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the child's body. Increase in diagnoses of autism The number of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade. Statistics in graph from the National Center for Health Statistics. There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder in the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden increase. Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the M.I.N.D. Institute in California (17 October 2002), claimed that the increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are accounted for (see reference in this section below). Other researchers remain unconvinced, including Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio and cochair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Autism Expert Panel, who says, \"There is a chance we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can answer that question for sure.\" (Newsweek reference below). The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the direction of research, since a real increase would focus more attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors, while little or no real increase would focus more attention to genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little public research on the effects of in vitro fertilization on the number of incidences of autism. One of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between \"geekdom\" and autism. This is hinted, for instance, by a Wired Magazine article in 2001 entitled \"The Geek Syndrome\", which is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement. This article, many professionals assert, is just one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior - they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger's syndrome. Others assert that it is actually the medical profession which is applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled 'gifted'. See clinomorphism for further discussion of this issue. Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the pervasive developmental disorder category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a differential diagnosis.

The families said a combination vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, plus a mercury-containing thimerosal, caused the children's symptoms. More than 5,300 cases were filed by parents who believed vaccines may have caused autism in their children. Autism is a condition that affects as many as one in 110 U.S. children. The spectrum ranges from mild Asperger's Syndrome to severe mental retardation and social disability, and there is no cure or good treatment. Researchers says a new genetic test called chromosomal microarray analysis can detect abnormalities that predispose a child to autism. However, it doesn't provide all the answers. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause researchers said leaving 85 percent or more with little explanation for the disorder. Autism Speaks, an advocacy group, has said it would also not completely abandon the theory that vaccines might cause autism. The organization said it would invest \"in research to determine whether subsets of individuals might be at increased risk for developing autism symptoms following vaccination.\" But the group also said it was clear that if such a link did exist, it would be rare. \"While we have great empathy for all parents of children with autism, it is important to keep in mind that, given the present state of the science, the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement. genetic genetic U.S. mental retardation Autism Speaks National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Autism481 null Add to my webjam DIAGNOSIS AND CONSULTATION There are no medical tests for diagnosing autism. An accurate diagnosis must be based on observation of the individual's communication, behavior, and developmental levels. However, because many of the behaviors associated with autism are shared by other disorders, various medical tests may be ordered to rule out or identify other possible causes of the symptoms being exhibited. At first glance, some persons with autism may appear to have mental retardation, a behavior disorder, problems with hearing, or even odd and eccentric behavior. To complicate matters further, these conditions can co-occur with autism. However, it is important to distinguish autism from other conditions, since an accurate diagnosis and early identification can provide the basis for building an appropriate and effective educational and treatment program.A brief observation in a single setting cannot present a true picture of an individual's abilities and behaviors. Parental (and other caregivers' and/or teachers) input and developmental history are very important components of making an accurate diagnosis.EARLY DIAGNOSISResearch indicates that early diagnosis is associated with dramatically better outcomes for individuals with autism. The earlier a child is diagnosed, the earlier the child can begin benefiting from one of the many specialized intervention approaches treatment and educationDIAGNOSTIC TOOLSThe characteristic behaviors of autism spectrum disorders may or may not be apparent in infancy (18 to 24 months), but usually become obvious during early childhood (24 months to 6 years).As part of a well-baby/well-child visit, your child's doctor should do a developmental screening asking specific questions about your baby's progress. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) lists five behaviors that signal further evaluation is warranted:Does not babble or coo by 12 monthsDoes not gesture (point, wave, grasp) by 12 monthsDoes not say single words by 16 monthsDoes not say two-word phrases on his or her own by 24 monthsHas any loss of any language or social skill at any age.Having any of these five red flags does not mean your child has autism. But because the characteristics of the disorder vary so much, a child showing these behaviors should have further evaluations by a multidisciplinary team. This team may include a neurologist, psychologist, developmental pediatrician, speech/language therapist, learning consultant, or other professionals knowledgeable about autism.SCREENING INSTRUMENTS While there is no one behavioral or communications test that can detect autism, several screening instruments have been developed that are now being used in diagnosing autism:CARS rating system (Childhood Autism Rating Scale), developed by Eric Schopler in the early 1970s, is based on observed behavior. Using a 15-point scale, professionals evaluate a child's relationship to people, body use, adaptation to change, listening response, and verbal communication.The Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) is used to screen for autism at 18 months of age. It was developed by Simon Baron-Cohen in the early 1990s to see if autism could be detected in children as young as 18 months. The screening tool uses a short questionnaire with two sections, one prepared by the parents, the other by the child's family doctor or pediatrician.The Autism Screening Questionnaire is a 40 item screening scale that has been used with children four and older to help evaluate communication skills and social functioning.The Screening Test for Autism in Two-Year Olds is being developed by Wendy Stone at Vanderbilt and uses direct observations to study behavioral features in children under two. She has identified three skills areas that seem to indicate autism - play, motor imitation, and joint attention.CONSULTING WITH PROFESSIONALSWhether you or your child's pediatrician is the first to suspect autism, your child will need to be referred to someone who specializes in diagnosing autism spectrum disorders. This may be a developmental pediatrician, a psychiatrist or psychologist, and other professionals that are better able to observe and test your child in specific areas.This multidisciplinary assessment team may include some or all of the following professionals (they may also be involved in treatment programs):Developmental pediatrician - Treats health problems of children with developmental delays or handicaps.Child psychiatrist - A medical doctor who may be involved in the initial diagnosis. He/she can also prescribe medication and provide help in behavior, emotional adjustment and social relationships). - Specializes in understanding the nature and impact of developmental disabilities, including autism spectrum disorders. May perform psychological and assessment test, as well as help with behavior modification and social skills training. - Focuses on practical, self-help skills that will aid in daily living such as dressing and eating. May also work on sensory integration, coordination of movement, and fine motor skills.Physical therapist - Helps to improve the use of bones, muscles, joints, and nerves to develop muscle strength, coordination and motor skills.Speech/language therapist - Involved in the improvement of communication skills, including speech and language.Social Worker - May provide counseling services or act as case manager helping to arrange services and treatments.It is important that parents and professionals work together for the child's benefit. While professionals will use their experience and training to make recommendations about your child's treatment options, you have unique knowledge about his/her needs and abilities that should be taken into account for a more individualized course of action.Once a treatment program is in place, communication between parents and professionals is essential in monitoring the child's progress. Here are some guidelines for working with professionals:Be informed. Learn as much as you can about your child's disability so you can be an active participant in determining care. If you don't understand terms used by professionals, ask for clarification.Be prepared. Be prepared for meetings with doctors, therapists, and school personnel. Write down your questions and concerns, and then note the answers.Be organized. Many parents find it useful to keep a notebook detailing their child's diagnosis and treatment, as well as meetings with professionals.Communicate. It's important to ensure open communication - both good and bad. If you don't agree with a professional's recommendation, speak up and say specifically why you don't.GETTING PAST THE DIAGNOSISOften, the time immediately after the diagnosis is a difficult one for families, filled with confusion, anger and despair. These are normal feelings. But there is life after a diagnosis of autism. Life can be rewarding for a child with autism and all the people who have the privilege of knowing the child. While it isn't always easy, you can learn to help your child find the world an interesting and loving place. TREATMENT Add to my webjam Discovering that your child has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be an overwhelming experience. For some, the diagnosis may come as a complete surprise; others may have had suspicions and tried for months or years to get an accurate diagnosis. In either case, a diagnosis brings a multitude of questions about how to proceed. A generation ago, many people with autism were placed in institutions. Professionals were less educated about autism than they are today and specific services and supports were largely non-existent. Today the picture is much clearer. With appropriate services and supports, training, and information, children on the autism spectrum will grow, learn and flourish, even if at a different developmental rate than others.While there is no known cure for autism, there are treatment and education approaches that may reduce some of the challenges associated with the condition. Intervention may help to lessen disruptive behaviors, and education can teach self-help skills that allow for greater independence. But just as there is no one symptom or behavior that identifies individuals with ASD, there is no single treatment that will be effective for all people on the spectrum. Individuals can learn to function within the confines of ASD and use the positive aspects of their condition to their benefit, but treatment must begin as early as possible and be tailored to the child's unique strengths, weaknesses and needs.Throughout the history of the Autism Society of America, parents and professionals have been confounded by conflicting messages regarding what are, versus what are not, appropriate treatment approaches for children and adults on the autism spectrum.The purpose of this section is to provide a general overview of a variety of available approaches, not specific treatment recommendations. Keep in mind that the word treatment is used in a very limited sense. While typically used for children under 3, the approaches described herein may be included in an educational program for older children as well.It is important to match a child's potential and specific needs with treatments or strategies that are likely to be effective in moving him/her closer to established goals and greatest potential. ASA does not want to give the impression that parents or professionals will select one item from a list of available treatments. A search for appropriate treatment must be paired with the knowledge that all treatment approaches are not equal, what works for one will not work for all, and other options do not have to be excluded. The basis for choosing any treatment plan should come from a thorough evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses observed in the child.UNDERSTANDING YOUR OPTIONSTreatment approaches are constantly evolving as more is learned about the autism spectrum. There are many therapeutic programs, both conventional and complementary, that focus on replacing dysfunctional behaviors and developing specific skills.As a parent, it's natural to want to do something immediately. The literature states time and time again the importance of early treatment for individuals on the autism spectrum However, it is important not to rush in with changes. It does no good to push ahead with a treatment that is not appropriate for the individual or one that may be harmful. You also much consider the larger implications of beginning a new treatment. A child may have already learned to cope with his or her current environment and sudden changes or unexpected different expectations could be stressful and confusing. Various treatment approaches should be investigated and information gathered concerning various options before proceeding with any child's treatment.Parents will encounter numerous accounts from other parents about successes and failures with many of the treatment approaches mentioned. Professionals also differ in their theories of what they feel is the most successful treatment for autism. It can be frustrating! Parents do learn to sift through the information, examine options with a critical eye and make rational, educated decisions on what is appropriate given the individual circumstance. Parents live with the individual on the spectrum every day and best know his/her needs and the unique ways that autism impacts their lives. Parents must be empowered to trust their instincts as various options are explored, considered and implemented.The descriptions of treatment approaches provided here are for informational purposes only. They serve as overviews and should always be followed with contact with qualified professionals and should be discussed with parents or individuals on the spectrum who have person experiences. The Autism Society of America does not endorse any specific treatment or therapy.While doing research, parents and professionals will hear about many different treatments approaches, such as auditory training, discrete trial training, vitamin therapy, anti-yeast therapy, facilitated communication, music therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and sensory integration. These approaches can generally be broken down into three categories:Learning ApproachesBiomedical & Dietary ApproachesComplementary ApproachesSome of these treatment approaches have research studies that support their efficacy; others may not. Some parents will only want to try treatment methods that have undergone research and testing and are generally accepted by the professional community. But keep in mind that scientific studies are often difficult to do since each individual on the autism spectrum is different.For others, formal testing might not be a pre-requisite for them to try a treatment with their child. Even for those with scientific proof, the Autism Society of America recommends that all options available are investigated to determine the approach that is most appropriate.Experts agree though, that early intervention is important in addressing the symptoms associated with ASD. The earlier treatment is started, the more opportunity for the individual to reach their highest potential. Many of the approaches described can be used on children as young as age 2 or 3. They may also continue to be used in conjunction with special education programs or traditional elementary school for children who are mainstreamed.PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN UNDER AGE 3If a child is younger than 3 years old, he or she is eligible for early intervention assistance. This federally-funded program is available in every state, but may be provided by different agencies. Contact the local chapter of the Autism Society of America in your area for more specific information, search program listings in Autism Source\u2122 located on the web at http://www.autismsource.org/, or obtain a state resource sheet from the National Information Center for Children and Youth with Disabilities.This early education assistance may be available in two forms: home-based or school-based. Home-based programs generally assign members of an early intervention team to come to the home to train parents or caregivers to educate the child on the spectrum. School-based programs may be in a public school or a private organization. Both of these programs should be staffed by teachers and other professionals who have experience working with children with disabilities specifically autism. Related services should also be offered, such as speech, physical or occupational therapy, depending on the needs of each child. The program may be only for children with disabilities or it may also include typically developing peers.PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDRENFrom the age of 3 through the age of 21, every child diagnosed on the autism spectrum is guaranteed a free appropriate public education supplied by the local education agency. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal mandate that guarantees this education. Whatever the level of impairment, the educational program for an individual on the autism spectrum should be based on the unique needs of the student, and thoroughly documented in the IEP (Individualized Education Program). If this is the first attempt by the parents and the school system to develop the appropriate curriculum, conducting a comprehensive needs assessment is a good place to start. Consult with professionals who are well versed in the spectrum of autism and related conditions about the best possible educational methods that will be effective in assisting the student to learn and benefit from his/her school program. Educational programming for students with ASD often addresses a wide range of skill development, including: academics, language, social skills, self-help skills, behavioral issues, and leisure skills.Parents can and should be an active and equal participant in deciding on an appropriate educational plan for their child. Parents know the child best and can provide valuable information to teachers and other professionals who will be providing educational services. Collaboration between parents and professionals is essential; open communication will certainly lead to better evaluation of progress and improved outcomes for the student.To learn about other services specific to an area, contact resources in the community, such as the local ASA chapter, a local University Affiliated Program for Developmental Disabilities, the local ARC, Easter Seals, or Parent Training and Information Center. Be persistent but be patient it may take days or weeks to find the information you need. If a local resource is not able to provide the information or services sought, ask for a referral to another agency or local resource that may be helpful.EVALUATING APPROACHESBecause no two children on the autism spectrum have the exact same symptoms and behavioral patterns, a treatment approach that works for one child may not be successful with another. This makes evaluating different approaches difficult and that much more essential. There is little comparative research between treatment approaches. Primarily this is because there are too many variables that have to be controlled. So, it's no wonder that parents might be confused about what to do.The Autism Society of America has long promoted the empowerment of individual consumers (including people on the spectrum, parents and professionals) to critically examine a variety of available options and be forearmed with a set of parameters under which they can better determine associated threats and opportunities and, therefore, make informed decisions. Further, better educated consumers, would help control the embracing of unproven notions that may distract from effective courses of treatment for individuals with ASD.In the article Behavioral and Educational Treatment for Autistic Spectrum Disorders (Autism Advocate, Volume 33, No. 6), Bryna Siegel, Ph.D., suggests thinking about each symptom as an autism specific learning disability\u2026 that tells something about a barrier to understanding. Using this model, what the student can and cannot do well can be evaluated. \u2026take stock of which autistic learning disabilities are present, and then select treatments that address that particular child's unique autism learning disability profile. Understanding these learning differences is the first step in assessing whether a specific treatment approach may be helpful; understanding a child's strengths is equally important. For example, some children are good visual learners, while another child may need written, rather than oral, cues.Finding Treatment Programs in Your AreaOnce familiar with the treatments that are available and appropriate for individuals with ASD, parents begin to think about where they can receive these services. Treatments may be obtained through either the medical or educational community, depending on the nature of the treatment. There are also a variety of resources useful in finding qualified professionals or service providers in your area. There are several state agencies established to provide this type of information and support, including Protection and Advocacy agencies; Developmental Disabilities Councils; Vocational Rehabilitation Centers; Parent Training Centers; and Educational Resources. Local chapters of the Autism Society of America are run by parents of individuals on the autism spectrum and have been established to provide guidance, advice and referrals to programs and professionals in a specific geographic region. mental retardation Autism Society of America add ASD NICHD Disabilities Education Act Developmental Disabilities National Information Center for Children and Youth National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Individualized Education Program imitation IDEA ASA Simon Baron-Cohen Autistic Spectrum Disorders Easter Seals Autism Rating Scale No. Eric Schopler Wendy Stone Vanderbilt Autism Source&trade University Affiliated Program ARC Parent Training and Information Center ASD.In Autism Advocate Bryna Siegel Developmental Disabilities Councils Vocational Rehabilitation Centers Parent Training Centers www.autismsource.org/, screening occupational therapy cars childhood autism rating scale physical therapy music therapy Autism482 null There's Hope For Us Yet, Eh? This entry was written on Apr 13, 2009 by our Autism Guru Jennifer Warwick There was study done by Guillermo Montes, PhD and Jill Halterman, MD, MPH from the Children s Institue in Rochester, NY and Department of Pediatrics at the University of Rochester, School of medicine and Dentristy. They were concerned about small-scale studies which found having a child with autism was detrimental to maternal psychological functioning. They wanted to investigate this theory using a large-scale population-based study. They also wanted to determine how the relationship between the mother and her child were affected by autism. The title of their research article is Psychological Functioning and Coping Among Mothers of Children With Autism: A Population-Based Study 1. When I first read the title, a little voice inside me asked: What psychological functioning and coping? Late night web surfing does not bring out the optimists. Or maybe cynicism is brought on by sleepless nights when your child decides they are going to tear paper until 3 in the morning. Or it could be from those 10 minute meltdowns at the grocery store just when you thought you were going to make it out of there incident-free. So, when the results of this study which interviewed mothers of 61,772 children (364 of which had autism), indicated mothers of children with autism were highly stressed and more likely to report poor or fair mental health than mothers in the general population, I believed my question had been answered. Yes, we are stressed. Not much of a shock, there. What did surprise me, though, was the results which showed mothers of children with autism also report having a close relationship with their child and better coping with parenting tasks. We were also less like to be angry with our child, and there were no indications of an increase in violence in our households. The results were based on self-evaluations and compared with those given by mothers in the general population. In addition, the results were also adjusted to accomodate for the child s social skills and demographic background. Based on my own personal experiences and those of my other friends with children with autism, I would say these results were spot on. I have the medical bills to prove my mental health has seen better days. Many mothers, including myself, have found relief from some of the anxiety from medications such as SSRI s. Nonetheless, some days I feel like a mountain collapsed on me. But other days, particularly those when I relfect on how far my child has come, I am convinced I can move mountains. So, if you are a mother new to the world of autism and reading this for the first time, do not give up hope. While most of us will agree living with autism is no picnic, it has its rewards. Think of yourself as a contestant on Survivor. While some of the challenges and situations on this reality show seem surreal (come on, who s going to have to eat a rat or perch atop a pole for 30 minutes?), so will be some of the trials and tribulations you will experience as a parent of a child with autism. When you have a child who needs to be taught inhibition, you learn quickly what surreal is all about. But unlike the reality show, there is one bonus they ll never vote you off the island. 1 Psychological Functioning and Coping Among Mothers of Children With Autism: A Population-Based Study , Guillermo Montes, PhD and Jill S.

PDD represents a distinct category of developmental disabilities that share many of the same characteristics. The different diagnostic terms that fall within the broad meaning of PDD, include: \ufffd Disorder, and\ufffd Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). While there are subtle differences and degrees of severity among these conditions, treatment and educational needs can be very similar for all of them. In the diagnostic manual used to classify mental disorders, the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), \ufffdAutistic Disorder\ufffd is listed under the heading of \ufffdPervasive Developmental Disorders.\ufffd A diagnosis of autistic disorder is made when an individual displays 6 or more of 12 symptoms across three major areas: (a) social interaction, (b) communication, and (c) behavior. When children display similar behaviors but do not meet the specific criteria for autistic disorder (or the other disorders listed above), they may receive a diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, or PDD-NOS. Autism is one of the disabilities specifically defined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the federal legislation under which infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities receive early intervention, special education and related services. IDEA defines the disorder as \ufffda developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and nonverbal communication and social interaction, generally evident before age 3, that adversely affects a child\ufffds educational performance. Other characteristics often associated with autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences.\ufffd [See 34 Code of Federal Regulations \ufffd300.8(c)(1).] routines PDD childhood disintegrative disorder social interaction American Psychiatric Association Disabilities Education Act IDEA PDD-NOS Autism/Pervasive Developmental Disorder Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified DSM-IV-TR \ufffdPervasive Developmental Disorders.\ufffd A Federal Regulations Autism484 null Researchers find early autism signs in some kids 12 March 2010 By Bruce Bower BALTIMORE\ufffdSome infants headed for a diagnosis of autism, or autism spectrum disorder as it\ufffds officially known, can be reliably identified at 14 months old based on the presence of five key behavior problems, according to an ongoing long-term study described March 11 at the International Conference on Infant [...] Bruce Bower International Conference 12 March 2010 Autism485 null Current News Legislative Breakfast March 12: Concerned that the state's fiscal 2011 budget could further erode much-needed services for local residents with intellectual and developmental disabilities, 4 area service providers are participating in a major campaign to avert what could be devastating service reductions.

This set of signs distinguishes autism from milder autism spectrum disorders (ASD) such as Asperger syndrome.[2]Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare mutations.[3] In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects.[4] Other proposed causes, such as childhood vaccines, are controversial and the vaccine hypotheses lack convincing scientific evidence.[5] Most recent reviews estimate a prevalence of one to two cases per 1,000 people for autism, and about six per 1,000 for ASD, with ASD averaging a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio. The number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, at least partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.[6]Autism affects many parts of the brain; how this occurs is poorly understood. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. Early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help children gain self-care, social, and communication skills. There is no cure.[7] Few children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, but some become successful,[8] and an autistic culture has developed, with some seeking a cure and others believing that autism is a condition rather than a disorder.[9] Contents 1 Classification 2 Characteristics 2.1 Social development 2.2 Communication 2.3 Repetitive behavior 2.4 Other symptoms 3 Causes 4 Mechanism 4.1 Pathophysiology 4.2 Neuropsychology 5 Screening 6 Diagnosis 7 Management 8 Prognosis 9 Epidemiology 10 History 11 References 12 External links //<![CDATA[ if (window.showTocToggle) { var tocShowText = \"show\"; var tocHideText = \"hide\"; showTocToggle(); } //]]> genetic brain genetic mutations ASD social interaction birth defects repetitive behavior cognitive Prognosis Causes Page Classification ICD-10 F84.0 ICD-9 OMIM MeSH D001321 20985 00152 00132 screening Autism487 null The U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled Friday that thimerosal-containing vaccines do not cause autism, rejecting a second theory advanced by plaintiffs lawyers who blame the injections for contributing to the developmental disorder in children. The rulings in three test cases mark the second defeat for the plaintiffs lawyers who are litigating autism-related claims in the federal claims court in Washington. More than 5,500 families have filed claims in the Federal Vaccine Compensation Program. In February 2009, the court in three rulings rejected the argument that measles, mumps and rubella vaccines and thimerosal-containing vaccines can combine to play a role in causing autism. The second theory advanced by the plaintiffs attorneys was that thimerosa, a mercury-based preservative, was alone responsible for causing autism. None of the causation hypotheses advanced were reliable as medical or scientific theories, Special Master Denise Vowell said in her ruling in one of the cases. In another case, Special Master George Hastings Jr. found the evidence was overwhelmingly contrary to the plaintiffs' claims.

Autism has long been considered a disorder that can range from mild to severe. Asperger's symptoms can vary, but the condition is generally thought of as a mild form and since 1994 has had a separate category in psychiatrists' diagnostic manual. Both autism and Asperger's involve poor social skills, repetitive behavior or interests, and problems communicating. But unlike classic autism, Asperger's does not typically involve delays in mental development or speech.The American Psychiatric Association's proposed revisions, announced Wednesday, involve autism and several other conditions. The suggested autism changes are based on research advances since 1994 showing little difference between mild autism and Asperger's. Evidence also suggests that doctors use the term loosely and disagree on what it means, according to psychiatrists urging the revisions.A new autism spectrum category recognizes that \"the symptoms of these disorders represent a continuum from mild to severe, rather than being distinct disorders,\" said Dr. Edwin Cook, a University of Illinois at Chicago autism researcher and member of the APA work group proposing the changes.The proposed revisions are posted online at http://www.DSM5.org for public comment, which will influence whether they are adopted. Publication of the updated manual is planned for May 2013.Dr. Mina Dulcan, child and adolescent psychiatry chief at Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital, said Aspies' opposition \"is not really a medical question, it's an identity question.\"\"It would be just like if you were a student at MIT. You might not want to be lumped with somebody in the community college,\" said Dulcan who supports the diagnostic change.\"One of the characteristics of people with Asperger's is that they're very resistant to change,\" Dulcan added. The change \"makes scientific sense. I'm sorry if it hurts people's feelings,\" she said.Harold Doherty, a New Brunswick lawyer whose 13-year-old son has severe autism, opposes the proposed change for a different reason. He says the public perception of autism is skewed by success stories ? the high-functioning \"brainiac\" kids who thrive despite their disability.Doherty says people don't want to think about children like his son, Conor, who will never be able to function on his own. The revision would only skew the perception further, leading doctors and researchers to focus more on mild forms, he said.It's not clear whether the change would affect autistic kids' access to special services.But Kelli Gibson of Battle Creek, Mich., whose four sons have different forms of autism, thinks it would. She says the revision could make services now designated just for kids with an \"autism\" diagnosis available to less severely affected kids ? including those with Asperger's and a variation called pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified.Also, Gibson said, she'd no longer have to use four different terms to describe her boys.\"Hallelujah! Let's just put them all in the same category and be done with it,\" Gibson said.

How is the diagnosis of autism made? My friend has a child who is suspected to have autism. I wanted to find out more about making the diagnosis of autism.A. Diagnosing autism is not an easy task, especially when there are several other conditions that might confuse the clinician with this disorder or spectrum of disorders. The child usually has several symptoms that suggest an autistic disorder, such as impaired social behavior. Several diagnostic instruments (tests) are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children. A pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child.. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factorsQ. worried again about autism...

In 1943 He published a paper entitled, Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact, which described the symptoms of 11 children who all exhibited signs of Autism. This publication gave the world its first look inside the world of Autism. Since this time Autism as grown to affect 1 in 150 and is most prevalent in males. What is Autism?Autism is one of many Autistic Spectrum Disorders(ASDs). It shares the spectrum with other well known disorders such as Aspergers Syndrome, Fragile X Syndrome and PDD , among others. Autism is a neurological disorder, this means that it is a disorder that affects the nervous system due to disease, injury, developmental abnormalities or toxins. It impairs the main functions of the Nervous System which is rooted in sensory, integration and motor skills. What Causes Autism? Researchers believe that Autism is caused by both genetics and environmental factors with genetics playing the role of susceptibility and environmental factors acting as triggers. Diabetes could be an example. Most people are more susceptible of contracting diabetes if their mother or father has it but may not ever develop it. In most cases of diabetes it can be controlled or prohibited by exercise and a proper diet but the genetic disposition is still there. What are the Signs and Symptoms? The effects of Autism are deeply rooted in three areas; communication, social interactions and repetitive behaviors. Most children with autism have little to no speech and if they posses speech it is not uncommon for that speech to be lost over time. They also possess an inability to interact with others, lack of eye contact, standoffish, do not like to be touched, intolerable to change. Other signs may be no real sense of danger, seems as deaf, spinning objects, inappropriate laughing or giggling, inappropriate attachment to objects, sustained play , sensory problems, bad motor skills. The signs and symptoms of Autism may vary from person to PDD aspergers fragile x syndrome Aspergers Syndrome Autistic Spectrum Disorders HistoryLeo Kanner Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact Fragile X Syndrome Autism495 null Autism is a complex brain disorder that inhibits a person's ability to communicate and develop social relationships, and is often accompanied by extreme behavioral challenges. In February 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that Autism Spectrum Disorders are diagnosed in one in 150 children in the United States, affecting up to seven times as many boys than girls. The diagnosis of autism has increased tenfold in the last decade. The CDC has called autism a national public health crisis whose cause and cure remain unknown. Facts and Figures Recent studies show the rate of autism occurs in 1 out of 150 births. The occurrence in boys is up to 7 times more prevalent than girls. Autism can often be detected as early 18 months of age. However, the average diagnosis age is still 5 years. While there is no known cause or cure for autism, we do know that intervention, particularly early-intervention, can help tremendously. To date there are no long-term studies on autism and what therapies are most effective. Therefore, it is up to the parents to research what is best for their child. Under federal mandates, basic services may be covered by local school districts or government entities. However, the cost of contemporary services most likely fall outside of their purview and are not covered by medical insurance and, therefore, fall squarely on the caretakers. Autism Myths There are many misleading myths concerning autism. It's imperative that people understand that these are, in fact, myths and that every person should be treated as an individual. Autism is an emotional disability. You can tell right away if someone has Autism. Children with Autism never make eye contact. Children with Autism cannot show affection. Children with Autism all exhibit the same traits. Children with Autism do not talk. Children with Autism do not smile. Children with Autism do not want friends. Children with Autism can perform amazing mental feats, such as memorizing the telephone book or multiplying large numbers in their heads. Children with Autism are completely cut off from human relationships. All of these statements are false.

Autism United States down syndrome Wisconsin Autism50 http://www.atc-gsi.org/AboutAutism.htm About Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders Under the umbrella of Pervasive Developmental Disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Ed. Text Rev. 2000), there are five disorders that share distinct characteristics unique to classify and identify an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These are Autistic Disorder, Asperger?s Disorder, Rett?s Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified. Autistic Disorder or Autism is more prevalent in boys than girls at a ratio of 4:1. The Autism Society of America and other organizations estimate that 1 in 166 children are currently diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. What is Autistic Disorder? The criteria for Autistic Disorder are qualitative or highly noticeable impairments in social interaction, communication, speech and language skills, play and imagination appropriate to developmental age, and restricted repetitive and stereotyped behaviors or sequences of behavior, interests and activities or routines that are difficult to change or modify (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). In many cases, Mental Retardation may also be present with Autistic Disorder ranging from mild to severe and profound (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). Diagnostic characteristics usually emerge before age 3. Red Flags for Autism (DSM-IV-TR, 2000): Social Interaction: Child does not reciprocate or imitate eye-to-eye gaze, gestures such as waiving goodbye or hello to promote social interaction, facial expressions such as smiling, and body postures. Child does not develop peer relationships appropriate to age. Child lacks social or emotional reciprocity such as pointing to objects in environment to share interest or clings and hoards toys and/or atypical objects that no one else can touch or play with. Child does not socially or emotionally reciprocate such as appearing to ignore adults and children in the room, and does not initiate social interaction. Communication: Spoken language is severely delayed or there are no words spoken, no approximation of words spoken, or no gestures or mime are used to compensate for the lack of words and communicating with others. Spoken language is used but child cannot sustain a conversation or begin a conversation with others. Spoken language is repetitive, stereotyped and/or idiosyncratic such as may recite scripts from movies or commercials but cannot make a sentence to ask for a cookie. Spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play that is appropriate to developmental level is lacking such as child does not pretend to eat play food or drive a car, use a variety of toys and objects to act out a scene or play sequence. Behavior: Child shows a preoccupation or obsessive focus with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal in intensity or focus such as holding the same object all day long but does not play with the object or watches the same video, TV program, or commercial over and over again. Child demonstrates specific rituals and routines that are inflexible and nonfunctional such as keeping doors closed, turning off and on light switches, insists on following the same route to school or stores, and tantrums when routines and rituals are not followed. Child demonstrates stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms such as rocking while walking or sitting, wiggling fingers in the air, twirling around, hand flapping, or other complex and atypical body movements. Child demonstrates a persistent preoccupation with parts of objects such as spinning the wheels of a toy car over and over but never pushes car across the floor, opening and closing a part of a pop-up toy but does not explore the other parts, etc. If the red flags are evident or emerging, talk to your pediatrician and get a referral to a neurologist, pediatric psychiatrist, or other clinicians that can perform a formal evaluation and diagnosis as soon as possible. Research shows that early intervention and education can help children with ASD. Remember, a ?label? of ASD will get your child important services such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, developmental therapy, and more. What is Asperger?s Disorder also known as Asperger?s Syndrome? A diagnosis of Asperger?s Disorder is given when there is a severe and sustained impairment in social interaction, and a development of restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests and activities that causes significant impairment in social, occupational and/or other important areas of functioning (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). For example, the child may know and express everything about trains, ceiling fans, historical dates and integral details pertaining to his/her interests, but does not know how to give and take in conversations or relate to information the communicative partner expresses. With AD, there are no clinically significant delays or impairments in language development or cognitive development and Mental Retardation is not present although some very mild Mental Retardation cases have been reported (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). Many children are diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder prior to a diagnosis of AD and AD has been associated with other conditions such as Depressive Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). According to the DSM-IV-TR (2000), the social disability becomes more obvious over time and individuals may learn how to use areas of strengths to compensate for areas of weaknesses such as memorizing social responses to use in social situations. Asperger?s Disorder is diagnosed 5 times more in males than in females (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). What is Rett?s Disorder? Rett?s Disorder is much less common than Autistic Disorder and has only been reported in females (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). Prenatal and perinatal development is normal for the first 5 months. However, between 5 and 48 months, the child?s head growth decelerates, and the child?s purposeful hand skills are replaced with repetitive hand wringing or hand washing type movements (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). After a few years of the onset of Rett?s Disorder, there is a decreased interest in the child?s social environment, problems develop in gait and/or trunk movements along with severe psychomotor retardation, and severe impairments in expressive and receptive language development emerge (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). What is Childhood Disintegrative Disorder? After a period of at least 2 years of typical development in all areas of functioning, the child develops a severe and clinically significant loss of skills in at least two of the following areas: expressive or receptive language, social skills and/or adaptive behavior, loss of bladder or bowl control, play skills, and/or motor skills (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). The characteristics of Childhood Disintegrative Disorder resemble Autistic Disorder but onset of CDD can be up to age 10 and Severe Mental Retardation is usually present. Other complications may include seizure disorder and abnormal EEG?s (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). This disorder is very rare and recent data suggest that the condition is more common among males than females (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). What is Pervasive Developmental Disorder ? Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)? Pervasive Developmental Disorder ? Not Otherwise Specified or Atypical Autism is diagnosed when all of the criteria for the other four pervasive developmental disorders are not met, as well as criteria for Schizophrenia, Schizotypal Personality Disorder, or Avoidant Personality Disorder are not met (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). There may be deviations in developmental milestones or sequences that are atypical but not clinically significant to give a diagnosis of another ASD. Strategies for Working with Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: There are many strategies and techniques for working with children with ASD. It is important to understand the child?s unique personality, learning style, developmental levels, sensitivities to environmental stimuli, and other relevant issues of the child in order to develop and provide the best educational program in school, help the child at home and in the community, and prepare the child with self-help and independent living skills for adult life. Applied Behavior Analysis-Discrete Trial, TEACCH, Errorless Learning, Video learning, visual strategies, social stories, schedules, first-then model, sensory integration strategies, and forward/backward chaining are just a few of the many techniques and strategies for working with students diagnoses with ASD.

The findings were expected to draw widespread attention because of the intense public interest in autism, but their true impact was expected to be simply in suggesting further avenues of research. Surprisingly, the age of the father plays little role unless the mother is younger than 30 and the father is over 40, according to the analysis of all births in California in the 1990s. The number of women over age 40 in California giving birth increased by 300% in the 1990s, while the diagnosis of autism increased by 600%. At first glance, it might seem that the rise in older pregnancies could be responsible for the rise in autism, which is now thought to affect as many as one child in every 100. But the authors, from UC Davis, calculate that older mothers account for less than 5% of the increase in autism diagnoses. \"There is a long history of blaming parents\" for the development of autism, said senior author Dr. Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences and a researcher at the UC Davis MIND Institute who has been studying potential causes for the autism increase. \"We're not saying this is the fault of mothers or fathers. We're just saying this is a correlation that will direct research in the future.\" Researchers have long known that the age of the parents plays a role in a child's risk of developing autism, but how big a role and how that role varies with the sex of the parent has remained confusing, with contradictory results reported in different studies. To investigate, Hertz-Picciotto, graduate student Janie E. Shelton and epidemiologist Daniel J. Tancredi of UC Davis analyzed all the singleton births in California during the 1990s for which information was available about the ages of both parents, a total of about 4.9 million births and 12,159 cases of autism. Because of the large sample size, they were able to show how the risk was affected by each parent's age. They reported in the February issue of the journal Autism Research that women over 40 were 77% more likely to deliver an autistic child than those younger than 25 and 51% more likely than those age 25 to 29, independent of the age of the father. For men over 40, there was a 59% increased risk of autism if the mother was younger than 30, but virtually no increased risk if the mother was over 30. The researchers also calculated that the recent trend toward delayed childbearing contributed about a 4.6% increase in autism diagnoses over the decade. \"Five percent is probably indicating that there is something besides maternal age going on because we are seeing a rise in every age group of parents,\" Shelton said. Also, noted Hertz-Picciotto, older women may be followed more closely during pregnancy, which would mean more ultrasounds - which a few researchers have suggested might play a role in autism. Older women are more likely to suffer gestational diabetes and to develop autoimmune disorders, both of which have been linked to an increased risk of autism. \"We still have a real long way to go\" in determining the causes of autism, she concluded. textSize() Copyright 2010, The Los Angeles Times Sphere.Inline.search(\"\", \"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/sfl-healthykey-family-autism-31110,0,1408716.story\"); E-mail Digg Twitter Facebook StumbleUpon Comments (0) Add comments Currently there are no comments.

Autism is a complex neurobiological disorder. It is part of a group of disorders known as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Today, 1 in 150 individuals is diagnosed with autism, making it more common than pediatric cancer, diabetes, and AIDS combined. It occurs in all racial, ethnic, and social groups and is four times more likely to strike boys than girls. Autism impairs a person's ability to communicate and relate to others. It is also associated with rigid routines and repetitive behaviors, such as obsessively arranging objects or following very specific routines. Symptoms can range from very mild to quite severe. 1 in 150 children is diagnosed with autism 1 in 94 boys is on the autism spectrum 67 children are diagnosed per day A new case is diagnosed almost every 20 minutes More children will be diagnosed with autism this year than with AIDS, diabetes cancer combined Autism is the fastest-growing serious developmental disability in the U.S. Autism costs the nation over $90 billion per year, a figure expected to double in the next decade Autism receives less than 5% of the research funding of many less prevalent childhood diseases Boys are four times more likely than girls to have autism There is no medical detection or cure for autism Autism was first identified in 1943 by Dr. Leo Kanner of Johns Hopkins Hospital. At the same time, a German scientist, Dr. Hans Asperger, described a milder form of the disorder that is now known as Asperger Syndrome. These two disorders are listed in the DSM IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) as two of the five developmental disorders that fall under the autism spectrum disorders. The others are Rett Syndrome, PDD NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder), and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. All of these disorders are characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills and social abilities, and also by repetitive behaviors. Autism spectrum disorders can usually be reliably diagnosed by age 3, although new research is pushing back the age of diagnosis to as early as 6 months. Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child or their child's failure to reach appropriate developmental milestones. Some parents describe a child that seemed different from birth, while others describe a child who was developing normally and then lost skills. Pediatricians may initially dismiss signs of autism, thinking a child will \ufffdcatch up,\ufffd and may advise parents to \ufffdwait and see.\ufffd New research shows that when parents suspect something is wrong with their child, they are usually correct. If you have concerns about your child's development, don't wait: speak to your pediatrician about getting your child screened for autism.

Autism is a life-long condition of a developmental disability, affecting the individual s understanding of what he/she sees, hears and senses. As a result, people with autism can have problems in social relationships, communication and behaviour. Autism affects approximately one in five hundred people and boys are more likely to be affected than girls. It affects all ethnic and social groups. The cause of autism remains unknown, however it is definitely not caused by poor parenting (as was once believed). Understanding of autism has improved greatly over the years, although there is no known cure. What are the features of autism? Autism is a developmental disability. A person with autism will have significant difficulties in several areas of his/her development. Individuals with autism typically show uneven skill development. All people with autism will have problems with communication, social interaction and behaviour, regardless of the level of intellectual functioning. The degree of severity of characteristics differs from person to person, but can include the following: Communication: Autism affects the ability of a person to understand the meaning and purpose of body language and the spoken and written word. There may be delay or absence in language development, difficulties understanding speech, difficulties using language, difficulties understanding and using gesture. Social Interaction: Social interaction is an essential part of life for most people. For people with autism being sociable is difficult. Problems usually occur with: understanding relationships, relating to others, maintaining eye contact, forming friendships, understanding other peoples thoughts and feelings. Some appear to withdraw and become isolated; others try very hard to be sociable but never seem to get it right. Variable Sensory Responses - may appear to be deaf, may appear to have selective hearing, may use peripheral vision, may show extreme fear reactions, apparent insensitivity to pain, may show lack of responsiveness to cold or heat, may overreact to any of these Intellectual Functioning - uneven pattern of skills, some things may be done quite well in relation to overall functioning eg memorising dates, numbers, advertising jingles, the majority of people with autism have varying degrees of intellectual disability Activities and Interests - Restricted range of activities and interests: unusual repetitive body movements eg hand flicking, spinning or rocking. walking on tip-toe, rigidity in routines, obsessive and ritualistic behaviour eg peeling paint/wallpaper, smelling food before eating, resistance to and difficulty adapting to change Play - lack of imaginative play eg make-believe games, play inappropriate to the function of the toy eg spinning wheels, lining up Textas, may have difficulty learning through imitations How is Autism diagnosed? Assessments are provided by most Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, specialist paediatricians and child psychiatrists, and private teams or clinics. If affected, most children will show signs of autism by two years of age, but a diagnosis may not be confirmed until three years of age, and sometimes older. The main criteria used for diagnosis are: qualitative impairment in verbal and non verbal communication qualitative impairment in reciprocal social interaction markedly restricted number of activities and interests and impaired imaginative play symptoms evident during first 30 months of life Autism may be diagnosed using the above criteria, or there may be varying amounts of disability in other areas of development which result in diagnosis of conditions called Asperger Syndrome or Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD - NOS). These developmental disabilities are referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorders. People with these disorders are affected differently, but all require specialised assistance and support. What is the Treatment for Autism? Behavioural and Developmental Therapy: There is no one therapy or approach to the treatment of autistic disorders. The needs of each person vary greatly. Specialised educational approaches enhance development in social, language, self-help, co-operation and other basic skills. These are best when provided controlled, consistent, predictable and organised routines to assist children to progress with learning. Early intervention is highly desirable. Most able. Most school aged children will be eligible for assistance with Government programs for students with disabilities and impairments. Children benefit greatly from being with their peers and may attend a specialist school, or a mainstream school with additional support. Medications: Medication has no specific role in autism; however some may be useful to manage co-existing conditions eg. anticonvulsants are required if epilepsy develops, and medications may be prescribed to treat aggression, depression, anxiety, etc, if they develop. These would be prescribed by a suitably qualified medical practitioner. Diet Therapy: All people benefit from a diet that is nutritionally adequate. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has produced dietary guidelines for Australians to promote healthy eating. Eating a wide variety of nutritious foods including grains and cereals, fruits, vegetables, dairy and meat foods daily is an important part of a healthy diet. Children need appropriate food and physical activity for normal physical growth and development. It is important to achieve an adequate food intake to balance the physical activity and growth of childhood and adolescence. There have been some suggestions that a casein-free/gluten-free diet may be beneficial in the treatment of Autism. Significant research into the role of this diet has been undertaken by the Autism Research Unit of the University of Sunderland, UK. It is strongly recommended that anyone considering such dietary management should seek the support of their medical practitioner and a knowledgeable dietitian. The dietary restrictions can be challenging. It is recommended that you discuss your child s diet with a dietitian to ensure that it includes all of the important nutrients for growthand development. How Can Orgran Products Assist Me? The entire range of Orgran products are gluten free casein free. For those choosing to follow a gluten-free/casein-free diet for the management of autism, Orgran products are ideal. For those wanting to follow general principles of healthy eating, you can enjoy the benefits of alternative grains, with Orgran products that are also low fat, and do not have added sucrose. Orgran s great range of pastas, crispbreads, bread and baking mixes, breakfast cereals, biscuits and fruit snacks are a delicious inclusion in a nutritious diet. Who Can I contact for More Support?

The organization, which is the the nation s largest for autism advocacy, says self-advocate John Elder Robison is joining its scientific advisory board. Other members of the 30-person board, which is responsible for reviewing grant applications for millions of dollars worth of autism research,\ufffdare researchers and family members of those with autism. Robison, who wrote the book Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger\ufffds, teaches at Elms College in Chicopee, Mass. and previously served on the public review board for the National Institutes of Mental Health. It is essential that our grant funding reflects the needs and perspectives of the community we serve, namely, people with autism spectrum disorders, said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer at Autism Speaks, in a statement. We are very pleased to welcome John to our scientific review boards. His insight and skills will prove invaluable. For self-advocates, however, the appointment of one person with autism does not go far enough. They re calling for systemic change at Autism Speaks to include people with autism of varying perspectives at all levels throughout the organization. If you have an organization for women and you had an advisory board and it had one female on it, that would not be acceptable, says Scott Michael Robertson, vice president of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network. This doesn t really change anything. Even Robison acknowledges that he is just one voice. I\ufffdm aware that my vote is only one among thirty, but the fact that I myself am on the spectrum will make a difference, and I certainly believe in speaking up for whatever I support, Robison said.

As parents, we must seek the truth. The emerging theory that Thimerosal, a preservative which is half mercury that was increased in vaccines during 1988 and 1991, continues to heat up the debate as to whether or not it fueled the dramatic increase in autism and other developmental disabilities in the United States and other countries around the world. AutismFACTS will look closely at this issue and all information, debates, and research concerning Thimerosal. Research will be looked at very closely as to validity, structure and usefulness. Who conducted the research? What type of research was done and how reliable is the information and conclusions? Is there criticism surrounding the research and how valid is that criticism? Debates surrounding Thimerosal will also be closely looked at. Are the points being made valid and true or are they speculative and unsupported? Where did the debate points begin? And who is making the arguments? Information extends into the political arena and this be closely looked at, as well. There are politicians who are supporting research into the cause of autism, including investigating Thimerosal, and there are those who are not. All political support and interference concerning various issues and Bills concerning autism will be explored and reported. AutismFACTS is dedicated to taking an unbiased and factual look at this issue. We, the public, cannot stand by blindly accepting any and all statements we hear, dismissing important research of any kind, nor can we reject any relevant information. We must stand together strong, seek answers and continue to ask questions. We must fight for research in all areas of autism and other developmental disabilities and find correct and safe ways to help our children. The controversy surrounding Thimerosal is strong because of the political and potential fallout concerning Federal Agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as private organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). However, the truth is not something that can be compromised for any reason and any controversy surrounding these agencies will be looked at as well. The same goes for any research or debate disputing their position. The truth must prevail, whichever way the truth turns. Let the chips fall where they may. United States Centers for Disease Control Food and Drug Administration FDA CDC American Academy of Pediatrics AAP Thimerosal Federal Agencies 1988 and 1991 Autism51 http://www.nwcn.com/news/health/Court-Thimerosal-did-not-cause-autism-87516072.html WASHINGTON, D.C. - The vaccine additive thimerosal is not to blame for autism, a special federal court ruled Friday in a long-running battle by parents convinced there is a connection. While expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism. Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration, special master George Hastings Jr., wrote. But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case. The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court. Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines. The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling covered one theory, and a second was dropped after that. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories. That doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available. The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had already had its day in science court and failed to hold up. But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them. On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges, Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement. SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling. The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology, the goup said. The advocacy group Autism Speaks said the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases. However, while research has found no overall connection between autism and vaccines, the group said it would back research to determine if some individuals might be at increased risk because of genetic or medical conditions. Meanwhile, in reaction to the concerns of parents, thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines in the United States. In Friday's action the court ruled in three different cases, each concluding that the preservative has no connection to autism. The trio of rulings can offer reassurance to parents scared about vaccinating their babies because of a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, are on the rise. The U.S. Court of Claims is different from many other courts: The families involved didn't have to prove the inoculations definitely caused the complex neurological disorder, just that they probably did. More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation through the government's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the rulings dealt with test cases to settle which if any claims had merit. Autism is best known for impairing a child's ability to communicate and interact. Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it's unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosis. Worry about a vaccine link first arose in 1998 when a British physician, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published a medical journal article linking a particular type of autism and bowel disease to the measles vaccine.

Symptoms may include: Significant problems developing nonverbal communication skills, such as eye-to-eye gazing, facial expressions, and body posture. Failure to establish friendships with children the same age. Lack of interest in sharing enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people. Lack of empathy. People with autism may have difficulty understanding another person's feelings, such as pain or sorrow. Verbal and nonverbal communication. Symptoms may include: Delay in, or lack of, learning to talk. As many as 40% of people with autism never speak.1 Problems taking steps to start a conversation. Also, people with autism have difficulties continuing a conversation after it has begun. Stereotyped and repetitive use of language. People with autism often repeat over and over a phrase they have heard previously (echolalia). Difficulty understanding their listener's perspective. For example, a person with autism may not understand that someone is using humor. They may interpret the communication word for word and fail to catch the implied meaning. Limited interests in activities or play. Symptoms may include: An unusual focus on pieces. Younger children with autism often focus on parts of toys, such as the wheels on a car, rather than playing with the entire toy. Preoccupation with certain topics. For example, older children and adults may be fascinated by video games, trading cards, or license plates. A need for sameness and routines. For example, a child with autism may always need to eat bread before salad and insist on driving the same route every day to school. Stereotyped behaviors. These may include body rocking and hand flapping. Symptoms during childhood Symptoms of autism are usually noticed first by parents and other caregivers sometime during the child's first 3 years. Although autism is present at birth (congenital), signs of the disorder can be difficult to identify or diagnose during infancy. Parents often become concerned when their toddler does not like to be held; does not seem interested in playing certain games, such as peekaboo; and does not begin to talk. Sometimes, a child will start to talk at the same time as other children the same age, then lose his or her language skills. They also may be confused about their child's hearing abilities. It often seems that a child with autism does not hear, yet at other times, he or she may appear to hear a distant background noise, such as the whistle of a train. With early and intensive treatment, most children improve their ability to relate to others, communicate, and help themselves as they grow older. Contrary to popular myths about children with autism, very few are completely socially isolated or \"live in a world of their own.\" Symptoms during teen years During the teen years, the patterns of behavior often change. Many teens gain skills but still lag behind in their ability to relate to and understand others. Puberty and emerging sexuality may be more difficult for teens who have autism than for others this age. Teens are at an increased risk for developing problems related to depression, anxiety, and epilepsy. Symptoms in adulthood Some adults with autism are able to work and live on their own. The degree to which an adult with autism can lead an independent life is related to intelligence and ability to communicate. At least 33% are able to achieve at least partial independence.2 Some adults with autism need a lot of assistance, especially those with low intelligence who are unable to speak. Part- or full-time supervision can be provided by residential treatment programs. At the other end of the spectrum, adults with high-functioning autism are often successful in their professions and able to live independently, although they typically continue to have some difficulties relating to other people. These individuals usually have average to above-average intelligence. Other symptoms Many people with autism have symptoms similar to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). But these symptoms, especially problems with social relationships, are more severe for people with autism. For more information, see the topic Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. About 10% of people with autism have some form of savant skills\ufffdspecial limited gifts such as memorizing lists, calculating calendar dates, drawing, or musical ability.1 Many people with autism have unusual sensory perceptions. For example, they may describe a light touch as painful and deep pressure as providing a calming feeling. Others may not feel pain at all. Some people with autism have strong food likes and dislikes and unusual preoccupations. Sleep problems occur in about 40% to 70% of people with autism.3 Other conditions Autism is one of several types of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), also called autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is not unusual for autism to be confused with other PDDs, such as Asperger's disorder or syndrome, or to have overlapping symptoms. A similar condition is called pervasive developmental disorder-NOS (not otherwise specified). PDD-NOS occurs when children display similar behaviors but do not meet the criteria for autism. It is commonly called just PDD. In addition, other conditions with similar symptoms may also have similarities to or occur with autism. depression routines echolalia anxiety sleep ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd PDDs Autism511 null font size A A A Oxytocin Hormone May Treat Autism Study Shows Oxytocin May Improve Social Skills for Some People With Autism By Jennifer Warner WebMD Health News Reviewed By Louise Chang, MD Feb. 15, 2010 -- Oxytocin, the so-called hormone of love, may help promote social skills and social behavior in people with high-functioning autism. A new study shows people with high-functioning autism disorders, such as Asperger's syndrome, who were treated with oxytocin responded more strongly to others and displayed more appropriate social behaviors. Despite high intellectual abilities, people with high-functioning autism lack the social skills to engage appropriately with others in social situations. Oxytocin is nicknamed the hormone of love because it is known to promote mother-infant bonds. It is also thought to be involved in the regulation of emotions and other social behaviors. Other research has found that children with autism have lower levels of oxytocin than children without autism. In this study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers examined the effect of inhaled oxytocin on social behavior in 13 young adults with high-functioning autism in two separate experiments. A comparable group of 13 people without autism was also included in the study. In the first experiment, researchers observed the participants' social behavior in a computer ball-tossing game in which the players could choose between passing the ball to a good, bad, or neutral character. Typically, people with autism would exhibit little preference between the three choices, but in the experiment those treated with oxytocin engaged more with the good character and sent more balls to the good character than the bad one. People with autism who were given a placebo showed no difference in the way they responded to the three characters. The comparison group without autism sent more balls to the good character. In the second experiment, researchers measured the participants' attentiveness and responses to pictures of human faces. Those treated with oxytocin were more attentive to visual cues in the pictures and looked longer at the socially informative region of the face, namely the eyes. \"Thus, under oxytocin, patients respond more strongly to others and exhibit more appropriate social behavior and affect, suggesting a therapeutic potential of oxytocin through its action on a core dimension of autism,\" write researcher Elissar Andari of the Centre N\ufffdtional de la Recherche Scientifique in Bron, France, and colleagues. They say the results suggest further long-term studies are needed to examine the effects of oxytocin on social skills and behaviors in people with high-functioning autism.SOURCES: Andari, E.

During the appointment Teddy Bear Autism514 null Autism A Case Study Fred's parents were concerned. Fred was two and a half years old, but had not begun to talk. He didn't babble like other children his age. Fred did not make eye contact, but his vision seemed fine. He loved watching his own hands. He could sit for hours watching his hands move back and forth. Fred was diagnosed with autism, a neurological disorder that disrupts normal development. Some children with autism can attend school with children their own age; others need special care. The Symptoms Autism is classified as a pervasive developmental disorder. The \"pervasive\" part of the name implies that the disorder is serious, or that it affects many areas of development. Symptoms vary greatly from person to person. People with autism may appear to daydream constantly or be unaware of people around them. Most children with autism prefer to play by themselves, and treat other people like furniture. The major symptoms of autism include: Symptoms of Autism Communication Problems Many people with autism are uncommunicative - they will not speak, gesture, or make facial expressions. When they do speak, the speech may be in a sing-song pattern or monotone (no variation in pitch, like playing a single note on an instrument). Other people with autism may talk at length with no regard to what another person says or does. Repetitive Motions Most people with autism enjoy repetitive motions, such as spinning objects, running water, or sniffing objects. A sense of routine is very important, and it can be extremely upsetting to them when part of their routine is changed. This could be something as trivial as changing the route to the grocery store or moving an item within the house. Problems with Social Interactions People with autism have trouble interpreting other people's facial expressions. Most of the time they will not make eye contact with others and have trouble making friends. Some people with autism are hypersensitive to sound and may get very upset when they hear sirens or dogs barking. Others are fascinated by faint noises such as the ticking of a watch. To some, bright lights are distressing, while others will stare at bright lights for hours. Many people with autism can not stand light touch: scratchy clothing could be unbearable. Others seem immune to pain and may hurt themselves. Mood swings are common. The Cause of Autism is Unknown It was once thought that poor parenting caused autism. This is definitely not true. Although the cause of autism is unclear, it is known that genetics do play a role. The disorder is seen often in identical twins: different studies have shown that if one identical twin has autism then there is a 63-98% chance that the other twin will have it. For non-identical twins (also called fraternal or dizygotic twins), the chance is between 0-10% that both twins will develop autism. The chance that siblings will be affected by autism is about 3%. Chance that both people will develop autism 63-98%Identical Twins 0-10%Fraternal Twins 3%Siblings Autism appears to be associated with other chromosomal abnormalities, such as Fragile X syndrome or brain abnormalities such as congenital rubella syndrome. A large number of people with these disorders are also diagnosed with autism. Furthermore, complicated births, such as difficult pregnancies, labor, or delivery may to contribute to the disorder. Diagnosis Autism is a behaviorally defined syndrome. There is no simple test for it. Usually parents notice that their child is not developing in the same way as other children the same age. A physician can perform a psychiatric exam, ruling out other disorders such as schizophrenia, selective mutism (when the child chooses not to speak but can speak if he wanted to), or mental retardation, to name a few. Other tests examine language skills. When all test results are examined, a physician can make a diagnosis. Treatment Although symptoms in children may lessen with age, autism is a lifelong disorder. Many people with autism will remain in institutionalized care and approximately 50% will remain without the ability to speak. Structured programs that do not allow the child to \"tune out\" have proved successful at helping many children gain language and some social skills. Many times children with autism will have other disorders, such as epilepsy (seizures), hyperactivity, and attention problems. Epilepsy, in particular, appears to get worse as autistic children get older. Drugs that inhibit the reuptake of the neurotransmitter called serotonin have some success in treating patients with autism. These drugs, such as Fluxoetine, slow the reuptake of serotonin by the neuron that releases it. Therefore, serotonin stays in the synapse for a longer time. Normal Synapse With Fluxoetine A Look at the Brain of a Person with Autism Brain imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been used to examine the brains of people with autism. However, results have been inconsistent. Abnormal brain areas in people with autism include the: Cerebellum - reduced size in parts of the cerebellum. Hippocampus and Amygdala - smaller volume. Also, neurons in these areas are smaller and more tightly packed (higher cell density). Lobes of the Cerebrum - larger size than normal. Ventricles - increased size. Caudate nucleus - reduced volume. Quick Facts About Autism Autism occurs in approximately four or five out of every 10,000 children in the U.S. Autism is the third most common developmental disorder in the U.S., affecting at least 500,000 people. Autism is seen more often in boys; four or five boys will have autism compared to one girl. But girls with autism are often more severely affected than boys and score lower on intelligence tests. Leo Kanner first described autism as the \"inability to relate themselves in the ordinary way to people and situations from the beginning of life\" in the 1943 paper \"Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact.\" Autism usually is seen within the first three years of life. Approximately 80% of people with autism function at a mentally retarded level (usually within the moderate range of retardation). Some people with autism are gifted in certain areas such as math or music. These are termed \"splinter skills.\" Autism has also been further reading: American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), 4th Edition, Washington, D.C., American Psychiatric Association, 1994.

Children and adults with autism find it difficult or impossible to relate to other people in a meaningful way and may show restrictive and/or repetitive patterns of behavior or body movements. While great strides are being made, there is no known cause, or a known singular effective treatment for autism. Learn About Signs and Symptoms There is no single behavior that is always typical of autism or any of the autistic spectrum disorders. Learn about the signs and symptoms. There is Hope Autism is a baffling, life-long disorder. And while there is no cause or cure, nor a known singular effective treatment, it is treatable. People with autism -- at any age -- can make significant progress through therapy and treatments, and can lead meaningful and productive lives. However, experts agree that early diagnosis and early intervention are critical - because the earlier people with autism get help, the better their outcomes will be in the future. Did you Know? The annual cost of providing services for people with autism is $90 million, in 10 years that number is projected to be $200 - 400 billion. With early diagnosis and intervention, the overall cost of treatment can be reduced by two-thirds over an individual with autism s lifetime. London School of Economics Study, 2001Opening the Door to AutismThere are five developmental disorders that fall under the Autism Spectrum Disorder umbrella and are defined by challenges in three areas: social skills, communication, and behaviors and/or interests. Autistic Disorder -- occurs in males four times more than females and involves moderate to severe impairments in communication, socialization and behavior. Asperger's Syndrome -- sometimes considered a milder form of autism, Asperger s is typically diagnosed later in life than other disorders on the spectrum. People with Asperger's syndrome usually function in the average to above average intelligence range and have no delays in language skills, but often struggle with social skills and restrictive and repetitive behavior. Rett Syndrome -- diagnosed primarily in females who exhibit typical development until approximately five to 30 months when children with Rett syndrome begin to regress, especially in terms of motor skills and loss of abilities in other areas. A key indicator of Rett syndrome is the appearance of repetitive, meaningless movements or gestures. Childhood Disintegrative Disorder -- involves a significant regression in skills that have previously been acquired, and deficits in communication, socialization and/or restrictive and repetitive behavior. Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) -- includes children that do not fully meet the criteria for the other specific disorders or those that do not have the degree of impairment associated with those disorders.

What is the treatment for autism? Is autism inherited? NHGRI Clinical Research on Autism Additional Resources for Autism What is autism? Autism - or more precisely the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) - represent a broad group of developmental disorders characterized by impaired social interactions, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors or severely limited activities and interests. The ASDs include a variety of medical autism diagnoses, which vary in the severity of the individual symptoms and include autistic disorder (sometimes called classical autism), Asperger's syndrome and a general diagnostic category called Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). Autism has become the most commonly diagnosed childhood developmental disorder. According to the Centers for Disease Control Prevention in 2007, autism spectrum disorders now affect 1 in every 150 children in the United States. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Education and other government agencies indicate that autism diagnoses are increasing at the rate of 10 to 17 percent per year. Autism can affect any individual and is not based on ethnic, racial or social background. The incidence of autism is the same all around the world. It is four times more common in boys than in girls. Top of page What are the symptoms of autism? Autism usually develops before 3 years of age and affects each individual differently and to varying degrees. It ranges in severity from relatively mild social and communicative impairments to a severe disability requiring lifelong parental, school and societal support. The hallmark symptom of autism is impaired social interaction. Children with autism may fail to respond to their name and often avoid eye contact with other people. They have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling because they don't understand social cues provided by tone of voice or facial expressions and they don't watch other people's faces to pick up on these cues. Many children with autism engage in repetitive movements such as rocking, spinning, twirling or jumping, or in self-abusive behavior such as hand biting or head-banging. Of children being diagnosed now with an autism spectrum disorder, about half will have mental retardation defined by nonverbal IQ testing and 25 percent will also develop seizures. Though most children show signs of autism in the first year of life, about 30 percent will seem fine and then regress in both their language and social interactions at around 18 months of age. About 30 percent of children with autism have physical signs of some alteration in early development such as physical features that differ from their parents (sometimes called dysmorphic features), small head size (microcephaly) or structural brain malformations. Top of page How is autism diagnosed? Diagnosis of autism is based on standardized testing plus a clinical evaluation by an autism specialist. These professionals are usually psychologists, psychiatrists, developmental pediatricians, pediatric neurologists or medical geneticists. The diagnosis of autism is made when there are a specific number of symptoms as defined by the Diagnostic and Standard Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Some commonly used diagnostic tests are the CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale), the ABC (Autism Behavior Checklist) and the GARS (Gilliam Autism Rating Scale). Formal diagnosis by an autism specialist usually depends on completing the ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale), and ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised). The CHAT (Checklist for Autism in Toddlers) is often used in pediatrican's offices to screen for autism symptoms. When physical features, small head size or brain malformations are present or there is a family history of relatives with autism, genetic testing such as chromosome analysis and single-gene testing is done. Top of page What is the treatment for autism? There is currently no cure for autism. However, autism can be managed and shaped at a young age, even as early as pre-school. Early intensive therapy can have a positive effect on development later in life. Treatment of autism involves medical and behavioral therapies to help children with conversational language and social interactions. Treatment also involves helping children decrease their repetitive, self-stimulatory behaviors, tantrums and self-injurious behavior. Medications can help treat specific symptoms such as aggressive or self-injurious behavior, inattention, poor sleep and repetitive behaviors. However, no medications are autism specific and medications should be used in conjunction with a family-centered, behavioral and educational program. Top of page Is autism inherited? Scientists are not certain what causes autism, but it's likely that both genetics and environment play a role. The causes of autism may be divided into 'idiopathic', (of unknown cause) which is the majority of cases, and 'secondary,' in which a chromosome abnormality, single-gene disorder or environmental agent can be identified. Approximately 15 percent of individuals with autism can be diagnosed with secondary autism; the remaining 85 percent have idiopathic autism. Exposure during pregnancy to rubella (German measles), valproic acid, and thalidomide, are recognized causes of secondary autism; however, it remains unclear whether those who develop autism after such an exposure are also genetically predisposed. The search for new environmental causes of secondary autism has centered primarily on childhood immunizations given around the time that regressive-onset autism is recognized. Both childhood immunizations and mercury in thimerosal, which was used as a preservative in some routine immunizations until 2001, have both been under scrutiny; however, no scientific evidence for a relationship between vaccines and autism has been identified. Researchers have identified a number of genes associated with autism. Studies of people with autism have found irregularities in several regions of the brain. Other studies suggest that people with autism have abnormal levels of serotonin or other neurotransmitters in the brain. These abnormalities indicate that autism usually results from the disruption of normal brain development early in fetal development caused by defects in genes that control brain growth and that regulate how neurons communicate with each other. These are preliminary findings and require further study. The risk that a brother or sister of an individual who has idiopathic autism will also develop autism is around 4 percent, plus an additional 4 to 6 percent risk for a milder condition that includes language, social or behavioral symptoms. Brothers have a higher risk (about 7 percent) of developing autism, plus the additional 7 percent risk of milder autism spectrum symptoms, over sisters whose risk is only about 1 to 2 percent. When the cause of autism is a chromosome abnormality or a single-gene alteration, the risk that other brothers and sisters will also have autism depends on the specific genetic cause.

Autism Dr. Molly McButter, Ph.D., is a much sought-after child psychologist working near Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. For the past several years, she's been counseling a suspiciously large number of well-to-do (but freaked out) moms and dads living in the Bay Area. They come to her from different cities and unique socioeconomic backgrounds, but they do have one thing in common: their kids have all started acting funny. \"Tommy,\" age two and a half, suddenly stopped recognizing his parents and 5-year-old sister. Instead of responding when called to, he'd sway back and forth in slow circles, pausing only to bonk his head repeatedly against a ceramic dog bowl. One day he ceased making eye contact with his family members altogether. He'd drag his head across the floor, walk on his toes, make odd gurgling sounds, and spend long hours filling and emptying buckets of sand in the sandbox. Then the screaming began; he'd wail inconsolably at all hours of the day and night, refusing to be held or comforted in any way. Shortly thereafter, he developed chronic diarrhea. Tommy's mother compared this incomprehensible phenomenon to someone coming into her perfectly healthy son's bedroom in the night, stealing his personality and ability to communicate, and then leaving behind the empty cardboard box of an utterly bewildered child. At age six, \"Kelly\" developed some eccentric habits of her own. She began tugging uncomfortably at the collar of her shirt or the footpads of her pajama bottoms. Sometimes she'd go as far as to rip all her clothes off during an otherwise routine trip to Safeway. At the corner Blockbuster, Kelly would windmill both of her arms and run sweeping down the aisle, knocking entire racks of video boxes onto the floor. When this caused a scene, she too would scream and lash out with her fists, biting her father and lifting up her shirt to bare her bee-stung breasts at flabbergasted customers. At home, she'd refuse to sleep more than a few minutes at a time. She began urinating in the fireplace and all four corners of the hardwood family room floor, making an exaggerated show of it whenever company came over for extended periods of time -- to the understandable consternation and embarrassment of her parents. And when \"Harrison\" reached the age of ten, his mother and father could no longer deny the disparity between his development and that of other children his age. He seemed to exist alternately in one of two possible states: passed out and sound asleep, or running tirelessly around the house from room to room wearing different wigs and clanging iron pots together. He developed an obsessive, breakfast time fascination with the Pocahontas-style illustration of the Indian princess on the Land O'Lakes spreadable butter tub. He would kick chairs, curse and shriek, and throw forks whenever it was time for her to return to the refrigerator. On his birthday, Harrison crept into his father's room as he lay sleeping, and stabbed him in the buttocks with a turkey thermometer. After a battery of tests, these children were diagnosed with varying degrees of autism, and Dr. McButter herself was responsible for delivering the bad news. She knows firsthand that the medical and psychiatric literature covering autism employs daunting words like \"hopeless\" and disparaging phrases like \"no known treatment\". Autism is a disorder which can seize upon someone instantly, or sneak up on them over the course of many months. It hinders the development of a person's ability to communicate, interact with other people and maintain normal contact with the outside world. The symptoms of autism are extremely noticeable and can be recognized as early as infancy. In most cases, a perfectly normal child will begin to regress: he or she loses the power of speech, abandons social skills, or gets stuck in infinite loops of obsessive physical activity. Most children completely withdraw into a world all their own. When parents learn their child is autistic, they describe it as one of the most traumatic, stressful events of their lives. Non-autistic people see autism as an enormous tragedy, and mothers and fathers alike experience continuing disappointment and grief at nearly all stages of an autistic child's life. Mostly this grief stems from profound sorrow over the loss of the \"normal\" child they'd been hoping for. In forty-eight states, one out of every 500 children has been diagnosed with autism. But two regions in the two remaining states -- the California Bay Area and a borough of New Jersey -- stand out: the ratio is a disturbing one in 250. Studies of the New Jersey phenomenon suggest contributing factors like environmental toxins and genetic predisposition, but age attributes of the mothers also apply. Teen mothers, as well as women in their thirties or forties are more likely to produce autistic children than a female in her twenties. New theories attempting to reconcile explanations for the Silicon Valley autism phenomenon are more sinister, and they've begun to orbit around moms and dads who met each other online. Before we explore that, let's turn our attention to the animal world for just a moment. Specialized dog factories offering their customers purebred terriers, greyhounds, German shepherds and the like are in the inbreeding business. It's been long understood that any sufficiently advanced mammal species requires a more dynamic population source. From the standpoint of maintaining a genetically healthy stock, limited mating options guarantee progressive genetic degeneration, brittle bones, deafness, heart problems and a substantial loss of vigor. Any one of these disabilities alone can saddle dog owners with the unhappy responsibility of wrangling unhealthy pets. But if you go to the Humane Society and adopt a dog, you're likely to find -- pardon the term -- a mutt, a mixed breed dog with rich, colorful DNA. These dogs are profoundly smarter, better adjusted to living with humans, and far more loving than their blue blooded cousins. In large cities, the men and women who hook up in bars get together because they find each other cute. Successful unions between such couples are more likely to produce cute kids with healthy, happy genes. After all, they're the output of parents who ostensibly came together with no similar genetic markers beyond physical appearance. Their offspring are mutts as well, and statistically predisposed to a healthier, happier life. In smaller cities (or rural areas where sexual intercourse is the preferred method of passing time because nobody has a car or a computer to escape the tedium of everyday life) people of similarly limited characteristics mix and mingle in a woefully homogenous petri dish. Such a localized gene pool is tantamount to a single block of low-income housing: there's far less opportunity for the population to enjoy the diversity required to encourage evolution, and there's a much greater chance of propagating genetic defects. The Internet as we know it is more of a puddle than a massive, unwieldy universe. Online portals like Orkut, Friendster, Tribe.Net, MySpace, Nerve, and Craigslist which foster the illusion of value by belonging to privatized, incestuous \"communities\" are inbreeding a new generation of individuals with genetic markings nearly identical to those of autism -- and its lesser cousin Asperger's. Asperger's syndrome is a Pervasive Development Disorder (PDD) characterized by severe and sustained impairment with social interaction. Adults with Asperger's have trouble feeling empathy for others, especially when it comes to decoding social cues like gestures, facial expressions and body language. Normal communicative behaviors like humor or the emotional nuances of sarcasm, idioms or metaphors are often wholly lost on sufferers of Asperger's. Relationship issues depicted in books, movies, and television programs will not be understood. While their reading recognition skills are excellent, language comprehension remains weak -- and it cannot be assumed that they fully understand what they so fluently read. People with autism and Asperger's can often be egocentric, meaning that in some cases they find it difficult to believe other people actually have their own thoughts, feelings, or opinions of their own. The pervasiveness of individual thoughts, feelings, and opinions in tech-savvy metropolitan areas (like Silicon Valley) might be cause for alarm. Steve Silberman, a Wired magazine reporter examined the autism phenomenon several years ago, limiting his focus primarily to men and women working in the software industry: \"It's a familiar joke that many of the hardcore programmers in IT strongholds like Intel, Adobe, and Silicon Graphics -- coming to work early, leaving late, sucking down Big Gulps in their cubicles while they code for hours -- are residing somewhere in Asperger's domain. Kathryn Stewart, director of the Orion Academy, a high school for high-functioning kids in Moraga, California, calls Asperger's syndrome the engineers' disorder. Bill Gates is regularly diagnosed in the press: His single-minded focus on technical minutiae, rocking motions, and flat tone of voice are all suggestive of an adult with some trace of the disorder. In Microserfs, novelist Douglas Coupland observes, 'I think all tech people are slightly autistic.'\" In January of 2001, Microsoft became the first major US corporation to offer its employees insurance benefits to cover the cost of behavioral training for their autistic children. But elsewhere, a building army of autistic offspring threatens to bankrupt families, school systems and states nationwide. Federal law mandates that special-needs students be removed from traditional classrooms and stationed inside the portables at the far, far end of the football field where they can receive specialized tutoring. Such a law requires hiring more expensive teachers (those with master's degrees in special education) who wrangle classrooms of five students as opposed to twenty-five. These classrooms also include deaf and blind students, children with head injuries or learning disabilities like dyslexia, severe emotional disorders or bipolar conditions. The alternative to this arrangement is equally expensive: a privatized care facility where you can park your kid in front of construction paper for the day. Meanwhile, as more and more women step up to claim their rightful place in online communities by blogging themselves silly, pumping up their perceived street value with mutually fanatical, hyperactive and hug-heavy \"testimonials,\" e-viting one another into their electroclash pilates tribes, staging impromptu stitch-n-bitch knitting circles or hosting day-long Burning Man \"decompression\" parties, mentally obtuse men and boys who might never have found a compatible female partner suddenly discover they can hurl an iPod out the window and crack one square in the head with increasing accuracy. As long as men and women continue to meet online based exclusively on shared interests, the mental stability of future generations remains in grave peril -- and new technologies will need to be developed to keep them alive. Office furniture, for instance, may need to be ergonomically redesigned to take advantage of the Hug Box, a three-dimensional calming mechanism developed specifically for autism sufferers. In cooperation with noted researcher Temple Grandin, the Hug Box is an ingenious pressurized snuggle system used for deep touch stimulation, producing a calming effect on autistic or otherwise attention deficient individuals. Hug Boxes are already being used in schools, clinics, and homes around the world. Each machine is 60\" tall, 60\" long and 32\" wide, constructed from 13-grade 3/4\" birch plywood which is sealed and lacquered for a smooth durable finish. All edges are rounded to ensure safety. The air controls are of outstanding quality and multiple safety devices are included. Remaining components are fashioned from wood, metal, and plastic. The overall look is that of traditional office cubicle, with a classy, contemporary style suitable for those working in the software, Internet, gaming or design industry. The operator places his head in the top area, against soft fuzzy padding. His hands slide through the bottom opening to manipulate a keyboard or control joystick. As the furry side panels close in at a slow pace, overstimulated nerves become calm. Employees who previously paced, panted or hid under their desks during a morning meeting will soon be able to make their way to the conference room in a much calmer state -- without the use of a plastic mouth guard or ironcage safety helmet. The Hug Box, adjustable in many ways, can be used by software engineers, QA testers, videogame \"producers,\" artistic \"directors,\" and special needs students. The machine has a series of slots and holes to accommodate a laptop, a 12-oz cup of coffee, a 17\" flat-panel display, and either a softcover O'Reilly reference or a rolled-up yoga mat. There are also slots which adjust the arm rests, sliders which allow for oversized head girths, and a hands-free speaker phone. In time, rather than clamoring for standup videogame units, Segways or Air Hockey tables, tomorrow's crop of autistic office workers borne of Orkut-sanctioned relationships or Friendster-branded marital unions will undoubtedly learn to love their complementary Hug Boxes. In a nation of eight million socially impaired Rain Mans unable to make human connections, at least everyone involved can boast they're a very good driver. The U.S. Department of Education recorded a nationwide autism increase of 600 percent between 1992 and 2004. The average child with autism will require $8 million in lifetime supervision and care. It's a disability with a normal life expectancy affecting boys five times more than girls -- although girls are more severely affected. In the United States, over one million individuals live with autism, making it more prevalent than Down Syndrome, diabetes, and cancer combined.

What are the areas of concern? What should I do about my child's autism/PDD-NOS? What are the Pervasive Developmental Disorders? The Pervasive Developmental Disorders or Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental disabilities, which according to recent estimates, affect as many as 1-2 out of every 500 people. The Pervasive Developmental Disorders are also known as the autism-spectrum disorders, and they include Autistic Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), Asperger?s Disorder, Rett?s Disorder, and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. They affect up to 4-5 times as many boys as girls, occur in all cultures, and are present among all socioeconomic classes. They usually become noticeable between the ages of 1 and 3 years, and affect the way in which social behavior, communication (verbal and nonverbal communication), and attention/interests develop. There is a wide spectrum of impairment associated with the Pervasive Developmental Disorders, which can range from mild to severe. The PDDs do not describe a delay in development, but rather a difference or deviation in development in these three areas. Back to top What causes Pervasive Developmental Disorders? Pervasive Developmental Disorders are neurologically-based, medical disorders that are not caused by errors in parenting, a specific environmental toxin, poor prenatal care, etc. In a percentage of cases, there may be a genetic cause. Although scientists are making strides in identifying their cause(s), right now, there does not appear to be one specific cause for all cases. A physician or psychologist may diagnose one of these conditions using a medical model (following the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fourth Edition, DSM-IV). Alternatively, an education team may assign an educational eligibility (autism), based on a child's special needs for educational modifications. At the present time, there is no medical test that indicates an autism spectrum disorder; however, routine medical screenings (metabolic, genetic, and Fragile X) are recommended to rule out the presence of another identifiable condition. In either case, the diagnosis of a PDD is based on behavioral observations and clinical experience. Back to top What is the difference between Autism and PDD-NOS? Pervasive Developmental Disorder is a general category used to describe a pattern of behavioral differences (which may include deviations, excesses, or difficulties) in the areas of social relating, communication, and attention/interest. Children who demonstrate a number of characteristics or symptoms in these three areas, and whose problems are not better explained by other disorders, may receive a diagnosis of PDD. This diagnosis may also be applied if the child exhibits a variety of symptoms associated with Autism, but in an unusual pattern. It should be stressed that this is still a relatively new label, dating back only 15 years, so that some professionals may not be familiar with its correct use. In some cases, it has been incorrectly used synonymously with \"significant developmental delay? or ?general delay\" or \"developmental delay.\" Both Autism and PDD-NOS can occur in conjunction with a wide spectrum of intellectual ability. The defining feature must be a qualitative difference in social and language development for these diagnoses. Autism and PDD-NOS are subtypes of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders. It is common for a person to be given the general diagnosis of PDD, which indicates an autism spectrum disorder without clarifying the exact form of PDD. The differential diagnosis of the PDDs is based on a particular pattern or clustering of symptoms, and specific criteria on the number of symptoms that are observed. In both disorders, there is a higher likelihood of developing seizures than in individuals without autism. Back to top How do professionals tell the difference between autism and PDD-NOS? Primarily by the pattern and degree or number of characteristics observed or reported. However, there are difficulties associated with this differential diagnosis, and it often takes a clinician with extensive experience with both disorders to make the call. Problems may occur when a child's developmental level is quite low, so that assessing the areas of concern would be quite difficult at a similar age equivalent. A second problem occurs with children who are toddlers and young preschool-age children. Many of the behaviors that are considered crucial for diagnosis are still very variable in typically developing young children in this age range. Some children may receive a diagnosis of PDD-NOS as a toddler because they did not have any communicative behavior; later they may qualify for a diagnosis of autism as their communication develops and it becomes more evident that a qualitative difference exists in that area. For parents and educators, the important thing to focus on is not the specific label a child receives, but what can be done to help the child develop skills in the areas of concern. Back to top What is the difference between Autism and Asperger?s Disorder? Asperger?s Disorder was only added as a subtype of the PDDs in the DSM-IV in 1994, so its characteristics are still under a great deal of study. Similar to distinguishing Autism from PDD-NOS, there are specific criteria that distinguish Autism and Asperger?s. Some of the key differences between Autism and Asperger?s are that the individual could not have had a clinically significant language delay (although unusual patterns of communication and impaired nonverbal communication is generally present), and the individual must function within average to above average intellectual (cognitive) levels. There is currently much debate between professionals whether Asperger?s Disorder should really be distinguished from high-functioning Autism, and clinical experience is often important to determine how these diagnoses should be applied to a particular individual. Back to top Does my child have an intellectual impairment (mental retardation)? How is this different from Autism? Intellectual impairment (mental retardation) is a term used to describe individuals who follow a slower developmental path than others their age. ?Intellectual impairment? is the term generally used by educators and ?mental retardation? is the term used in the DSM-IV; however, these terms generally refer to the same types of learning difficulties. People with an intellectual impairment continue to develop skills and abilities as they grow, although they typically progress more slowly than their peer group. Intellectual Impairment is identified by comparing a person's intellectual performance on standardized tests with others in his/her age group, and by looking at how well that individual can function in adaptive skills (self-care, safety knowledge, independent living skills). Autism and PDD-NOS can be present in people who also have an intellectual impairment; however, they can also be present in individuals who have superior intellectual skills. It varies from individual to individual. However, because communication skills are an integral part of what most people consider intelligence, the problems people with autism show in this area may affect their ability to perform on standardized intelligence tests. Some individuals with Autism may receive a diagnosis of intellectual impairment or mental retardation due to suppressed performance in areas involving verbal expression or understanding, while performing above average in some other areas (such as memory and visual problem-solving). In such cases, the term is not particularly meaningful or predictive of long-term outcome. When assessing the skills of a child with a PDD, it is important to evaluate the skills that they show on an everyday basis in situations that are meaningful and familiar to them. Evaluation should not only focus on identifying a child?s intellectual level, but should aim to identify the child?s learning characteristics so that meaningful goals can be planned to help the child develop to his or her potential. Back to top What is the long-term prognosis for children diagnosed with Autism/PDD-NOS? Autism/PPD-NOS is a life-long disability, and individuals with Autism live a full lifetime. There are no cures, and even those individuals who proclaim themselves \"recovered\" continue to have difficulties with subtle social processes. However, with advances in education, early intervention, and research, today individuals with Autism/PDD have a greatly expanded range of outcomes as adults. In the past, the majority of individuals with Autism lived in institutional care as adults. Current trends, based on increased knowledge of how to educate children with Autism and the importance of early education, emphasize building skills and abilities in order to prepare young adults with Autism/PDD to work, to live in the community, and in some cases, to pursue higher education. Outcome appears to depend on both degree of overall impairment and intensity of educational/treatment effort. Prognosis is markedly better for individuals who develop verbal language before the age of 5 years Back to top My doctor says my child will never learn to talk. Is this true? For most children with Autism, there is no physical reason to preclude learning to use verbal communication. Unless there is a specific physical problem (such as deafness, absence of larynx/pharynx, focal lesion the brain), there is no reason to make such an assumption. It should be noted that speech does not frequently come easily to individuals with Autism, and research suggests that intensive efforts and education are often needed for children with Autism to develop speech. However, given the relationship between speech development and prognosis, aggressively pursuing verbal communication skills is highly recommended for young children with Autism/PDD-NOS. Back to top How is Autism/PDD-NOS diagnosed? What are the areas of concern? Individuals with Autism frequently display certain clusters of behavior that distinguish them from individuals who do not have Autism. Diagnosing this syndrome using the DSM-IV involves consideration of the following characteristics. Note: The child need not show all of these characteristics. I. Qualitative impairment in reciprocal social interactions: This refers to a developmental difference in the individual's interest and competence in achieving reciprocal interactions. It does not mean that the individual is not affectionate, or cannot make contact with other people, or is simply behind schedule in the development of social skills. What is different is the quality of interaction and interest. Behaviors suggesting this area may be affected include: difficulty understanding/perceiving the emotions of others difficulty sustaining interactions initiated by others poor, fleeting or abnormal eye contact lack of comfort-seeking when distressed difficulty making peer friendships appropriate to developmental level lack of social or emotional reciprocity lack of effort to share interests or enjoyment with others (may not show, point out or bring objects to share with others) in preschool children, lack of turn-taking play with peers (although the child may enjoy active and rough-and-tumble play) difficulty understanding social cues difficulty understanding and expressing his/her own emotions seeking touch and affection on own terms, but shunning affection when offered by others (not on own terms) preference for solitary play instead of group or paired play absence of symbolic play behavior, very literal and concrete in comprehension (e.g., would not use a block as a telephone) frequent or sustained giggling, laughing or crying without visible cause may appear deaf at times, yet hear sounds from a distance at other times (ignore voice when name is called, yet run to window when ice cream truck is two blocks away) II. Qualitative impairment in verbal and non-verbal communication and imaginative activities: Again, this does not refer to a delay in development, but rather a difference in the way verbal and nonverbal communication proceeds. Behaviors suggesting this area may be affected include: normal development of early babbling and first words which are later lost between the ages of 1 and 3 years, while other development appears to proceed on course difficulty developing verbal communication pulling adults to items of interest rather than pointing or gesturing lack of use of gestures, demonstration, mime to compensate for lack of verbal expression repeating phrases verbatim frequently (echolalia) repeating phrases (often from TV) out of context after a period of time has passed (delayed echolalia) using words out of communicative context (walks around saying \"hi daddy\" when daddy is at work, and nobody is present) answering question by parroting question back to you poor timing and content variation in topic difficulty taking turns in maintaining a conversation difficulty with abstract concepts (learns nouns better than verbs or adjectives) difficulty understanding the \"theme\" of a story inventing own words for objects and rigidly uses them (neologism) talking mainly about one restricted topic, or using one word repeatedly (perseveration) acting as if adults can read his/her mind question-like or sing-song cadence to their speech difficulties in imitation III. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities: engaging in repetitive non-functional body movements (for example, spinning or whirling around, flapping arms or hands, rocking, walking on tiptoes, looking at fingers (stereotypies) difficulty with changes or transitions under- or over-sensitivity to sensory stimuli (sounds, lights, textures, odors) restricted food preferences, sometimes related to food texture may explore environment in unusual ways (smelling objects, mouthing excessively, scratching, licking) develop attachments to objects that are not typical for children (must sleep with twigs) may carry around objects without ever playing with them, and become upset when they are taken away becomes fascinated with parts of objects (wheels, lines, writing) may spin objects that are round in shape may focus on ordering and reordering or categorizing toys instead of playing with them (lining up cars, amassing red blocks) plays with materials in the same sequence across a period of time where variation would be expected (has Ernie follow same route to hospital every time he plays with car mat) develops routines that are difficult to break may get upset over trivial changes in environment (moving a lamp) not interested in a wide variety of toys and materials peculiar insistence in selected items, sequences, or routines (will only drink milk out of a certain cup) does not ask for help, but figures out how to get what he/she wants OTHER CONCERNS: eating inedible objects undersensitive to pain attention span fleeting for most activities, yet can spend long periods of time focused on one activity of his/her own interest (can watch videos for hours, but can't sit for 30 seconds for other tasks) high overall activity level may need less sleep than typical children of the same age absence of fear or appreciation of dangerous situations self-injurious behavior that does not appear to be directed at achieving any result (head banging, eye poking, biting) uneven intellectual ability (skills show a great deal of variability) peculiar fascination with one specific medium (country music, TV station, Wheel of Fortune, preview guide), etc. more interested in credits and commercials than TV shows unusual fear reactions STRENGTHS: good memory, especially for visually presented information enjoys completing tasks with a set end point may have precocious interest in letters and numbers cuddly and affectionate with parents, usually on own terms mechanical aptitude (can program the VCR at age 2) higher skills/talents in art, music, math, balance enjoy vestibular stimulation (tosses, being turned upside down, etc) stamina good non-verbal problem solving abilities (can get what they want) Back to top What should I do about my child's Autism/PDD-NOS? The most successful approach to dealing with the symptoms of Autism involves systematic and intensive educational programming. You may want to pursue a second opinion regarding diagnosis; however, the most prudent approach is to assume that the diagnosis is correct and proceed to develop plans to deal with the language and social difficulties of the child through educational programming (including speech therapy, therapeutic play groups, etc.) while you are also looking for a second opinion. If the original diagnosis was incorrect, no valuable time will be lost.

[ More definitions and points of view | Asperger's Syndrome ] Autism (or PDD, PDD-NOS, \"autism spectrum disorder\") Autism (and the related pervasive developmental disorders) is a severe developmental disorder which, left unchecked, usually progresses to developmental disability at a young age. The causes of the disorder are largely unknown; they include genetic and environmental (chemical and biological) factors, or some interaction of the two. (Many in the psychoanalytic community once believed that lack of parental nurturing was the cause, but that is perhaps the only factor we now know is not important.) Symptoms may be present from or even before birth (yes, Moms can tell), or appear gradually or suddenly after two or more years of apparently normal development. Although some related conditions such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome cause measurable changes in brain activity, in most cases the only diagnostic information is the child's behavior. Other biological markers are sketchy: there is some evidence of altered neurotransmitter (serotonin) levels; some children show slight physical changes, such as the shape of their ears; there is a strong correlation with maleness and non-right-handedness; and there is correlation with certain genes. There is about a one in nine chance that a sibling will also have autism. The early symptoms may include grossly delayed language or motor development; atypical play, such as spinning, lining up, staring at, or feeling toys (but no pretend play); lack of peer play or friendships; stereotyped (repeated unchanging) body movements; or pronounced fears, crying fits, sleeplessness, or noise sensitivity. In place of the typical progression of skills, the young child with autism may develop some skills early, such as the ability to recognize letters and signs (or even read), or the ability to make people smile by flirting or acting silly. These strengths may mask the severity of the many real deficits. (It is a common misconception that children with autism must be withdrawn; some are, but others are perfectly friendly. Real, and tragic, isolation sets in later if they do not develop the social and communication skills expected of older children.) Older children may develop aggressive, hazardous, or self-injurious behavior to such a degree that they require institutional care. Most do develop language, but it may consist largely of \"echoed\" words and phrases. If functional language appears, it is frequently missing important social context. Asked to talk about a picture of an activity, for example, the child may say \"The boy's shirt is red and he has five fingers on his left hand and five fingers on his right hand.\" He may insist on extreme sameness, counting every step to the kitchen, tantruming if interrupted or the number of steps is not exactly 16. Although not all suffer severe symptoms, individuals with autism frequently have difficulty achieving independence, forming stable relationships, or being free of anxiety. There is strong evidence that many or even most children with autism are actually able to learn as much as typically developing children, given the right environment. For many, there may be no deficit at all in the 'underlying' (cognitive) brain functions , but for some reason the information does not get in and skills do not develop normally. There is, in effect, a learning 'blockage.' Some research points to the attention mechanism as a factor. As infants, children who later are diagnosed with autism are unable to switch attention from one stimulus to another as readily as their peers. (Can you read this and make sense of it while you are talking on the phone?) We also don't understand well the 'subtypes' or boundaries of autism. For any individual, professionals will differ on what deficits may be due to autism, and what may be due to other disorders, such as ADHD, \"nonverbal learning disorder,\" or other cognitive and learning difficulties. This leads to a proliferation of related official and not-quite-official diagnostic labels for people with different mixes of skills and deficits: hyperlexia, semantic-pragmatic disorder, Asperger's Syndrome, sensory integrative dysfunction, and so on. Many people put these into the bucket \"autism spectrum disorder.\" It is a very mysterious disorder. No one understands why our kids are the way they are, or can explain why their responses to everyday things can be so very strange. The particular excesses and deficits vary so greatly from one child to another that an explanation or strategy that seems to work for one child may be a disaster for another. We know mostly how little we know. One measure of a professional's ability to help your child is a willingness to admit how little he knows, and a commitment to use your child's progress as the only sure guide. Having said all this, here are a few things that are mostly true - likely to apply to most - or mostly false - concepts that may work for an individual child here or there but probably don't apply to most. Autism (and the related pervasive developmental disorders) is... Uncommon but not rare. The \"accepted\" incidence is around one per thousand, but many parents in the USA report a \"head count\" in their schools that gives an incidence closer to one in every two or three hundred. Research in England gives a total incidence of all autism spectrum disorders at one in 160. A severe disorder, one that substantially affects most life activities. When an evaluator or administrator speaks of \"mild autism\" or \"mild PDD,\" ask, \"What is a mild severe disorder?\" Genetically linked to some degree. Evidenced as an impairment in learning by social imitation. Spoken language, body language, the rules of play and friendship, are all typically learned at an amazingly early age by observing and imitating other's behaviors. If our kids are to learn those things at all, they need a lot of expert help. Related to overall brain functioning rather than one specific site. See Scientists Discover Biological Basis for Autism. Autism is probably not... Caused by entirely genetic or entirely environmental factors A \"sensory disorder,\" or a dysfunction of any specific sense (hearing, balance, vision, and so on). Exaggerated responses (fear, anxiety) to normal sensory stimuli are very common, but the response is probably not simply a normal response to an exaggerated or distorted sensation. (There may be a disorder in how sensory information is processed, but it is not likely as simple as \"too loud\" or \"not clear.\") Caused by vaccinations. The symptoms of autism often show up suddenly after one to three years of apparently normal development. Kids get lots of vaccinations during this time so the odds are significant that \"sudden autism\" will follow a shot. This is a case where only careful statistical analysis can untangle the facts. Highly treatable by drugs. There is no medication specific to autism. Some individuals do benefit from psychoactive medications such as SSRIs (used to treat depression and OCD), antipsychotics (schizophrenia), stimulants (ADHD), or anticonvulsants (bipolar disorder). Some get a lot of benefit, so careful trials may be warranted. The dosages may be different - often lower - than those used for the associated clinical condition.

The study revealed that chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) had the highest detection rate among clinically available genetic tests for patients with autism spectrum disorders and should be part of the initial diagnostic evaluation of all patients with ASDs unless a genetic diagnosis has already been made. <!-- = \"FF0000\"; //--> The study, a collaboration between the Autism Consortium and Children's Hospital Boston, led by Consortium members Bai-Lin Wu, David Miller, Kira Dies, and Yiping Shen, examined 933 families (children and parents) who received clinical genetic testing for a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) between January 2006 and December 2008. The researchers compared the findings from three clinical genetic tests: G-banded karyotype and fragile X testing, the current standard battery of genetic testing, and chromosomal microarray analysis, for which testing guidelines have not yet been established. Chromosomal microarray analysis is similar to a karyotype, but can find much smaller chromosomal deletions and duplications. The results showed that chromosomal microarray analysis identified more genetic abnormalities associated with autism than the standard testing methods combined: Standard testing method G-banded karyotype testing yielded abnormal results in 19/852 patients (2.23%) Standard testing method Fragile X testing results were abnormal in 4/861 patients (0.46%) In contrast, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) identified deletions or duplications in 154/848 (18.2%) patients and 59/848 (7.0%) were clearly abnormal. As a result, chromosomal microarray was better than a karyotype for all but a small number of patients with balanced rearrangements, and those were not necessarily a cause of ASD. \"This is the largest study of clinical genetic testing for patients with autism spectrum disorders, and the results clearly show that chromosomal microarray analysis detects genetic abnormalities leading to ASD more often than a standard karyotype and fragile X testing,\" said David Miller, MD, PhD, assistant director of the DNA Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's. \"Chromosomal microarray was much better than a karyotype, but most clinical guidelines still recommend a karyotype and consider the microarray a second tier test.\" Because of the dramatic increase in variations identified using CMA, the Autism Consortium recommends that CMA should be included in the first tier of diagnostic testing for children with ASD symptoms who have no clear genetic cause.

Then she started talking about a new band, so Iris didn't have a chance to ask her any questions. It left her wondering: What is autism? How does someone get it? Can it be treated? What Is Autism? Autism is a developmental disorder that some people are born with it's not something you can catch or pass along to someone else. It affects the brain and makes communicating and interacting with other people difficult. People who have autism often have delayed language development, prefer to spend time alone, and show less interest in making friends. Another characteristic of autism is what some people describe as \"sensory overload\": Sounds seem louder, lights brighter, or smells stronger. Although many people with autism also have mental retardation, some are of average or high intelligence. Not everybody with autism has the exact same symptoms. Some people may have autism that is mild, whereas others may have autism that is more severe. Because it affects people differently, autism is known as a spectrum disorder. Two people with the same spectrum disorder may not act alike or have the same skills. As many as 1 in 150 people have autism, and it's more common in guys than in girls. Although doctors do not know exactly what causes it, many researchers believe autism is linked to differences in brain chemicals (neurotransmitters). These differences may be caused by something in our genes families who have one child with autism have a higher risk of having another child with autism or a similar disorder. Research suggests that in most cases it's probably a combination of genes that causes the disorder, not a single autism gene. Sometimes you may hear other developmental disorders mentioned in the same way as autism, such as Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and childhood disintegrative disorder. These disorders, along with autism, are all considered pervasive developmental disorders. People diagnosed with any of these disabilities have problems with social skills and communication. What Do Doctors Do? Autism is usually diagnosed at a very young age, when a child is 11/2 to 4 years old. There are no medical tests to determine whether someone has autism, although doctors may run various tests to rule out other causes of the symptoms. The best way to identify autism is to watch how a child behaves and communicates. Parents can help by telling the doctor how the child acts at home. Then a team of specialists which may include a psychologist, a neurologist, a psychiatrist, a speech therapist, and a developmental pediatrician will evaluate the child and compare levels of development and behavior with those of other kids the same age. Together, they will decide whether the child has autism or something else. How Is Autism Treated? Autism is not treated with surgery or medicine (although some people with autism may take medicine to improve certain symptoms, like aggressive behavior or attention problems). Instead, people who have autism are taught skills that will help them do the things that are difficult for them. The best results are usually seen with kids who begin treatment when they're very young and as soon as they're diagnosed. Special education programs that are tailored to the child's individual needs are usually the most effective form of treatment. These programs work on breaking down barriers by teaching the child to communicate (sometimes by pointing or using pictures or sign language) and to interact with others. Basic living skills, like how to cross a street safely or ask for directions, are also emphasized. A treatment program might also include any of the following: speech therapy, physical therapy, music therapy, changes in diet, medication, occupational therapy, and hearing or vision therapy. The same specialists who helped diagnose the condition usually work together to come up with the best combination of therapies to use in addition to the educational program. By the time they are teens, people with autism may be taking regular classes, attending special classes at the high school level, or attending a special school because of ongoing behavioral problems. What Are Teens With Autism Like? Because their brains process information differently, teens with autism may not act like other people you know (or each other, because the severity of symptoms of autism varies from person to person). They can have trouble talking and sometimes communicate with gestures instead of words. Some spend a lot of time alone, don't make friends easily (and may not act like they want to), and don't react to social cues like someone smiling or scowling at them. They often do not make eye contact when you are talking to them. They also find it hard to join in a game or activity with other people. If they are sensitive to sensory stimuli, they might draw back when hugged or startle easily when they hear a sudden noise, even if it's not very loud. Some teens with autism are passive and withdrawn, whereas others are overactive and may have tantrums or act aggressively when they are frustrated; it's important to realize that this is part of the disorder. Many teens with autism also continue to have intellectual limitations and learning problems. Because they don't have the ability to express emotions like anger and frustration in more acceptable ways, they might express themselves in ways that seem inappropriate. Many have difficulty coping with change and get anxious if their daily routine is altered. In more severe cases, a teen might fixate on different objects or ideas or display repetitive motions like rocking or hand flapping. One common misconception is that people with autism don't feel or show emotion. Although they can feel affection, they often don't express it the same way others do. To an outsider, this can come across as being cold or unemotional. Living With Autism Perhaps the most difficult part of coping with autism is interacting with other people every day. Because the brain of a teen with autism works a little differently, learning to communicate can be like learning a foreign language. This can make it hard for people with autism to express themselves or for others to understand them, so just talking with a classmate becomes stressful and frustrating. When even a casual conversation requires so much effort, it's hard to make friends. Teens with autism may have to think constantly about how other people will perceive their actions and make a conscious effort to pay attention to social cues the rest of us handle without even thinking. Basically, it takes a lot of work for someone with autism to do what comes naturally to most people. So if you know someone who has autism, be extra patient when you're talking with him or her. Don't expect a person with autism to look at things the same way you do. You should also realize that some behaviors you think are rude (like interrupting you when you're talking) come from a different perception of the world: It's tough for people who can't read social cues and recognize the natural pauses in a conversation to know when to jump in with their own thoughts. The more understanding and supportive you are, the more enjoyable your time together will be. Despite all the day-to-day hurdles, though, many people with autism lead fulfilling, happy lives on their own or with help from friends and family. Most teens with autism like school, and some can attend regular classes with everyone else. They have individual tastes and enjoy different activities, just like you do. Some people with autism go on to vocational school or college, get married, and have successful careers. Consider Temple Grandin, for example. Despite having autism, she was able to earn a PhD and become a college professor. She's even written a book about her experience called Thinking in Pictures: And Other Reports From My Life With Autism. Although she still struggles with the disorder almost daily, she leads a \"normal\" life, just like many other people with autism.

While expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded on Friday they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism.Worry about a vaccine link first arose in 1998 when a British physician, Dr Andrew Wakefield, published a medical journal article linking a particular type of autism and bowel disease to the measles vaccine.The study was later discredited. Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration, special master George Hastings Jr, wrote.But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case. Start of sidebar. Skip to end of sidebar. End of sidebar. Return to start of sidebar. The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the US Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court.Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines.The new ruling was welcomed by Dr Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had already had its day in science court and failed to hold up .But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them .On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government lawyers defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges, Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement.Meanwhile, in reaction to the concerns of parents, thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines in the United States.In Friday's action the court ruled in three different cases, each concluding that the preservative has no connection to autism.The trio of rulings can offer reassurance to parents scared about vaccinating their babies because of a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, are on the rise.The US Court of Claims is different from many other courts: The families involved did not have to prove the inoculations definitely caused the complex neurological disorder, just that they probably did.More than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation through the government's Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the rulings dealt with test cases to settle which if any claims had merit.Autism is best known for impairing a child's ability to communicate and interact. Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it's unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosis.

The clusters, including five in metropolitan Los Angeles and one in San Diego, are centered on regional developmental services centers in areas with highly educated parents, primarily Caucasians, with high incomes. In short, what they found were clusters of increased diagnostic rates for autism. In one respect, the results were not surprising because it has long been known that high-income, highly educated white parents are more likely to have their children diagnosed with autism and more likely to have them diagnosed at an early age. Looking at clustering is often a way to uncover leads about problems in the environment, said epidemiologist Irva Hertz-Picciotto, the senior author of the study. Mapping has a long history of being a way to get clues about causes of disease. She was, indeed, surprised by the findings -- not that there are clusters with parents with higher education, but that it was so consistent across the board. In virtually every cluster they identified, the rate of autism was about twice as high within the cluster as in adjacent regions. Hertz-Picciotto and her colleagues obtained birth records for 2,453,717 children born in the state between 1996 and 2000. By 2006, the children had all reached at least age 6, the age by which diagnosis of autism is generally accomplished. State records showed that about 9,900 autism cases were in the records of the Department of Developmental Services. The team reported in the journal Autism Research that they identified 10 clusters of autism among the 21 regional offices of the department and two potential clusters. The clusters were primarily in the high-population areas of Southern California and, to a lesser extent, in the San Francisco Bay area. The clusters were: -- The Westside Regional Center in Culver City, which serves western Los Angeles County, including Culver City, Inglewood and Santa Monica. -- The Harbor Regional Center, headquartered in Torrance, which serves southern Los Angeles County. -- The North Los Angeles County Regional Center, in Van Nuys, which serves the San Fernando and Antelope valleys. Two clusters were in this region. -- The South Central Regional Center in Los Angeles, which serves Compton and Gardena. -- The Regional Center of Orange County in Santa Ana. --The Regional Center of San Diego County, which serves San Diego and Imperial counties. -- The Golden Gate Regional Center in San Francisco, which serves San Francisco, Marin and San Mateo counties. There are two clusters in this area. -- The San Andreas Regional Center in Campbell, which serves Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Benito counties. Increased incidence was also noted in two other regions, the Central Valley Regional Center in Stockton and the Valley Mountain Regional Center in Fresno. The incidence of autism was not as high in those regions, however. Because the team analyzed birth locations and not the location of diagnosis, it is highly unlikely that the parents moved into the cluster regions to seek care, Hertz-Picciotto said. In the U.S., the children of older, white and highly educated parents are more likely to receive a diagnosis of autism or autism spectrum disorder, said lead author Karla C. Van Meter, who was a graduate student when the data were collected but is now at the Sonoma County Department of Public Health. For this reason, the clusters we found are probably not a result of a common environmental exposure. Instead, the differences in education, age and ethnicity of parents comparing births in the cluster versus those outside the cluster were striking enough to explain the clusters. The team is now looking elsewhere for possible causes. Some previous studies have hinted that exposure to pesticides may play a role and a study in Texas showed that exposure to mercury in the environment --but not in vaccines -- could be a causative agent. We are casting a wide net, looking at everything we can--pesticides, medical conditions in the mother, medications, flame retardants, etc., Hertz-Picciotto said. The problem, she conceded, is that, if the exposure is truly widespread, then linking it to autism will be very difficult. -- Thomas H. Maugh II Credit: UC Davis M.I.N.D.

World Autism Awareness Day is an event that falls annually on the 2nd of April. Unfortunately this year, this date happens to also be Good Friday. In order to be able to give full attention to the day, Autism Victoria decided to move the event back a day and celebrate on Thursday 1st April. We have been working on this event for the past 4 weeks and unfortunately last week the World body have advised a change of date to mid-March. As this notice has arrived far too late to change our plans we have decided to continue with the events in hand. Please join us on Thursday 1st April 2010 for a march from the Autism Victoria offices to the State Library. Once there, we will release 1000 multicoloured balloons into the sky to visually respect and represent the individuality of those on the Autism Spectrum. The balloons will also represent the number of Early Intervention hours the 1000 hours campaign is fighting for. Where? Autism Victoria 24 Drummond St, Carlton When? 12pm Thursday 1st April If you are not able to make it for the walk, please meet us at the State Library located at 328 Swanston St, Melbourne. We would really like to make an impact and to help to raise awareness of Autism Spectrum Disorders in the community. Please mark the date in your diary we look forward to seeing you there! Other Initiatives Planned Autism Victoria has also contacted a number of television programs including The Footy Show, Sunrise, The Morning Show and The Circle requesting presenters wear Autism Awareness Ribbons on their shows. We have also approached the producers of the Royal Children s Hospital Good Friday Appeal to request the ribbons been worn and to present a short piece on World Autism Awareness Day.

We received submissions from a wide cross-section of the community, from individuals and family members of those affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), to students, graphic designers, professionals in education and health sectors, and artists. The competition attracted national and international attention, and it is fantastic to see that that our conference has had such far-reaching effects to draw interest from individuals from such a wide variety of backgrounds. Due to the high standard of entries, we have invited all artists to showcase their submissions at the conference (at the Melbourne site as well as all our regional locations), which is sure be a highlight of the two-day event. We are pleased to present the winning logo entries for the 2010 Victorian Autism Conference. Our congratulations go out to our two winners, who have each been awarded a double pass to conference to be held on August 5th and 6th 2010. The winning logo was created by Josh Chan, and is displayed above. Our theme for this year s conference is Promoting Positive Practice Across the Spectrum, and an image submitted by Jaime Kelly, was selected to represent this year s theme. The image is available here. Keep an eye out for other conference material to be released soon! Conference Update In other conference news, the organising committee is very excited to confirm that planning is well underway for the Victorian Autism Conference, hosted by Autism Victoria, to be held on the 5th and 6th of August 2010. With Early Bird registrations opening mid-March and only a limited number of places, we recommend that you Save The Date now! With the aim of promoting lively discussion about strategies and information on Autism Spectrum Disorders to enhance the quality of life of families and individuals affected by ASD, this two day event, targeted at families, individuals and professionals with an interest in ASDs is shaping up to be a major event on the disability calendar. Whilst the conference itself is being conducted in Melbourne, it will also be held simultaneously in several key regional centres across the state to ensure that we maximise participation. With the assistance of live streaming and partner organisations, families and professionals living in regional or rural areas won t miss out on being involved in this exciting event. It is anticipated that we will be announcing the key regional satellite centres in the next Conference Update, so keep an eye out for the next eSpectrum! The VAC organising committee has been working tirelessly to ensure that this year s conference program is a spectacular success, and we are delighted to announce the involvement of Dr Richard Eisenmajer, Wendy Lawson and Chris Glennon. The call for presentations closed late February, and we are looking forward to shortly announcing the involvement of numerous other exciting speakers in the two-day program. Finally, we would like to announce some exciting opportunities for individuals and organisations to become involved in the conference via various sponsorship programs. Sponsorship is an investment that will yield a positive and rewarding return for you and your organisation. With significant exposure across the state, sponsorship involvement in this event presents an excellent opportunity to network and promote your business throughout the ASD and broader communities. We would encourage anyone interested in sponsorship opportunities to contact the committee at conference@autismvictoria.org.au. Campaign for Change - State and Federal Elections 4th March 2010 Call for Campaign Activists This is an unusual year within a political context with both the Victorian and Federal Governments facing an election. Interestingly, although Labour looks safe at a Federal level the State government is looking somewhat shakier. This provides us with an opportunity to try to influence the policies of all major parties as they recognise that small shifts may determine the election outcome. Autism Victoria intends to develop and submit position papers to State and Federal Government. To support this approach and to ensure we develop comprehensive and detailed position papers we invite our members to become involved in the process. I would like to stress that this work is not for the faint hearted as it requires much effort and commitment if we are to achieve any meaningful outcome. It will also mean the group will need to liaise with and co-ordinate action with other pressure groups at times. To this end the first stage is to gauge interest from members who may wish to come together and work on specific topics. I am keen to seek expressions of interest from members in the following areas: Early Childhood services Transition to and through school Current funding models for school support Transition to work and higher education Employment support Housing and Accommodation options Recreation and social networking Please note, subject to the level of interest, each working group will be required to develop specific program responses and to cost same. This will form the basis of the Autism Victoria election document and then the groups both individually and as a whole will develop a broad promotional campaign around the document. Please advise your expression of interest by email to ceo@autismvictoria.org.au. Please note the cut off date for expressions of interest will be the 31st of March.

A Fair Go For All Letter-Writing Campaign 1st March 2010 Help increase funding for disability support services in Victoria A letter writing campaign has taken off to support the state-wide campaign A Fair Go For All. The letters aim to raise political awareness of the urgent need to increase funding of disability support services. With the State Budget (May) and 2010 State election (November) just around the corner, every letter sent will make a difference. We are calling on our members, support people, friends and professionals to Sign and Send letters to help support better outcomes for people with a disability. Letters to Community Services Minister Lisa Neville and Premier John Brumby aim to increase pressure on the current government to act on the findings of the Price Review: Out-of-Home Disability Services and address the true cost of providing support services. It also aims to apply pressure to respond to the recommendations of the Parliamentary inquiry into supported accommodation for people with a disability and/or mental illness. Now is the time to show your support. Current media attention on disability and the government s own data help the case for increased funding. Your letter, along with the hundreds of others from across Victoria, will make the difference. You can download example letters at the links below: Letter to Premier Brumby calling for A Fair Go For All Letter to Minister Neville calling for A Fair Go For All 2009 ASD Research Forum Proceedings available now! 16th November 2009 The 2009 ASD Research Forum was held on Tuesday 10th November. Around 100 delegates had the pleasure of attending to hear a fascinating summary of the latest research into the genetics of autism, presented by our keynote speaker, Dr Natasha Brown. The forum also provided an opportunity for participants to hear about some of the latest research findings in the autism field across Victoria. Please click here for a copy of the 2009 ASD Research Forum Proceedings. The Autism Victoria Service Directory 3rd April 2009 The Autism Victoria Service Directory is in desperate need of both updating and expanding! The service directory is one of the few central information sources in Victoria that families, individuals and professionals can utilise to discover or share ASD services that range from ASD specific counsellors and therapists to hairdressers or naturopaths who have experience with ASD children. The service directory has evolved from parents, carers and individuals wanting to share a helpful service or professional with the wider Victorian ASD community. Over the years the service directory has become a very useful tool for many people, as it can take the leg work out of navigating through the service maze that is not ASD specific. As awareness of ASD grows and more services designed to benefit those on the spectrum become available, it is important that Autism Victoria s service directory grows also, as we are often the first port of call for parents or individuals with a recent diagnosis. More than half of the 300 odd calls a week that come through Autism Victoria s info-line concern accessing our service directory. So if you are already on our service directory, we would greatly appreciate it if you could fill out a service directory application form. If you do not want to fill out the whole form just simply list your contacts and service offered on page 3, but we have tried to make the form as brief and simple as possible! If you know of anyone that you think should be on the service directory please either pass the application form onto them or ask them to contact the infoline on 1300 308 699 or email.

Autism528 null What is Occupational Therapy (O.T.)?Occupational Therapy aims to maximize a child s participation in home, school, play and leisure activities i.e. activities of daily living. Occupational Therapy is important when a child s ability to participate in/ or perform these tasks is affected or compromised by illness, disease, disability or disorder. How Occupational Therapy Helps the Autistic Child Children are assessed in terms of age-appropriate life tasks. Occupational Therapy addresses areas that interfere with the child's ability to function in such life tasks. An occupational therapist would assess the child s fine motor skills, coordination and self-help skills. (eating with utensils, dressing etc) The occupational therapist would also look at how the child responds to and uses what he sees, hears, feels, tastes and smells. The occupational therapist would identify the child s impairments and provide intervention services to develop skills in these identified areas. Occupational Therapy benefits a child with autism by attempting to improve the quality of life for the individual through successful and meaningful experiences. This may be accomplished through the maintenance, improvement, or introduction of skills necessary for the child to participate as independently as possible in meaningful life activities. These are some of the skills occupational therapy may foster: daily living skills, such as toilet training, dressing, brushing teeth, and other grooming skills fine motor skills required for holding objects while handwriting or cutting with scissors gross motor skills used for walking or riding a bike sitting, posture, or perceptual skills, such as telling the differences between colors, shapes, and sizes visual skills for reading and writing play, coping, self-help, problem solving, communication, and social skills By working on these skills during occupational therapy, a child with autism may also do the following: develop peer and adult relationships learn how to focus on tasks learn how to delay gratification express feelings in more appropriate ways engage in play with peers learn how to self-regulate And this from Andrea Roche, ASD Unit Teacher Scoil Mhuire Coolcotts Wexford. The Benefits of Occupational Therapy for children with Autism. In Scoil Mhuire Wexford we are lucky enough to have a purpose built, fully equipped occupational therapy room. We are also fortunate enough to have a group of dedicated parents from the Cottage Autism Network who have raised enough funds to employ an occupational therapist who works with children in our school and in St Senans, Enniscorthy and members of C.A.N county wide. This has provided us with a consistent occupational therapy service. Each child has individual sensory and motor needs and so has an individual programme to meet these needs. The sensory levels of the children can change from day to day and moment to moment and because our staff are familiar with the recommendations and equipment, they can immediately react to calm a child who is over stimulated or vice versa. The recommendations are carried out not only during occupational therapy sessions but throughout the day when needed. Weighted jackets, weight bearing exercises, fidget toys, structured movement breaks along with consistent behavioural plans and vigilant staff have helped to reduce significantly inappropriate behaviour. These strategies have been a huge benefit to the children in aiding concentration, listening skills and participation in group work. We have also seen improvements in fine motor co-ordination, which is an area of great difficulty for our children. The use of slant boards, weights, pencil grips and specific fine motor exercise have aided this. There is no doubt that occupational therapy is of huge benefit to children with sensory processing problems. We have found when it is used in conjunction with consistent behavioural plans by staff who are aware of the difficulties facing children with autism, the benefits are even greater.

In 1943 Dr. Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital studied a group of 11 children and introduced the label early infantile autism into the English language. At the same time a German scientist, Dr. Hans Asperger, described a milder form of the disorder that became known as Asperger syndrome. Thus these two disorders were described and are today listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision)1 as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). All these disorders are characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior. The autism spectrum disorders can often be reliably detected by the age of 3 years, and in some cases as early as 18 months.2 Studies suggest that many children eventually may be accurately identified by the age of 1 year or even younger. The appearance of any of the warning signs of ASD is reason to have a child evaluated by a professional specializing in these disorders. Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child. In some cases, the baby seemed different from birth, unresponsive to people or focusing intently on one item for long periods of time. The first signs of an ASD can also appear in children who seem to have been developing normally. When an engaging, babbling toddler suddenly becomes silent, withdrawn, self-abusive, or indifferent to social overtures, something is wrong. Research has shown that parents are usually correct about noticing developmental problems, although they may not realize the specific nature or degree of the problem. The pervasive developmental disorders, or autism spectrum disorders, range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, to a milder form, Asperger syndrome. If a child has symptoms of either of these disorders, but does not meet the specific criteria for either, the diagnosis is called pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Other rare, very severe disorders that are included in the autism spectrum disorders are Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder. This brochure will focus on classic autism, PDD-NOS, and Asperger syndrome, with brief descriptions of Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder on the following page. Rare Autism Spectrum Disorders Rett Syndrome Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses -- she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech. Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.* Childhood Disintegrative Disorder Very few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome. The loss of such skills as vocabulary are more dramatic in CDD than they are in classical autism. The diagnosis requires extensive and pronounced losses involving motor, language, and social skills.*** CDD is also accompanied by loss of bowel and bladder control and oftentimes seizures and a very low IQ. *Rett syndrome.

Autism, 2002; ***Volkmar RM Childhood disintegrative disorder: Results of the DSM-IV autism field trial. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 1995; 34: 1092-1095. What Are the Autism Spectrum Disorders? The autism spectrum disorders are more common in the pediatric population than are some better known disorders such as diabetes, spinal bifida, or Down syndrome.2 Prevalence studies have been done in several states and also in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Asia. Prevalence estimates range from 2 to 6 per 1,000 children. This wide range of prevalence points to a need for earlier and more accurate screening for the symptoms of ASD. The earlier the disorder is diagnosed, the sooner the child can be helped through treatment interventions. Pediatricians, family physicians, daycare providers, teachers, and parents may initially dismiss signs of ASD, optimistically thinking the child is just a little slow and will catch up. Although early intervention has a dramatic impact on reducing symptoms and increasing a child's ability to grow and learn new skills, it is estimated that only 50 percent of children are diagnosed before kindergarten. All children with ASD demonstrate deficits in 1) social interaction, 2) verbal and nonverbal communication, and 3) repetitive behaviors or interests. In addition, they will often have unusual responses to sensory experiences, such as certain sounds or the way objects look. Each of these symptoms runs the gamut from mild to severe. They will present in each individual child differently. For instance, a child may have little trouble learning to read but exhibit extremely poor social interaction. Each child will display communication, social, and behavioral patterns that are individual but fit into the overall diagnosis of ASD. Children with ASD do not follow the typical patterns of child development. In some children, hints of future problems may be apparent from birth. In most cases, the problems in communication and social skills become more noticeable as the child lags further behind other children the same age. Some other children start off well enough. Oftentimes between 12 and 36 months old, the differences in the way they react to people and other unusual behaviors become apparent. Some parents report the change as being sudden, and that their children start to reject people, act strangely, and lose language and social skills they had previously acquired. In other cases, there is a plateau, or leveling, of progress so that the difference between the child with autism and other children the same age becomes more noticeable. ASD is defined by a certain set of behaviors that can range from the very mild to the severe. The following possible indicators of ASD were identified on the Public Health Training Network Webcast, Autism Among Us.3 Possible Indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorders Does not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of age Does not speak one word by 16 months Does not combine two words by 2 years Does not respond to name Loses language or social skills Some Other Indicators Poor eye contact Doesn't seem to know how to play with toys Excessively lines up toys or other objects Is attached to one particular toy or object Doesn't smile At times seems to be hearing impaired Social Symptoms From the start, typically developing infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most children with ASD seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem indifferent to other people, and often seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although children with ASD are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to read. To parents, it may seem as if their child is not attached at all Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of the expected and typical attachment behavior. Children with ASD also are slower in learning to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues -- whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace -- may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, Come here always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with ASD have difficulty seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with ASD may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. Although not universal, it is common for people with ASD also to have difficulty regulating their emotions. This can take the form of immature behavior such as crying in class or verbal outbursts that seem inappropriate to those around them. The individual with ASD might also be disruptive and physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. They have a tendency to lose control, particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They may at times break things, attack others, or hurt themselves. In their frustration, some bang their heads, pull their hair, or bite their arms. Communication Difficulties By age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is \"no.\" Some children diagnosed with ASD remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of ASD coo and babble during the first few months of life, but they soon stop. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Some children may learn to use communication systems such as pictures or sign language. Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. They seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some ASD children parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Although many children with no ASD go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3. Some children only mildly affected may exhibit slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining a conversation. The give and take of normal conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. Another difficulty is often the inability to understand body language, tone of voice, or phrases of speech. They might interpret a sarcastic expression such as Oh, that's just great as meaning it really IS great. While it can be hard to understand what ASD children are saying, their body language is also difficult to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Also, their tone of voice fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Some children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, failing to pick up on the kid-speak that is common in their peers. Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with ASD are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, they may simply scream or grab what they want. Until they are taught better ways to express their needs, ASD children do whatever they can to get through to others. As people with ASD grow up, they can become increasingly aware of their difficulties in understanding others and in being understood. As a result they may become anxious or depressed. Repetitive Behaviors Although children with ASD usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or walking on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position. As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, rather than using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of the toys, the child may be tremendously upset. ASD children need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine -- in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, going to school at a certain time and by the same route -- can be extremely disturbing. Perhaps order and sameness lend some stability in a world of confusion. Repetitive behavior sometimes takes the form of a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners, train schedules, or lighthouses. Often there is great interest in numbers, symbols, or science topics. Problems That may Accompany ASD Sensory problems. When children's perceptions are accurate, they can learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory information is faulty, the child's experiences of the world can be confusing. Many ASD children are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin almost unbearable. Some sounds -- a vacuum cleaner, a ringing telephone, a sudden storm, even the sound of waves lapping the shoreline -- will cause these children to cover their ears and scream. In ASD, the brain seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some ASD children are oblivious to extreme cold or pain. An ASD child may fall and break an arm, yet never cry. Another may bash his head against a wall and not wince, but a light touch may make the child scream with alarm. Mental retardation. Many children with ASD have some degree of mental impairment. When tested, some areas of ability may be normal, while others may be especially weak. For example, a child with ASD may do well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low scores on the language subtests. Seizures. One in four children with ASD develops seizures, often starting either in early childhood or adolescence.4 Seizures, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, can produce a temporary loss of consciousness (a blackout ), a body convulsion, unusual movements, or staring spells. Sometimes a contributing factor is a lack of sleep or a high fever. An EEG (electroencephalogram -- recording of the electric currents developed in the brain by means of electrodes applied to the scalp) can help confirm the seizure's presence. In most cases, seizures can be controlled by a number of medicines called anticonvulsants. The dosage of the medication is adjusted carefully so that the least possible amount of medication will be used to be effective. Fragile X syndrome. This disorder is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. It was so named because one part of the X chromosome has a defective piece that appears pinched and fragile when under a microscope. Fragile X syndrome affects about two to five percent of people with ASD. It is important to have a child with ASD checked for Fragile X, especially if the parents are considering having another child. For an unknown reason, if a child with ASD also has Fragile X, there is a one-in-two chance that boys born to the same parents will have the syndrome.5 Other members of the family who may be contemplating having a child may also wish to be checked for the syndrome. Tuberous Sclerosis. Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain as well as in other vital organs. It has a consistently strong association with ASD. One to four percent of people with ASD also have tuberous sclerosis.6 The Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders Although there are many concerns about labeling a young child with an ASD, the earlier the diagnosis of ASD is made, the earlier needed interventions can begin. Evidence over the last 15 years indicates that intensive early intervention in optimal educational settings for at least 2 years during the preschool years results in improved outcomes in most young children with ASD.2 In evaluating a child, clinicians rely on behavioral characteristics to make a diagnosis. Some of the characteristic behaviors of ASD may be apparent in the first few months of a child's life, or they may appear at any time during the early years. For the diagnosis, problems in at least one of the areas of communication, socialization, or restricted behavior must be present before the age of 3. The diagnosis requires a two-stage process. The first stage involves developmental screening during well child check-ups; the second stage entails a comprehensive evaluation by a multidisciplinary team.7 Screening A well child check-up should include a developmental screening test. If your child's pediatrician does not routinely check your child with such a test, ask that it be done. Your own observations and concerns about your child's development will be essential in helping to screen your child.7 Reviewing family videotapes, photos, and baby albums can help parents remember when each behavior was first noticed and when the child reached certain developmental milestones. Several screening instruments have been developed to quickly gather information about a child's social and communicative development within medical settings. Among them are the Checklist of Autism in Toddlers (CHAT),8 the modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT),9 the Screening Tool for Autism in Two-Year-Olds (STAT),10 and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)11 (for children 4 years of age and older). Some screening instruments rely solely on parent responses to a questionnaire, and some rely on a combination of parent report and observation. Key items on these instruments that appear to differentiate children with autism from other groups before the age of 2 include pointing and pretend play. Screening instruments do not provide individual diagnosis but serve to assess the need for referral for possible diagnosis of ASD. These screening methods may not identify children with mild ASD, such as those with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome. During the last few years, screening instruments have been devised to screen for Asperger syndrome and higher functioning autism. The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ),12 the Australian Scale for Asperger's Syndrome,13 and the most recent, the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST),14 are some of the instruments that are reliable for identification of school-age children with Asperger syndrome or higher functioning autism. These tools concentrate on social and behavioral impairments in children without significant language delay. If, following the screening process or during a routine well child check-up, your child's doctor sees any of the possible indicators of ASD, further evaluation is indicated. Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation The second stage of diagnosis must be comprehensive in order to accurately rule in or rule out an ASD or other developmental problem. This evaluation may be done by a multidisciplinary team that includes a psychologist, a neurologist, a psychiatrist, a speech therapist, or other professionals who diagnose children with ASD. Because ASD's are complex disorders and may involve other neurological or genetic problems, a comprehensive evaluation should entail neurologic and genetic assessment, along with in-depth cognitive and language testing.7 In addition, measures developed specifically for diagnosing autism are often used. These include the Autism Diagnosis Interview-Revised (ADI-R)15 and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-G).16 The ADI-R is a structured interview that contains over 100 items and is conducted with a caregiver. It consists of four main factors -- the child's communication, social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and age-of-onset symptoms. The ADOS-G is an observational measure used to press for socio-communicative behaviors that are often delayed, abnormal, or absent in children with ASD. Still another instrument often used by professionals is the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS).17 It aids in evaluating the child's body movements, adaptation to change, listening response, verbal communication, and relationship to people. It is suitable for use with children over 2 years of age. The examiner observes the child and also obtains relevant information from the parents. The child's behavior is rated on a scale based on deviation from the typical behavior of children of the same age. Two other tests that should be used to assess any child with a developmental delay are a formal audiologic hearing evaluation and a lead screening. Although some hearing loss can co-occur with ASD, some children with ASD may be incorrectly thought to have such a loss. In addition, if the child has suffered from an ear infection, transient hearing loss can occur. Lead screening is essential for children who remain for a long period of time in the oral-motor stage in which they put any and everything into their mouths. Children with an autistic disorder usually have elevated blood lead levels.7 Customarily, an expert diagnostic team has the responsibility of thoroughly evaluating the child, assessing the child's unique strengths and weaknesses, and determining a formal diagnosis. The team will then meet with the parents to explain the results of the evaluation. Although parents may have been aware that something was not quite right with their child, when the diagnosis is given, it is a devastating blow. At such a time, it is hard to stay focused on asking questions. But while members of the evaluation team are together is the best opportunity the parents will have to ask questions and get recommendations on what further steps they should take for their child. Learning as much as possible at this meeting is very important, but it is helpful to leave this meeting with the name or names of professionals who can be contacted if the parents have further questions. Available Aids When your child has been evaluated and diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, you may feel inadequate to help your child develop to the fullest extent of his or her ability. As you begin to look at treatment options and at the types of aid available for a child with a disability, you will find out that there is help for you. It is going to be difficult to learn and remember everything you need to know about the resources that will be most helpful. Write down everything. If you keep a notebook, you will have a foolproof method of recalling information. Keep a record of the doctors' reports and the evaluation your child has been given so that his or her eligibility for special programs will be documented. Learn everything you can about special programs for your child; the more you know, the more effectively you can advocate. For every child eligible for special programs, each state guarantees special education and related services. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a Federally mandated program that assures a free and appropriate public education for children with diagnosed learning deficits. Usually children are placed in public schools and the school district pays for all necessary services. These will include, as needed, services by a speech therapist, occupational therapist, school psychologist, social worker, school nurse, or aide. By law, the public schools must prepare and carry out a set of instruction goals, or specific skills, for every child in a special education program. The list of skills is known as the child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). The IEP is an agreement between the school and the family on the child's goals. When your child's IEP is developed, you will be asked to attend the meeting. There will be several people at this meeting, including a special education teacher, a representative of the public schools who is knowledgeable about the program, other individuals invited by the school or by you (you may want to bring a relative, a child care provider, or a supportive close friend who knows your child well). Parents play an important part in creating the program, as they know their child and his or her needs best. Once your child's IEP is developed, a meeting is scheduled once a year to review your child's progress and to make any alterations to reflect his or her changing needs. If your child is under 3 years of age and has special needs, he or she should be eligible for an early intervention program; this program is available in every state. Each state decides which agency will be the lead agency in the early intervention program. The early intervention services are provided by workers qualified to care for toddlers with disabilities and are usually in the child's home or a place familiar to the child. The services provided are written into an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) that is reviewed at least once every 6 months. The plan will describe services that will be provided to the child, but will also describe services for parents to help them in daily activities with their child and for siblings to help them adjust to having a brother or sister with ASD. There is a list of resources at the back of the brochure that will be helpful to you as you look for programs for your child. Continue to Part Two...

Researchers offered about 933 people aged 13 months to 22 years who had been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder three genetic tests: G-banded karyotype testing, fragile X testing or chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), which has been available only for the past few years. Karyotype tests identified chromosomal aberrations associated with autism in about 2 percent of patients, while the fragile X genetic mutation was found in about 0.5 percent of patients. CMA detected chromosomal abnormalities in slightly more than 7 percent of patients, making it the best available genetic test for autism spectrum disorders, the study authors said. \"The CMA test alone has triple the detection rate of karyotyping or fragile X,\" said co-senior author Bai-Lin Wu, director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston. \"CMA should be added to first-tier genetic testing for autism spectrum disorders.\" The study appeared online March 15 and will be published in the April print issue of Pediatrics. \"When parents have a child diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, one of the first questions they often ask is 'how did this happen?' \" said Dr. Robert Marion, a pediatric geneticist at Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. \"In the vast majority of cases, we believe there is at least a genetic predisposition to autism, but the ability to identify a specific genetic cause has been very elusive,\" Marion said. \"Part of that is because of the technology that's been available. A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\" Standard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said. In karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium. Like karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said. \"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\" While both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted. The main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said. If tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.) But if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said. Still, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those. There are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases. But that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said. \"CMA is better, but it's not great,\" Marion said. \"The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies. That is very frustrating.\" More information The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism. This article: Copyright 2010 HealthDay.

View your profile Treatments An early, intensive, appropriate treatment program will greatly improve the outlook for most young children with autism. Most programs will build on the interests of the child in a highly structured schedule of constructive activities. Visual aids are often helpful.Treatment is most successful when it is geared toward the child's particular needs. An experienced specialist or team should design the program for the individual child. A variety of therapies are available, including:Applied behavior analysis (ABA)MedicationsOccupational therapyPhysical therapySpeech-language therapySensory integration and vision therapy are also common, but there is little research supporting their effectiveness. The best treatment plan may use a combination of techniques.APPLIED BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS (ABA)This program is for younger children with an autism spectrum disorder. It can be effective in some cases. ABA uses a one-on-one teaching approach that reinforces the practice of various skills. The goal is to get the child close to normal developmental functioning.ABA programs are usually done in a child's home under the supervision of a behavioral psychologist. These programs can be very expensive and have not been widely adopted by school systems. Parents often must seek funding and staffing from other sources, which can be hard to find in many communities.TEACCHAnother program is called the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH). TEACCH was developed as a statewide program in North Carolina. It uses picture schedules and other visual cues that help the child work independently and organize and structure their environments.Though TEACCH tries to improve a child's adaptation and skills, it also accepts the problems associated with autism spectrum disorders. Unlike ABA programs, TEACCH programs do not expect children to achieve typical development with treatment.MEDICINEMedicines are often used to treat behavior or emotional problems that people with autism may have, including:AggressionAnxietyAttention problemsExtreme compulsions that the child cannot stopHyperactivityImpulsivenessIrritabilityMood swingsOutburstsSleep difficultyTantrumsCurrently, only risperidone is approved to treat children ages 5 - 16 for the irritability and aggression that can occur with autism. Other medicines that may also be used include SSRIs, divalproex sodium and other mood stabilizers, and possibly stimulants such as methylphenidate. There is no medicine that treats the underlying problem of autism.DIETSome children with autism appear to respond to a gluten-free or casein-free diet. Gluten is found in foods containing wheat, rye, and barley. Casein is found in milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Not all experts agree that dietary changes will make a difference, and not all studies of this method have shown positive results.If you are considering these or other dietary changes, talk to both a doctor who specializes in the digestive system (gastroenterologist) and a registered dietitian. You want to be sure that the child is still receiving enough calories, nutrients, and a balanced diet.OTHER APPROACHESBeware that there are widely publicized treatments for autism that do not have scientific support, and reports of \"miracle cures\" that do not live up to expectations. If your child has autism, it may be helpful to talk with other parents of children with autism and autism specialists. Follow the progress of research in this area, which is rapidly developing.At one time, there was enormous excitement about using secretin infusions. Now, after many studies have been conducted in many laboratories, it's possible that secretin is not effective after all. However, research continues.

Defining Autism Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life and is the result of a neurological disorder that affects the normal functioning of the brain, impacting development in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Both children and adults with autism typically show difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. One should keep in mind however, that autism is a spectrum disorder and it affects each individual differently and at varying degrees - this is why early diagnosis is so crucial. By learning the signs, a child can begin benefiting from one of the many specialized intervention programs. Autism is one of five disorders that falls under the umbrella of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), a category of neurological disorders characterized by \"severe and pervasive impairment in several areas of development.\" The five disorders under PDD are: Autistic Disorder Asperger's Disorder Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD) Rett's Disorder PDD-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) Each of these disorders has specific diagnostic criteria which been outlined in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). Prevalence of Autism Autism is the most common of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders, affecting an estimated 1 in 150 births (Centers for Disease Control Prevention, 2007). Roughly translated, this means as many as 1.5 million Americans today are believed to have some form of autism. And this number is on the rise. Based on statistics from the U.S. Department of Education and other governmental agencies, autism is growing at a startling rate of 10-17 percent per year. At this rate, the ASA estimates that the prevalence of autism could reach 4 million Americans in the next decade. Autism knows no racial, ethnic, social boundaries, family income, lifestyle, or educational levels and can affect any family, and any child. And although the overall incidence of autism is consistent around the globe, it is four times more prevalent in boys than in girls. The above information is from the Autism Society of America.

Autism57 http://www.ont-autism.uoguelph.ca/what_is_autism.shtml Autism is a very confusing diagnostic label. The term is used both for a more specific syndrome of abnormal development and also for a much broader range of related disorders. As their causes are not yet known for sure, these disorders are defined in terms of sets of behavioural symptoms which are not the same in every affected person. If we were to enter a room full of persons who had been diagnosed with autism, we would be struck far more by the differences than by the similarities among them. After a great deal of research interest during the 1990s, we can now understand several things about autism more clearly. There is general agreement that, in its full-blown form, autism involves a triad of impairments?in social interaction, in communication and the use of language, and in limited imagination as reflected in restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour and activities. Those who combine all three impairments to a marked degree have the classic form of autism, so named by Leo Kanner, a psychistrist at Johns Hopkins University, in 1943. But much larger numbers have some of the traits of autism. The idea of a spectrum or continuum of autism disorders is helpful to include persons who have some if not all the symptoms of autism, sometimes in combination with other disabilities. Asperger?s Syndrome, defined in 1944 but a diagnostic label not widely used until the 1990s, may affect seven times as many people as classic autism. We now know that autism consists of disorders of development of brain functions. It is not a mental illness. Nor is it psychogenic, caused by anything in a child?s psychological environment. Earlier notions, that autism was caused by emotional deprivation or emotional stress, have long been discredited. Autism affects families in all races, cultures and socioeconomic groups and is found everywhere in the world. More males than females are affected, the ratio being 4:1 with classic autism, 9:1 with Asperger?s Syndrome. For a diagnosis of autism, the main symptoms must be clear before the age of 3 years. The disabilities are lifelong and there is no known cure, though careful training and sensitive support can bring improvements. The autistic impairments may be associated with cognitive disabilities. Two-thirds of those with classic autism (or Kanner syndrome) are severely to mildly handicapped in cognition and intellect. Most people with Asperger?s have average to higher IQ. Across the autistic spectrum, perhaps 10 per cent have distinctive abilities?in such fields as art, music, mathematics or memory?and are called autistic savants. (The proportion of people with such special abilities in the whole population is only one per cent). Websites concerned with autism all present some information about the disorders, though some do not make clear the distinction between the more specific Autistic Disorder and the whole spectrum of autism disorders.

But she wouldn\ufffdt have it any other way. In 1950, Grandin was diagnosed with autism. The disorder, seen in about 1 in 110 U.S. kids, spans a range of complex neurodevelopmental problems: an inability to make social connections, language difficulties and bizarre, repetitive behaviors. There is no known cause or cure. Some children may have a mild form of the disorder, yet have difficulties holding down a job in adulthood.

U.S. | HealthThe special U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that vaccines could not have caused the autism of an Oregon boy, William Mead, ending his family's quest for reimbursement.\"The Meads believe that thimerosal-containing vaccines caused William's regressive autism. As explained below, the undersigned finds that the Meads have not presented a scientifically sound theory,\" Special Master George Hastings, a former tax claims expert at the Department of Justice, wrote in his ruling.In February 2009, the court ruled against three families who claimed vaccines caused their children's autism, saying they had been \"misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment\".The families sought payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault system that has a $2.5 billion fund built up from a 75-cent-per-dose tax on vaccines.Instead of judges, three \"special masters\" heard the three test cases representing thousands of other petitioners.They asked whether a combination vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, children's symptoms.MYSTERIOUS CONDITIONMore than 5,300 cases were filed by parents who believed vaccines may have caused autism in their children. The no-fault payout system is meant to protect vaccine makers from costly lawsuits that drove many out of the vaccine-making business.Autism is a mysterious condition that affects as many as one in 110 U.S. children. The so-called spectrum ranges from mild Asperger's Syndrome to severe mental retardation and social disability, and there is no cure or good treatment.The U.S. Institute of Medicine has reported several times that no link can be found between vaccines and autism.Supporters of the scientific community welcomed the ruling.\"It's time to move forward and look for the real causes of autism,\" said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation. \"There is not a bottomless pit of money with which to fund autism science. We have to use our scarce resources wisely.\"But advocates for the idea that vaccines are dangerous said they would not give up. \"We hope that Congress will intervene in what is clearly a miscarriage of justice to vaccine-injured children,\" said Jim Moody of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety.Autism Speaks, another advocacy group, said it would also not completely abandon the theory that vaccines might cause autism.The organization said it would invest \"in research to determine whether subsets of individuals might be at increased risk for developing autism symptoms following vaccination.\"But the group also said it was clear that if such a link did exist, it would be rare.\"While we have great empathy for all parents of children with autism, it is important to keep in mind that, given the present state of the science, the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement.(Editing by Philip Barbara) U.S. mental retardation Oregon Autism Speaks Congress U.S. Court of Federal Claims WASHINGTON Reuters National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program William Mead Meads William George Hastings Department of Justice Autism Science Foundation Alison Singer Meads U.S. Institute of Medicine Jim Moody Philip Barbara Coalition for Vaccine Safety.Autism Speaks 4182010031 www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62B41820100312 418201003 Autism6 http://www.autism-resources.com/ o o o o o AUTISM RESOURCES o o o o o Welcome to Autism Resources, with information and links regarding the developmental disabilities autism and Asperger's Syndrome.

The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism. The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available. The new ruling was welcomed by Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who said the autism theory had already had its day in science court and failed to hold up. But the controversy has cast a pall over vaccines, causing some parents to avoid them, he noted, it's very hard to unscare people after you have scared them. On the other side of the issue, a group backing the parents' theory charged that the vaccine court was more interested in government policy than protecting children. The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court. Government attorneys defend a government program, using government-funded science, before government judges, Rebecca Estepp, of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety said in a statement. SafeMinds, another group supporting the parents, expressed disappointment at the new ruling. The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science and poorly designed and highly controversial epidemiology, the goup said. The advocacy group Autism Speaks said the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism. Thus, we strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children to protect them from serious childhood diseases.

(Photo by FRED ADAMS/FOR THE TIMeS LEADER) By Mary Therese Biebel | Times Leader He squirms. He twists. He bounces up and down. Anyone can see it\ufffds not easy for 4-year-old Eric Fritz to sit quietly at the little table in his preschool. \ufffdC\ufffdmon, Eric. Stop,\ufffd a therapeutic support staff worker says, gently massaging the little boy\ufffds shoulders and trying to hold his torso still. It\ufffds snack time at the Wyoming Valley Children\ufffds Association in Forty Fort \ufffd and it\ufffds time for Eric to pay attention to speech pathologist Terry Tokach, who has put Goldfish crackers, pumpernickel pretzels and pieces of shortbread cookie on the table. \ufffdWhat do you want, Eric?\ufffd Tokach repeats again and again, holding out her hand. \ufffdWhich one do you want?\ufffd She doesn\ufffdt expect Eric to say \ufffdcracker\ufffd or \ufffdpretzel\ufffd \ufffd the little boy, who was diagnosed with autism when he was going on 2 years old \ufffd doesn\ufffdt communicate verbally. But, Tokach hopes he will communicate another way, by picking up a picture of a \ufffdcracker\ufffd or \ufffdpretzel\ufffd and handing it to her. Again and again, he simply grabs at the pretzels and crackers (not the cookies, which he doesn\ufffdt seem to like.) Again and again, Tokach steers his hand toward the appropriate picture. When he finally hands her one, she rewards him with food and praise. \ufffdGood job, Eric,\ufffd she tells the child, \ufffdI like it when you \ufffdtalk\ufffd to me. I like it when you look at me, too.\ufffd A reluctance to engage in eye contact is one symptom of autism, a developmental disorder that, according to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, affects 1 in 110 children to some extent. Delayed verbal skills and tendencies toward hyperactivity and repetitive motions are other symptoms. But, it was a lack of eye contact that first prompted Eric\ufffds father, also named Eric, to suspect something was amiss. \ufffdMy husband noticed he wasn\ufffdt getting enough eye interaction,\ufffd Lori Fritz explained during an interview in the family\ufffds Nanticoke home. Young Eric also \ufffdhad a few words, but they went away,\ufffd his mother said. \ufffdHis speech isn\ufffdt there, so we do signing.\ufffd Eric knows how to ask his parents for things he wants through sign language. The gesture for \ufffdmilk\ufffd looks like you\ufffdre moving your hands to milk a cow. The gesture for \ufffdbook\ufffd looks as if you\ufffdre opening the covers of a book. \ufffdEric\ufffds come so far,\ufffd Lori Fritz, 37, said with a smile as Eric, her firstborn, climbed over his father\ufffds lap and onto his shoulders, and leaned over to do a jigsaw puzzle on the floor. \ufffdHe\ufffds good at puzzles,\ufffd said the elder Eric, who is 38. The couple\ufffds younger son, David, 2, favors dinosaurs, and played with several colorful ones on a recent evening. \ufffdDavid likes to do everything Eric does, and Eric is usually pretty tolerant of David,\ufffd said the boys\ufffd father, who gave up a job in sales and service to become \ufffdMr. Mom.\ufffd Eric\ufffds job required out-of-state travel to cover a large territory, which caused him to miss out on a considerable amount of family time. With young Eric\ufffds special needs, it made sense for Dad to give up his career. \ufffdWe definitely play it as a team,\ufffd said Lori, who kept her job in pharmaceutical sales. \ufffdWhat I\ufffdm good at doing, I do. What he\ufffds good at doing, he does. For example, you would not want me to cook.\ufffd Laughing, Eric the cook lets on that he likes to make homemade chili and spaghetti sauce. A typical day for young Eric involves getting up around 7 a.m., getting dressed, perhaps watching a cartoon, and seeing a TSS worker from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. From noon to 2:30 most days, he attends a preschool program at the children\ufffds association, where he is in a class of seven students, each of whom receives lots of one-on-one attention. On Mondays and Wednesdays a TSS worker spends time with him at home in the late afternoon, and every day there are familiar routines of supper, bath, story time and songs. Bedtime is about 9:30 p.m. \ufffdHe\ufffds less resistant to going to bed than he used to be,\ufffd his father said. Rejoicing in small triumphs Children with autism tend to become overwhelmed by certain stimuli \ufffd it could be too many bright colors, too many people, or a whiff of a stranger\ufffds perfume, Lori Fritz explained. \ufffdEric isn\ufffdt a fan of crowds,\ufffd she said. To cope, children with autism sometimes \ufffdself-stimulate,\ufffd using repetitive motions or sounds to distract themselves from the overwhelming stimuli. In addition to sights, sounds and aromas, textures can be a challenge. Eric, for example, doesn\ufffdt like the way rice feels, his mother said. Yet he doesn\ufffdt have a problem with shaving cream. That became apparent on a recent afternoon when the staff at Eric\ufffds preschool had an exercise designed to help the class become accustomed to the smoothness of the cream. Teacher\ufffds aide Cathy Wolfe spread some foam on a table and Eric plunged his hands into it with gusto. Later that day, after his session with the speech pathologist, he met with occupational therapist Shari Aude, who soon had him coloring a picture of a bear with crayons, then finger-painting various shapes and lines. \ufffdThis is to get him used to the idea of holding a pencil,\ufffd Aude said. One part of his therapy Eric really seemed to enjoy was swinging on his stomach in a contraption called a \ufffdprone swing\ufffd or \ufffdvestibular swing.\ufffd Lying in a canvas swing that was suspended from the ceiling and hanging just a few inches above a thick rubber mat on the floor, Eric reached down to the mat with his hands and propelled himself around. \ufffdThis is to help him understand his place in space, to deal with gravitational insecurity,\ufffd Aude said. \ufffdIt\ufffds exercising his arms and hands too, and that will be helpful for holding a pencil. That\ufffds something he needs for kindergarten readiness.\ufffd What kind of school Eric eventually attends is a matter as yet undecided, his dad said, and it\ufffds hard to predict what his life will be like as an adult. Web sites devoted to autism suggest careers as diverse as caring for animals or searching for abnormal cells on a microscope slide can be ideal for some with autism. For now, Eric\ufffds parents rejoice in the small triumphs, as when their son communicates through sign language or obeys a simple request, perhaps to put away a toy. He does seem to be in perpetual motion, and the reason for all that jumping and running around sometimes mystifies his parents. \ufffdWe don\ufffdt know if he\ufffds being willful,\ufffd Lori Fritz said. \ufffdOr is it because he can\ufffdt help it?\ufffd The Fritz family of Nanticoke relaxes in the family room of their Nanticoke home.

Children and adults with autism spectrum disorders usually have particular communication and social characteristics in common, but the conditions cover a wide spectrum, with individual differences in: Number and particular kinds of symptoms Severity - mild to severe Age of onset Levels of functioning Challenges with social interactions Source: Autism Society Canada Autism is not a single disorder, but a spectrum of closely-related disorders with a shared core of symptoms. Every individual on the autistic spectrum has problems to some degree with social skills, empathy, communication, and flexible behavior. But the level of disability and the combination of symptoms varies tremendously from person to person. In fact, two kids with the same diagnosis may look very different when it comes to their behaviors and abilities. If you re a parent dealing with a child on the autism spectrum, you may hear many different terms including high-functioning autism, atypical autism, autism spectrum disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder. These terms can be confusing, not only because there are so many, but because doctors, therapists, and other parents may use them in dissimilar ways. But no matter what doctors, teachers, and other specialists call the disorder, it s your child s unique needs that are truly important. No diagnostic label can tell you exactly what problems your child will have. Finding treatment that addresses your child s needs, rather than focusing on what to call the problem, is the most helpful thing you can do. The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) One Boy on the Autism Spectrum Three-year-old Dylan doesn t seem interested in playing with other kids, and completely ignores his siblings. He doesn t pay attention to his mom or dad either, even to smile or greet them when they get home. Dylan barely talks. Sometimes he mimics a certain word or phrase he s heard, saying it over and over in the same tone of voice and accent of the original speaker. On the rare occasions when he uses words to communicate, he does so in peculiar ways. For example, he asks Do you want a drink? when he s thirsty. Moving objects fascinate Dylan. He loves to watch the credits roll at the end of TV shows or the cars drive by on the street, flapping his hands in excitement. He has a favorite toy truck that he carries at all times. He doesn t play with it other than to spin its wheels, but if the truck is taken away or his routine is disrupted in even minor ways, Dylan throws a tantrum that can last for hours. The autism spectrum disorders belong to an umbrella category of five childhood-onset conditions known as pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). Some autism specialists use the terms pervasive developmental disorder and autism spectrum disorder interchangeably. However, when most people talk about the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), they are referring to the three most common PDDs: Autism Asperger's Syndrome Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) Childhood disintegrative disorder and Rett Syndrome are the other pervasive developmental disorders. Because both are extremely rare genetic diseases, they are usually considered to be separate medical conditions that don't truly belong on the autism spectrum. The three autism spectrum disorders differ in their impact. Classic autism, or autistic disorder, is the most severe of the autism spectrum disorders. Asperger s Syndrome, sometimes called high-functioning autism, is the mildest. PDD-NOS, or atypical autism, falls somewhere in between. According to the Autism Spectrum Resource Center, only 20% of people on the autism spectrum have classic autism. The overwhelming majority fall somewhere on the milder range of the spectrum. In both children and adults, the signs and symptoms of the autism spectrum disorders revolve around problems with social interaction, language, and restricted activities and interests. However, there are enormous differences when it comes to the severity of the symptoms, their combinations, and the patterns of behavior. Since the autism spectrum disorders share many similar symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish one from the other, particularly in the early stages. If your child is developmentally delayed or exhibits other autism-like behaviors, you will need to visit a medical professional for a thorough evaluation. Your doctor can help you figure out where, or even if, your child fits on the autistic spectrum. Keep in mind that just because a child has a few autism-like symptoms does not mean he or she has an autism spectrum disorder. These disorders are diagnosed based on a distinct pattern of multiple symptoms that disrupt the child s level of functioning. Sometimes Autism Really Means Autism Spectrum Disorder When people use the term autism, it can mean one of two things. They may actually be referring to autistic disorder, or classical autism. But autism is often used in a more general sense to refer to all autism spectrum disorders. So if someone is talking about your child s autism, don t assume that he or she is implying that your child has autistic disorder, rather than another autism spectrum disorder. If you re unsure what is meant, don t be afraid to ask. Social interaction in autism spectrum disorders Basic social interaction can be difficult for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Many kids on the autism spectrum seem to prefer to live in their own little world, aloof and detached from others. This detachment from others can sometimes be seen even in babies. Some autistic infants don't respond to cuddling, reach out to be picked up, or look at their mothers when being fed. When they're older, autistic children may not hear when others are speaking to them or respond to affection in typical ways (standing stiffly when hugged, for example). Common social interaction impairments seen in autism spectrum disorders include: Poor eye contact. Unusual or inappropriate body language and facial expressions. Lack of interest in other people. Prefers to be alone. Lack of empathy. Doesn't share interests or achievements with others (drawings, toys). Resistance to being touched. Difficulty or failure to make friends. Communication in autism spectrum disorders Children with autism spectrum disorders have difficulty with both verbal and non-verbal communication. Speech problems Problems with verbal communication are a telltale sign of the autism spectrum disorders. According to the Yale Developmental Disabilities Clinic, speech is absent in about 50 percent of classical autism cases. In other cases, kids may not start to talk until very late. Those with classical autism who do speak, often do so in odd or unusual ways. For example, children on the autism spectrum may: Speak in an abnormal tone of voice, or with an odd rhythm or pitch. End every sentence as if asking a question. Use echolalia (the parrot-like repetition of the same words or phrases). Respond to a question by repeating it, rather than answering it. Refer to themselves in the third person. Language comprehension Language comprehension is also commonly impaired in children with autism spectrum disorders. Kids with autism may not understand simple directions or questions. Those who do have a firm grasp of spoken language often take what is said too literally. Metaphors and other figures of speech (such as it's raining cats and dogs ) can be confusing, and they are typically oblivious to attempts at humor, irony, and sarcasm. Kids with autism spectrum disorders often: Have trouble starting a conversation or keeping it going. Use language incorrectly (grammatical errors, wrong words). Have difficulty communicating needs or desires. Don t understand simple statements or questions. Confuse pronouns. Nonverbal Communication When kids with autism spectrum disorders do choose to interact with others, they sometimes come across as cold or robot-like. But while they may appear emotionally flat, the reality is that autistic individuals are far from unfeeling. What can look like indifference or insensitivity is actually due to mind blindness, or an inability to see things as other people do. This makes the give-and-take of social interaction very difficult for children with autism spectrum disorders. Subtle social cues such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures are often lost on them. They may also have trouble communicating through their own nonverbal behaviors. For example, your child may avoid eye contact, make very few gestures, or use facial expressions that don't match what he or she is saying. Restricted behaviors in autism spectrum disorders Children with autism spectrum disorders are often restricted, rigid, and even obsessive in their behaviors, activities, and interests. This can show up as: Repetitive body movements Following an inflexible schedule Attachment to unusual objects Preoccuption with a narrow topic of interest Repetitive movements Children with autism spectrum disorders commonly engage in repetitive movements such as hand flapping, rocking, or twirling. Such self-stimulatory behavior, also known as stimming , may preoccupy your child to the exclusion of all other activities and interests. Alternately, he or she may spend hours arranging toys in specific ways, watching moving objects such as a ceiling fan, or focusing on one specific part of an object. Common self-stimulatory behaviors: Hand flapping Rocking back and forth Spinning in a circle Finger flicking Head banging Staring at lights Moving fingers in front of the eyes Snapping fingers Tapping ears Scratching Lining up toys Spinning objects Wheel spinning Watching moving objects Flicking light switches on and off Repeating words or noises Often, kids on the autism spectrum also exhibit clumsiness, abnormal posture, or eccentric ways of moving. For example, a child with autism may walk exclusively on tiptoe. Inflexible or obsessive activities and interests Some children with autism spectrum disorders follow rigid routines and are resistant to any changes in their schedule or environment. For example, they may insist on taking a certain route to school and become extremely upset if they have to go another way. They may have a temper tantrum if the furniture in their house is rearranged or they have to eat lunch at a different time than they're used to. Many children with ASDs also form obsessive attachments to unusual objects such as keys or rubber bands, or become preoccupied with a very specific topic. This topic often involves numbers or symbols (maps, train schedules, sports statistics), and the child may spend hours memorizing and reciting facts about it. Play behavior in autistic children Children with autism spectrum disorders tend to be less spontaneous than other kids. Unlike a typical curious little kid pointing to things that catch his or her eye, autistic children often appear disinterested or unaware of what's going on around them. They also show differences in the way they play. They usually don't play make-believe, engage in group games, imitate others, or use their toys in creative ways. Common problems on the autism spectrum While not part of autism s official diagnostic criteria, kids on the autism spectrum often suffer from one or more of the following problems: Sensory Problems - Many children with ASDs either underreact or overreact to sensory stimuli. At times they may ignore people speaking to them, even to the point of appearing deaf. However, at other times they may be disturbed by even the softest sounds. Sudden noises such as a ringing telephone can be upsetting, and they may respond by covering their ears and making repetitive noises to drown out the offending sound. Children on the autism spectrum also tend to be highly sensitive to touch and to texture. They may cringe at a pat on the back or the feel of certain fabric against their skin. Emotional Difficulties Kids with autism spectrum disorders may have difficulty regulating their emotions or expressing them appropriately. For instance, your child may start to yell, cry, or laugh hysterically for no apparent reason. When stressed, he or she may exhibit disruptive or even aggressive behavior (breaking things, hitting others, or harming him or herself). The National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities also notes that autistic kids may be unfazed by real dangers like moving vehicles or heights, yet be terrified of harmless objects such as a stuffed animal. Uneven Cognitive Abilities - The autism spectrum disorders occur at all intelligence levels. However, even kids with normal to high intelligence often have unevenly developed cognitive skills. Not surprisingly, verbal skills tend to be weaker than nonverbal skills. In addition, children with ASDs typically do well on tasks involving immediate memory or visual skills, while tasks involving symbolic or abstract thinking are more difficult. Savant Skills Approximately 10% of people with autism spectrum disorders have special savant skills, such as Dustin Hoffman portrayed in the film Rain Man. The most common savant skills involve mathematical calculations, artistic and musical abilities, and feats of memory. For example, an autistic savant might be able to multiply large numbers in his or her head, play a piano concerto after hearing it once, or quickly memorize complex maps. Asperger's Syndrome and PDD-NOS Symptoms of Asperger s syndrome Asperger s syndrome is the mildest of the autism spectrum disorders. Unlike autism, speech is not delayed or impaired in Asperger s. Children with this disorder have good language and verbal skills. They have normal to high intelligence. However, they have problems socializing and communicating effectively with others. Children with Asperger s syndrome often come across to others as socially clueless or eccentric. The signs and symptoms of Asperger s syndrome include: Obsession with a specific topic. Long, one-sided conversations. Inability to read other people s reactions or nonverbal cues. Unusual or inappropriate eye contact, gestures, and facial expressions. Insensitivity to the feelings of others. An overly-formal, high-pitched, or robotic speaking voice. Failure to grasp humor, irony, and figures of speech. Repetitive routines and rituals. Clumsy or odd movements. Sensitivity to light, sound, and pain. Of all the signs and symptoms, an excessive, all-encompassing preoccupation with a narrow subject or interest (such as airplanes, spiders, or weather) is often the most prominent. A person with Asperger s may spend a great deal of time memorizing facts or collecting and organizing things related to his or her obsession. Symptoms of PDD-NOS For children who meet some, but not all, of the criteria for autism or Asperger s syndrome, a diagnosis of PDD-NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified)is given. PDD-NOS is also sometimes called atypical autism). The PDD-NOS diagnosis is reserved for kids who have many autistic-like symptoms, but don t quite fit into the box for the other autism spectrum disorders. For example, their symptoms might have started after the age of three, or they may demonstrate repetitive behaviors and abnormal speech, but have better social skills than other autistic kids. In some cases, a diagnosis of PDD-NOS is eventually changed to something else as the child gets older and the symptoms become clearer.

Custom Reports on AutismTired of prepackaged reports that just don't meet your needs? Target your needs! What is Autism? Autism is the most common condition in a group of developmental disorders known as the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Autism is characterized by three distinctive behaviors. Autistic children have difficulties with social interaction, display problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and exhibit repetitive behaviors or narrow, obsessive interests. These behaviors can range in impact from mild to disabling. Autism varies widely in its severity and symptoms and may go unrecognized, especially in mildly affected children or when more debilitating handicaps mask it. Scientists aren?t certain what causes autism, but it?s likely that both genetics and environment play a role. What are some common signs of autism? There are three distinctive behaviors that characterize autism. Autistic children have difficulties with social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors or narrow, obsessive interests. These behaviors can range in impact from mild to disabling. The hallmark feature of autism is impaired social interaction. Parents are usually the first to notice symptoms of autism in their child. As early as infancy, a baby with autism may be unresponsive to people or focus intently on one item to the exclusion of others for long periods of time. A child with autism may appear to develop normally and then withdraw and become indifferent to social engagement. Children with autism may fail to respond to their name and often avoid eye contact with other people. They have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling because they can?t understand social cues, such as tone of voice or facial expressions, and don?t watch other people?s faces for clues about appropriate behavior. They lack empathy. Many children with autism engage in repetitive movements such as rocking and twirling, or in self-abusive behavior such as biting or head-banging. They also tend to start speaking later than other children and may refer to themselves by name instead of I or me. Children with autism don?t know how to play interactively with other children. Some speak in a sing-song voice about a narrow range of favorite topics, with little regard for the interests of the person to whom they are speaking. Many children with autism have a reduced sensitivity to pain, but are abnormally sensitive to sound, touch, or other sensory stimulation. These unusual reactions may contribute to behavioral symptoms such as a resistance to being cuddled or hugged. Children with autism appear to have a higher than normal risk for certain co-existing conditions, including fragile X syndrome (which causes mental retardation), tuberous sclerosis (in which tumors grow on the brain), epileptic seizures, Tourette syndrome, learning disabilities, and attention deficit disorder. For reasons that are still unclear, about 20 to 30 percent of children with autism develop epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood. While people with schizophrenia may show some autistic-like behavior, their symptoms usually do not appear until the late teens or early adulthood. Most people with schizophrenia also have hallucinations and delusions, which are not found in autism. How is autism diagnosed? Autism varies widely in its severity and symptoms and may go unrecognized, especially in mildly affected children or when it is masked by more debilitating handicaps. Doctors rely on a core group of behaviors to alert them to the possibility of a diagnosis of autism. These behaviors are: * impaired ability to make friends with peers * impaired ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others * absence or impairment of imaginative and social play * stereotyped, repetitive, or unusual use of language * restricted patterns of interest that are abnormal in intensity or focus * preoccupation with certain objects or subjects * inflexible adherence to specific routines or rituals Doctors will often use a questionnaire or other screening instrument to gather information about a child?s development and behavior. Some screening instruments rely solely on parent observations; others rely on a combination of parent and doctor observations. If screening instruments indicate the possibility of autism, doctors will ask for a more comprehensive evaluation. Autism is a complex disorder. A comprehensive evaluation requires a multidisciplinary team including a psychologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, speech therapist, and other professionals who diagnose children with ASDs. The team members will conduct a thorough neurological assessment and in-depth cognitive and language testing. Because hearing problems can cause behaviors that could be mistaken for autism, children with delayed speech development should also have their hearing tested. After a thorough evaluation, the team usually meets with parents to explain the results of the evaluation and present the diagnosis. Children with some symptoms of autism, but not enough to be diagnosed with classical autism, are often diagnosed with PDD-NOS. Children with autistic behaviors but well-developed language skills are often diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Children who develop normally and then suddenly deteriorate between the ages of 3 to 10 years and show marked autistic behaviors may be diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder. Girls with autistic symptoms may be suffering from Rett syndrome, a sex-linked genetic disorder characterized by social withdrawal, regressed language skills, and hand wringing. What causes autism? Scientists aren?t certain what causes autism, but it?s likely that both genetics and environment play a role. Researchers have identified a number of genes associated with the disorder. Studies of people with autism have found irregularities in several regions of the brain. Other studies suggest that people with autism have abnormal levels of serotonin or other neurotransmitters in the brain. These abnormalities suggest that autism could result from the disruption of normal brain development early in fetal development caused by defects in genes that control brain growth and that regulate how neurons communicate with each other. While these findings are intriguing, they are preliminary and require further study. The theory that parental practices are responsible for autism has now been disproved. What role does inheritance play? Recent studies strongly suggest that some people have a genetic predisposition to autism. In families with one autistic child, the risk of having a second child with the disorder is approximately 5 percent, or one in 20. This is greater than the risk for the general population. Researchers are looking for clues about which genes contribute to this increased susceptibility. In some cases, parents and other relatives of an autistic child show mild impairments in social and communicative skills or engage in repetitive behaviors. Evidence also suggests that some emotional disorders, such as manic depression, occur more frequently than average in the families of people with autism. Do symptoms of autism change over time? For many children, autism symptoms improve with treatment and with age. Some children with autism grow up to lead normal or near-normal lives. Children whose language skills regress early in life, usually before the age of 3, appear to be at risk of developing epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity. During adolescence, some children with autism may become depressed or experience behavioral problems. Parents of these children should be ready to adjust treatment for their child as needed. How is autism treated? There is no cure for autism. Therapies and behavioral interventions are designed to remedy specific symptoms and can bring about substantial improvement. The ideal treatment plan coordinates therapies and interventions that target the core symptoms of autism: impaired social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and obsessive or repetitive routines and interests. Most professionals agree that the earlier the intervention, the better. * Educational/behavioral interventions: Therapists use highly structured and intensive skill-oriented training sessions to help children develop social and language skills. Family counseling for the parents and siblings of children with autism often helps families cope with the particular challenges of living with an autistic child. * Medications: Doctors often prescribe an antidepressant medication to handle symptoms of anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anti-psychotic medications are used to treat severe behavioral problems. Seizures can be treated with one or more of the anticonvulsant drugs. Stimulant drugs, such as those used for children with attention deficit disorder (ADD), are sometimes used effectively to help decrease impulsivity and hyperactivity. * Other therapies: There are a number of controversial therapies or interventions available for autistic children, but few, if any, are supported by scientific studies. Parents should use caution before adopting any of these treatments.

The Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders Treatment Options Adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder Research into Causes and Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorders References Introduction Not until the middle of the twentieth century was there a name for a disorder that now appears to affect an estimated 3.4 every 1,000 children ages 3-10, a disorder that causes disruption in families and unfulfilled lives for many children. In 1943 Dr. Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital studied a group of 11 children and introduced the label early infantile autism into the English language. At the same time a German scientist, Dr. Hans Asperger, described a milder form of the disorder that became known as Asperger syndrome. Thus these two disorders were described and are today listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision)1 as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). All these disorders are characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior.The autism spectrum disorders can often be reliably detected by the age of 3 years, and in some cases as early as 18 months.2 Studies suggest that many children eventually may be accurately identified by the age of 1 year or even younger. The appearance of any of the warning signs of ASD is reason to have a child evaluated by a professional specializing in these disorders.Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child. In some cases, the baby seemed \ufffddifferent\ufffd from birth, unresponsive to people or focusing intently on one item for long periods of time. The first signs of an ASD can also appear in children who seem to have been developing normally. When an engaging, babbling toddler suddenly becomes silent, withdrawn, self-abusive, or indifferent to social overtures, something is wrong. Research has shown that parents are usually correct about noticing developmental problems, although they may not realize the specific nature or degree of the problem.The pervasive developmental disorders, or autism spectrum disorders, range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, to a milder form, Asperger syndrome. If a child has symptoms of either of these disorders, but does not meet the specific criteria for either, the diagnosis is called pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Other rare, very severe disorders that are included in the autism spectrum disorders are Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder. This brochure will focus on classic autism, PDD-NOS, and Asperger syndrome, with brief descriptions of Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder below.PrevalenceIn 2007 - the most recent government survey on the rate of autism - the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that the rate is higher than the rates found from studies conducted in the United States during the 1980s and early 1990s (survey based on data from 2000 and 2002). The CDC survey assigned a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder based on health and school records of 8 year olds in 14 communities throughout the U.S. Debate continues about whether this represents a true increase in the prevalence of autism. Changes in the criteria used to diagnose autism, along with increased recognition of the disorder by professionals and the public may all be contributing factors. Nonetheless, the CDC report confirms other recent epidemiologic studies documenting that more children are being diagnosed with an ASD than ever before.Data from an earlier report of the CDC's Atlanta-based program found the rate of autism spectrum disorder was 3.4 per 1,000 for children 3 to 10 years of age. Summarizing this and several other major studies on autism prevalence, CDC estimates that 2-6 per 1,000 (from 1 in 500 to 1 in 150) children have an ASD. The risk is 3-4 times higher in males than females. Compared to the prevalence of other childhood conditions, this rate is lower than the rate of mental retardation (9.7 per 1,000 children), but higher than the rates for cerebral palsy (2.8 per 1,000 children), hearing loss (1.1 per 1,000 children), and vision impairment (0.9 per 1,000 children).3 The CDC notes that these studies do not provide a national estimate.For additional data, please visit the autism section of the CDC Web site.Rare Autism Spectrum DisordersRett SyndromeRett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses\ufffdshe no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling doctors to start treating these children much sooner, and improving the quality of life these children experience.*Childhood Disintegrative DisorderVery few children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis meet the criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). An estimate based on four surveys of ASD found fewer than two children per 100,000 with ASD could be classified as having CDD. This suggests that CDD is a very rare form of ASD. It has a strong male preponderance.** Symptoms may appear by age 2, but the average age of onset is between 3 and 4 years. Until this time, the child has age-appropriate skills in communication and social relationships. The long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome.The loss of such skills as vocabulary are more dramatic in CDD than they are in classical autism. The diagnosis requires extensive and pronounced losses involving motor, language, and social skills.*** CDD is also accompanied by loss of bowel and bladder control and oftentimes seizures and a very low IQ.*Rett syndrome.

What Are the Autism Spectrum Disorders?The autism spectrum disorders are more common in the pediatric population than are some better known disorders such as diabetes, spinal bifida, or Down syndrome.2 A recent study of a U.S. metropolitan area estimated that 3.4 of every 1,000 children 3-10 years old had autism.3 The earlier the disorder is diagnosed, the sooner the child can be helped through treatment interventions. Pediatricians, family physicians, daycare providers, teachers, and parents may initially dismiss signs of ASD, optimistically thinking the child is just a little slow and will \ufffdcatch up.\ufffdAll children with ASD demonstrate deficits in 1) social interaction, 2) verbal and nonverbal communication, and 3) repetitive behaviors or interests. In addition, they will often have unusual responses to sensory experiences, such as certain sounds or the way objects look. Each of these symptoms runs the gamut from mild to severe. They will present in each individual child differently. For instance, a child may have little trouble learning to read but exhibit extremely poor social interaction. Each child will display communication, social, and behavioral patterns that are individual but fit into the overall diagnosis of ASD.Children with ASD do not follow the typical patterns of child development. In some children, hints of future problems may be apparent from birth. In most cases, the problems in communication and social skills become more noticeable as the child lags further behind other children the same age. Some other children start off well enough. Oftentimes between 12 and 36 months old, the differences in the way they react to people and other unusual behaviors become apparent. Some parents report the change as being sudden, and that their children start to reject people, act strangely, and lose language and social skills they had previously acquired. In other cases, there is a plateau, or leveling, of progress so that the difference between the child with autism and other children the same age becomes more noticeable.ASD is defined by a certain set of behaviors that can range from the very mild to the severe. The following possible indicators of ASD were identified on the Public Health Training Network Webcast, Autism Among Us.4Possible Indicators of Autism Spectrum DisordersDoes not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of ageDoes not speak one word by 16 monthsDoes not combine two words by 2 yearsDoes not respond to nameLoses language or social skillsSome Other IndicatorsPoor eye contactDoesn't seem to know how to play with toysExcessively lines up toys or other objectsIs attached to one particular toy or objectDoesn't smileAt times seems to be hearing impairedSocial SymptomsFrom the start, typically developing infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile.In contrast, most children with ASD seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem indifferent to other people, and often seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although children with ASD are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to \ufffdread.\ufffd To parents, it may seem as if their child is not attached at all. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of the expected and typical attachment behavior.Children with ASD also are slower in learning to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues\ufffdwhether a smile, a wink, or a grimace\ufffdmay have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, \ufffdCome here\ufffd always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with ASD have difficulty seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with ASD may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions.Although not universal, it is common for people with ASD also to have difficulty regulating their emotions. This can take the form of \ufffdimmature\ufffd behavior such as crying in class or verbal outbursts that seem inappropriate to those around them. The individual with ASD might also be disruptive and physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. They have a tendency to \ufffdlose control,\ufffd particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They may at times break things, attack others, or hurt themselves. In their frustration, some bang their heads, pull their hair, or bite their arms.Communication DifficultiesBy age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is \ufffdno.\ufffdSome children diagnosed with ASD remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of ASD coo and babble during the first few months of life, but they soon stop. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Some children may learn to use communication systems such as pictures or sign language.Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. They seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some ASD children parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Although many children with no ASD go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3.Some children only mildly affected may exhibit slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining a conversation. The \ufffdgive and take\ufffd of normal conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. Another difficulty is often the inability to understand body language, tone of voice, or \ufffdphrases of speech.\ufffd They might interpret a sarcastic expression such as \ufffdOh, that's just great\ufffd as meaning it really IS great.While it can be hard to understand what ASD children are saying, their body language is also difficult to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Also, their tone of voice fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Some children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, failing to pick up on the \ufffdkid-speak\ufffd that is common in their peers.Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with ASD are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, they may simply scream or grab what they want. Until they are taught better ways to express their needs, ASD children do whatever they can to get through to others. As people with ASD grow up, they can become increasingly aware of their difficulties in understanding others and in being understood. As a result they may become anxious or depressed.Repetitive BehaviorsAlthough children with ASD usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or walking on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position.As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, rather than using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of the toys, the child may be tremendously upset. ASD children need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine\ufffdin mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, going to school at a certain time and by the same route\ufffdcan be extremely disturbing. Perhaps order and sameness lend some stability in a world of confusion.Repetitive behavior sometimes takes the form of a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners, train schedules, or lighthouses. Often there is great interest in numbers, symbols, or science topics.Problems That May Accompany ASDSensory problems. When children's perceptions are accurate, they can learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory information is faulty, the child's experiences of the world can be confusing. Many ASD children are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin almost unbearable. Some sounds\ufffda vacuum cleaner, a ringing telephone, a sudden storm, even the sound of waves lapping the shoreline\ufffdwill cause these children to cover their ears and scream.In ASD, the brain seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some ASD children are oblivious to extreme cold or pain. An ASD child may fall and break an arm, yet never cry. Another may bash his head against a wall and not wince, but a light touch may make the child scream with alarm.Mental retardation. Many children with ASD have some degree of mental impairment. When tested, some areas of ability may be normal, while others may be especially weak. For example, a child with ASD may do well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low scores on the language subtests.Seizures. One in four children with ASD develops seizures, often starting either in early childhood or adolescence. 5 Seizures, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, can produce a temporary loss of consciousness (a \ufffdblackout\ufffd), a body convulsion, unusual movements, or staring spells. Sometimes a contributing factor is a lack of sleep or a high fever. An EEG (electroencephalogram\ufffdrecording of the electric currents developed in the brain by means of electrodes applied to the scalp) can help confirm the seizure's presence.In most cases, seizures can be controlled by a number of medicines called \ufffdanticonvulsants.\ufffd The dosage of the medication is adjusted carefully so that the least possible amount of medication will be used to be effective.Fragile X syndrome. This disorder is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. It was so named because one part of the X chromosome has a defective piece that appears pinched and fragile when under a microscope. Fragile X syndrome affects about two to five percent of people with ASD. It is important to have a child with ASD checked for Fragile X, especially if the parents are considering having another child. For an unknown reason, if a child with ASD also has Fragile X, there is a one-in-two chance that boys born to the same parents will have the syndrome. 6 Other members of the family who may be contemplating having a child may also wish to be checked for the syndrome.A distinction can be made between a father's and mother's ability to pass along to a daughter or son the altered gene on the X chromosome that is linked to fragile X syndrome. Because both males (XY) and females (XX) have at least one X chromosome, both can pass on the mutated gene to their children.A father with the altered gene for Fragile X on his X chromosome will only pass that gene on to his daughters. He passes a Y chromosome on to his sons, which doesn't transmit the condition. Therefore, if the father has the altered gene on his X chromosome, but the mother's X chromosomes are normal, all of the couple's daughters would have the altered gene for Fragile X, while none of their sons would have the mutated gene. Because mothers pass on only X chromosomes to their children, if the mother has the altered gene for Fragile X, she can pass that gene to either her sons or her daughters. If the mother has the mutated gene on one X chromosome and has one normal X chromosome, and the father has no genetic mutations, all the children have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the mutated gene.The odds noted here apply to each child the parents have 7 in terms of prevalence, the latest statistics are consistent in showing that 5% of people with autism are affected by fragile X and 10% to 15% of those with fragile X show autistic traits.Tuberous Sclerosis. Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain as well as in other vital organs. It has a consistently strong association with ASD. One to 4 percent of people with ASD also have tuberous sclerosis.8The Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders Although there are many concerns about labeling a young child with an ASD, the earlier the diagnosis of ASD is made, the earlier needed interventions can begin. Evidence over the last 15 years indicates that intensive early intervention in optimal educational settings for at least 2 years during the preschool years results in improved outcomes in most young children with ASD.2In evaluating a child, clinicians rely on behavioral characteristics to make a diagnosis. Some of the characteristic behaviors of ASD may be apparent in the first few months of a child's life, or they may appear at any time during the early years. For the diagnosis, problems in at least one of the areas of communication, socialization, or restricted behavior must be present before the age of 3. The diagnosis requires a two-stage process. The first stage involves developmental screening during \ufffdwell child\ufffd check-ups; the second stage entails a comprehensive evaluation by a multidisciplinary team.9ScreeningA \ufffdwell child\ufffd check-up should include a developmental screening test. If your child's pediatrician does not routinely check your child with such a test, ask that it be done. Your own observations and concerns about your child's development will be essential in helping to screen your child.9 Reviewing family videotapes, photos, and baby albums can help parents remember when each behavior was first noticed and when the child reached certain developmental milestones.Several screening instruments have been developed to quickly gather information about a child's social and communicative development within medical settings. Among them are the Checklist of Autism in Toddlers (CHAT),10 the modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT),11 the Screening Tool for Autism in Two-Year-Olds (STAT),12 and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)13 (for children 4 years of age and older).Some screening instruments rely solely on parent responses to a questionnaire, and some rely on a combination of parent report and observation. Key items on these instruments that appear to differentiate children with autism from other groups before the age of 2 include pointing and pretend play. Screening instruments do not provide individual diagnosis but serve to assess the need for referral for possible diagnosis of ASD. These screening methods may not identify children with mild ASD, such as those with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome.During the last few years, screening instruments have been devised to screen for Asperger syndrome and higher functioning autism. The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ),14 the Australian Scale for Asperger's Syndrome,15 and the most recent, the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST),16 are some of the instruments that are reliable for identification of school-age children with Asperger syndrome or higher functioning autism. These tools concentrate on social and behavioral impairments in children without significant language delay.If, following the screening process or during a routine \ufffdwell child\ufffd check-up, your child's doctor sees any of the possible indicators of ASD, further evaluation is indicated.Comprehensive Diagnostic EvaluationThe second stage of diagnosis must be comprehensive in order to accurately rule in or rule out an ASD or other developmental problem. This evaluation may be done by a multidisciplinary team that includes a psychologist, a neurologist, a psychiatrist, a speech therapist, or other professionals who diagnose children with ASD.Because ASDs are complex disorders and may involve other neurological or genetic problems, a comprehensive evaluation should entail neurologic and genetic assessment, along with in-depth cognitive and language testing.9 In addition, measures developed specifically for diagnosing autism are often used. These include the Autism Diagnosis Interview-Revised (ADI-R)17 and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-G).18 The ADI-R is a structured interview that contains over 100 items and is conducted with a caregiver. It consists of four main factors\ufffdthe child's communication, social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and age-of-onset symptoms. The ADOS-G is an observational measure used to \ufffdpress\ufffd for socio-communicative behaviors that are often delayed, abnormal, or absent in children with ASD.Still another instrument often used by professionals is the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS).19 It aids in evaluating the child's body movements, adaptation to change, listening response, verbal communication, and relationship to people. It is suitable for use with children over 2 years of age. The examiner observes the child and also obtains relevant information from the parents. The child's behavior is rated on a scale based on deviation from the typical behavior of children of the same age.Two other tests that should be used to assess any child with a developmental delay are a formal audiologic hearing evaluation and a lead screening. Although some hearing loss can co-occur with ASD, some children with ASD may be incorrectly thought to have such a loss. In addition, if the child has suffered from an ear infection, transient hearing loss can occur. Lead screening is essential for children who remain for a long period of time in the oral-motor stage in which they put any and everything into their mouths. Children with an autistic disorder usually have elevated blood lead levels.9Customarily, an expert diagnostic team has the responsibility of thoroughly evaluating the child, assessing the child's unique strengths and weaknesses, and determining a formal diagnosis. The team will then meet with the parents to explain the results of the evaluation.Although parents may have been aware that something was not\ufffdquite righ\ufffd with their child, when the diagnosis is given, it is a devastating blow. At such a time, it is hard to stay focused on asking questions. But while members of the evaluation team are together is the best opportunity the parents will have to ask questions and get recommendations on what further steps they should take for their child. Learning as much as possible at this meeting is very important, but it is helpful to leave this meeting with the name or names of professionals who can be contacted if the parents have further questions.Available AidsWhen your child has been evaluated and diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, you may feel inadequate to help your child develop to the fullest extent of his or her ability. As you begin to look at treatment options and at the types of aid available for a child with a disability, you will find out that there is help for you. It is going to be difficult to learn and remember everything you need to know about the resources that will be most helpful. Write down everything. If you keep a notebook, you will have a foolproof method of recalling information. Keep a record of the doctors' reports and the evaluation your child has been given so that his or her eligibility for special programs will be documented. Learn everything you can about special programs for your child; the more you know, the more effectively you can advocate.For every child eligible for special programs, each state guarantees special education and related services. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a Federally mandated program that assures a free and appropriate public education for children with diagnosed learning deficits. Usually children are placed in public schools and the school district pays for all necessary services. These will include, as needed, services by a speech therapist, occupational therapist, school psychologist, social worker, school nurse, or aide.By law, the public schools must prepare and carry out a set of instruction goals, or specific skills, for every child in a special education program. The list of skills is known as the child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). The IEP is an agreement between the school and the family on the child's goals. When your child's IEP is developed, you will be asked to attend the meeting. There will be several people at this meeting, including a special education teacher, a representative of the public schools who is knowledgeable about the program, other individuals invited by the school or by you (you may want to bring a relative, a child care provider, or a supportive close friend who knows your child well). Parents play an important part in creating the program, as they know their child and his or her needs best. Once your child's IEP is developed, a meeting is scheduled once a year to review your child's progress and to make any alterations to reflect his or her changing needs.If your child is under 3 years of age and has special needs, he or she should be eligible for an early intervention program; this program is available in every state. Each state decides which agency will be the lead agency in the early intervention program. The early intervention services are provided by workers qualified to care for toddlers with disabilities and are usually in the child's home or a place familiar to the child. The services provided are written into an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) that is reviewed at least once every 6 months. The plan will describe services that will be provided to the child, but will also describe services for parents to help them in daily activities with their child and for siblings to help them adjust to having a brother or sister with ASD.Treatment Options There is no single best treatment package for all children with ASD. One point that most professionals agree on is that early intervention is important; another is that most individuals with ASD respond well to highly structured, specialized programs.Before you make decisions on your child's treatment, you will want to gather information about the various options available. Learn as much as you can, look at all the options, and make your decision on your child's treatment based on your child's needs. You may want to visit public schools in your area to see the type of program they offer to special needs children.Guidelines used by the Autism Society of America include the following questions parents can ask about potential treatments:Will the treatment result in harm to my child?How will failure of the treatment affect my child and family?Has the treatment been validated scientifically?Are there assessment procedures specified?How will the treatment be integrated into my child's current program? Do not become so infatuated with a given treatment that functional curriculum, vocational life, and social skills are ignored.The National Institute of Mental Health suggests a list of questions parents can ask when planning for their child:How successful has the program been for other children?How many children have gone on to placement in a regular school and how have they performed?Do staff members have training and experience in working with children and adolescents with autism?How are activities planned and organized?Are there predictable daily schedules and routines?How much individual attention will my child receive?How is progress measured? Will my child's behavior be closely observed and recorded?Will my child be given tasks and rewards that are personally motivating?Is the environment designed to minimize distractions?Will the program prepare me to continue the therapy at home?What is the cost, time commitment, and location of the program?Among the many methods available for treatment and education of people with autism, applied behavior analysis (ABA) has become widely accepted as an effective treatment. Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General states,\ufffdThirty years of research demonstrated the efficacy of applied behavioral methods in reducing inappropriate behavior and in increasing communication, learning, and appropriate social behavior\ufffd20 The basic research done by Ivar Lovaas and his colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles, calling for an intensive, one-on-one child-teacher interaction for 40 hours a week, laid a foundation for other educators and researchers in the search for further effective early interventions to help those with ASD attain their potential. The goal of behavioral management is to reinforce desirable behaviors and reduce undesirable ones.21, 22An effective treatment program will build on the child's interests, offer a predictable schedule, teach tasks as a series of simple steps, actively engage the child's attention in highly structured activities, and provide regular reinforcement of behavior. Parental involvement has emerged as a major factor in treatment success. Parents work with teachers and therapists to identify the behaviors to be changed and the skills to be taught. Recognizing that parents are the child's earliest teachers, more programs are beginning to train parents to continue the therapy at home.As soon as a child's disability has been identified, instruction should begin. Effective programs will teach early communication and social interaction skills. In children younger than 3 years, appropriate interventions usually take place in the home or a child care center. These interventions target specific deficits in learning, language, imitation, attention, motivation, compliance, and initiative of interaction. Included are behavioral methods, communication, occupational and physical therapy along with social play interventions. Often the day will begin with a physical activity to help develop coordination and body awareness; children string beads, piece puzzles together, paint, and participate in other motor skills activities. At snack time the teacher encourages social interaction and models how to use language to ask for more juice. The children learn by doing. Working with the children are students, behavioral therapists, and parents who have received extensive training. In teaching the children, positive reinforcement is used.23Children older than 3 years usually have school-based, individualized, special education. The child may be in a segregated class with other autistic children or in an integrated class with children without disabilities for at least part of the day. Different localities may use differing methods but all should provide a structure that will help the children learn social skills and functional communication. In these programs, teachers often involve the parents, giving useful advice in how to help their child use the skills or behaviors learned at school when they are at home.24In elementary school, the child should receive help in any skill area that is delayed and, at the same time, be encouraged to grow in his or her areas of strength. Ideally, the curriculum should be adapted to the individual child's needs. Many schools today have an inclusion program in which the child is in a regular classroom for most of the day, with special instruction for a part of the day. This instruction should include such skills as learning how to act in social situations and in making friends. Although higher-functioning children may be able to handle academic work, they too need help to organize tasks and avoid distractions.During middle and high school years, instruction will begin to address such practical matters as work, community living, and recreational activities. This should include work experience, using public transportation, and learning skills that will be important in community living.25All through your child's school years, you will want to be an active participant in his or her education program. Collaboration between parents and educators is essential in evaluating your child's progress.The Adolescent YearsAdolescence is a time of stress and confusion; and it is no less so for teenagers with autism. Like all children, they need help in dealing with their budding sexuality. While some behaviors improve during the teenage years, some get worse. Increased autistic or aggressive behavior may be one way some teens express their newfound tension and confusion.The teenage years are also a time when children become more socially sensitive. At the age that most teenagers are concerned with acne, popularity, grades, and dates, teens with autism may become painfully aware that they are different from their peers. They may notice that they lack friends. And unlike their schoolmates, they aren't dating or planning for a career. For some, the sadness that comes with such realization motivates them to learn new behaviors and acquire better social skills.Dietary and Other InterventionsIn an effort to do everything possible to help their children, many parents continually seek new treatments. Some treatments are developed by reputable therapists or by parents of a child with ASD. Although an unproven treatment may help one child, it may not prove beneficial to another. To be accepted as a proven treatment, the treatment should undergo clinical trials, preferably randomized, double-blind trials, that would allow for a comparison between treatment and no treatment. Following are some of the interventions that have been reported to have been helpful to some children but whose efficacy or safety has not been proven.Dietary interventions are based on the idea that 1) food allergies cause symptoms of autism, and 2) an insufficiency of a specific vitamin or mineral may cause some autistic symptoms. If parents decide to try for a given period of time a special diet, they should be sure that the child's nutritional status is measured carefully.A diet that some parents have found was helpful to their autistic child is a gluten-free, casein-free diet. Gluten is a casein-like substance that is found in the seeds of various cereal plants\ufffdwheat, oat, rye, and barley. Casein is the principal protein in milk. Since gluten and milk are found in many of the foods we eat, following a gluten-free, casein-free diet is difficult.A supplement that some parents feel is beneficial for an autistic child is Vitamin B6, taken with magnesium (which makes the vitamin effective). The result of research studies is mixed; some children respond positively, some negatively, some not at all or very little.5In the search for treatment for autism, there has been discussion in the last few years about the use of secretin, a substance approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a single dose normally given to aid in diagnosis of a gastrointestinal problem. Anecdotal reports have shown improvement in autism symptoms, including sleep patterns, eye contact, language skills, and alertness. Several clinical trials conducted in the last few years have found no significant improvements in symptoms between patients who received secretin and those who received a placebo.26Medications Used in TreatmentMedications are often used to treat behavioral problems, such as aggression, self-injurious behavior, and severe tantrums, that keep the person with ASD from functioning more effectively at home or school. The medications used are those that have been developed to treat similar symptoms in other disorders. Many of these medications are prescribed\ufffdoff-label\ufffd This means they have not been officially approved by the FDA for use in children, but the doctor prescribes the medications if he or she feels they are appropriate for your child. Further research needs to be done to ensure not only the efficacy but the safety of psychotropic agents used in the treatment of children and adolescents.On October 6, 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved risperidone (generic name) or Risperdal (brand name) for the symptomatic treatment of irritability in autistic children and adolescents ages 5 to 16. The approval is the first for the use of a drug to treat behaviors associated with autism in children. These behaviors are included under the general heading of irritability, and include aggression, deliberate self-injury and temper tantrums.Olanzapine (Zyprexa) and other antipsychotic medications are used \"off-label\" for the treatment of aggression and other serious behavioral disturbances in children, including children with autism. Off-label means a doctor will prescribe a medication to treat a disorder or in an age group that is not included among those approved by the FDA. Other medications are used to address symptoms or other disorders in children with autism. Fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft) are approved by the FDA for children age 7 and older with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Fluoxetine is also approved for children age 8 and older for the treatment of depression.Fluoxetine and sertraline are antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Despite the relative safety and popularity of SSRIs and other antidepressants, some studies have suggested that they may have unintentional effects on some people, especially adolescents and young adults. In 2004, after a thorough review of data, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adopted a \"black box\" warning label on all antidepressant medications to alert the public about the potential increased risk of suicidal thinking or attempts in children and adolescents taking antidepressants. In 2007, the agency extended the warning to include young adults up to age 25. A \"black box\" warning is the most serious type of warning on prescription drug labeling. The warning emphasizes that patients of all ages should be closely monitored, especially during the initial weeks of treatment, for any worsening depression, suicidal thinking or behavior, or any unusual changes in behavior such as sleeplessness, agitation, or withdrawal from normal social situations.A child with ASD may not respond in the same way to medications as typically developing children. It is important that parents work with a doctor who has experience with children with autism. A child should be monitored closely while taking a medication. The doctor will prescribe the lowest dose possible to be effective. Ask the doctor about any side effects the medication may have and keep a record of how your child responds to the medication. It will be helpful to read the \ufffdpatient insert\ufffd that comes with your child's medication. Some people keep the patient inserts in a small notebook to be used as a reference. This is most useful when several medications are prescribed.Anxiety and depression. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) are the medications most often prescribed for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Only one of the SSRI's, fluoxetine, (Prozac\ufffd) has been approved by the FDA for both OCD and depression in children age 7 and older. Three that have been approved for OCD are fluvoxamine (Luvox\ufffd), age 8 and older; and clomipramine (Anafranil\ufffd), age 10 and older.4 Treatment with these medications can be associated with decreased frequency of repetitive, ritualistic behavior and improvements in eye contact and social contacts. The FDA is studying and analyzing data to better understand how to use the SSRI's safely, effectively, and at the lowest dose possible.Behavioral problems. Antipsychotic medications have been used to treat severe behavioral problems. These medications work by reducing the activity in the brain of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Among the older, typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol (Haldol\ufffd), thioridazine, fluphenazine, and chlorpromazine, haloperidol was found in more than one study to be more effective than a placebo in treating serious behavioral problems.27 However, haloperidol, while helpful for reducing symptoms of aggression, can also have adverse side effects, such as sedation, muscle stiffness, and abnormal movements.Placebo-controlled studies of the newer\ufffdatypica\ufffd antipsychotics are being conducted on children with autism. The first such study, conducted by the NIMH-supported Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP) Autism Network, was on risperidone (Risperdal\ufffd).28 Results of the 8-week study were reported in 2002 and showed that risperidone was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of severe behavioral problems in children with autism. The most common side effects were increased appetite, weight gain and sedation. Further long-term studies are needed to determine any long-term side effects. Other atypical antipsychotics that have been studied recently with encouraging results are olanzapine (Zyprexa\ufffd) and ziprasidone (Geodon\ufffd). Ziprasidone has not been associated with significant weight gain.Seizures. Seizures are found in one in four persons with ASD, most often in those who have low IQ or are mute. They are treated with one or more of the anticonvulsants. These include such medications as (Topamax\ufffd), and valproic acid (Depakote\ufffd). The level of the medication in the blood should be monitored carefully and adjusted so that the least amount possible is used to be effective. Although medication usually reduces the number of seizures, it cannot always eliminate them.Inattention and hyperactivity. Stimulant medications such as methylphenidate (Ritalin\ufffd), used safely and effectively in persons with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have also been prescribed for children with autism. These medications may decrease impulsivity and hyperactivity in some children, especially those higher functioning children.Several other medications have been used to treat ASD symptoms; among them are other antidepressants, naltrexone, lithium, and some of the benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium\ufffd) and lorazepam (Ativan\ufffd). The safety and efficacy of these medications in children with autism has not been proven. Since people may respond differently to different medications, your child's unique history and behavior will help your doctor decide which medication might be most beneficial.Adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder Some adults with ASD, especially those with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome, are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs. Nevertheless, communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of life. They will continue to need encouragement and moral support in their struggle for an independent life.Many others with ASD are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps persons with ASD continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives.The public schools\ufffd responsibility for providing services ends when the person with ASD reaches the age of 22. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals. Long before your child finishes school, you will want to search for the best programs and facilities for your young adult. If you know other parents of ASD adults, ask them about the services available in your community. If your community has little to offer, serve as an advocate for your child and work toward the goal of improved employment services. Research the resources listed in the back of this brochure to learn as much as possible about the help your child is eligible to receive as an adult.Living Arrangements for the Adult with an Autism Spectrum DisorderIndependent living. Some adults with ASD are able to live entirely on their own. Others can live semi-independently in their own home or apartment if they have assistance with solving major problems, such as personal finances or dealing with the government agencies that provide services to persons with disabilities. This assistance can be provided by family, a professional agency, or another type of provider.Living at home. Government funds are available for families that choose to have their adult child with ASD live at home. These programs include Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Medicaid waivers, and others. Information about these programs is available from the Social Security Administration (SSA). An appointment with a local SSA office is a good first step to take in understanding the programs for which the young adult is eligible.Foster homes and skill-development homes. Some families open their homes to provide long-term care to unrelated adults with disabilities. If the home teaches self-care and housekeeping skills and arranges leisure activities, it is called a\ufffdskill-developmen\ufffd home.Supervised group living. Persons with disabilities frequently live in group homes or apartments staffed by professionals who help the individuals with basic needs. These often include meal preparation, housekeeping, and personal care needs. Higher functioning persons may be able to live in a home or apartment where staff only visit a few times a week. These persons generally prepare their own meals, go to work, and conduct other daily activities on their own.Institutions. Although the trend in recent decades has been to avoid placing persons with disabilities into long-term-care institutions, this alternative is still available for persons with ASD who need intensive, constant supervision. Unlike many of the institutions years ago, today\ufffds facilities view residents as individuals with human needs and offer opportunities for recreation and simple but meaningful work.Research into Causes and Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorders Research into the causes, the diagnosis, and the treatment of autism spectrum disorders has advanced in tandem. With new well-researched standardized diagnostic tools, ASD can be diagnosed at an early age. And with early diagnosis, the treatments found to be beneficial in recent years can be used to help the child with ASD develop to his or her greatest potential.Disorders/VaccinationsThe Institute of Medicine (IOM) conducted a thorough review on the issue of a link between thimerosal (a mercury based preservative that is no longer used in vaccinations) and autism. The final report from IOM, Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines and Autism, released in May 2004, stated that the committee did not find a link.Until 1999, vaccines given to infants to protect them against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Hepatitis B contained thimerosal as a preservative. Today, with the exception of some flu vaccines, none of the vaccines used in the U.S. to protect preschool aged children against 12 infectious diseases contain thimerosal as a preservative. The MMR vaccine does not and never did Varicella (chickenpox), inactivated polio (IPV), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have also never contained thimerosal.A U.S. study looking at environmental factors including exposure to mercury, lead and other heavy metals is ongoing.Research on the Biologic Basis of ASDBecause of its relative inaccessibility, scientists have only recently been able to study the brain systematically. But with the emergence of new brain imaging tools\ufffdcomputerized tomography (CT), tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), study of the structure and the functioning of the brain can be done. With the aid of modern technology and the new availability of both normal and autism tissue samples to do postmortem studies, researchers will be able to learn much through comparative studies.Postmortem and MRI studies have shown that many major brain structures are implicated in autism. This includes the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, limbic system, corpus callosum, basal ganglia, and brain stem.29 Other research is focusing on the role of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and epinephrine.Research into the causes of autism spectrum disorders is being fueled by other recent developments. Evidence points to genetic factors playing a prominent role in the causes for ASD. Twin and family studies have suggested an underlying genetic vulnerability to ASD.30 To further research in this field, the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange, a project initiated by the Cure Autism Now Foundation, and aided by an NIMH grant, is recruiting genetic samples from several hundred families. Each family with more than one member diagnosed with ASD is given a 2-hour, in-home screening. With a large number of DNA samples, it is hoped that the most important genes will be found. This will enable scientists to learn what the culprit genes do and how they can go wrong.Another exciting development is the Autism Tissue Program (http://www.brainbank.org), supported by the Autism Society of America Foundation, the Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (M.I.N.D.) Institute at the University of California, Davis, and the National Alliance for Autism Research. The program is aided by a grant to the Harvard Brain and Tissue Resource Center (http://www.brainbank.mclean.org), funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Studies of the postmortem brain with imaging methods will help us learn why some brains are large, how the limbic system develops, and how the brain changes as it ages. Tissue samples can be stained and will show which neurotransmitters are being made in the cells and how they are transported and released to other cells. By focusing on specific brain regions and neurotransmitters, it will become easier to identify susceptibility genes.Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that a contributing cause for autism may be abnormal brain development beginning in the infant\ufffds first months. This\ufffdgrowth dysregulation hypothesi\ufffd holds that the anatomical abnormalities seen in autism are caused by genetic defects in brain growth factors. It is possible that sudden, rapid head growth in an infant may be an early warning signal that will lead to early diagnosis and effective biological intervention or possible prevention of autism.31The Children\ufffds Health Act of 2000\ufffdWhat It Means to Autism ResearchThe Children\ufffds Health Act of 2000 was responsible for the creation of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC), a committee that includes the directors of five NIH institutes\ufffdthe National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)\ufffdas well as representatives from the Health Resource Services Administration, the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (a part of the Centers for Disease Control), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Administration on Developmental Disabilities, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the U.S. Department of Education. The Committee, instructed by the Congress to develop a 10-year agenda for autism research, introduced the plan, dubbed a\ufffdmatri\ufffd or a\ufffdroadmap\ufffd at the first Autism Summit Conference in November 2003. The roadmap indicates priorities for research for years 1 to 3, years 4 to 6, and years 7 to 10.The five NIH institutes of the IACC have established the Studies to Advance Autism Research and Treatment (STAART) Network, composed of eight network centers. They will conduct research in the fields of developmental neurobiology, genetics, and psychopharmacology. Each center is pursuing its own particular mix of studies, but there also will be multi-site clinical trials within the STAART network.The STAART centers are located at the following sites:University of North Carolina, Chapel HillYale University, ConnecticutUniversity of Washington, SeattleUniversity of California, Los AngelesMount Sinai Medical School, New YorkKennedy Krieger Institute, MarylandBoston University, MassachusettsUniversity of Rochester, New YorkA data coordination center will analyze the data generated by both the STAART network and the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism (CPEA). This latter program, funded by the NICHD and the NIDCD Network on the Neurobiology and Genetics of Autism, consists of 10 sites. The CPEA is at present studying the world\ufffds largest group of well-diagnosed individuals with autism characterized by genetic and developmental profiles.The CPEA centers are located at:Boston University, MassachusettsUniversity of California, DavisUniversity of California, IrvineUniversity of California, Los AngelesYale University, ConnecticutUniversity of Washington, SeattleUniversity of Rochester, New YorkUniversity of Texas, HoustonUniversity of Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaUniversity of Utah, Salt Lake CityThe NIEHS has programs at:Center for Childhood Neurotoxicology and Assessment, University of Medicine Dentistry, New JerseyThe Center for the Study of Environmental Factors in the Etiology of Autism, University of California, DavisReferences 1.

The clinic provides assessment and treatment for children with Autism, as well as providing the necessary parental support and training. Definition of Autism The Autism Spectrum Disorders are a group of disorders with common deficits in three key areas - communication, social interaction and imaginative thought and play. The disorder is defined by a list of behaviour criteria set by the American Psychiatric Association. The criteria is used to define subtypes in what has become known as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The word 'spectrum' reflects the fact that no two people with an Autism Spectrum Disorder behave the same. At the least affected end of the spectrum diagnostic labels such as Asperger's Syndrome , High Functioning Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) are used. At the more impaired end labels such as Autism , Classic Autism and Kanner Autism are used. Read more... Autism Diagnosis Autism is not diagnosed through any specific diagnostic laboratory tests. The diagnosis of Autism is based entirely on observation and classification of behaviours and does not take into account the underlying causal factors. A multi-disciplinary assessment is usually recommended for a diagnosis. At the Behavioural Neurotherapy Clinic, younger children are assessed by a team of Allied Health Professionals, who will provide information that will enable parents to make educated decisions about our ABA program and Biomedical treatment approaches. For older children, teenagers and adults, a psychologist experienced with Autism Spectrum Disorders usually makes the diagnosis. We prefer to provide a diagnosis as early as possible preferably from approximately 18 months through to three years of age, to allow for early intensive intervention. Read more... Causes of Autism Although there are no single specific causes identified in the aetiology of Autism Spectrum disorders, there are published scientific theories that Autism may be caused by genetic polymorphisms which express themselves when interacting with nutrient deficiencies to create less than optimum cell structures. These in turn can potentially cause multiple dysfunctions in systems in the body. Environmental toxins may then further compromise these systems resulting in the range of health and behaviour deficits seen in the Autistic population. Read more...

The special U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that vaccines could not have caused the autism of an Oregon boy, William Mead, ending his family's quest for reimbursement. \"The Meads believe that thimerosal-containing vaccines caused William's regressive autism. As explained below, the undersigned finds that the Meads have not presented a scientifically sound theory,\" Special Master George Hastings, a former tax claims expert at the Department of Justice, wrote in his ruling. In February 2009, the court ruled against three families who claimed vaccines caused their children's autism, saying they had been \"misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment\". The families sought payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault system that has a $2.5 billion fund built up from a 75-cent-per-dose tax on vaccines. Instead of judges, three \"special masters\" heard the three test cases representing thousands of other petitioners. They asked whether a combination vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, plus a mercury-containing preservative called thimerosal, caused the children's symptoms. MYSTERIOUS CONDITION More than 5,300 cases were filed by parents who believed vaccines may have caused autism in their children. The no-fault payout system is meant to protect vaccine makers from costly lawsuits that drove many out of the vaccine-making business. Autism is a mysterious condition that affects as many as one in 110 U.S. children. The so-called spectrum ranges from mild Asperger's Syndrome to severe mental retardation and social disability, and there is no cure or good treatment. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has reported several times that no link can be found between vaccines and autism. Supporters of the scientific community welcomed the ruling. \"It's time to move forward and look for the real causes of autism,\" said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation. \"There is not a bottomless pit of money with which to fund autism science. We have to use our scarce resources wisely.\" But advocates for the idea that vaccines are dangerous said they would not give up. \"We hope that Congress will intervene in what is clearly a miscarriage of justice to vaccine-injured children,\" said Jim Moody of the Coalition for Vaccine Safety. Autism Speaks, another advocacy group, said it would also not completely abandon the theory that vaccines might cause autism. The organization said it would invest \"in research to determine whether subsets of individuals might be at increased risk for developing autism symptoms following vaccination.\" But the group also said it was clear that if such a link did exist, it would be rare. \"While we have great empathy for all parents of children with autism, it is important to keep in mind that, given the present state of the science, the proven benefits of vaccinating a child to protect them against serious diseases far outweigh the hypothesized risk that vaccinations might cause autism,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement.

More Information No. No, Thank You by Catherine Pollard My bright, beautiful, and loving six-year old grand-daughter, Catherine Jane, whom we call CJ, has autism. One of the earliest indications of her autism was delayed speech. As CJ slowly developed communication skills, she began to quote entire sections of dialogue from movies that she viewed. However, it has taken longer for her to express her thoughts using her own words. So we were quite pleased when she began to respond to situations with which she did not agree with a firm No. No, thank you. We have encountered some interesting and often humorous situations when she has used this response. For example, when my husband and his brother visited my daughter, Mary, she called to CJ saying that someone had come to see her. CJ called back hopefully, Gramme? Mary said, No, it s Grandpa and Uncle Robert. CJ quickly responded, No. No, thank you, expressing her preference with whom she wanted to play that day. Ever since she was a toddler, CJ has objected in the strongest ways, which usually included kicking and screaming, when her pediatrician needed to examine her ears. This summer while we were on vacation, CJ began saying that her ear hurt. After Grandpa, who is a doctor, checked her throat and indicated it was time for him to look in her ear, she looked at Grandpa and said, No. No, thank you. No matter how uncomfortable she was, she definitely did not want to have that otiscope in her ear, and she used her words to express that fact to Grandpa. More recently, my daughter decided to try to reduce the fat content in CJ s diet by preparing lower-fat turkey dogs instead of regular hot dogs. When the turkey dog was served, CJ leaned over, took one sniff, and dismissed the turkey dog with a simple, No. No, thank you, and a more descriptive, Ewww. It was obvious CJ, like all of us, has her own set of standards, especially where hot dogs are concerned. All of us who love CJ are delighted that she is expressing her thoughts in her own words, and we enjoy hearing the unique and interesting ways that she phrases those thoughts.

Related NewsJournal retracts paper that linked autism to MMR vaccineEditorial: Hippocrates would puke1 in 4 parents believes autism linked to vaccines WASHINGTON - The vaccine additive thimerosal is not to blame for autism, a special federal court ruled Friday in a long-running battle by parents convinced there is a connection. While expressing sympathy for the parents involved in the emotionally charged cases, the court concluded they had failed to show a connection between the mercury-containing preservative and autism. \"Such families must cope every day with tremendous challenges in caring for their autistic children, and all are deserving of sympathy and admiration,\" special master George Hastings Jr. wrote. But, he added, Congress designed the victim compensation program only for families whose injuries or deaths can be shown to be linked to a vaccine and that has not been done in this case. The ruling came in the so-called vaccine court, a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims established to handle claims of injury from vaccines. It can be appealed in federal court. The parents presented expert witnesses who argued mercury can have a variety of effects on the brain, but the ruling said none of them offered opinions on the cause of autism in the three specific cases argued. They testified that mercury can affect a number of biological processes, including abnormal metabolism in children. Special master Denise K. Vowell noted that in order to succeed in their action, the parents would have to show \"the exquisitely small amounts of mercury\" that reach the brain from vaccines can produce devastating effects that far larger amounts ... from other sources do not. The ruling said the parents were arguing that the effects from mercury in vaccines differ from mercury's known effects on the brain. \ufffdVowell concluded that the parents had failed to establish that their child's condition was caused or aggravated by mercury from vaccines. Friday's decision that autism is not caused by thimerosal alone follows a parallel ruling in 2009 that autism is not caused by the combination of vaccines with thimerosal and other vaccines. The cases had been divided into three theories about a vaccine-autism relationship for the court to consider. The 2009 ruling rejected a theory that thimerasol can cause autism when combined with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. After that, a theory that certain vaccines alone cause autism was dropped. Friday's decision covers the last of the three theories, that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism. The ruling doesn't necessarily mean an end to the dispute, however, with appeals to other courts available. brain MMR Congress U.S. Court of Federal Claims Denise K.

Questions and answers about autism First it is important to note that autism does not impact all individuals in the same way. While there are certain characteristics common to most people with autism, not all people with autism have all of the same characteristics, e.g., many people with autism have extreme difficulty in developing social skills, and others are very comfortable in social situations displaying good eye contact and affection to others. What is autism? Autism is a life-long developmental disability that affects an individual s ability to process sensory information and causes difficulties in developing communication skills, the interpretation of social relationships, and in learning appropriate ways to relate to people, objects and events. What are some characteristics of autism? The degree of severity of characteristics differs from person to person, but usually includes the following: Significant delays in language development Verbal language is slow to develop, and in some instances the person is completely non-verbal. Some individuals exhibit peculiar speech patterns or the use of words without attachment to their normal meaning. Those who are able to use language effectively may still use unusual metaphors or speak in a formal and monotone voice. Significant delays in understanding social relationships The autistic person often avoids eye contact, resists being picked up, and may seem to tune out the world around him. This results in a lack of cooperative play with peers, and impaired ability to develop friendships, and difficulty in understanding other people s feelings. Inconsistent patterns of sensory responses The child who has autism at times may appear to be deaf and fail to respond to words or other sounds. At other times, the same child may be extremely distressed by an everyday noise such as a vacuum cleaner or a dog s barking. The child also may show an apparent insensitivity to pain and a lack of responsiveness to cold or heat, or touch, or may overreact to any of these sensations. Uneven patterns of intellectual functioning The individual may have special skills such as drawing, music, memorizing facts, or math skills, while at the same time having great challenges with everyday life skills such as shoe tying, using eating utensils, toilet training, etc. May persons with autism have average or above average intelligence while others may have some degree of mental retardation. Marked restriction of activity and interests A person who has autism may perform repetitive body movements, such as hand flicking, twisting, spinning, or rocking. Persons with autism often display repetition by following the same schedule every day, the same order or doing tasks such as dressing, waking or mealtimes. If changes occur in these routines, the person with autism often becomes very distressed. People with autism often will develop obsessions about certain topics, or people either real or fictional. What causes autism? Autism is a brain disorder, which affects the way the brain uses information. The cause of autism is still unknown. Some research suggests that there is a genetic predisposition along with other factors such as exposure to some element which ithe child s body is unable to process which becomes a toxin in the child s system, causing abnormal brain development. Autism is not caused by ineffective or cold parenting. How does autism affect behavior? In addition to significant language and socialization problems, people with autism often experience extreme hyperactivity or unusual passivity in relating to parents, family members, and other people. Do all people with autism have behavior problems? No. Many people with autism have developed ways of coping with some of the challenges presented by their condition. Therapists, teachers and parents work to determine what may be upsetting to the individual. A variety of therapies are often used, as well as special items like weighted vests and environmental modifications, which all help the person with autism to function without anxiety and stress. In autism, behavior problems range from very severe to mild. Severe behavior problems may take the form of highly unusual, aggressive, and in some cases even self-injurious behavior, these behaviors may persist and be difficult to change. In its milder form, autism may resemble a learning disability, usually, however, even people who are only mildly affected may need a significant amount of instruction and support to be successful at school and work because of deficits in the areas of communication and socialization. Does autism occur in conjunction with other disabilities? Autism can occur by itself or in association with other developmental disorders such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, epilepsy, etc. Autism is best considered as a spectrum disorder, meaning that the degree that the individual is handicapped by the condition depends on the location on the spectrum from mild impairment to significant impairment. Can people with autism be helped? Yes. Although at the present time there is no cure for autism, people with autism can make substantial improvement in their functioning ability when given proper instruction with the necessary level of intensity. You will find information about specific treatment approaches elsewhere on this web site. Many studies have indicated that intensive early intervention (preferable in the early childhood period) can lead to significant positive outcomes for a child with autism. A child with autism does not have brain damage, but rather certain areas of the brain have not developed in a way that is helpful to the processing of sensory information. A child who receives intensive instruction early on has the opportunity of having the needed brain development ot occur which becomes the basis for language development, the understanding of social relationships, imaginative play skills, basic academic skills needed for preschool success, etc. How can persons with autism learn best? Since each person with autism has different needs and strengths, it is important that a program of instruction be based on a comprehensive assessment of the person s present level of functioning. An individualized plan can then be developed taking into consideration the individual s needs, strengths, fears, physical environmental factors and motivational aspects. Young children often require a period of intensive, individualized, one-on-one instruction, which can be reduced as the child develops communication, socialization and coping skills. What services are available for people with autism in Indiana? Children with autism who are under the age of three can access a full range of services through Indiana s First Steps Program. First Steps evaluations are offered at no cost to the family. When it is determined that the child would benefit from on-going services through First Steps charges for services are based on a sliding fee scale based on household income and number of persons in the household. Children over age three are eligible for an evaluation through the public school Special Education Department. When a child is determined to be eligible, the public school will make arrangements for the child to receive the services needed at no charge to the family. In Indiana children with special needs are eligible for public school special education services until their 22nd birthday. When children leave public schools they are eligible for service through the Indiana Department of Vocational Rehabilitation, and there is an option for seeking a community job with the assistance of a community job coach or work in a sheltered workshop setting. The Bureau of Developmental Disabilities, a branch of the Indiana Department of Family and Social Services, can assist individuals to apply for the Medicaid Waiver program. The Medicaid Waiver is a funding source that can pay for case management services, therapies, respite services and other services. IN*SOURCE, The Indiana Resource Center for Parents, is a statewide program that provides information, advocacy and supports for families of school age children. IN*SOURCE provides training for families on Indiana and Federal Special Education laws, the case conference process, the development of the Individual Education Plan, mediation of disputes and other topics. The Regional Autism Center has a family support group that meets monthly, and we maintain a list of contact information for other support groups in the region. Many other services are available through area therapy providers, behavioral and mental health centers, hospitals, recreation providers and others.

Autism78 http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site613/mainpageS613P0.html Level two The second level of screening should be performed if a child is identified in the first level of screening as developmentally delayed. The second level of screening is a more in-depth diagnosis and evaluation that can differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. The second level of screening may include more formal diagnostic procedures by clinicians skilled in diagnosing autism, including medical history, neurological evaluation, genetic testing, metabolic testing, electrophysiologic testing (CT scan, MR Imaging, PET scan) among others. Genetic testing involves an evaluation by a medical geneticist (a physician who has specialized training and certification in clinical genetics), particularly as there are several genetic syndromes which may cause autism, including Fragile-X, untreated phenylketonuria (PKU), neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, Rett syndrome, as well as a variety of chromosome abnormalities. A geneticist can determine whether the autism is caused due to a genetic disorder, or has no known genetic cause. If a genetic disorder is diagnosed, there may be other health problems involved. The chance for autism to occur in a future pregnancy would depend on the syndrome found. For example, PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder with a reoccurrence risk of one in four, or 25 percent, chance, while tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder, with a reoccurrence risk of 50 percent. In cases where no genetic cause for the autism is identified, there is still a slightly increased chance for a couple to have another child with autism, with ranges averaging from 3 to 7 percent. The reason for this increase over the general population is thought to be because autism may result from several genes inherited from both parents acting in combination, in addition to unknown environmental factors. There is no action/inaction known that parents could have done, or did not do, to cause autism to occur in a child. Always consult your child's physician for a diagnosis and for more information. genetic genetic PKU rett syndrome CT MR Imaging Fragile-X www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site613/mainpageS613P0.html screening Autism79 http://www.autismcolorado.com/ I Paint, Therefore I AmA Benefit for the Autism Society of Colorado Join us for a cultural and artistic evening featuring local artists and the work of Matt Hardwick, an artist with Asperger\ufffds Syndrome.

The main signs and symptoms of autism involve communication, social interactions and repetitive behaviors. Children with autism might have problems talking with you, or they might not look you in the eye when you talk to them. They may have to line up their pencils before they can pay attention, or they may say the same sentence again and again to calm themselves down. They may flap their arms to tell you they are happy, or they might hurt themselves to tell you they are not. Some people with autism never learn how to talk. Because people with autism can have very different features or symptoms, health care providers think of autism as a spectrum disorder. Asperger syndrome is a milder version of the disorder. The cause of autism is not known. Autism lasts throughout a person's lifetime. There is no cure, but treatment can help. Treatments include behavior and communication therapies and medicines to control symptoms.

Photograph: Allstar/United Artists/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar Adults with autism are set to get the same access to jobs, education and good health care as everybody else following a pledge from government today in its first autism strategy for England.Care services minister Phil Hope says the strategy is not about creating a raft of new services, but about reorganising those that exist to help people with autism better. \"The success of the strategy will depend upon those existing services changing to recognise and respond to the needs of people with autism,\" he says.Although a modest amount of new money \ufffd in the shape of \ufffd500,000 to train frontline professionals to better recognise and understand autism and its needs \ufffd is being announced, the strategy is expected to be implemented without substantial extra finance. The first year's delivery plan will be published later this month.Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University, warmly welcomes the document. \"Encouragingly, it pinpoints achievable solutions that could radically improve the lives of people with autism,\" he says. \"This is an important new development, following on the heels of the historic new Autism Act.\" But he suggests that additional finance might be required. \"The hope is that the autism strategy will lead to the identification of desperately needed funding to meet the cost of these essential provisions,\" he says.Around one in 100 adults have a condition somewhere on the autistic spectrum, according to the recent Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. \"By applying the one in 100 figure, we estimate that over 300,000 adults in England have autism,\" says the report. \"Together with their families, they make up over 1 million people whose lives are touched by autism every day.\"The report defines autism as \"a lifelong condition that affects how a person communicates with, and relates to, other people. It also affects how a person makes sense of the world around them.\" Those affected have problems communicating and interacting, and find it hard to imagine other people's feelings and predict their behaviour. For the purposes of the strategy, the Department of Health includes Asperger's syndrome, which can affect people who are very articulate and talented but still suffer from considerable communication difficulties.The Autism Act 2009 was passed in response to increasing evidence that people with autism suffer social and economic exclusion. Only 15% of adults have jobs, they have poorer health than the rest of the population, and 49% of adults live with and are dependent on their parents. The launch of the strategy is a requirement of the act.\"Adults with autism spectrum conditions have been invisible, marginalised, and left to suffer in a system they cannot negotiate unaided,\" says Baron-Cohen.Among the aims of the strategy are to increase awareness and understanding of autism among frontline public services staff. Too often, people with autism are thought to be rude and difficult by the police, or they avoid going to see a GP because of crowds in the waiting rooms. Employment advisers may recommend only certain types of job, and some social workers assume that all people with autism have a learning disability.\"Although most people have heard of autism, they do not actually understand the whole spectrum and how it affects people differently,\" said one contributor to the strategy's consultation process. \"Most will cite Rain Man and assume that all autistic people are the same as the character in the film.\"The National Institute for Healthcare and Clinical Excellence is developing diagnosis guidelines, and the strategy aims to ensure that support and services follow diagnosis, and to identify and promote service models that have been proved to make a positive difference.The strategy will allow adults with autism, and their families, to have more control over where they live \ufffd recognising sensitivities to, for instance, harsh lighting in a home, and offering support to those who want to live independently.A National Autism Programme Board will be set up to lead the public service changes.The National Autistic Society believes it is critical that specialist autism teams should be set up in every local area, responsible for providing a range of services, including diagnosis and support, but the strategy appears to leave it up to each area to develop its own commissioning plan. \"What really matters is delivery on the ground,\" says chief executive Mark Lever. \"We will look to see how we can work with local authorities to ensure that the words deliver real change.\" National Autistic Society Rain Man Dustin Hoffman \ufffd England Autism Act Mark Lever Rain Man England.Care Phil Hope Baron-Cohen Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey Department of Health includes Asperger GP National Institute for Healthcare and Clinical Excellence National Autism Programme Board www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/mar/03/labour-adult-autism-strategy Autism82 http://www.autismnwaf.org/index.htm OUR PARTNERS Easter Seals of OregonSwindells Resource Center OrPTIAutism Society of Oregon Autism Research InstituteARRO Help Autism Now Society (HANS)Oregon Technical Assistance Corp.

What causes it? Who can get it? What are signs my child could be autistic? How is it diagnosed? What are the symptoms? Is it contagious? How is it treated? What can I do to help? How long does it last? Can it be prevented? When should I call the doctor? What is autism? Autism is a developmental disability. It is a brain disorder. It is a type of pervasive developmental disorder, or PDD. It is sometimes called infantile autism or autistic disorder. It causes a wide range of developmental problems in young children. An autistic child often has problems with social skills, communication, and behavior. What causes it? The cause is unknown. It may have something to do with genetics or how the brain works. Different children may have autism for different reasons. Parents do not cause autism. Autism has not been linked to vaccines. Symptoms usually become more obvious in the second year of life, which happens to be around the same time most children get a vaccine for measles. The vaccine does not cause the symptoms. Who can get it? Anyone can get autism. It is more common in boys than in girls. Parents of a child with autism are more likely to have another child with autism. What are signs my child could be autistic? Most babies are very social. They like to cuddle and laugh. They respond positively to interaction. A child with autism does not interact in these ways. An autistic child's physical appearance is normal. She may not like to be touched or held. She may have strange, repetitive behaviors. She may seem to be in her own world and lack interest in other people. She may prefer to play with toys or objects instead of people. Parents may worry that their child is deaf because she hasn't learned to talk and doesn't respond to people. Autistic children often seem withdrawn. How is it diagnosed? Autism cannot be diagnosed at birth. It is usually diagnosed by the time a child is 3 years old. Parents usually begin to notice symptoms when the child is young. 25% of children are diagnosed in the first year of life. 50% are usually diagnosed in the second year. 25% are usually diagnosed in the third year. The child should be seen by a doctor as soon as parents notice symptoms. She may need to be seen by a developmental pediatrician or psychiatrist (special doctors who are trained to diagnose autism). The doctor will watch your child and ask you about her symptoms. How have her social and language skills changed over time? Her behavior? She may need tests. What are the symptoms? Autism usually affects a child's social skills, communication skills, and behavior. Symptoms can be mild or severe. Every child has different symptoms. Symptoms often get worse in adolescence (10 - 14 years old). Social Skills Lacks social skills, does not seem interested in others. Seems unaware of others' feelings. Avoids eye contact. Does not like to be touched or held. Does not respond to name. Likes to play alone. Seems in her own world. Communication Skills Begins speaking later than most children. May not speak at all. Has problems with language. May call herself \"she\" instead of \"I.\" Forgets how to say words and sentences that she knew before. Doesn't know how to use words. Can't start a conversation or keep one going. Repeats what other people say. Repeats a word or phrase over and over again. Speaks in rhyme or a singsong voice. Behavior Has repetitive routines. Routines often reflect a need to maintain order. (Child may need to line up her shoes every morning before she is ready to leave. Gets upset if you move the shoes.) Is upset if routines are changed. (May get very upset if bus is late.) Repetitive behavior, such as rocking back and forth or flapping hands. Self-injury, such as banging her head or biting. May have tantrums. Overly active. May play with one part of a toy. Fascinated by things that spin, for example. Likes to play alone. Does not often play imaginary games. May react in strange ways to loud noises and high-pitched sounds. May have one extreme talent (drawing, solving math problems, remembering statistics, etc.) May learn quickly and be very intelligent. Despite intelligence may still lack social skills or have problems communicating. May be slow to learn new skills. May have problems adjusting to new situations. Is it contagious? No. Autism is not contagious. How is it treated? There is no cure. Treatment is aimed at helping your child reach her highest potential (learn as much as she can). Every child has strengths and weaknesses. Children often benefit from special education programs and behavior training. Some children may need special teachers or classes or may need to go to a special school. Other children may work best in a \"regular\" classroom. Children can often be trained in specific skills. Medication may help. What can I do to help? Join your child where she is playing. Try to introduce her to a variety of activities. If she likes spinning toys, show her several toys that spin. She may not respond to spoken praise. Try other ways to reward her. After she behaves well, give her extra time to play with a favorite toy. Use lots of visuals to help her understand spoken language. Use pictures, photos, symbols, or gestures. Teach her how to use the pictures to talk to you. Try to teach your child important life skills, such as crossing the street, taking the bus, dialing her home phone number, and cooking. Autistic children have special needs that can be stressful. Developmental pediatricians, psychiatrists, teachers, social workers, and others can help families cope and teach them how to manage a treatment plan for their child. Get help if you are having problems coping. Parents often experience stages of grief when their child is diagnosed with autism. Talk to your doctor. How long does it last? Autism cannot be cured but treatment can often help reduce symptoms. Success often depends on how severe the symptoms are. The child may be able to learn new skills or taught how to control her behavior. Some children may be able to live on their own. Children with more severe autism may never learn how to do the everyday tasks they need to be independent. Can it be prevented? There is no known way to prevent autism. When should I call the doctor? Call your doctor if your child shows behaviors from \"Signs\" and \"Symptoms\" above. Call your doctor, your child's doctor, your child's school, or a support group for help. There are many organizations that can help you cope and teach you how to manage life with an autistic child. Your autistic child has a legal right to receive special services at school. Talk to your doctor or teachers for more information. They can help you decide what school setting and education plan will be best for your child. Quick Answers Autism is a developmental disability. The cause is unknown. Different children may have autism for different reasons. Anyone can get autism. It is more common in boys than in girls. Most babies respond positively to interaction. A child with autism often does not. It is usually diagnosed by the time a child is 3 years old. Autism usually affects a child's social skills, communication skills, and behavior. It is not contagious. Treatment is aimed at helping your child learn as much as she can. Use lots of visuals to help her understand spoken language. Autism cannot be cured but treatment can often help reduce symptoms. There is no known way to prevent it. Call your doctor, your child's doctor, your child's school, or a support group for help.

Unlike blindness or deafness, where a person is unable to sense or receive input from sight or sound, a person with SID is able to perceive sensory stimuli. The deficit lies in the brain s inability to process the stimuli. If the person with SID is hyposensitive to sensory input such as touch, he or she may be more likely to be injured walking into objects or not realizing an object was too hot. A SID patient who is hypersensitive to input such as noise, will often respond loudly and negatively to surprise noises. They may also be able to hear soft noises, such as the buzz from fluorescent lights which is imperceptible to a typical person. Sensory Integration Therapy is a proven treatment for SID and is typically implemented by occupational therapists who also treat patients with autism. brain Autism Spectrum Disorders Autism Sensory Integration Disorder SID Tourette Syndrome autism.lifetips.com/ Autism85 http://www.msgtruth.org/autism.htm Breaking NEWS: November 21, 2009 - the FDA has just approved Abilify (Aripiprazole) to treat autism symptoms. This GLUTAMATE BLOCKER is now being used to treat autism. At the VERY SAME TIME, behavioral therapists are feeding MSG-laden junk food to children with autism as REWARDS for behavior. Dr. Oz explains autism as a disease affected by inflammation, which is affected by DIET. Dr. Oz didn't mention vaccines, but vaccines stimulate the immune response. That is exactly what they are designed to do. Unfortunately, MSG exacerbates the immune response further and most folks don't know that VACCINES are a very real source of Free Glutamic acid as well. It is in the hydrolyzed gelatin added as a preservative in nearly all vaccines - but especially in the MMR vaccine. For children with the RNF8 gene mutation which inhibits the formation of glutathione to begin with, the following scientific explanation of what happens in the mitochondria should be chilling enough to force the immediate removal of free glutamic acid (hydrolyzed gelatin) from all vaccines. According to Dr. Eduardo E. Benarroch, M.D. on Pg 296 of his book Basic Neurosciences with Clinical Applications ?There is a low-affinity glutamate transporter that acts as a 1:1 cystine-glutamate exchanger and carries cystine to the interior of the cell in exchange for intracellular glutamate. The released glutamate undergoes rapid uptake via the Na+/K+ glutamate transporter. Accumulation of extra-cellular glutamate inhibits the cystine-glutamate exchanger, resulting in depletion of cell stores of cystine. This predisposes to oxidative stress, because cysteine, a derivative of cystine, is required for synthesis of the anti-oxidant glutathione. Oligodendrocytes are particularly susceptible to glutathione-induced cystine depletion and excitotoxicity.? In recent research papers by S. H Fatemi, Autism is described as a hyper-glutamatergic disorder. In other words, in autistic individuals, glutamate is in excess in the nervous system. And so based on well-accepted scientific information, children with ASD but especially those who present with heavy metal toxicity or the RNF8 mutation, and ASD symptoms of taurine deficiency (taurine is also made from cysteine) like epilepsy, irregular heartbeat, frequent diarrhea or constipation, and trouble digesting fats, should be avoiding ALL sources of excess glutamate found in PROCESSED wheat, dairy, soy, and corn and VACCINES with any hydrolyzed protein or gelatin in them. FLOW CHART showing how MSG and autism are connected. Autism is directly impacted by genes that affect the nervous system and the neurotransmitter glutamate according to research reported in Scientific American February 17, 2007. However, because vaccines, and processed gluten and casein (wheat and dairy), are high in the amino acid glutamate in its free form, we firmly believe these items WILL affect a child's brain during development - prior to age 7. = FREE GLUTAMIC ACID (glutamate) Autism appears very similar to the disease PKU, which causes brain damage by the buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine due to an error of metabolism that prevents the breakdown of this one amino acid. The treatment is a special limited amino acid diet until the age of 7. Based on the precedent of the disease PKU, which is tested for at birth, and treated with diet, and also involves one amino acid, we completely agree with Jenny McCarthy and her organization Generation Rescue, that the behaviors of autism can be reversed by greening vaccines (specifically removing glutamic acid), changing the vaccination schedule, and adhering to a strict diet limiting the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate in their free form. However, since a child's brain is generally hard-wired by age 7, early treatment is essential. Carol Hoernlein wrote the following to the NIH in January. It still sums up our thoughts. It should be noted that one of the genes for autism discovered last year codes for a MITOCHONDRIAL aspartate/glutamate carrier: I am a former food process engineer who believes, because recent studies have implicated genes which code for glutamate synapses in ASD, we should investigate the effects of both INGESTED and INJECTED excitatory free amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid) on children with these autism genes. If excitatory free amino acids affect ASD children, it would explain both the impact of GF-CF diets AND a vaccine link. Vaccines have free glutamic acid added to preserve the virus. I have created and attached a chart showing where free glutamic acid comes from. It is found in extremely high amounts in processed wheat and dairy products - so much so that food manufacturers use these two items routinely to produce free glutamic acid in foods but with a clean label. Consequently, a child may not improve on a GF-CF diet alone, because it doesn't limit all potential sources of free glutamic acid - like soy. Children are tested at birth for PKU and phenylalanine is limited until the brain is hardwired by the age of 7. Why not treat the predisposition for autism similarly and limit the glutamic and aspartic amino acids in the diets of children with autism genes? ASD also includes errors of metabolism for sulfur containing amino acids - like cysteine. Cysteine is converted to taurine and glutathione by the liver. Taurine regulates heartbeat and osmotic balance as well as bile production and was found to be low after a seizure. In ASD, symptoms include arrhythmias, digestive disorders and a high rate of epilepsy - suggesting that taurine production may be compromised. Glutathione levels are also lower in ASD leading one to conclude that possibly, cysteine metabolism may be responsible for the myriad and seemingly unrelated additional symptoms of ASD. It should be noted that glutamate interferes with the handling of cysteine. When cysteine metabolism is compromised, homocysteine levels may increase. The lower levels of glutathione may put ASD individuals at risk of mercury poisoning, since glutathione helps eliminates mercury from the body. It should be noted that the NMDA receptors that respond to both glutamate and aspartate are found in the amygdala - part of the limbic system involved in the perception of taste and smell as well as fear. Activating the amygdala in ASD, causes gaze avoidance. ASD children may also over-react to smells and tastes and face to face encounters can overwhelm them with fear. Limiting excitatory amino acids that target the amygdala may help. Japan consumes more MSG, and fish (a dietary source of mercury) than nearly any other country. Compared to the amount of mercury consumed in fish and the amount of MSG consumed in the diet, the MMR contribution was probably small compared to a typical Japanese diet. In Japan, the MMR vaccine was stopped in 1993. Autism rates still increased. Perhaps in Japan, the diet plays more of a role in autism than the vaccines. Children from other countries with a lower consumption of fish and MSG may find a stronger correlation between vaccines and autism. New research studies into ASD should include people who are sensitive to the food additives MSG and aspartame. MSG-sensitive persons have reported a distinct lessening of symptoms by using taurine, ibuprofen, CoQ10, Vitamins B6 and B12, carbohydrate, foods high in butyric acid - like butter, and Magnesium. Perhaps they share some of the same genes that predispose a child to ASD. New treatment studies should look into these easily available, inexpensive and relatively safe compounds. Based on what I have observed, here are my recommendations: 1. Treatment of ASD? REMOVAL of excitatory amino acids (glutamate, aspartate) from VACCINES. Glutamate and aspartate restricted diet (similar to treatment for PKU) in addition to GF/CF diet. Supplementation of taurine, glutathione, vitamins B6, C, Increased carbohydrate. Labeling of free glutamic and aspartic on food labels. Glutamate blockers, anti-histamines and leukotriene blockers for children already suffering or getting vaccinated. We should calm their surroundings, encourage quiet tasks and less-threatening contact to enhance communication. We need to give them space and not overwhelm them. 2. Diagnosis of ASD? Test for autism genes preferably AT BIRTH like PKU. Tests for aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutathione, taurine, cysteine, homocysteine. 3. Risk factors for ASD? Autism Genes Sensitivity to excitatory amino acids Low taurine, Low glutathione Sulfite Sensitivity Vaccination with glutamic acid as a preservative Damage to the microglia Overactive immune system Junk food diet Aspartame in medications or vitamins or foods Multiple food allergy 4. Biology of ASD? Excess CNS sensitivity, Inability to handle sulfur-containing amino acids, Overactive immune response - linked to Nerve Growth Factor 5. Other areas of ASD research? Common genes in Alzheimer's, Parkinsons, ALS, MS, and excitatory amino acid sensitivity. Study persons without ASD who suffer from overactive CNS or neurodegenerative disease and sensitivity to excitatory amino acids. See if they share same genes. Could Alzheimer's sufferers simply be ADS children whose brains were hard-wired before damage by the environment? Thank you for this opportunity to share my ideas on this very important topic, Please see this webpage that clearly shows why a wheat and dairy based processed food diet may be very harmful to a child sensitive to excitatory amino acids: http://www.msgtruth.org/avoid.htm Since the above letter was written to the NIH in January, new research has uncovered 6 genes related to autism. One specifically is involved in making glutathione (which is the body's natural chelating agent) from cysteine and glutamate. Cysteine is one of the sulfur-containing amino acids. We were on the right track all along ......More about the AUTISM GENES. On May 12, 2008 John Erb and I traveled to Washington DC to address the Federal Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee. John and I were able to address the Committee for five minutes each - I showed and explained our flow chart while John Erb held it for me. On the bright side, we were able to meet Margaret Dunkle who is on the forefront of efforts to actually help families dealing with autism. Although Margaret Dunkle was unable due to time constraints, to address the Committee, I was able to obtain the statement she was going to give. It is excellent. Here it is in its entirety: Statement of Margaret Dunkle Senior Fellow, Center for Health Services Research and Policy, George Washington University Director, Early Identification and Intervention Collaborative for Los Angeles CountyRecipient, American Academy of Pediatrics' Dale Richmond Award for Outstanding Achievement in the field of Child Development May 12, 2008 Federal Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee My name is Margaret Dunkle. Some of you know me through my current position as Senior Fellow with the Center for Health Services Research and Policy at George Washington University, and some from my prior work running policy seminars on Capitol Hill. Some of you know me as recipient of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Dale Richmond Award for outstanding achievement in the field of child development, or for the collaborative efforts I direct in Los Angeles County to ensure all children receive good developmental screenings and effective follow-up. More recently, some of you have come to know me because my nephew's daughter, Hannah Poling, is the little 9 -year-old girl from Athens, Georgia who was the subject of a case the government conceded in vaccine court. The nine vaccines Hannah received on one day in July of 2000 significantly aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder, which predisposed her to deficits in cellular energy metabolism and manifested as a regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder. Indeed, Hannah has autism, with a clear DSM-IV diagnosis based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. I believe in a strong and safe immunization program. Yet, every day more parents and some pediatricians reject the current vaccine schedule. I am concerned that many people are missing Hannah's clearly scribbled handwriting on the wall. She has provided a critical clue (mitochondrial dysfunction) and a historic opportunity for our public health leaders and policymakers to act responsibly and decisively - undertaking serious science to address the very real concerns so many parents and families are raising. Hannah's condition is not rare. The best evidence available strongly suggests that at least 7%, and perhaps as many as 20% or 30%, of children with autism have mitochondrial dysfunction similar to Hannah's. With one in every 150 children on the autism spectrum, these issues are both urgent and important. Now that we know this, it is time to follow the prestigious Institute of Medicine's 2004 report that said: Determining a specific cause [for autism] in the individual is impossible unless the etiology is known and there is a biological marker. Determining causality with population-based methods requires either a well-defined at-risk population or a large effect in the general population. Mitochondrial dysfunction defining an autistic subpopulation and the role of neuro-inflammation in autism are not esoteric theories. They are real leads that need to be quickly followed. I urge you to support the following recommendations that reflect your Committee's mission to coordinate, monitor, and recommend changes concerning federal autism efforts. #1 First and most importantly... With Marshall Plan speed and focus, I recommend a new, intense basic science research program to get to the bottom of what is going on with the many Hannahs out there - specifically focusing on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and neuro-inflammation in autism. How many dysfunction dysfunctions come from? How do they work? Can the negative effects be undone or limited? This research must be bold, going wherever the science takes it, with nothing off the table. I estimate $200 million will be needed to jump-start this research. This money must be a new or redirected appropriation, not borrowed or taken from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). #2 Quickly find ways to screen for and identify the subset of children like Hannah for whom vaccines can cause or exacerbate mitochondrial damage and lead to symptoms of autism. For example, start screening the siblings of children with autism to identify biomedical markers that could lead to screening tests and treatment. #3 Piggyback new research onto existing studies to answer important questions about autism, vaccines, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuro-inflammation. For example: Test alternative vaccine schedules and frequencies through the National Children's Study and use this data set of 100,000 children to get longitudinal data on these issues; and Build new analyses into existing studies and cohorts of patients with known mitochondrial dysfunction - such as research already underway at Hopkins, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Columbia. #4 Institute an immediate nationwide initiative to spot children, like Hannah, who have adverse vaccine reactions and speed them into intense early intervention (specifically, the federal IDEA Early Intervention program for children ages 0-36 months and the Preschool Education program for children ages 3-5). An important corollary is to strengthen the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) so that it actually does the job it was set up to do - collecting information about adverse events, including side effects, that occur after the administration of vaccines. #5 Reform and improve the current vaccine schedule and practices to ensure they are as safe as they possibly can be. For example, examine the number and frequency of vaccines, use of combo vaccines, preservatives used, and ages administered to identify changes that would minimize damage to children, especially susceptible children such as Hannah Poling. It is significant that the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' recently downgraded its preference for a MMRV vaccine (four-vaccines in one shot: measles, mumps, rubella and varicella) to no preference because of increased seizures among children receiving the MMRV. #6 Update the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. For example: Allow parents longer than three years to file, especially given the newly identified mitochondrial dysfunction implications of the Hannah Poling decision and because we want parents and families to devote 100% of their energy to early intervention as soon as they learn their child has a problem; and Update the list of table injuries to reflect the emerging discoveries about autism, mitochondrial dysfunction and immunological disorders. #7 Improve the way the federal government approves and monitors vaccines and vaccine safety - perhaps establishing an independent agency (separate from the Centers for Disease Control, which also runs the National Immunization Program) to research, approve, and monitor vaccine safety and effectiveness. **** I am proud that my family is providing hope and voice to many families across our country who have their own Hannahs. I am also proud of their leadership to nudge those of us who care about good public health and good public policy to do the right thing and to do it right. A little 9-year-old girl has raised incredibly tough and important questions. Your challenge, as leaders concerned about autism, is to tackle these issues in a way that is effective and unflinching - and that responds to her clear scribbling on the wall with equally clear advances in science and improvements in immunization practices. In addition to Margaret Dunkle, Jenny McCarthy's Generation Rescue is doing a tremendous job trying to educate parents that autism CAN BE treated and children can improve dramatically if treated as early as possible. We also are grateful to the family of Hannah Poling for coming forward and bringing Hannah's story to the public. July 10, 2008, studies indicated that at least 6 genes may be related to autism. The genes are: 1) C3orf58 - located at 3q24 (chromosome 3 - position q24) This gene codes for a protein found in the human testes. It was deleted in cases of autism. The protein this codes for is not well known currently, but it is interesting that the protein is found in the male reproductive system considering that the risk of autism is greater in males than females. It is connected to tyrosine phosphorylation and epidermal growth factor. Is this a genetic clue as to why autism is more prevalent in males? 2) NHE9 - located at 3q24 (chromosome 3 - position q24) This gene codes for solute carrier family 9 members. These proteins are linked to the CPA1 transporter family that is involved with sodium channels in the nervous system. It is found in large amounts in the heart muscle and the skeletal muscles as well as lesser amounts in the placenta, kidney and liver, brain, medulla, and spinal cord. It is also found in the ovary and the spleen. It is obviously involved in the proper development and operation of the nervous system. In persons with a mutation in this gene, ADHD symptoms may appear. 3) PCDH10 - located at 4q283 (chromosome 4 - position q283) This gene codes for protocadherin 10 precursor. This gene is involved with cell-adhesion protein, calcium ion binding and cell communication. It is found in the brain, testes, and ovary. Again, the nervous system and the endocrine system are involved. Note that glutamate neurotoxicity involves calcium channels. 4) CNTN3 - located at 3p26 (chromosome 3 - position p26) This gene codes for plasmacytoma associated neuronal glycoprotein. What is fascinating about this protein is that it is found in the brain - the frontal lobe, the occipital lobe, the cerebellum, and the amygdala. NOTE: the amygdala is what is targeted by MSG - it is involved in smell and taste as well as fear and may be responsible for the gaze-avoidance seen in autism. It is also associated with immunoglobulin. And so here is a link to the immune system, which in individuals with autism often is over-stimulated - resulting in multiple allergies. 5) RNF8 - located at 6p21.2 (chromosome 6 - position 21.2) This gene codes for RING finger protein 8. What is extremely interesting about this protein is that it is used in E3 ubiquitin - protein ligase formation. That may not mean much to you at the moment, but ligases are important in forming amino acids. Specifically, the ones that jumped out at us here were: a) glutamate-cysteine ligase, b) glutathione-synthase. In other words, this gene is critical for the formation of glutathione. Glutathione is the body's natural means of chelating mercury and getting rid of it. No matter WHERE it comes from. Could THIS gene be the reason some children with autism often suffer from heavy metal toxicity? Is THIS the common genetic source of trouble with cysteine and sulfur metabolism seen in both children with autism and those of us sensitive to MSG? 6) SCN7A - located at 2q21-q23 (chromosome 2 - position q21 - q23) This gene codes for proteins found in the heart and the uterus. Mutations in this gene result in: muscle weakness, trouble swallowing, blocked and inflamed blood vessels, swelling, and erythromelalgia, (which can be caused by MERCURY POISONING, and even bromocriptine - a drug used to treat both Parkinson's and prolactin - secreting pituitary tumors. Apparently the drug Effexor - and SSRI has been reported to relieve symptoms.) It is interesting that mutations in this gene ALSO give the same symptoms as mercury poisoning. Neurexin 1 - In addition, in February of 2007, it was reported that the area of the human genome found to be associated with autism, contains the genes involved in building glutamate synapses - the very locations where glutamate is used as a neurotransmitter by the nerve cells. The Amygdala and Fear Response in Autistic Children Research about autism links overstimulation of the amygdala in the brain to perceiving faces as threatening. This explains why autistic children avoid the gaze of others. It should be noted that the NMDA receptors that respond to both glutamate and aspartate (the amino acid found in aspartame) are found in the amygdala. The amygdala is part of the limbic system and is involved in the perception of taste and smell as well as fear. See glutamate receptors in the amygdala. Could ingestion of MSG and aspartame, by targeting the amygdala, result in the perceptions and behaviors typically associated with autism? Mercury Children with autism have lower levels of glutathione, and may have difficulty chelating mercury (a suspected cause of autism) and removing it from the body. Excess glutamic acid has been proven to reduce glutathione levels that are protective against mercury poisoning. It is our belief that the large amount of free glutamic acid still present in all vaccines today as well as increasing amounts of free glutamic acid in processed food, is responsible for the autism epidemic. We also believe that the mercury toxicity present in children with autism is a SIDE EFFECT of the disease, not the primary cause. Therefore, removal of thimerosol, will not reduce the incidence of autism, because mercury is still present in our food and water, and our dental fillings, and glutamic acid is STILL in the vaccines and present in ever larger quantities in processed wheat and dairy foods. The problem in autism is that no matter where the mercury comes from, it is not being removed as it normally should be. The excess of mercury caused by excess glutamate, then results in heavy metal toxicity. Considering that the newly discovered autism gene RNF8 is essential in FORMING glutathione, any additive in a vaccine that hinders glutathione formation is a not a good idea. Therefore free glutamic acid should absolutely be removed from vaccines given to children with autism genes. Vaccines MMR vaccines first came under scrutiny due to autism rates in Scotland climbing 18% in just one year. Also, other vaccines have been suspected as well. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/2224126.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/2232111.stm http://www.vaccinationnews.com/dailynews/March2002/ExpertSaysMMRWillBeProved.htm This ingredient list of the MMR vaccine includes hydrolyzed gelatin, which contains 10% free glutamic acid. Vaccine makers claim one study done in one Japanese city shows no link between autism and vaccines simply because after MMR vaccines were stopped in 1993, autism rates still rose. However, the study included only one city in a country that consumes more MSG, and fish (a dietary source of mercury) than most in the world. Also, only one vaccine was stopped - the MMR. Compared to the amount of mercury consumed in fish, the amount of MSG in the diet, and the amount of glutamic acid in other vaccines, the MMR contribution of mercury and glutamate was small. Autism rates in Japan still increased. Glutamate in any vaccine WILL put children at greater risk of mercury poisoning by hindering the ability of a child to rid themselves of mercury from ANY source. Unfortunately, free glutamic acid is found in nearly every vaccine in use today. For more information about autism climbing and the MMR vaccine: NOTE: We would be remiss if we did not mention TEACCH, an organization which helps address the behaviors of autism in an effort to enable autistic children and adults to lead productive lives in society. For while the causes of autism are still being investigated, these children are growing up and need to enter our society in meaningful ways. We should be ready to welcome them. Gluten-Free, Casein-Free (GFCF) Diet Current treatments for autism include gluten-free and casein-free diets. A current theory is that incomplete breakdown of gluten and casein result in the formation of casomorphins and gliadorphins, morphine-like compounds which act on the brain. Another theory (ours) is based on the fact that 15.5% of all the amino acids in wheat are glutamic acid in its free or active form and 22.9% of the amino acids present are aspartic acid in its free and active form (which can be converted to glutamate in only one step). In fact, wheat gluten is a considerable source of natural MSG in the diet. Items containing casein, like cheese, also are high in free glutamic acid. For example - 18.5 % of the amino acids found in cheddar cheese are free (active) glutamic acid. Parents helping their child adhere to a strict gluten-free, casein (dairy) -free diet may wish to consider also eliminating soy products from their child's diet as well, if glutamate is suspect. For more information about autism and diet see the following links: Generation Rescue - Jenny McCarthy's autism organization. Autism Network for Dietary Intervention (ANDI) Autism Society of America The Autism Research Unit (Sunderland, UK) - The Use of Gluten and Casein Free Diets with People with Autism GFCF Diet - Gluten Free Casein Free Diet Support Group McDonalds French Fries Be aware that foods stating natural flavor on the label can be made from wheat and dairy products. As of February 22, 2006, McDonalds is in legal trouble after admitting their French fries which had been labeled gluten-free actually contain beef, wheat and dairy products due to the use of a seasoning placed into the oil where the fries are precooked before being shipped to restaurants. McDonalds spokespeople don't think the fries contain enough allergens or protein to cause a problem - or to label - but consumers are angry at not being told that dairy and wheat products were involved at all. Let the consumer be informed then they can decide to take the risk. Parents with autistic and celiac children are furious at being deliberately misled. Currently, there are three lawsuits pending. The fact that McDonalds spokespeople are stating that there is no more protein left in the seasoning - tells this food scientist that the entire reason for using this seasoning is because it probably contains free glutamic acid broken down from the high glutamate containing protein foods mentioned (beef, wheat, and milk) - another way of flavoring their fries as if they were using MSG, without having to label it as such. Very clever, but completely unethical.

Many professionals felt Asperger's Disorder was simply a milder form of autism and used the term high-functioning autism to describe these individuals. Professor Uta Frith, with the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience of University College London and author of Autism and Asperger Syndrome, describes individuals with Asperger's Disorder as having a dash of Autism. Asperger's Disorder was added to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) in 1994 as a separate disorder from autism. However, there are still many professionals who consider Asperger's Disorder a less severe form of autism. What distinguishes Asperger's Disorder from autism is the severity of the symptoms and the absence of language delays. Children with Asperger's Disorder may be only mildly affected and frequently have good language and cognitive skills. To the untrained observer, a child with Asperger's Disorder may just seem like a normal child behaving differently. Children with autism are frequently seen as aloof and uninterested in others. This is not the case with Asperger's Disorder. Individuals with Asperger's Disorder usually want to fit in and have interaction with others; they simply don't know how to do it. They may be socially awkward, not understanding of conventional social rules, or may show a lack of empathy. They may have limited eye contact, seem to be unengaged in a conversation, and not understand the use of gestures. Interests in a particular subject may border on the obsessive. Children with Asperger's Disorder frequently like to collect categories of things, such as rocks or bottle caps. They may be proficient in knowing categories of information, such as baseball statistics or Latin names of flowers. While they may have good rote memory skills, they have difficulty with abstract concepts. One of the major differences between Asperger's Disorder and autism is that, by definition, there is no speech delay in Asperger's. In fact, children with Asperger's Disorder frequently have good language skills; they simply use language in different ways. Speech patterns may be unusual, lack inflection or have a rhythmic nature or it may be formal, but too loud or high pitched. Children with Asperger's Disorder may not understand the subtleties of language, such as irony and humor, or they may not understand the give and take nature of a conversation. Another distinction between Asperger's Disorder and autism concerns cognitive ability. While some individuals with Autism experience mental retardation, by definition a person with Asperger's Disorder cannot possess a clinically significant cognitive delay and most possess an average to above average intelligence. While motor difficulties are not a specific criteria for Asperger's, children with Asperger's Disorder frequently have motor skill delays and may appear clumsy or awkward.

Last year I wrote a couple of posts (here and\ufffdhere) criticizing Polly Tommey for pulling expensive publicity stunts that resulted in her meeting with Prime\ufffdMinister\ufffdGordon\ufffdBrown\ufffdand his wife at Downing Street. She presented herself as just\ufffda mother speaking for thousands of other mothers. Her remarkable success was contrasted with the apparent failure of autism organizations to work together for the benefit of autistic people. At the time I pointed out that many other organizations had come together to support the Autism Bill, soon to become an Act of Parliament and to to advise the government via the External Reference Group. Chaired by the NAS chief executive, Mark Lever, with an autistic vice chair, it included organizations of autistic adults as well as parents. The only significant absence from the campaign were representatives of the biomedical cure organizations, including Polly Tommey s Autism Trust, which seemed intent on disregarding the rest of us in pursuit of its own agenda. The result of all our campaigning and lobbying of government officials and politicians saw the government adopt the Autism Bill, guaranteeing its passage into law, and shaped the adult strategy for autism that was published this week. Then\ufffdPolly Tommey appeared on GMTV to discuss the strategy. We learned that it was her poster campaign that galvanized the government. They had consulted with her on the strategy and the next step was to be a new poster campaign which presumably would drive the next phase of the project. Then I turned to\ufffdAge of Autism (AoA)which provided more details. In 2009 Polly Tommey was approached by Gordon Brown to represent The Autism Trust within the External Reference Group (ERG).\ufffd This followed a meeting with the Prime Minister as a result of The Autism Trust\ufffds Dear Gordon Brown charity billboard campaign.\ufffd Polly was part of the ERG that helped formulate The strategy for adults with autism in England (2010). Actually, after months of patient negotiation in which various organizations learned to work together and gained the respect of government officials and ministers, I can think of nothing more disruptive to the process than for someone to be parachuted in on the strength of an advertizing campaign and lay claim to all the credit. AoA also suggests that she organized the public consultation on the strategy. Last year, following the campaign, Polly announced on national television that everybody could take part in formulating this plan; no one was left out of the strategy. It was announced via a direct email address to the Department of Health so that everyone who wanted could get involved. AoA does not mention the 14 other organizations led by the NAS that campaigned for the Autism Act and organized over a thousand responses from their members to the consultation process. It does not mention any of the other members of the ERG. It does not explain why the ERG report does not list Polly Tommey as a member or that it published its report before she is supposed to have been invited to join it. Nor, if she already has the ear of the prime minister, are we told why another poster campaign is needed. Perhaps it will be aimed at persuading the rest of the autism community that we are all wrong and we should be following her lead instead. One thing is certain. Although Tommey continues to support Andrew Wakefield and his failed hypothesis you will not hear about that in her campaign to take credit for the success of a movement in which she was at best peripheral and at times a hindrance. All these organizations supported the passage of the Autism Bill through Parliament. No mention of\ufffdPolly\ufffdTommey s Autism Trust.

This system allows them to build sentences using a book of laminated pictures attached to a board by Velcro. As the child learns new words through pictures, they are added to the book, reflecting the child s growing vocabulary. However, while the existing system is very effective in the home or classroom, it is not very portable for everyday situations outside of these settings.The inspiration for Lisa s application came to her when she spotted an advertisement for the iPhone on the side of a bus in Dublin. She noticed that the main screen of the device in the ad, which featured a range of colourful application photos, looked like an electronic version of a Picture Exchange book. At that point, she realised the phone s potential as a portable alternative to the existing system and set to work in developing the new application in conjunction with software developer, Steve Troughton-Smith.The main benefits of the new application are that it is simple and works in real time. It can be customised to the individual child using their picture and photo vocabulary and it is compact but can hold hundreds of images. Furthermore, adding new images and sharing them with the child s parent/carer/tutor is simple and instant - this encourages consistency in language development for the child. For example, Lisa s daughter Grace now has over 300 symbols and photos stored on her iPhone to reflect her current vocabulary, to which she can instantly add new photos at any time as her vocabulary grows. Lisa can also share new words and interests instantly with Grace s carers and tutors in school using the phone to ensure they are aware and can use the new words in their interaction with Grace.The development of the new application has been supported by O2, which supplied iPhones for the creation and testing of it and which also funded the development of the final artwork used. I m absolutely delighted that thanks to Steve and O2, we have been able to bring this project to fruition. As the mother of two children with autism, I know it works, I ve seen the positive impact it has had on my own children and therefore I can confidently recommend it to other parents and tutors of children with autism, Ms Domican said.The new application is now available in the official iPhone Application Store. It costs 29.99 for up to five users, to facilitate family members accessing it.

It is a neurological disorder that affects the way a person interprets the things around them. It effects them on a behavioural, social and communicative level. Sometimes the first symptoms are visible right after birth, but it most cases it takes till the ages 1-2 for it to become more evident. Though there are different levels of autism, there are some common traits or a checklist of symptoms to be aware of in your developing child. Here is a brief autism symptoms checklist of the most common traits. Impairment of social interaction. Simply put the child has problems interacting with those around them. They often have marked delays in the use of non-verbal behaviour or body language such as eye to eye contact, facial expressions ( they often look at the world around them with a blank expression), body posture and gestures regularly used in social interactions. They may also have delays or inability to develop peer relationships appropriate for their age or mental development level. As a young child they also do not seek to share enjoyment with others. While other children will take you by the hand to show and share their accomplishments the autistic child lacks this. Impairments or delays in their communications skills.The autistic child will often lack or have a delay in their language skills. This is not accompanied by them making up for their lack of speech with hand gestures or other ways of communicating. They also tend to have an impairment in being able to hold a conversation or start a conversation with another person. Characteristics of autism can also include a repetitive use of language ( only saying certain phrases). Repetitive and stereotyped behaviours. Characteristic of autism is a preoccupation of specific interests. For example that of an obsessive compulsive disorder. The autistic child is also inflexible in schedule. Little changes in routine cause an autistic child extreme distress. Their routine is very specific in its rituals and timing. Delays in at least one of the following areas. If any or all of the following are present you may have an autistic child ( onset prior to age 3). Delays in social interactions, language used in social interactions and or lack of imaginative play. This is just a brief autism symptoms checklist, if you child displays a large number of these it is imperative that you follow up with a doctor. Early intervention is the best possible way to prevent or minimize the impairment your child may have from autism. You as the parent are your child best advocate. \ufffd Parenting a child with autism can be a difficult task indeed. By being prepared with this autism symptoms checklist can help you to be better prepared for your child s future and to advocate on their behalf.

Although people with this baffling brain disorder can display a wide range of symptoms and disability, many are incapable of understanding other people's thoughts, feelings, and needs. Often, language and intelligence fail to develop fully, making communication and social relationships difficult. Many people with autism engage in repetitive activities, like rocking or banging their heads, or rigidly following familiar patterns in their everyday routines. Some are painfully sensitive to sound, touch, sight, or smell. Children with autism do not follow the typical patterns of child development. In some children, hints of future problems may be apparent from birth. In most cases, the problems become more noticeable as the child slips farther behind other children the same age. Other children start off well enough. But between 18 and 36 months old, they suddenly reject people, act strangely, and lose language and social skills they had already acquired. But there is help and hope. Gone are the days when people with autism were isolated, typically sent away to institutions. Today, many youngsters can be helped to attend school with other children. Methods are available to help improve their social, language, and academic skills. Even though more than 60 percent of adults with autism continue to need care throughout their lives, some programs are beginning to demonstrate that with appropriate support, many people with autism can be trained to do meaningful work and participate in the life of the community. Autism is found in every country and region of the world, and in families of all racial, ethnic, religious, and economic backgrounds. Emerging in childhood, it affects about 1 or 2 people in every thousand and is three to four times more common in boys than girls. Girls with the disorder, however, tend to have more severe symptoms and lower intelligence. In addition to loss of personal potential, the cost of health and educational services to those affected exceeds $3 billion each year. So, at some level, autism affects us all. Autism Defined Autism is a brain disorder that typically affects a person's ability to communicate, form relationships with others, and respond appropriately to the environment. form relationships with others, and respond appropriately to the environment. Some people with autism are relatively high-functioning, with speech and intelligence intact. Others are mentally retarded, mute, or have serious language delays. For some, autism makes them seem closed off and shut down; others seem locked into repetitive behaviors and rigid patterns of thinking. Although people with autism do not have exactly the same symptoms and deficits, they tend to share certain social, communication, motor, and sensory problems that affect their behavior in predictable ways. Difference in the Behaviors of Infants With and Without Autism Infants with Autism Normal Infants Communication Avoid eye contact Seem deaf Start developing language, then abruptly stop talking altogether Study mother's face Easily stimulated by sounds Keep adding to vocabulary and expanding grammatical usage Social relationships Act as if unaware of the coming and going of others Physically attack and injure others without provocation Inaccessible, as if in a shell Cry when mother leaves the room and are anxious with strangers Get upset when hungry or frustrated Recognize familiar faces and smile Exploration of environment Remain fixated on a single item or activity Practice strange actions like rocking or hand-flapping Sniff or lick toys Show no sensitivity to burns or bruises, and engage in self-mutilation, such as eye gouging Seek pleasure and avoid pain \ufffdMove from one engrossing object or activity to another Use body purposefully to reach or acquire objects Explore and play with toys Social symptoms From the start, most infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, endearingly grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most children with autism seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many do not interact and they avoid eye contact. They seem to prefer being alone. They may resist attention and affection or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Later, they seldom seek comfort or respond to anger or affection. Unlike other children, they rarely become upset when the parent leaves or show pleasure when the parent returns. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of response. Children with autism also take longer to learn to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues-whether a smile, a wink, or a grimace-may have little meaning. To a child who misses these cues, Come here, always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or squinting and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with autism have problems seeing things from another person's perspective. Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different information, feelings, and goals than they have. A person with autism may lack such understanding. This inability leaves them unable to predict or understand other people's actions. Some people with autism also tend to be physically aggressive at times, making social relationships still more difficult. Some lose control, particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when angry and frustrated. They are capable at times of breaking things, attacking others, or harming themselves. Alan, for example, may fall into a rage, biting and kicking when he is frustrated or angry. Paul, when tense or overwhelmed, may break a window or throw things. Others are self-destructive, banging their heads, pulling their hair, or biting their arms. Language difficulties By age 3, most children have passed several predictable milestones on the path to learning language. One of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it very clear that his answer is no. By age 2, most children begin to put together sentences like See doggie, or More cookie, and can follow simple directions. Research shows that about half of the children diagnosed with autism remain mute throughout their lives. Some infants who later show signs of autism do coo and babble during the first 6 months of life. But they soon stop. Although they may learn to communicate using sign language or special electronic equipment, they may never speak. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways. Some seem unable to combine words into meaningful sentences. Some speak only single words. Others repeat the same phrase no matter what the situation. Some children with autism are only able to parrot what they hear, a condition called echolalia. Without persistent training, echoing other people's phrases may be the only language that people with autism ever acquire. What they repeat might be a question they were just asked, or an advertisement on television. Or out of the blue, a child may shout, Stay on your own side of the road! -something he heard his father say weeks before. Although children without autism go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are 3. People with autism also tend to confuse pronouns. They fail to grasp that words like my, I, and you, change meaning depending on who is speaking. When Alan's teacher asks, What is my name? he answers, My name is Alan. Some children say the same phrase in a variety of different situations. One child, for example, says Get in the car, at random times throughout the day. While on the surface, her statement seems bizarre, there may be a meaningful pattern in what the child says. The child may be saying, Get in the car, whenever she wants to go outdoors. In her own mind, she's associated Get in the car, with leaving the house. Another child, who says Milk and cookies whenever he is pleased, may be associating his good feelings around this treat with other things that give him pleasure. It can be equally difficult to understand the body language of a person with autism. Most of us smile when we talk about things we enjoy, or shrug when we can't answer a question. But for children with autism, facial expressions, movements, and gestures rarely match what they are saying. Their tone of voice also fails to reflect their feelings. A high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common. Without meaningful gestures or the language to ask for things, people with autism are at a loss to let others know what they need. As a result, children with autism may simply scream or grab what they want. Temple Grandin, an exceptional woman with autism who has written two books about her disorder, admits, Not being able to speak was utter frustration. Screaming was the only way I could communicate. Often she would logically think to herself, I am going to scream now because I want to tell somebody I don't want to do something. Until they are taught better means of expressing their needs, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to others. Repetitive behaviors and obsessions Although children with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, odd repetitive motions may set them off from other children. A child might spend hours repeatedly flicking or flapping her fingers or rocking back and forth. Many flail their arms or walk on their toes. Some suddenly freeze in position. Experts call such behaviors stereotypies or self-stimulation. Some people with autism also tend to repeat certain actions over and over. A child might spend hours lining up pretzel sticks. Or run from room to room turning lights on and off. Some children with autism develop troublesome fixations with specific objects, which can lead to unhealthy or dangerous behaviors. For example, one child insists on carrying feces from the bathroom into her classroom. Other behaviors are simply startling, humorous, or embarrassing to those around them. One girl, obsessed with digital watches, grabs the arms of strangers to look at their wrists. For unexplained reasons, people with autism demand consistency in their environment. Many insist on eating the same foods, at the same time, sitting at precisely the same place at the table every day. They may get furious if a picture is tilted on the wall, or wildly upset if their toothbrush has been moved even slightly. A minor change in their routine, like taking a different route to school, may be tremendously upsetting. Scientists are exploring several possible explanations for such repetitive, obsessive behavior. Perhaps the order and sameness lends some stability in a world of sensory confusion. Perhaps focused behaviors help them to block out painful stimuli. Yet another theory is that these behaviors are linked to the senses that work well or poorly. A child who sniffs everything in sight may be using a stable sense of smell to explore his environment. Or perhaps the reverse is true: he may be trying to stimulate a sense that is dim. Imaginative play, too, is limited by these repetitive behaviors and obsessions. Most children, as early as age 2, use their imagination to pretend. They create new uses for an object, perhaps using a bowl for a hat. Or they pretend to be someone else, like a mother cooking dinner for her family of dolls. In contrast, children with autism rarely pretend. Rather than rocking a doll or rolling a toy car, they may simply hold it, smell it, or spin it for hours on end. Sensory symptoms When children's perceptions are accurate, they can learn from what they see, feel, or hear. On the other hand, if sensory information is faulty or if the input from the various senses fails to merge into a coherent picture, the child's experiences of the world can be confusing. People with autism seem to have one or both of these problems. There may be problems in the sensory signals that reach the brain or in the integration of the sensory signals-and quite possibly, both. Apparently, as a result of a brain malfunction, many children with autism are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, and smells. Some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin so disturbing that they can't focus on anything else. For others, a gentle hug may be overwhelming. Some children cover their ears and scream at the sound of a vacuum cleaner, a distant airplane, a telephone ring, or even the wind. Temple Grandin says, It was like having a hearing aid that picks up everything, with the volume control stuck on super loud. Because any noise was so painful, she often chose to withdraw and tuned out sounds to the point of seeming deaf. In autism, the brain also seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Some children with autism seem oblivious to extreme cold or pain, but react hysterically to things that wouldn't bother other children. A child with autism may break her arm in a fall and never cry. Another child might bash his head on the wall without a wince. On the other hand, a light touch may make the child scream with alarm. In some people, the senses are even scrambled. One child gags when she feels a certain texture. A man with autism hears a sound when someone touches a point on his chin. Another experiences certain sounds as colors. Unusual abilities Some people with autism display remarkable abilities. A few demonstrate skills far out of the ordinary. At a young age, when other children are drawing straight lines and scribbling, some children with autism are able to draw detailed, realistic pictures in three-dimensional perspective. Some toddlers who are autistic are so visually skilled that they can put complex jigsaw puzzles together. Many begin to read exceptionally early-sometimes even before they begin to speak. Some who have a keenly developed sense of hearing can play musical instruments they have never been taught, play a song accurately after hearing it once, or name any note they hear. Like the person played by Dustin Hoffman in the movie Rain Man, some people with autism can memorize entire television shows, pages of the phone book, or the scores of every major league baseball game for the past 20 years. However, such skills, known as islets of intelligence or savant skills are rare. How Autism is Diagnosed Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child. In many cases, their baby seemed different from birth-being unresponsive to people and toys, or focusing intently on one item for long periods of time. The first signs of autism may also appear in children who had been developing normally. When an affectionate, babbling toddler suddenly becomes silent, withdrawn, violent, or self-abusive, something is wrong. Even so, years may go by before the family seeks a diagnosis. Well-meaning friends and relatives sometimes help parents ignore the problems with reassurances that Every child is different, or Janie can talk-she just doesn't want to! Unfortunately, this only delays getting appropriate assessment and treatment for the child.

Diagnostic procedures To date, there are no medical tests like x-rays or blood tests that detect autism. And no two children with the disorder behave the same way. In addition, several conditions can cause symptoms that resemble those of autism. So parents and the child's pediatrician need to rule out other disorders, including hearing loss, speech problems, mental retardation, and neurological problems. But once these possibilities have been eliminated, a visit to a professional who specializes in autism is necessary. Such specialists include people with the professional titles of child psychiatrist, child psychologist, developmental pediatrician, or pediatric neurologist. Autism specialists use a variety of methods to identify the disorder. Using a standardized rating scale, the specialist closely observes and evaluates the child's language and social behavior. A structured interview is also used to elicit information from parents about the child's behavior and early development. Reviewing family videotapes, photos, and baby albums may help parents recall when each behavior first occurred and when the child reached certain developmental milestones. The specialists may also test for certain genetic and neurological problems. Specialists may also consider other conditions that produce many of the same behaviors and symptoms as autism, such as Rett's Disorder or Asperger's Disorder. Rett's Disorder is a progressive brain disease that only affects girls but, like autism, produces repetitive hand movements and leads to loss of language and social skills. Children with Asperger's Disorder are very like high-functioning children with autism. Although they have repetitive behaviors, severe social problems, and clumsy movements, their language and intelligence are usually intact. Unlike autism, the symptoms of Asperger's Disorder typically appear later in childhood. Diagnostic criteria After assessing observations and test results, the specialist makes a diagnosis of autism only if there is clear evidence of: poor or limited social relationships underdeveloped communication skills repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities. People with autism generally have some impairment within each category, although the severity of each symptom may vary. The diagnostic criteria also require that these symptoms appear by age 3. However, some specialists are reluctant to give a diagnosis of autism. They fear that it will cause parents to lose hope. As a result, they may apply a more general term that simply describes the child's behaviors or sensory deficits. Severe communication disorder with autism-like behaviors, multi-sensory system disorder, and sensory integration dysfunction are some of the terms that are used. Children with milder or fewer symptoms are often diagnosed as having Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD). Although terms like Asperger's Disorder and PDD do not significantly change treatment options, they may keep the child from receiving the full range of specialized educational services available to children diagnosed with autism. They may also give parents false hope that their child's problems are only temporary. Etiology It is generally accepted that autism is caused by abnormalities in brain structures or functions. Using a variety of new research tools to study human and animal brain growth, scientists are discovering more about normal development and how abnormalities occur. The brain of a fetus develops throughout pregnancy. Starting out with a few cells, the cells grow and divide until the brain contains billions of specialized cells, called neurons. Research sponsored by NIMH and other components at the National Institutes of Health is playing a key role in showing how cells find their way to a specific area of the brain and take on special functions. Once in place, each neuron sends out long fibers that connect with other neurons. In this way, lines of communication are established between various areas of the brain and between the brain and the rest of the body. As each neuron receives a signal it releases chemicals called neurotransmitters, which pass the signal to the next neuron. By birth, the brain has evolved into a complex organ with several distinct regions and subregions, each with a precise set of functions and responsibilities. Different parts of the brain have different functions The hippocampus makes it possible to recall recent experience and new information The amygdala directs our emotional responses The frontal lobes of the cerebrum allow us to solve problems, plan ahead, understand the behavior of others, and restrain our impulses The parietal areas control hearing, speech, and language The cerebellum regulates balance, body movements, coordination, and the muscles used in speaking But brain development does not stop at birth. The brain continues to change during the first few years of life, as new neurotransmitters become activated and additional lines of communication are established. Neural networks are forming and creating a foundation for processing language, emotions, and thought. However, scientists now know that a number of problems may interfere with normal brain development. Cells may migrate to the wrong place in the brain. Or, due to problems with the neural pathways or the neurotransmitters, some parts of the communication network may fail to perform. A problem with the communication network may interfere with the overall task of coordinating sensory information, thoughts, feelings, and actions. Researchers supported by NIMH and other NIH Institutes are scrutinizing the structures and functions of the brain for clues as to how a brain with autism differs from the normal brain. In one line of study, researchers are investigating potential defects that occur during initial brain development. Other researchers are looking for defects in the brains of people already known to have autism. Scientists are also looking for abnormalities in the brain structures that make up the limbic system. Inside the limbic system, an area called the amygdala is known to help regulate aspects of social and emotional behavior. One study of high-functioning children with autism found that the amygdala was indeed impaired but that another area of the brain, the hippocampus, was not. In another study, scientists followed the development of monkeys whose amygdala was disrupted at birth. Like children with autism, as the monkeys grew, they became increasingly withdrawn and avoided social contact. Differences in neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system, are also being explored. For example, high levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin have been found in a number of people with autism. Since neurotransmitters are responsible for passing nerve impulses in the brain and nervous system, it is possible that they are involved in the distortion of sensations that accompanies autism. NIMH grantees are also exploring differences in overall brain function, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify which parts of the brain are energized during specific mental tasks. In a study of adolescent boys, NIMH researchers observed that during problem-solving and language tasks, teenagers with autism were not only less successful than peers without autism, but the MRI images of their brains showed less activity. In a study of younger children, researchers observed low levels of activity in the parietal areas and the corpus callosum. Such research may help scientists determine whether autism reflects a problem with specific areas of the brain or with the transmission of signals from one part of the brain to another. Each of these differences has been seen in some but not all the people with autism who were tested. What could this mean? Perhaps the term autism actually covers several different disorders, each caused by a different problem in the brain. Or perhaps the various brain differences are themselves caused by a single underlying disorder that scientists have not yet identified. Discovering the physical basis of autism should someday allow us to better identify, treat, and possibly prevent it. Factors affecting brain development But what causes normal brain development to go awry? Some NIMH researchers are investigating genetic causes-the role that heredity and genes play in passing the disorder from one generation to the next. Others are looking at medical problems related to pregnancy and other factors. Heredity. Several studies of twins suggest that autism- or at least a higher likelihood of some brain dysfunction-can be inherited. For example, identical twins are far more likely than fraternal twins to both have autism. Unlike fraternal twins, which develop from two separate eggs, identical twins develop from a single egg and have the same genetic makeup. It appears that parents who have one child with autism are at slightly increased risk for having more than one child with autism. This also suggests a genetic link. However, autism does not appear to be due to one particular gene. If autism, like eye color, were passed along by a single gene, more family members would inherit the disorder. NIMH grantees, using state-of-the-art gene splicing techniques, are searching for irregular segments of genetic code that the autistic members of a family may have inherited. Some scientists believe that what is inherited is an irregular segment of genetic code or a small cluster of three to six unstable genes. In most people, the faulty code may cause only minor problems. But under certain conditions, the unstable genes may interact and seriously interfere with the brain development of the unborn child. A body of NIMH-sponsored research is testing this theory. One study is exploring whether parents and siblings who do not have autism show minor symptoms, such as mild social, language, or reading problems. If so, such findings would suggest that several members of a family can inherit the irregular or unstable genes, but that other as yet unidentified conditions must be present for the full-blown disorder to develop. Pregnancy and other problems. Throughout pregnancy, the fetal brain is growing larger and more complex, as new cells, specialized regions, and communication networks form. During this time, anything that disrupts normal brain development may have lifelong effects on the child's sensory, language, social, and mental functioning. For this reason, researchers are exploring whether certain conditions, like the mother's health during pregnancy, problems during delivery, or other environmental factors may interfere with normal brain development. Viral infections like rubella (also called German measles), particularly in the first three months of pregnancy, may lead to a variety of problems, possibly including autism and retardation. Lack of oxygen to the baby and other complications of delivery may also increase the risk of autism. However, there is no clear link. Such problems occur in the delivery of many infants who are not autistic, and most children with autism are born without such factors. Accompanying Disorders Several disorders commonly accompany autism. To some extent, these may be caused by a common underlying problem in brain functioning. Mental retardation Of the problems that can occur with autism, mental retardation is the most widespread. Seventy-five to 80 percent of people with autism are mentally retarded to some extent. Fifteen to 20 percent are considered severely retarded, with IQs below 35. (A score of 100 represents average intelligence.) But autism does not necessarily correspond with mental impairment. More than 10 percent of people with autism have an average or above average IQ. A few show exceptional intelligence. Interpreting IQ scores is difficult, however, because most intelligence tests are not designed for people with autism. People with autism do not perceive or relate to their environment in typical ways. When tested, some areas of ability are normal or even above average, and some areas may be especially weak. For example, a child with autism may do extremely well on the parts of the test that measure visual skills but earn low scores on the language subtests. Seizures About one-third of the children with autism develop seizures, starting either in early childhood or adolescence. Researchers are trying to learn if there is any significance to the time of onset, since the seizures often first appear when certain neurotransmitters become active. Since seizures range from brief blackouts to full-blown body convulsions, an electroencephalogram (EEG) can help confirm their presence. Fortunately, in most cases, seizures can be controlled with medication. Fragile X One disorder, Fragile X syndrome, has been found in about 10 percent of people with autism, mostly males. This inherited disorder is named for a defective piece of the X-chromosome that appears pinched and fragile when seen under a microscope. People who inherit this faulty bit of genetic code are more likely to have mental retardation and many of the same symptoms as autism along with unusual physical features that are not typical of autism. Tuberous Sclerosis There is also some relationship between autism and Tuberous Sclerosis, a genetic condition that causes abnormal tissue growth in the brain and problems in other organs. Although Tuberous Sclerosis is a rare disorder, occurring less than once in 10,000 births, about a fourth of those affected are also autistic. Scientists are exploring genetic conditions such as Fragile X and Tuberous Sclerosis to see why they so often coincide with autism. Understanding exactly how these conditions disrupt normal brain development may provide insights to the biological and genetic mechanisms of autism. Reason for Hope When parents learn that their child is autistic, most wish they could magically make the problem go away. They looked forward to having a baby and watching their child learn and grow. Instead, they must face the fact that they have a child who may not live up to their dreams and will daily challenge their patience. Some families deny the problem or fantasize about an instant cure. They may take the child from one specialist to another, hoping for a different diagnosis. It is important for the family to eventually overcome their pain and deal with the problem, while still cherishing hopes for their child's future. Most families realize that their lives can move on. Today, more than ever before, people with autism can be helped. A combination of early intervention, special education, family support, and in some cases, medication, is helping increasing numbers of children with autism to live more normal lives. Special interventions and education programs can expand their capacity to learn, communicate, and relate to others, while reducing the severity and frequency of disruptive behaviors. Medications can be used to help alleviate certain symptoms. Older children and adults may also benefit from the treatments that are available today. So, while no cure is in sight, it is possible to greatly improve the day-to-day life of children and adults with autism. Today, a child who receives effective therapy and education has every hope of using his or her unique capacity to learn. Even some who are seriously mentally retarded can often master many self-help skills like cooking, dressing, doing laundry, and handling money. For such children, greater independence and self-care may be the primary training goals. Other youngsters may go on to learn basic academic skills, like reading, writing, and simple math. Many complete high school. Some, like Temple Grandin, may even earn college degrees. Like anyone else, their personal interests provide strong incentives to learn. Clearly, an important factor in developing a child's long-term potential for independence and success is early intervention. The sooner a child begins to receive help, the more opportunity for learning. Furthermore, because a young child's brain is still forming, scientists believe that early intervention gives children the best chance of developing their full potential. Even so, no matter when the child is diagnosed, it's never too late to begin treatment. Social Skills and Behavior A number of treatment approaches have evolved in the decades since autism was first identified. Some therapeutic programs focus on developing skills and replacing dysfunctional behaviors with more appropriate ones. Others focus on creating a stimulating learning environment tailored to the unique needs of children with autism. Researchers have begun to identify factors that make certain treatment programs more effective in reducing- or reversing-the limitations imposed by autism. Treatment programs that build on the child's interests, offer a predictable schedule, teach tasks as a series of simple steps, actively engage the child's attention in highly structured activities, and provide regular reinforcement of behavior, seem to produce the greatest gains. Parent involvement has also emerged as a major factor in treatment success. Parents work with teachers and therapists to identify the behaviors to be changed and the skills to be taught. Recognizing that parents are the child's earliest teachers, more programs are beginning to train parents to continue the therapy at home. Research is beginning to suggest that mothers and fathers who are trained to work with their child can be as effective as professional teachers and therapists. Developmental approaches Professionals have found that many children with autism learn best in an environment that builds on their skills and interests while accommodating their special needs. Programs employing a developmental approach provide consistency and structure along with appropriate levels of stimulation. For example, a predictable schedule of activities each day helps children with autism plan and organize their experiences. Using a certain area of the classroom for each activity helps students know what they are expected to do. For those with sensory problems, activities that sensitize or desensitize the child to certain kinds of stimulation may be especially helpful. In one developmental preschool classroom, a typical session starts with a physical activity to help develop balance, coordination, and body awareness. Children string beads, piece puzzles together, paint and participate in other structured activities. At snack time, the teacher encourages social interaction and models how to use language to ask for more juice. Later, the teacher stimulates creative play by prompting the children to pretend being a train. As in any classroom, the children learn by doing. Although higher-functioning children may be able to handle academic work, they too need help to organize the task and avoid distractions. A student with autism might be assigned the same addition problems as her classmates. But instead of assigning several pages in the textbook, the teacher might give her one page at a time or make a list of specific tasks to be checked off as each is done. Behaviorist approaches When people are rewarded for a certain behavior, they are more likely to repeat or continue that behavior. Behaviorist training approaches are based on this principle. When children with autism are rewarded each time they attempt or perform a new skill, they are likely to perform it more often. With enough practice, they eventually acquire the skill. For example, a child who is rewarded whenever she looks at the therapist may gradually learn to make eye contact on her own. Dr. O. Ivar Lovaas pioneered the use of behaviorist methods for children with autism more than 25 years ago. His methods involve time-intensive, highly structured, repetitive sequences in which a child is given a command and rewarded each time he responds correctly. For example, in teaching a young boy to sit still, a therapist might place him in front of chair and tell him to sit. If the child doesn't respond, the therapist nudges him into the chair. Once seated, the child is immediately rewarded in some way. A reward might be a bit of chocolate, a sip of juice, a hug, or applause-whatever the child enjoys. The process is repeated many times over a period of up to two hours. Eventually, the child begins to respond without being nudged and sits for longer periods of time. Learning to sit still and follow directions then provides a foundation for learning more complex behaviors. Using this approach for up to 40 hours a week, some children may be brought to the point of near-normal behavior. Others are much less responsive to the treatment. However, some researchers and therapists believe that less intensive treatments, particularly those begun early in a child's life, may be more efficient and just as effective. So, over the years, researchers sponsored by NIMH and other agencies have continued to study and modify the behaviorist approach. Today, some of these behaviorist treatment programs are more individualized and built around the child's own interests and capabilities. Many programs also involve parents or other non-autistic children in teaching the child. Instruction is no longer limited to a controlled environment, but takes place in natural, everyday settings. Thus, a trip to the supermarket may be an opportunity to practice using words for size and shape. Although rewarding desired behavior is still a key element, the rewards are varied and appropriate to the situation. A child who makes eye contact may be rewarded with a smile, rather than candy. NIMH is funding several types of behaviorist treatment approaches to help determine the best time for treatment to start, the optimum treatment intensity and duration, and the most effective methods to reach both high- and low-functioning children. Nonstandard approaches In trying to do everything possible to help their children, many parents are quick to try new treatments. Some treatments are developed by reputable therapists or by parents of a child with autism, yet when tested scientifically, cannot be proven to help. Before spending time and money and possibly slowing their child's progress, the family should talk with experts and evaluate the findings of objective reviewers. Following are some of the approaches that have not been shown to be effective in treating the majority of children with autism: Facilitated Communication, which assumes that by supporting a nonverbal child's arms and fingers so that he can type on a keyboard, the child will be able to type out his inner thoughts. Several scientific studies have shown that the typed messages actually reflect the thoughts of the person providing the support. Holding Therapy, in which the parent hugs the child for long periods of time, even if the child resists. Those who use this technique contend that it forges a bond between the parent and child. Some claim that it helps stimulate parts of the brain as the child senses the boundaries of her own body. There is no scientific evidence, however, to support these claims. Auditory Integration Training, in which the child listens to a variety of sounds with the goal of improving language comprehension. Advocates of this method suggest that it helps people with autism receive more balanced sensory input from their environment. When tested using scientific procedures, the method was shown to be no more effective than listening to music. Dolman/Delcato Method, in which people are made to crawl and move as they did at each stage of early development, in an attempt to learn missing skills. Again, no scientific studies support the effectiveness of the method. It is critical that parents obtain reliable, objective information before enrolling their child in any treatment program. Programs that are not based on sound principles and tested through solid research can do more harm than good. They may frustrate the child and cause the family to lose money, time, and hope. Selecting a treatment program Parents are often disappointed to learn that there is no single best treatment for all children with autism; possibly not even for a specific child. Even after a child has been thoroughly tested and formally diagnosed, there is no clear right course of action. The diagnostic team may suggest treatment methods and service providers, but ultimately it is up to the parents to consider their child's unique needs, research the various options, and decide. Above all, parents should consider their own sense of what will work for their child. Keeping in mind that autism takes many forms, parents need to consider whether a specific program has helped children similar to their own. Exploring Treatment Options Parents may find these questions helpful as they consider various treatment programs: How successful has the program been for other children? How many children have gone on to placement in a regular school and how have they performed? Do staff members have training and experience in working with children and adolescents with autism? How are activities planned and organized? Are there predictable daily schedules and routines? How much individual attention will my child receive? How is progress measured? Will my child's behavior be closely observed and recorded? Will my child be given tasks and rewards that are personally motivating? Is the environment designed to minimize distractions? Will the program prepare me to continue the therapy at home? What is the cost, time commitment, and location of the program? Medications No medication can correct the brain structures or impaired nerve connections that seem to underlie autism. Scientists have found, however, that drugs developed to treat other disorders with similar symptoms are sometimes effective in treating the symptoms and behaviors that make it hard for people with autism to function at home, school, or work. It is important to note that none of the medications described in this section has been approved for autism by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is the Federal agency that authorizes the use of drugs for specific disorders. Medications used to treat anxiety and depression are being explored as a way to relieve certain symptoms of autism. These drugs include fluoxetine (Prozac\ufffd), fluvoxamine (Luvox\ufffd), sertraline (Zoloft\ufffd), and clomipramine (Anafranil\ufffd). Some scientists believe that autism and these disorders may share a problem in the functioning of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which these medications apparently help. One study found that about 60 percent of patients with autism who used fluoxetine became less distraught and aggressive. They became calmer and better able to handle changes in their routine or environment. However, fenfluramine, another medication that affects serotonin levels, has not proven to be helpful. People with an anxiety disorder called obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), like people with autism, are plagued by repetitive actions they can't control. Based on the premise that the two disorders may be related, one NIMH research study found that clomipramine, a medication used to treat OCD, does appear to be effective in reducing obsessive, repetitive behavior in some people with autism. Children with autism who were given the medication also seemed less withdrawn, angry, and anxious. But more research needs to be done to see if the findings of this study can be repeated. Some children with autism experience hyperactivity, the frenzied activity that is seen in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Since stimulant drugs like Ritalin\ufffd are helpful in treating many people with ADHD, doctors have tried them to reduce the hyperactivity sometimes seen in autism. The drugs seem to be most effective when given to higher-functioning children with autism who do not have seizures or other neurological problems. Because many children with autism have sensory disturbances and often seem impervious to pain, scientists are also looking for medications that increase or decrease the transmission of physical sensations. Endorphins are natural painkillers produced by the body. But in certain people with autism, the endorphins seem to go too far in suppressing feeling. Scientists are exploring substances that block the effects of endorphins, to see if they can bring the sense of touch to a more normal range. Such drugs may be helpful to children who experience too little sensation. And once they can sense pain, such children could be less likely to bite themselves, bang their heads, or hurt themselves in other ways. Chlorpromazine, theoridazine, and haloperidol have also been used. Although these powerful drugs are typically used to treat adults with severe psychiatric disorders, they are sometimes given to people with autism to temporarily reduce agitation, aggression, and repetitive behaviors. However, since major tranquilizers are powerful medications that can produce serious and sometimes permanent side effects, they should be prescribed and used with extreme caution. Vitamin B6, taken with magnesium, is also being explored as a way to stimulate brain activity. Because vitamin B6 plays an important role in creating enzymes needed by the brain, some experts predict that large doses might foster greater brain activity in people with autism. However, clinical studies of the vitamin have been inconclusive and further study is needed. Like drugs, vitamins change the balance of chemicals in the body and may cause unwanted side effects. For this reason, large doses of vitamins should only be given under the supervision of a doctor. This is true of all vitamins and medications. Educational Options The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990 assures a free and appropriate public education to children with diagnosed learning deficits. The 1991 version of the law extended services to preschoolers who are developmentally delayed. As a result, public schools must provide services to handicapped children including those age 3 to 5. Because of the importance of early intervention, many states also offer special services to children from birth to age 3. The school may also be responsible for providing whatever services are needed to enable the child to attend school and learn. Such services might include transportation, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and any special equipment. Federally funded Parent Training Information Centers and Protection and Advocacy Agencies in each state can provide information on the rights of the family and child. By law, public schools are also required to prepare and carry out a set of specific instructional goals for every child in a special education program. The goals are stated as specific skills that the child will be taught to perform. The list of skills make up what is known as an IEP -the child's Individualized Educational Program. The IEP serves as an agreement between the school and the family on the educational goals. Because parents know their child best, they play an important role in creating this plan. They work closely with the school staff to identify which skills the child needs most. In planning the IEP, it's important to focus on what skills are critical to the child's well-being and future development. For each skill, parents and teachers should consider these questions: Is this an important life skill? What will happen if the child isn't trained to do this for herself? Such questions free parents and teachers to consider alternatives to training. After several years of valiant effort to teach Alan to tie his shoelaces, his parents and teachers decided that Alan could simply wear sneakers with Velcro fasteners, and dropped the skill from Alan's IEP. After Alan struggled in vain to memorize the multiplication table, they decided to teach him to use a calculator. A child's success in school should not be measured against standards like mastering algebra or completing high school. Rather, progress should be measured against his or her unique potential for self-care and self-sufficiency as an adult. Adolescence For all children, adolescence is a time of stress and confusion. No less so for teenagers with autism. Like all children, they need help in dealing with their budding sexuality. While some behaviors improve in the teenage years, some get worse. Increased autistic or aggressive behavior may be one way some teens express their newfound tension and confusion. The teenage years are also a time when children become more socially sensitive and aware. At the age that most teenagers are concerned with acne, popularity, grades, and dates, teens with autism may become painfully aware that they are different from their peers. They may notice that they lack friends. And unlike their schoolmates, they aren't dating or planning for a career. For some, the sadness that comes with such realization urges them to learn new behaviors. Sean Barron, who wrote about his autism in the book, There's a Boy in Here, describes how the pain of feeling different motivated him to acquire more normal social skills. At present, there is no cure for autism. Nor do children outgrow it. But the capacity to learn and develop new skills is within every child. With time, children with autism mature and new strengths emerge. Many children with autism seem to go through developmental spurts between ages 5 and 13. Some spontaneously begin to talk-even if repetitively-around age 5 or later. Some become more sociable, or some, more ready to learn. Over time, and with help, children may learn to play with toys appropriately, function socially, and tolerate mild changes in routine. Some children in treatment programs lose enough of their most disabling symptoms to function reasonably well in a regular classroom. Some children with autism make truly dramatic strides. Of course, those with normal or near-normal intelligence and those who develop language tend to have the best outcomes. But even children who start off poorly may make impressive progress. For example, one boy, after 9 years in a program that involved parents as co-therapists, advanced from an IQ of 70 to an IQ of 100 and began to get average grades at a regular school. While it is natural for parents to hope that their child will become normal, they should take pride in whatever strides their child does make. Many parents, looking back over the years, find their child has progressed far beyond their initial expectations. Independence The majority of adults with autism need lifelong training, ongoing supervision, and reinforcement of skills. The public schools' responsibility for providing these services ends when the person is past school age. As the child becomes a young adult, the family is faced with the challenge of creating a home-based plan or selecting a program or facility that can offer such services. In some cases, adults with autism can continue to live at home, provided someone is there to supervise at all times. A variety of residential facilities also provide round-the-clock care. Unlike many of the institutions years ago, today's facilities view residents as people with human needs, and offer opportunities for recreation and simple, but meaningful work. Still, some facilities are isolated from the community, separating people with autism from the rest of the world. Today, a few cities are exploring new ways to help people with autism hold meaningful jobs and live and work within the wider community. Innovative, supportive programs enable adults with autism to live and work in mainstream society, rather than in a segregated environment. By teaching and reinforcing good work skills and positive social behaviors, such programs help people live up to their potential. Work is meaningful and based on each person's strengths and abilities. For example, people with autism with good hand-eye coordination who do complex, repetitive actions are often especially good at assembly and manufacturing tasks. A worker with a low IQ and few language skills might be trained to work in a restaurant sorting silverware and folding napkins. Adults with higher-level skills have been trained to assemble electronic equipment or do office work. Based on their skills and interests, participants in such programs fill positions in printing, retail, clerical, manufacturing, and other companies. Once they are carefully trained in a task, they are put to work alongside the regular staff. Like other employees, they are paid for their labor, receive employee benefits, and are included in staff events like company picnics and retirement parties. Companies that hire people through such programs find that these workers make loyal, reliable employees. Employers find that the autistic behaviors, limited social skills, and even occasional tantrums or aggression, do not greatly affect the worker's ability to work efficiently or complete tasks. Like any other worker, program participants live in houses and apartments within the community. Under the direction of a residence coach, each resident shares as much as possible in tasks like meal-planning, shopping, cooking, and cleanup. For recreation, they go to movies, have picnics, and eat in restaurants. As they are ready, they are taught skills that make them more personally independent. Some take pride in having learned to take a bus on their own, or handling money they've earned themselves. Job and residence coaches, who serve as a link between the program participants and the community, are the key to such programs. There may be as few as two adults with autism assigned to each coach. The job coach demonstrates the steps of a job to the worker, observes behavior, and regularly acknowledges good performance. The job coach also serves as a bridge between the workers with autism and their co-workers. For example, the coach steps in if a worker loses self-control or presents any problems on the job. The coach also provides training in specific social skills, such as waving or saying hello to fellow workers. At home, the residence coach reinforces social and self-help behaviors, and finds ways to help people manage their time and responsibilities. At present, about a third of all adults with autism can live and work in the community with some degree of independence. As scientific research points the way to more effective therapies and as communities establish programs that provide proper support, expectations are that this number will grow. Coping as a Family The task of rearing a child with autism is among the most demanding and stressful that a family faces. The child's screaming fits and tantrums can put everyone on edge. Because the child needs almost constant attention, brothers and sisters often feel ignored or jealous. Younger children may need to be reassured that they will not catch autism or grow to become like their sibling. Older children may be concerned about the prospect of having a child with autism themselves. The tensions can strain a marriage. While friends and family may try to be supportive, they can't understand the difficulties in raising a child with autism. They may criticize the parents for letting their child get away with certain behaviors and announce how they would handle the child. Some parents of children with autism feel envious of their friends' children. This may cause them to grow distant from people who once gave them support. Families may also be uncomfortable taking their child to public places. Children who throw tantrums, walk on their toes, flail their arms, or climb under restaurant tables to play with strangers' socks, can be very embarrassing. Many parents feel deeply disappointed that their child may never engage in normal activities or attain some of life's milestones. Parents may mourn that their child may never learn to play baseball, drive, get a diploma, marry, or have children. However, most parents come to accept these feelings and focus on helping their children achieve what they can. Parents begin to find joy and pleasure in their child despite the limitations. Support groups Many parents find that others who face the same concerns are their strongest allies. Parents of children with autism tend to form communities of mutual caring and support. Parents gain not only encouragement and inspiration from other families' stories, but also practical advice, information on the latest research, and referrals to community services and qualified professionals. By talking with other people who have similar experiences, families dealing with autism learn they are not alone. The Autism Society of America has spawned parent support groups in communities across the country. In such groups, parents share emotional support, affirmation, and suggestions for solving problems. Its newsletter, the Advocate, is filled with up-to-date medical and practical information. Coping Strategies The following suggestions are based on the experiences of families in dealing with autism, and on NIMH-sponsored studies of effective strategies for dealing with stress. Work as a family. In times of stress, family members tend to take their frustrations out on each other when they most need mutual support. Despite the difficulties in finding child care, couples find that taking breaks without their children helps renew their bonds. The other children also need attention, and need to have a voice in expressing and solving problems. Keep a sense of humor. Parents find that the ability to laugh and say, You won't believe what our child has done now! helps them maintain a healthy sense of perspective. Notice progress. When it seems that all the help, love, and support is going nowhere, it's important to remember that over time, real progress is being made. Families are better able to maintain their hope if they celebrate the small signs of growth and change they see. Take action. Many parents gain strength working with others on behalf of all children with autism. Working to win additional resources, community programs, or school services helps parents see themselves as important contributors to the well-being of others as well as their own child. Plan ahead. Naturally, most parents want to know that when they die, their offspring will be safe and cared for. Having a plan in place helps relieve some of the worry. Some parents form a contract with a professional guardian, who agrees to look after the interests of the person with autism, such as observing birthdays and arranging for care. Research Research continues to reveal how the brain-the control center for thought, language, feelings, and behavior-carries out its functions. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funds scientists at centers across the Nation who are exploring how the brain develops, transmits its signals, integrates input from the senses, and translates all this into thoughts and behavior. In recognition of growing scientific gains in brain research, the President and Congress have officially designated the 1990s as the Decade of the Brain. There are new research initiatives at NIH sponsored by NIMH, NICHD, NINDS, and NIDCD. As a result, today as never before, investigators from various scientific disciplines are joining forces to unlock the mysteries of the brain. Perspective gained from research into the genetic, biochemical, physiological, and psychological aspects of autism may provide a more complete view of the disorder. Every day, NIH-sponsored researchers are learning more about how the brain develops normally and what can go wrong in the process. Already, for example, scientists have discovered evidence suggesting that in autism, brain development slows at some point before week 30 of pregnancy. Scientists now also have tools and techniques that allow them to examine the brain in ways that were unthought of just a few years ago. New imaging techniques that show the living brain in action permit scientists to observe with surprising clarity how the brain changes as an individual performs mental tasks, moves, or speaks. Such techniques open windows to the brain, allowing scientists to learn which brain regions are engaged in particular tasks. In addition, recent scientific advances are permitting scientists to break new ground in researching the role of heredity in autism. Using sophisticated statistical methods along with gene splicing-a technique that enables scientists to manipulate the microscopic bits of genetic code-investigators sponsored by NIH and other institutions are searching for abnormal genes that may be involved in autism. The ability to identify irregular genes-or the factors that make a gene unstable-may lead to earlier diagnoses. Meanwhile, scientists are working to determine if there is a genetic link between autism and other brain disorders commonly associated with it, such as Tourette Disorder and Tuberous Sclerosis. New insights into the genetic transmission of these disorders, along with newly gained knowledge of normal and abnormal brain development should provide important clues to the causes of autism. A key to developing our understanding of the human brain is research involving animals. Like humans, other primates, such as chimpanzees, apes, and monkeys, have emotions, form attachments, and develop higher-level thought processes. For this reason, studies of their brain functions and behavior shed light on human development. Animal studies have proven invaluable in learning how disruptions to the developing brain affect behavior, sensory perceptions, and mental development and have led to a better understanding of autism. Ultimately, the results of NIMH's extensive research program may translate into better lives for people with autism. As we get closer to understanding the brain, we approach a day when we may be able to diagnose very young children and provide effective treatment earlier in the child's development. As data accumulate on the brain chemicals involved in autism, we get closer to developing medications that reduce or reverse imbalances. Someday, we may even have the ability to prevent the disorder. Perhaps researchers will learn to identify children at risk for autism at birth, allowing doctors and other health care professionals to provide preventive therapy before symptoms ever develop. Or, as scientists learn more about the genetic transmission of autism, they may be able to replace any defective genes before the infant is even born. Resources Parents often find that books and movies about autism that have happy endings cheer them, but raise false hopes. In such stories, a parent's novel approach suddenly works or the child simply outgrows the autistic behaviors. But there really are no cures for autism and growth takes time and patience. Parents should seek practical, realistic sources of information, particularly those based on careful research. Similarly, certain sources of information are more reliable than others. Some popular magazines and newspapers are quick to report new miracle cures before they have been thoroughly researched. Scientific and professional materials, such as those published by the Autism Society of America and other organizations that take the time to thoroughly evaluate such claims, provide current information based on well-documented data and carefully controlled clinical research.

The very early identification of autism: outcome to age 4 1/2-5. J Autism Dev Disord. 2004 Aug;34(4):367-78. Forty-nine 2 years olds with social and language characteristics suggestive of autism were identified by community professionals and screening tools, then given a diagnostic assessment and reexamined at age 4 1/2. Agreement between autism clinic and screenings was high, with 88% receiving a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. The children were lower functioning relative to the autism population, thus more likely to be identified early. Reliability of diagnoses from 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 was high with 79% staying in the same diagnostic category, but more so for clear autism than for PDDNOS. About a third improved over 20 IQ points and similar number similarly declined. Changes were not related to amount or type of intervention but were related to the children's characteristics. Higher functioning children with milder autism were the most improved. Parsons S, Mitchell P, Leonard A. The use and understanding of virtual environments by adolescents with autistic spectrum disorders. J Autism Dev Disord. 2004 Aug;34(4):449-66. The potential of virtual environments for teaching people with autism has been positively promoted in recent years. The present study aimed to systematically investigate this potential with 12 participants with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs), each individually matched with comparison participants according to either verbal IQ or performance IQ, as well as gender and chronological age. Participants practised using a desktop 'training' virtual environment, before completing a number of tasks in a virtual caf\u0329. We examined time spent completing tasks, errors made, basic understanding of the representational quality of virtual environments and the social appropriateness of performance. The use of the environments by the participants with ASDs was on a par with their PIQ-matched counterparts, and the majority of the group seemed to have a basic understanding of the virtual environment as a representation of reality. However, some participants in the ASD group were significantly more likely to be judged as bumping into, or walking between, other people in the virtual scene, compared to their paired matches. This tendency could not be explained by executive dysfunction or a general motor difficulty. This might be a sign that understanding personal space is impaired in autism. Virtual environments might offer a useful tool for social skills training, and this would be a valuable topic for future research. Bieberich AA, Morgan SB. Self-regulation and affective expression during play in children with autism or Down Syndrome: a short-term longitudinal study. \ufffdJ Autism Dev Disord. 2004 Aug;34(4):439-48. Our study examined stability of self-regulation and affective expression in children with autism or Down syndrome over a 2 year period. A behaviorally-anchored rating scale was used to assess a self-regulation factor (attention, adaptability, object orientation, and persistence), negative affect factor (hostility, irritability, and compliance), and positive affect factor (positive affect, affective sharing, and dull affect) from videotapes of play sessions involving each child and his or her mother. The patterns of ratings within each group were similar from time 1 to time 2, with the autism group showing more deviant ratings on measures of self-regulation and affective sharing. From time 1 to time 2, children with autism showed relatively high stability for the self-regulation factor, but less stability than children with Down syndrome for all three factors. Merrick J, Kandel I, Morad M. Trends in autism. \ufffdInt J Adolesc Med Health. 2004 Jan-Mar;16(1):75-8. Leo Kanner described autism in 1943, and Hans Asperger described the syndrome in 1944. The term Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) was first used in the 1980s to describe a class of disorders that include (1) Autistic disorder, (2) Rett disorder or syndrome, (3) Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, (4) Asperger's disorder or syndrome, and (5) Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, or PDDNOS. Autism prevalence studies published before 1985 showed prevalence rates of 4 to 5 per 10,000 children for the broader autism spectrum, and about 2 per 10,000 for the classic autism definition. Since 1985 there have been higher rates of autism reported from several countries. From the UK a prevalence rate of 16.8 per 10,000 children for autistic disorder was reported, and 62.6 per 10,000 for the entire autistic spectrum disorders. Sweden reported a prevalence of 36 per 10,000 for Asperger and 35 per 10,000 for social impairment, or a total prevalence of 71 per 10,000 for suspected and possible cases. From the US, 40 per 10,000 in three to ten year old children for autistic disorder and 67 per 10,000 children for the entire autism spectrum was reported. From the north region in Israel for children born between 1989-93 in the Haifa area, an incidence rate of 10 per 10,000 was found for autism. In recent years concern has been shown about the possible increase in the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders. Studies have shown an increase, but during these last twenty years diagnostic criteria and definition have also changed. Although many factors are at play, it is evident that there has been an increase. Malow BA. Sleep disorders, epilepsy, and autism. Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev. 2004;10(2):122-5. The purpose of this review article is to describe the clinical data linking autism with sleep and epilepsy and to discuss the impact of treating sleep disorders in children with autism either with or without coexisting epileptic seizures. Studies are presented to support the view that sleep is abnormal in individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. Epilepsy and sleep have reciprocal relationships, with sleep facilitating seizures and seizures adversely affecting sleep architecture. The hypothesis put forth is that identifying and treating sleep disorders, which are potentially caused by or contributed to by autism, may impact favorably on seizure control and on daytime behavior. The article concludes with some practical suggestions for the evaluation and treatment of sleep disorders in this population of children with autism. MRDD Research Reviews 2004;10:122-125. Bernard-Opitz V, Ing S, Kong TY. Comparison of behavioural and natural play interventions for young children with autism. Autism. 2004 Sep;8(3):319-33. The article reports the results of a pilot study comparing traditional behavioural approaches and natural play interventions for young children with autism over a 10 week period. Two matched groups of eight young children with autism participated. Using a crossover design, children in both groups showed positive gains in compliance, attending, play and communication with their therapists and parents. Improvements in attending and compliance were higher following the behavioural condition compared with the natural play condition. Seven participants had reduced autism scores after the intervention. The findings suggest that behavioural and play approaches affect behaviour in different ways and that autistic symptomatology of young children may be amenable to treatment. The discussion focuses on the active ingredients of treatments and the need to base efficacy research on well-planned treatment comparisons. Pinto-Martin J, Levy SE. Early Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders. Curr Treat Options Neurol. 2004 Sep;6(5):391-400. Autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are an often-disabling continuum of disorders affecting two to four in 1000 children. These disorders have a core set of defining features including impaired verbal and nonverbal communication, impaired social interaction, and restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior. The cause of autism is unclear. The disorder can be defined only by related behaviors. Although there has been considerable improvement in standardized screening techniques for ASD in the past 10 years, screening and diagnostic practices in medicine and education lag far behind clinical research. Various studies have found the average age of diagnosis to be between 3 and 6 years, with significant differences as a function of ethnicity and socio-economic status. Preliminary research suggests that in some populations, missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis of ASD are common. This may be caused partly by inadequate screening practices. It also may reflect that presentation of symptoms varies from patient to patient. Lack of resources for appropriate referral, diagnosis, and treatment may play an important role. This article discusses recent progress in ASD screening, what is known of current screening and diagnostic practices, and future directions for research and practice improvement. The best practice model for the screening and early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disabilities should include routine developmental surveillance as part of well-child pediatric care. General developmental screening should be followed by autism-specific screening for those children who fail the initial developmental screen, or whose parents report suspect behaviors. Howlin P, Goode S, Hutton J, Rutter M. Adult outcome for children with autism. J Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2004 Feb;45(2):212-29. BACKGROUND: Information on long-term prognosis in autism is limited. Outcome is known to be poor for those with an IQ below 50, but there have been few systematic studies of individuals with an IQ above this. METHOD: Sixty-eight individuals meeting criteria for autism and with a performance IQ of 50 or above in childhood were followed up as adults. Their mean age when first seen was 7 years (range 3-15 years); at follow-up the average age was 29 years (range 21-48 years). Outcome measures included standardised cognitive, language and attainment tests. Information on social, communication and behavioural problems was obtained from the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI). RESULTS: Although a minority of adults had achieved relatively high levels of independence, most remained very dependent on their families or other support services. Few lived alone, had close friends, or permanent employment. Communication generally was impaired, and reading and spelling abilities were poor. Stereotyped behaviours or interests frequently persisted into adulthood. Ten individuals had developed epilepsy. Overall, only 12% were rated as having a 'Very Good' outcome; 10% were rated as 'Good' and 19% as 'Fair'. The majority was rated as having a 'Poor' (46%) or 'Very Poor' (12%) outcome. Individuals with a childhood performance IQ of at least 70 had a significantly better outcome than those with an IQ below this. However, within the normal IQ range outcome was very variable and, on an individual level, neither verbal nor performance IQ proved to be consistent prognostic indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Although outcome for adults with autism has improved over recent years, many remain highly dependent on others for support. This study provides some information on prognostic indicators, but more fine-grained research is needed into the childhood variables that are associated with good or poor outcome.

Autism: Do Environmental Factors Play a Role in Causation?Ted Schettler MD, MPH, Science DirectorScience and Environmental Health NetworkJune 2004SummaryAutism is a complex disorder with social, language, sensory, and motor deficits, behavioral abnormalities, and may also be associated with mental retardation. These components may have widely varying expression in individuals. In recent years, associated co-morbidities, including gastrointestinal, metabolic, and immune system abnormalities, have raised new questions about the causes and manifestations of the full spectrum of autism-like disorders. Autism prevalence is generally thought to be increasing, though changing diagnostic criteria and increased reporting are likely to be contributing somewhat to that increase. Genetic factors are important in the causation of autism but are not fully explanatory. Various environmental factors, including infectious and chemical agents, are known, suspected, or theorized to play a role, as well.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdWhat is Autism?Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder that involves social, language, sensory, and motor deficits, behavioral abnormalities, and may also be associated with mental retardation. Kanner coined the term \ufffd??autism\ufffd?? in 1943 to characterize a group of children in whom he identified a complex set of characteristics that clustered together, including abnormalities in social development, verbal and non-verbal communication, and symbolic thinking. In 1944 Asperger described a similar set of characteristics, except that his patients did not have language delays as described by Kanner.Autism usually becomes apparent by the age of three or four, though the timing of diagnosis depends on the severity of symptoms. Autistic children display varying degrees of impairment of social skills, limitations in the use of language, echolalia (repetition of a word or sentence just spoken by another person), deficiencies in symbolic thinking, stereotypic/repetitive behavior, self-injury behavior, seizures, and mental retardation (Rapin 1997).The diagnostic criteria for autism have evolved over the years. According to current criteria found in the American Psychiatric Association\ufffd??s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMIV), the diagnosis of autism depends on combinations of symptoms and signs from the realms of social interaction, communication, and behavior. Other pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) include PDD-not-otherwise-specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger syndrome. PDD-NOS includes individuals who do not fulfill the autism criteria in one of the three categories, or did not do so early enough in life. Rett\ufffd??s syndrome, generally thought to be seen only in females, and childhood disintegrative disorder are two relatively unusual additional severe developmental disorders that share some features of autism but are unlikely to have the same causes.Children with pervasive developmental disorders are not always easy to diagnose and classify. Considerable effort has been invested in developing the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) (LeCouteur et al. 1989, DiLavore et al. 1995) as reliable diagnostic instruments These tools have made it possible to combine samples of people with autism for study purposes, but their use is time-consuming, and they are not the standard of care in clinical practice. As a result, clinicians vary considerably in their use of diagnostic labels.In recent years, autism has increasingly been considered a spectrum of conditions (autism spectrum disorders\ufffd??ASD), but the value of using such a continuum is a matter of debate because of considerable variability in manifestations of altered social interaction, communication, and behavior. Yet, it is generally agreed that ASDs are likely to share at least some risk factors and causal mechanisms, such as overlapping genetic predisposition and gene expression, although these may be involved in different ways at varying times during development.Autism Prevalence and TrendsThe prevalence of autism and trends over time is the topic of considerable debate and disagreement. Uncertainties arise from two main sources. First, record keeping has been relatively sparse and inconsistent since Kanner first coined the term \ufffd??autism\ufffd??. Second, inconsistencies in the use of diagnostic terminology over time or from place to place make it difficult to achieve consensus.Prevalence surveys in the 1960s and 1970s dealt with a narrow definition of autism as defined by Kanner, and did not account for people who were not also mentally retarded. Autism prevalence from studies published before 1985 are 4-5 per 10,000 for the broader spectrum of conditions and about 2 per 10,000 for Kanner\ufffd??s more narrowly defined classic autism (Wing 1993).In the 1990s, pervasive developmental disorder\ufffd??not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger syndrome were added to the DSMIV. Clinicians often use these diagnostic categories for milder or less formulaic manifestations of developmental abnormalities. As a result, prevalence surveys in recent years often, but not always, include individuals with conditions that would not have been included in earlier surveys.In 1999, a 210% increase in the number of children with autism reported to the Department of Developmental Services in California from 1987 to 1998 suggested that the incidence of autism was rapidly increasing (California HHS 1999). Considerable debate since then has focused on whether or not the reported increase is a result of changing diagnostic patterns and changing terminology\ufffd??for example, substituting \ufffd??autism\ufffd?? for \ufffd??pervasive development disorder\ufffd??\ufffd??or whether the increase can be explained by \ufffd??diagnostic substitution\ufffd?? of patients who would previously been diagnosed as mentally retarded (Croen and Grether 2003, Fombonne 2003).Reanalysis of the original California data indicates that the increase cannot be explained entirely by diagnostic substitution (Blaxill et al. 2003, Croen and Grether 2003). In that reanalysis, over the period of 1987-1994, the probability of becoming a Department of Developmental Services client for mental retardation by age 4 remained relatively constant while the probability of becoming a client for autism increased steadily from about 2/10,000 births in 1987 to 10/10,000 births in 1994. The discussion surrounding the validity of the California data emphasizes the importance of accounting for case ascertainment bias, distinguishing between incidence (rate of new cases of autism) and prevalence (point estimate of total cases, new and old, at any time in a given population), and considering the prevalence of autism in annual birth cohorts independently as they age. Considering these factors, Blaxill et al. conclude that the increase is real.Another recent survey in Atlanta, GA found autism prevalence of 1.9 per 1000 in 3-year-old children to 4.7 per 1000 in 8-year-olds (Yeargin-Allsopp et al. 2003). In this survey, the term \ufffd??autism\ufffd?? included autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, and PDD-NOS. A recent study in the United Kingdom reported a prevalence of 1.7 per 1000 children for autistic disorder and 6.3 per 1000 for the entire autism spectrum.The debate over autism prevalence and trends has important practical consequences for two major reasons. First, an increasing prevalence of ASD buttresses arguments for additional research into their causes and identification of opportunities for prevention, as well as additional resources for clinical and educational services. Second, if the prevalence of autism is increasing, as recent surveys suggest, an important contributing role for environmental factors becomes more plausible.In all studies, males are about 3-4 times more likely to be affected with ASD than females. In the Atlanta study, among the children with autism, 20% had mild mental retardation (MR), 11% moderate MR, 7% severe MR, and 3% profound MR. Eight percent of the children with autism also had epilepsy and 5% had cerebral palsy.Autism:\ufffd\ufffdA Singular Disorder of Brain Development or Multisystem Disease?In the past two decades autism and ASD came to be considered to be primarily disorders of brain development. This formulation was an advance over prior psychoanalytic formulations associated with Bruno Bettelheim, who attributed autism to the social reticence of \ufffd??refrigerator mothers\ufffd??, even though it was later shown that social reticence was more likely in fathers (Eisenberg 1957). A significant contributor to this shift was the discovery of abnormalities in postmortem brain tissue, particularly in the limbic system and cerebellum (Bauman and Kemper 1985). The nature of these abnormalities suggested to some people a prenatal origin for autism, probably before 30 weeks gestation. This finding, in conjunction with the high concordance in monozygotic twins, led to a formulation that autism was a genetically programmed disorder that begins in utero.While postmortem brain tissue of young autistic subjects is hard to obtain, it has been easier to study brain abnormalities using various types of neuroimaging. After years of poorly replicated findings, the single most common observation has been that head circumference, brain volume and brain weight are all greater in children with autism than in children who are developing typically. Moreover, retrospective head circumference studies in children diagnosed with autism show that the brain volume increase occurs postnatally, as autistic children are usually born with normal or even slightly small head circumferences, but have an unusually rapid brain growth trajectory in the first few years of life (Lainhart et al. 1997, Woodhouse et al. 1996, Courchesne et al. 2001). While this post-natal brain volume increase could result from abnormalities in brain development that are set in motion in utero, it also raises the possibility that post-natal influences are having an impact on autistic brain development. In either case, environmental factors could play a role.Along with evidence that brain development may be altered postnatally and not just in utero, other findings suggest that not just the central nervous system but other organ systems as well may be affected in autism. Associated gastrointestinal, immunologic, and metabolic abnormalities that co-occur with neurologic signs and symptoms in many people with autism suggest that autism may actually be a multi-system disorder with a variety of manifestations (Gillberg and Billstedt 2000). Consequently, some clinicians, research scientists, and advocates have begun to think about autism as associated with a number of potential co-morbidities, which may, in some instances, be causally related to the entire symptom complex.Intestinal abnormalities: Gastrointestinal abnormalities reported in children with autism include gastritis, reflux esophagitis, non-specific colitis, constipation, and altered intestinal absorption (Horvath et al. 1999, D\ufffd??Eufemia et al. 1996, Accardo and Bostwick 1999, Wakefield et al. 1998, Afzal et al. 2003). These conditions can cause bloating, abnormal bowel movements, abdominal pain, and irritability, which in turn, can trigger behavioral abnormalities and abnormal sleep patterns. Pathological examination of intestinal biopsies has revealed abnormal immunological markers (Torrente et al. 2004, Ashwood et al. 2003). It appears that some dietary interventions may help improve these symptoms in autistic children. Whether or not these gastrointestinal abnormalities are in any way related to the cause of neurological manifestations of autism is a matter of conjecture. One hypothesis that has not been well studied, for example, theorizes that abnormal intestinal absorption of dietary components or toxic chemicals facilitates toxic impacts on brain development.Altered metabolic processes: Another hypothesis that has received some attention focuses on abnormal metabolic processes in some autistic people. This theory holds that at least some autistics have an impaired ability to properly metabolize toxic chemicals or metals to which they may be exposed through normal dietary intake or through exposure to contaminated food, water, or air. (Alberti et al. 1999, Waring 1997) Most reports that address this hypothesis are anecdotal or involve studies of relatively small numbers of children. This is also an area of profound uncertainty and debate. Larger well-designed and well-controlled studies will be necessary in order to draw any meaningful conclusions.Immune system abnormalities: Cell-mediated immunity and antibody levels have been reported to be abnormal in some people with autism (Gupta 2000, Singh et al. 1991, Burger and Warren 1998, Jyonouchi et al. 2001). Autoimmune antibodies have also been described (Singh et al. 1988, Gupta 2000) and increased autoimmune disease has been documented in family members of autistic individuals (Comi et al. 1999). As a result, abnormalities of the immune system are the basis for additional hypotheses about the causes of autism. Genetically determined immune system abnormalities might theoretically help to explain an abnormal response to toxic chemicals or metals in autistic people as well. This, too, remains an area of conjecture and significant research interest.Causes of AutismGenetic factors: The causes of autism are unknown. A limited number of twin studies show that genetic factors undoubtedly play an important role but are not fully explanatory. In monozygotic twins (\ufffd??identical twins\ufffd??), if one twin is diagnosed with autism, the other twin has a 70-90% chance of having a similar diagnosis (Steffenburg et al. 1989, Folstein and Rosen-Sheidley 2001). The severity of the condition in identical twins, however, may differ considerably. (Bailey et al. 1995) In dizygotic (fraternal) twins, if one is diagnosed with autism, the chance of the other having a similar diagnosis is to 5-10%. Non-twin siblings of people with autism also have a 3-8% chance of having the same diagnosis, which is more than a 10-fold increase in risk compared to the general population. (Rutter et al. 1997)These family studies of autism and related conditions help provide clues to both genetic and environmental causes. If, for example, dizygotic twins have a higher likelihood of a shared diagnosis than non-twin siblings, it suggests that a uterine environmental factor or something in the early postnatal shared environment may play a role. But dizygotic twin data are relatively sparse, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. It is also important to note that differing levels of severity of characteristics of autism among twins and siblings with similar diagnoses raise the possibility that, while genes may play an important role in autism causation, these genetic factors may be influenced to a greater or lesser extent by exposure to environmental agents, whether chemical, biological, or nutritional.Environmental agents: Many different environmental agents have been considered as possible contributors to the development of autism, in combination with a genetic predisposition. A number of problems complicate the design of research programs to explore these possibilities. Among them is the suspicion that the spectrum of disorders that are included in ASD may actually represent a very heterogeneous mix of conditions with disparate causes. Under these circumstances, no simple combination of genetic and environmental factors will ever be identified as contributing to the majority of cases of autism. Because of this, some researchers suggest a shift of research focus to identification of subtypes of autism that, while not purely homogeneous, will nevertheless have lower variability within the group being studied. A complementary shift in emphasis comes out of the argument that the autism is not a unitary diagnosis but rather is a manifestation of a final common pathway that can result from multiple types of injuries to or abnormalities in the developing nervous system.No clear picture has emerged from research into environmental contributors to autism, though there are tantalizing clues. In utero exposure to the rubella virus (the cause of \ufffd??German measles\ufffd??) can impair brain development of the fetus leading to varying degrees and combinations of blindness, deafness, birth defects, mental retardation and autism (Desmond et al. 1967). Children with autism resulting from gestational exposure to rubella virus may improve, worsen, or remain about the same. Post-natal herpes simplex virus brain infections (encephalitis) may also result in an autism-like syndrome. (Ritvo et al. 1990).Two pharmaceutical agents, thalidomide and valproic acid, are also implicated in the development of some cases of autism. The morning-sickness drug, thalidomide, is best known for the tragic and often severe limb defects that it caused in the offspring of some women who took it while pregnant. A 1994 Swedish study, however, reported that five out of a group of 100 children who had been exposed to the morning-sickness drug thalidomide in utero developed autism. The risk was particularly increased when the exposure to the drug occurred early in pregnancy\ufffd??20-24 days after conception (Stromland et al. 1994).Subsequently, in an autopsy examination of a person with autism, Rodier and colleagues found abnormalities in the brain stem and cranial nerves. (Rodier et al. 1996). This kind of abnormality is best explained by altered brain development during early gestation, similar to the time of increased risk in people exposed to thalidomide. Together these findings suggest that a critical period for autism induction may be very early in gestation. Valproic acid, an anti-seizure medication, has also been implicated as a cause of autism after gestational exposure (Christianson et al. 1994, Williams et al. 2001, Moore et al. 2000).A recent review of the medical literature by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry of the US Department of Human Services identified reports of chemical exposures that are potentially related to autism. (Allred and Wilbur 2002) Preconception parental occupational exposure to chemicals generally and maternal abuse of drugs have been linked to autism in offspring, but most of these studies have significant limitations. Studies of the potential role of anesthetics and labor-inducing drugs have mixed and inconclusive results. Maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol syndrome, a mixture of birth defects, intellectual and behavioral problems. Asperger syndrome and autism can coexist with other manifestations of fetal alcohol syndrome, suggesting that alcohol may, in some cases, be responsible for autism as a result of early gestational exposures (Aronson et al. 1997, Harris et al. 1995).In recent years, other environmental factors have been suggested as playing a role in the development of autism. Interactions between genetic susceptibility and toxic exposures that may trigger those genetic factors are the subject of considerable research into the causes of autism. For example, inter-individual variation in the absorption or excretion of heavy metals like mercury in susceptible individuals is under close scrutiny. Each hypothesis and the evidence that supports it, has attracted staunch, outspoken advocates, many of whom have organized in networks and organizations dedicated to further research, services for affected individuals, and treatment. (Defeat Autism Now, Autism Research Institute, Safe Minds, among others)Autism and vaccines: Concerns about a potential relationship between vaccines and autism developed in the 1990s and intensified in 1998 after reports of a study of 12 children with regressive autism and gastrointestinal disease (Wakefield et al. 1998). The children referred for study had all been reported to be developing normally before losing acquired skills, including language, and all had developed diarrhea and abdominal pain. For 8 of the 12 children, parents or clinicians reported retrospectively that the onset of their behavioral symptoms began shortly after receiving MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. On detailed examination, including biopsies and imaging studies, each of the children showed intestinal abnormalities, including inflammation. The study was noted to have limitations because it did not include any control patients and may have been influenced by retrospective ascertainment of vaccination timing and status, among other reasons. (Chen and DeStefano 1998) Nonetheless, although the authors clearly stated that the results did not show that MMR vaccine was responsible for the symptoms and findings, this study increased the concern of many about the safety of the MMR vaccine. The observations raised the possibility that MMR vaccine causes inflammation of the intestinal lining, facilitating increased intestinal permeability and excessive absorption of toxic compounds derived from certain foods.In 2001, a committee of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences addressed the topic, reviewing published and unpublished literature addressing MMR vaccines and autism spectrum disorders, and interviewing research scientists who had investigated the matter (Institute of Medicine 2001a). The committee concluded \ufffd??the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship at the population level between MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders\ufffd??. However, the committee notes that its conclusion does not exclude the possibility that MMR vaccine could contribute to autism spectrum disorders in a small number of children\ufffd??..\ufffd?? The committee noted \ufffd??the proposed biological models linking MMR to vaccine to ASD, although far from established, are nevertheless not disproved.\ufffd?? They also noted that vaccine protection from infectious disease is an extremely important public health measure and that the diseases that the vaccines prevent have significant associated morbidity and mortality.Autism and mercury\ufffd??vaccines and beyond: Another vaccine-related concern stems from the use of thimerosal as a preservative in vaccine preparations. Thimerosal is an organic mercury compound, metabolized to ethylmercury and thiosalicylate, and has been used in vaccines since the 1930s until it began to be phased out in the late 1990s. Concerns centered on the observation that organic mercury is a potent toxicant in the developing brain and that children receiving a full set of recommended vaccinations were often exposed to mercury at levels that exceed a \ufffd??safe\ufffd?? reference dose, established by the Environmental Protection Agency and affirmed by the National Academy of Sciences.In 2001, a committee of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) examined the evidence that might help clarify any relationship or lack of relationship between thimerosal and autism (Institute of Medicine 2001b) That committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish the link, but that the hypothesis is biologically plausible.Since that IOM report, in a study of mercury levels in the blood of 40 children who had received vaccines containing thimerosal and 21 control children, the authors reported that no children in the treatment group had mercury blood levels that exceeded the \ufffd??safe\ufffd?? level as estimated by the EPA. (Pichichero) The authors, however, determined that the half-life of ethylmercury is 5-7 days, and in some cases, blood samples were obtained well after peak blood levels would have occurred. As a result, and because only single blood samples were tested, the investigators were unable to determine what peak blood levels of mercury had actually been after vaccination. Moreover, no attempt was made to calculate the fluctuating mercury levels that will result over time as a child receives multiple vaccines beginning in infancy. Limitations of this study are discussed in some detail in correspondence (Colman 2003, Halsey and Goldman 2003, Westphal and Hallier 2003), and on the Safe Minds website www.safeminds.org.A subsequent report in 2003 evaluated doses of mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines and the incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, using the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, maintained by the Centers for Disease Control since 1990. (Geier and Geier 2003) Though the authors concluded that there was strong epidemiological evidence for a link between the thimerosal exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders, the study, as published, does not provide sufficient data to justify the conclusion. It is severely limited by its design and sources of data. It is an ecological study that examines vaccine use and adverse reactions reported in the entire population without being more precise about actual exposures to mercury in individual children who did, or did not, develop neurological disorders. Reporting bias is also likely to be a serious limitation. Moreover, the authors do not supply any of the detailed data, such as incidence of adverse effects and number of doses of vaccine administered, necessary to evaluate the significance of their conclusions. This study is uninterpretable and inadequate for drawing conclusions regarding a causal relationship between thimerosal and autism.In 2004, Hornig et al. reported the results of a study of the impacts of thimerosal in autoimmune-sensitive mice. The investigation was prompted by reports of increased autoimmune disease in families of people with autism, which generated the hypothesis that, in some people with autism, autoimmunity might play a causal role. Mice were treated with thimerosal at levels intended to mimic the exposures of children given thimerosal-containing vaccines. Autoimmune-sensitive mice showed altered growth, reduced locomotion, exaggerated response to novelty, and changes in microscopic brain structure, including increased cell density in some brain regions, after exposure to thimerosal. Control mice resistant to autoimmunity did not show similar changes. These results suggest an interaction of thimerosal with the immune system, causing neurobehavioral toxicity and structural brain changes, although it remains unclear if they are analogous with those seen in people with autism.A final IOM report on vaccines and autism was released in 2004 after the committee reviewed the most current data and interviewed research scientists and authors. That report concludes, \ufffd??the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.\ufffd?? (Institute of Medicine 2004) Commenting on the mice studies, the IOM committee said that the \ufffd??connection with autism and these models is theoretical\ufffd??. An important unresolved issue is whether the immune system may play a contributory role in causing autism in some people or rather, that immune system abnormalities are another manifestation of the complex condition. This is likely to remain an important line of ongoing research.Despite concerns about administering mercury-containing vaccines to pregnant women, infants, and children, thimerosal is not the source of largest mercury exposures in people. Methylmercury contamination of fish and dental amalgam fillings in teeth are other significant sources. Methylmercury easily crosses the placenta and is well known to impact normal fetal brain development. Cumulative mercury exposures from multiple sources, therefore, must be considered when assessing a potential link between autism and mercury.Perhaps as well as any other example, the debate about the potential role of mercury in vaccines as a contributing cause of autism highlights the intense interest of parents, the general public, research scientists, and public health agencies in learning more about a possible causative role of environmental factors in autism. Fortunately, thimerosal-free vaccines are now available in the US, so parents are not faced with wondering about the safety of vaccines for this reason. Lifting this burden has been a relief, since vaccinations are extremely important public health interventions in the prevention of dangerous infectious diseases.\ufffd\ufffdSummaryAutism is a complex disorder with social, language, sensory, and motor deficits, behavioral abnormalities, and may also be associated with mental retardation. These components may have widely varying expression in individuals.

But because the symptoms of autism vary greatly, two children with the same diagnosis may act quite differently and have strikingly different skills. Many children show signs of autism in early infancy. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life but then suddenly become withdrawn, aggressive, or lose language skills they've already acquired. Though each child with autism is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior, these characteristics are common signs of the disorder: Impaired ability to make friends with peers Impaired ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others Absence or impairment of imaginative and social play Stereotyped, repetitive, or unusual use of language Restricted patterns of interest that are abnormal in intensity or focus Preoccupation with certain objects or subjects Inflexible adherence to specific routines or rituals Causes There is no single known cause of autism. Contributing causes may include: [1]. Genetics: There is convincing evidence that autism is a heritable disorder. The identity and number of genes involved remain unknown. Environmental: Epidemiologic studies indicate that environmental factors such as toxic exposures, teratogens, perinatal insults, and prenatal infections such as rubella and cytomegalovirus account for few cases. Toxic exposure: Studies done to date fail to find evidence that immunizations with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine are responsible for the surge in autism. There has been considerable controversy about a possible toxic or heavy metal (especially mercury) component to autism. Diagnosis The diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder (from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition---Text Revision) (DSM-IV-TR) [2]: A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): 1. Qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: Marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction Failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level A lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) Lack of social or emotional reciprocity 2. Qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: Delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) In individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others Stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language Lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level 3. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: Encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus Apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals Stereotyped and repetitive motor manners (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) Persistent preoccupation with parts of objects Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to three years of age: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett\ufffds Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. Treatment There is no cure for autism. Therapies and behavioral interventions are designed to remedy specific symptoms and can bring about substantial improvement. The ideal treatment plan coordinates therapies and interventions that target the core symptoms of autism: impaired social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and obsessive or repetitive routines and interests. Most professionals agree that the earlier the intervention, the better. Treatment options for autism include: Medications Doctors often prescribe an antidepressant medication to handle symptoms of anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anti-psychotic medications are used to treat severe behavioral problems. Seizures can be treated with one or more of the anticonvulsant drugs. Stimulant drugs, such as those used for children with attention deficit disorder (ADD), are sometimes used effectively to help decrease impulsivity and hyperactivity. Therapies The National Institute of Mental Health says that psychosocial and behavioral interventions are key parts of comprehensive treatment programs for children with autism. Some of the most common interventions include: Applied behavior analysis (ABA): the science of applying experimentally derived principles in order to improve behavior. Discrete trial training (DTT): directly training a variety of skills that individuals with disabilities may not pick up naturally Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI): a structured approach to teaching which is carefully designed and follows specific patterns of instruction. It is based on well-studied principals of human learning and designed primarily for young children (ranging from 3 to 14 years of age) whose clinical diagnoses falls along the autism spectrum and/or who present significant behavioral challenges. [3] Incidental teaching: structuring and sequencing education in order to take advantage of interests and motivation. Pivotal response training (PRT): a treatment based on the principals of applied behavior which focuses on choices and direct reinforcement. Verbal behavior intervention (VBI): a form of EIBI which uses language and verbal behavoir. Developmental, individual differences, relationship-based approach (DIR/Floortime Model): focuses on helping children master the building blocks of relating, communicating and thinking, rather than on symptoms alone. [4] Relationship development intervention (RDI): a parent-centered treatment program which is intended to help lay missing pathways in the brain. Treatment and education of autistic and communication- related handicapped children (TEAACH): provides training and services designed to help patients and families deal with the condition of autism. Therapies often used with those listed previously: Occupational Therapy Sensory Integration Therapy Speech Therapy The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS): a program designed to teach communication using nonverbal cues. Holistic and alternative treatments There is no known cure for autism. To relieve the symptoms of autism, some parents and providers may use treatments that are outside of what is typically recommended by their pediatrician. These types of treatments are known as complementary and alternative treatments or CAM. They may include special diets, chelation (a treatment to remove heavy metals like lead from the body), biologicals (e.g., [[Human Secretin|secretin), or body-based systems (like deep pressure). [5] These types of treatments are controversial. Current research shows that as many as one third of children with autism may have tried complementary or alternative medicine treatments, and up to 10% may be using a potentially dangerous treatment. [6] Many biomedical interventions call for changes in diet. Such changes include removing certain types of foods from a child\ufffds diet and using vitamin or mineral supplements. Dietary treatments are based on the idea that food allergies cause symptoms of autism or that the lack of a specific vitamin or mineral may cause some autistic symptoms. Some parents feel that changes in their child\ufffds diet may make a difference in how the child feels or acts. A diet that some parents have found to be helpful for their autistic child is a gluten-free, casein-free diet. Gluten is a substance that is found in the seeds of various cereal plants\ufffdwheat, oat, rye, and barley. Casein is the principal protein in milk. A supplement that some parents feel is beneficial for an autistic child is Vitamin B6, taken with magnesium (which makes the vitamin effective). The results of research studies are mixed. Some children get better, some get worse, and some change not at all or very little. Living with Autism A child\ufffds autism diagnosis affects every member of the family in different ways. Parents must now place their primary focus on helping their child with ASD, which may put strains on their marriage, other children, work, finances, and personal relationships and responsibilities. The needs of a child with ASD complicates familial relationships, especially with siblings. However, parents can help their family by informing their other children about autism and the complications it introduces, understanding the challenges siblings face and helping them cope, and involving members of the extended family to create a network of help and understanding. [7] There are many organizations that can provide helpful information about autism. These include: The Sibling Support Project of The Arc of the United States [8], based in Seattle, Washington, offers a range of information on siblings of children with disabilities, including: reading lists for children and adults, information on local sibling group meetings, information on facilitating sibling discussion groups, and online resources. The New Jersey Center for Outreach and Services for the Autism Community (COSAC) [9] matches siblings with pen pals around the country as well as internationally. Online resources are also available. For example, a chat room for siblings of children with disabilities, called \"SibChat,\" meets periodically. While growing up as the sibling of someone with autism can certainly be trying, most siblings cope very well. It is important to remember that while having a sibling with autism or any other disability is a challenge to a child, it is not an insurmountable obstacle. Most children handle the challenge effectively, and many of them respond with love, grace and humor far beyond their years. A final resource to consider for siblings, particularly for those who are experiencing difficulty in adapting to the disability, would be individual counseling. Chances of Developing Autism The prevalence of autism was estimated at 13 per 10,000 in the United States in 2005. [10] Related Problems Seizures: One in four children with autism develops seizures, often starting either in early childhood or adolescence. [11] Seizures, caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, can produce a temporary loss of consciousness (a \ufffdblackout\ufffd), a body convulsion, unusual movements, or staring spells. Sometimes a contributing factor is a lack of sleep or a high fever. An EEG (electroencephalogram\ufffdrecording of the electric currents developed in the brain by means of electrodes applied to the scalp) can help confirm the seizure's presence. In most cases, seizures can be controlled by a number of medicines called anticonvulsants. The dosage of the medication is adjusted carefully so that the least possible amount of medication will be used to be effective. [[Fragile X Syndrome|Fragile X syndrome: This disorder is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. It was so named because one part of the X chromosome has a defective piece that appears pinched and fragile when under a microscope. Fragile X syndrome affects approximately 2% to 5% of people with autism [12] Tuberous Sclerosis: Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain as well as in other vital organs. It has a consistently strong association with autism. Between 1% and 4% of people with autism also have tuberous sclerosis. [13] Clinical Trials A list of clinical trials is available at: Clinical Trials.gov autism trials Research Recently completed studies relating to autism include: Whether galantamine, a medication used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, is an effective treatment modality for childhood autism. [14] Whether divalproex sodium (DS) (a medicine used to treat epilepsy) is an effective treatment for childhood autism. [15] The efficacy of Nambudripad's Allergy Research Foundation procedures (an alternative treatment) in the treatment of autism. [16] Using tongue acupuncture (an alternative treatment) to treat autism. [17] Advanced maternal-grandpaternal age as a possible risk factor for autism [18] Future Research Whether peer interaction training interventions are effective in enhancing the social relationships of children with autism. [19] Whether human immunoglobulin given by mouth twice a day is effective in treating the persistent gastrointestinal (GI) problems such as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and bloating, in children with autism. [20] Whether D-cycloserine is effective in reducing symptoms of autism in autistic children. [21] Identifying factors that distinguish children with autism from children with developmental delay and those with normal development and study the efficacy of intensive behavioral therapy in children with autism. [22] Controversy Vaccines In the past few years, there has been public interest in a theory that suggested a link between measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, and autism. Some have suggested that this was associated with the use of thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative. However thimerosal is no longer found in childhood vaccines in the United States, and was never a component of the UK's MMR vaccine - were the discredited theory originated. Many robust large-scale epidemiological studies have now been done that have failed to show a link between MMR vaccine and autism, and virological studies have also undermined the original research which raised concerns. A panel from the Institute of Medicine is now examining these studies, including a large Danish study that concluded that there was no causal relationship between childhood vaccination using thimerosal-containing vaccines and the development of an autism spectrum disorder [23] Heavy metals and chelation Chelation, the process of administering chemical chelating agents that bind to metals in the body and allow the resulting complex to be eliminated though the liver or kidneys, has become a controversial treatment for autism spectrum disorders. The theory is that chelation will remove the heavy metals that result from environmental exposure or possibly from vaccines. Studies are ongoing, including the following: A U.S. study looking at exposure to mercury, lead, and other heavy metals showed only one elevated (mercury) level which was reduced into the normal range when fish was removed from the child's diet. [24] The National Institutes of Health recently suspended a study involving mercury chelation to treat autism. [25] Expected Outcome For many children, autism symptoms improve with treatment and with age. Some children with autism grow up to lead normal or near-normal lives. Children whose language skills regress early in life, usually before the age of three, appear to be at risk of developing epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity. During adolescence, some children with autism may become depressed or experience behavioral problems. Parents of these children should be ready to adjust treatment for their child as needed. As they mature, some children with autism become more engaged with others and show less marked disturbances in behavior. Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near-normal lives. Others, however, continue to have great difficulty with language or social skills, and the adolescent years can mean a worsening of behavior problems. The majority of children with autism are slow to acquire new knowledge or skills and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with autism have normal to high intelligence. These children learn quickly yet have trouble communicating, applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting in social situations. An extremely small number of children with autism are \"autistic savants\" and have exceptional skills in a specific area, such as art, math or music. History Autism was first identified as a specific disorder in 1943 by child psychiatrist Dr. Leo Kanner (1894-1981). Based on a study of 11 children, Dr. Kanner published the first description of what he called \ufffdAutistic Disturbances of Affective Contact\" (The Nervous Child, New York, 1943, 2: 217-250.) Interesting Facts Famous people There are several celebrities who have children with autism and who have been active and vocal about the condition: Doug Flutie (former professional football player and current college football analyst) has a son with autism and has started an organization: the Doug Flutie, Jr. Foundation for Autism. Actresses Jenny McCartney and Holly Robinson-Peete, who both have sons with autism, have both spoken in public on the subject of autism. McCartney has written a book entitled Louder Than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism.

The games portal can be accessed at: www.whizkidgames.com The site for parents and teachers can be accessed at www.autismgames.com.au WhizKid Games is an online portal that aims to help autistic children develop their independent living skills, focusing on areas such as coping with change, recognising emotions and non-verbal communication. It includes 16 therapeutic games themed around everyday activities such as getting dressed, going to school and following a schedule. In developing WhizKid Games, students were given expert advice by researchers from the Swinburne Autism Bio-Research Initiative (SABRI) and teachers from Bulleen Heights Autism School. According to SABRI director, Associate Professor David Austin, the games will provide a real benefit for children with moderate to severe autism. \ufffdAutistic children can be difficult to engage in traditional educational settings, but most autistic children are very happy to work with a computer. The idea is to capitalise on that and have autism-specific computer-based activities that work for them in building their skills,\ufffd he said. In addition to the WhizKid portal, the Swinburne students created an accompanying site for parents and teachers of autistic children. \ufffdThis portal allows parents and teachers to learn more about the theory behind each game, and how the goals of the games can be supported at home and in school environments,\ufffd Austin said. WhizKid Games, which was created by 80 final year multimedia design students, represents over 16,000 hours of research and development. The site will be officially launched on Tuesday December 8 by the CEO of Autism Victoria, Murray Dawson Smith.

The manual topics are related to stressors that people cope with every day. The sensory modulation section has clear definitions of sensory modulation problems and draws on information from Stanley Greenspan's work with children with autism (Floortime experiences). As an occupational therapist working with school-age clients, I found the worksheets and activities in the module designed to assist children and teenagers to develop good study skills of particular interest. The site offers several practical suggestions for working with sensory modulation issues. My favorite is the sensory path developed by a volunteer working with children with autism. The site provides clear pictures of the path design, as well as of children using the path and of their reactions to the various textures they found along the path. The information provided has suitable precautions regarding children's reactions to various kinds of sensory input. This page would be a good teaching tool for professionals to share with a group when discussing basic concepts regarding sensory modulation. http://www.unc.edu/depts/teacch The University of North Carolina\ufffds Division TEACCH\ufffds website is a wonderful resource for parents, service providers, and teachers involved with autistic or communication handicapped children.

Most infants and young children are very social creatures who need and want contact with others to thrive and grow. They smile, cuddle, laugh, and respond eagerly to games like peek-a-boo or hide-and-seek. Occasionally, however, a child does not interact in this expected manner. Instead, the child seems to exist in his or her own world, a place characterized by repetitive routines, odd and peculiar behaviors, problems in communication, and a total lack of social awareness or interest in others. These are characteristics of a developmental disorder called autism. Autism is usually identified by the time a child is 30 months old. It is often discovered when parents become concerned that their child may be deaf, is not yet talking, resists cuddling, and avoids interaction with others. Some of the early signs and symptoms which suggest a young child may need further evaluation for autism include: no smiling by six months of age no back and forth sharing of sounds, smiles or facial expressions by nine months no babbling, pointing, reaching or waving by 12 months no single words by 16 months no two word phrases by 24 months regression in development any loss of speech, babbling or social skills A preschool age child with classic autism is generally withdrawn, aloof, and fails to respond to other people. Many of these children will not even make eye contact. They may also engage in odd or ritualistic behaviors like rocking, hand flapping, or an obsessive need to maintain order. Many children with autism do not speak at all. Those who do may speak in rhyme, have echolalia (repeating a person's words like an echo), refer to themselves as a he or she, or use peculiar language. The severity of autism varies widely, from mild to severe. Some children are very bright and do well in school, although they have problems with school adjustment. They may be able to live independently when they grow up. Other children with autism function at a much lower level. Mental retardation is commonly associated with autism. Occasionally, a child with autism may display an extraordinary talent in art, music, or another specific area. The cause of autism remains unknown, although current theories indicate a problem with the function or structure of the central nervous system. What we do know, however, is that parents do not cause autism. Children with autism need a comprehensive evaluation and specialized behavioral and educational programs. Some children with autism may also benefit from treatment with medication. Child and adolescent psychiatrists are trained to diagnose autism, and to help families design and implement an appropriate treatment plan. They can also help families cope with the stress which may be associated with having a child with autism. Although there is no cure for autism, appropriate specialized treatment provided early in life can have a positive impact on the child's development and produce an overall reduction in disruptive behaviors and symptoms.

Researchers offered about 933 people aged 13 months to 22 years who had been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder three genetic tests: G-banded karyotype testing, fragile X testing or chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), which has been available only for the past few years. Karyotype tests identified chromosomal aberrations associated with autism in about 2 percent of patients, while the fragile X genetic mutation was found in about 0.5 percent of patients. CMA detected chromosomal abnormalities in slightly more than 7 percent of patients, making it the best available genetic test for autism spectrum disorders, the study authors said. \"The CMA test alone has triple the detection rate of karyotyping or fragile X,\" said co-senior author Bai-Lin Wu, director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston. \"CMA should be added to first-tier genetic testing for autism spectrum disorders.\" The study appeared online March 15 and will be published in the April print issue of Pediatrics. \"When parents have a child diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, one of the first questions they often ask is 'how did this happen?' \" said Dr. Robert Marion, a pediatric geneticist at Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. \"In the vast majority of cases, we believe there is at least a genetic predisposition to autism, but the ability to identify a specific genetic cause has been very elusive,\" Marion said. \"Part of that is because of the technology that's been available. A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\" advertisement<!-- \"000000\"; //--> Standard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said. In karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium. Like karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said. \"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\" While both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted. The main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said. If tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.) But if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said. Still, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those. There are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases. But that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said. \"CMA is better, but it's not great,\" Marion said. \"The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies. That is very frustrating.\" More information The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism. This article: Copyright 2010 HealthDay.

The apparent increase in autism has alarmed parents and stymied scientists searching for a cause. Dr. Philip Landrigan argues in a medical journal that we should look to our environment for answers on autism. He's a professor of pediatrics and community and preventative medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Dr. Landrigan thinks a sustained focus on chemical exposures in the womb could tell us more than genetic studies have. LANDRIGAN: I'll begin by pointing out that there has been some very elegant genetic research done over the past five or ten years that has very successfully identified a number of genes and gene mutations that are responsible for a certain number of cases of autism. All together these genetic causes are responsible for something like 20 or 25 percent of cases. Well, that's very important work and it's very important to know that there are genetic causes, but at the same time those findings leave the causation of something like 75 percent of cases of autism unexplained. YOUNG: So, genetics alone can't explain this, what evidence do we have that environmental exposures might be a cause here? LANDRIGAN: We know from other research on toxic chemicals that the developing human brain is very vulnerable to environmental toxins, we know about lead, we know about mercury, we know about PCBs, we know about certain pesticides, and for each of those chemicals we know that if the developing brain is exposed to the chemical early in development, especially in the early months of pregnancy, that the potential is very high for injury to the developing brain. The second line of evidence I would call proof of principle. And this is the finding that there is a short list of chemicals that have been directly found to be linked to autism. The fact that early life exposure to these drugs can cause autism in certain children says to me that it's possible other drugs, other environmental chemicals might also be responsible for some cases of autism. The structure of the insecticide chlorpyrifos. Until 2001, the chemical was used in homes and other places where children could be exposed. It is still widely used in agriculture. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) YOUNG: Now, also in this list that you have here you have a pesticide, a pretty commonly used pesticide. LANDRIGAN: Yes, well, this is the most recent finding that a particular pesticide known as Clorpirifos, and organophosphate pesticide, is associated with pervasive developmental disorder, which a form of autism. There are more than 100 synthetic chemicals measurable in the bodies of virtually all Americans. So, we know that pregnant women, we know that children are being exposed to these chemicals. The real problem is that we don't know the potential toxicity of 80 percent of these high volume chemicals. In other words, we just no testing has ever been done to determine whether these chemicals are safe or not, and as a pediatrician, I find this very worrisome that we're allowing children to be exposed to chemicals whose possible hazard is simply not known. YOUNG: We should also talk about the focus on vaccines. There's some much attention to vaccines as a possible link to autism. How has that affected the overall field of looking for a real possible cause here? LANDRIGAN: The question of the possible link between vaccines and autism is clearly a question that needed to be addressed. And approximately a dozen high quality studies were launched. It turns out now that not one of them has found any epidemiological connection between vaccines and autism. It's time to begin to look systematically at other potential environmental causes of autism to see if we can find the triggers and then do something about them. Major brain structures implicated in autism (Source: Wikimedia Commons) YOUNG: There's a lot of attention right now on reforming toxic chemical regulation and on increasing scrutiny on certain chemicals of concern. What evidence are you seeing that people are taking autism into account when they do these things? LANDRIGAN: Well, I think people are beginning to connect the dots and realizing that there exists at least the potentiality, at least the possibility, that certain untested chemicals that are in children's environments may be contributing to neuro-behavioral problems in children and the possibility exists that autism is among those. The chemicals that I would put at the top of my list of suspicion are chemicals that fulfill two criteria: number one, they're widely distributed in children's environments, or the environments of pregnant women; and number two, there are chemicals where we already have some suspicion from experimental studies or from studies in adult workers exposed occupationally that these chemicals are neurotoxic. YOUNG: You know, in a way this is pretty scary because the upshot of what you're suggesting here is that there are exposures that in many cases may be well beyond our control that may determine whether or not our child is autistic, but on the other hand, it also implies we can figure this out and do something about it. LANDRIGAN: Yes, at the end of the day, I think the message here is fundamentally optimistic. I strongly believe that for 500 years knowledge has guided medicine, evidence has guided prevention, and time and again we have shown as a society that when we understand the causes of disease we can take action to prevent it.
