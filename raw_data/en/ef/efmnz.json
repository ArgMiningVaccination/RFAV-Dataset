This article describes the results of a qualitative study of the e\u00a1ects of traditional cleansing ceremonies for girl soldiers who are survivors of rape in Sierra Leone. The principal research question asked how these puri\u00a2cation rituals contribute to psychosocial healing and reintegration. T wo overarching themes emerged from the data. First, cleansing ceremonies represented a symbolic gesture of communityreconciliation in which both the girls and the community had prescribed roles and demonstrated a willingness and desire to be reconciled. Second, cleansing ceremonies allowed for a spiritual transformation in which the girls were able to shed their contamination and leave behind the 'bad luck' , anti-social behaviour and negative self-perceptionsthat they had brought back with them from the war. Both of these aspects of the cleansing ceremony have contributed to the girls' improved psychosocial health and have facilitated reintegration. Keywords: psychosocial healing, cleansing, girls, reconciliation, reintegration, Sierra Leone Introduction Complexemergenciesoftenexposeandleavevulnerable those a\u00a1ected to life-threateningsocial and psychological dislocations (Ager, 2002). In humanitarian responses, interven- tionsaddressingpsychologicalandsocialfac- tors have become increasingly common. However, controversy remains over what type of intervention ismoste\u00a1ective. Propo- nents of psychosocial interventions tend to fall into one of two paradigms. The \u00a2rst paradigm (one that has, until recently, tendedto dominate approaches and interventionsinAfrica)supportsthemedica- lization of su\u00a1ering, exporting Westernpsychological and biomedical diagnoses and treatments (Summer\u00a2eld,1999). This model is based on the Western understanding of traumaandhealing.Itemphasizesdiagnosing andtreating symptoms within an individual, and tends to disregard mending damaged socialnetworksorstrengtheningpre-existing resources in communities that could aid in thehealingprocess(Miller&Rasco,2004).Thesecondparadigm(which isbasedonthe assumption that psychological distress has a social and cultural dimension)draws on community resources and supports local coping strategies (Wessells & Monteiro, 2004). According to this paradigm, it is through spiritualunderstanding that people can \u00a2nd meaning and restore wellbeing in their lives after traumatic experiences.

In Sierra Leone, girls associated with the \u00a2ghting forces were largely overlooked in the demobilization process. These girls wit- nessed the murder of family members, had theirhomesburnedtotheground,wereforci- bly separated from their families, and suf-fered repeated rape and sexual violence at the hands of their captors. Many were not released by their abductors after the war, or failed to come forward out of shame or fear. Additionally, a large number of these girls now have children of their own as a result of rape. Thesegirlsandyoungwomenemergedfrom the war with both physical and emotionalwounds.They reported feelings of hopeless- ness, worthlessness and despair. Reinte- gration has proven extremely dicult and hasexacerbatedthesewounds.Theirfamilies andcommunities, who saw them as'impure' as a result of the sexual abuse, stigmatized the girls. They were exposed to ridicule for prostituting themselves to support their babies. They were verbally and physically attacked, restricted from mingling with family andcommunity, and prohibited frommarrying. Their spiritual pollution was believed to cause misfortune, bad harvests and health problems for both the girls and thebroader community. In the context of relationshipsbetween indi- viduals and their surroundings, their ances- tors, and amongst themselves,'the power of ''spiritual''entitiesremainsparamountinboth the causation of trauma and in community-based approaches to healing.' (Honwana, 1997). It is through spiritual understanding that people can \u00a2nd meaning and restore wellbeing in their lives. In this article, thehealthimpactofcleansingceremoniesongirlswhowere sexually violatedduringthewar in Sierra Leone is examined and analyzed in termsofphysical,mental,spiritualandsocial health,andreintegration. Traditional healing ceremonies have been lauded as an e\u00a1ective and integral aspect of psychosocialhealingandreintegration.While the process varies in di\u00a1erent communities, there are elements that are common to most of the cleansings. One traditional healerdescribedtheprocessinthefollowingway: 'The way I saw the girls, I knew I should cleanse them before their minds were set. I went to the ancestors and asked them how to help the girls. The ancestors instructed me in how to cleanse them. I went to the bush to fetch the herbs for the cleansing. I knew which herbs to pick becausethe ancestors had told me. I put the herbs in a pot and boiled them. I poured a libation on theground and also drank some of it. After boiling the herbs, I steamed the girls under blankets and over the boiling pot for their bodies to become clean and their minds to become steady. After the steaming, we all slept in the house.The next morning we all went to the bush. In the bush, Igave them herbs to drink.W e spent the day cooking, singing, eating,and tellingstories. On the third day, I brought the girls to the waterside. I told them that they would not go back to town wearing the clothes that they had worn to the riverside. I washed the girls one by one with black soap and herbs. After the wash- ing, they put on new clothing and we all came to town dancing and singing. ' Most of the cleansings contained similarelements. Almost all ended with traditionalhealers leading the girls into town and pre- senting them to the chief. After this presen- tation, the community would hold a large celebration with music, dancing and a com- munal feast.

Methodology This qualitative study draws on semi-struc-tured interviews as its main source of data, with participant observation and \u00a2eld notes providingadditionalcontextualdetail.From May through August 2005, the author inter- viewed 121 girls ranging in age from 8 to 30 years oldand17 traditional healers in \u00a2ve districts in Sierra Leone. The data for this paper comes from a sample of 25 interviews with girls from the Port Loko, T onkalili, Bombali, and Koinadugu districts. Inaddition, the author was invited to observe two cleansing ceremonies, which provided further data andalso informedthe analysis. Sample.Girlswereselectedforthisstudybased onconvenienceandcriterionsampling.Allofthegirlsinthestudy wereassociatedwiththe armed con\u00a3ict rape. Children's Fund (CCF)has insti- tuted a program called 'Sealing the Past,Facing the Future' speci\u00a2cally targeting this population, and girls were identi\u00a2ed and invited to participate based on their involve- ment in the program. Because of the unique situation of these girls, CCF has embraced a holistic approach to respond to the girls' physical, emotional, social, spiritual and economic needs. The project has provided assistancethroughtreatmentofsexuallytrans- mitted diseases, raising community aware- ness, supporting economic development andsponsoring traditional healing ceremonies. Many of the girls interviewed had been cleansed by a family member, a traditional healerorthroughCCF-sponsoredcleansings. Fourofthegirlsinthissamplehadneverbeen cleansedandserveasacomparisongroup. While convenience sampling worked well overall, it did raise a few validity concerns and is one limitation of this study. CCFcom-munity leaders were responsible for selecting girls for interview. It sometimes happened that these community leaders were eager to impressandpickedgirlswhohadmostsuccess- fullyreintegrated,andwerementallyandphy- sically well. In some communities, where the communityleaders were more open and had a good relationship withthe translator, it felt comfortable trying to persuade them to \u00a2nd girls with more diverse experiences. At other times,itwasfeltthattodothiswouldhavebeeninappropriate and would have o\u00a1ended the communityleader. The girls ranged in their levels of education fromhavinghadnoschoolingatall,tohaving completed some secondary school. As a result, verbal, rather than written, consent wassoughtandobtained.Throughatransla- tor,thegirlswereinformedthatparticipation was entirely voluntary and that they couldrefrain from answering any questions they chose, as well as terminating the interview at any point. CCF decided that incentives werenotappropriateforthissetting,because the girls were already receiving substantial bene\u00a2ts from the program. However, it was emphasized that choosing not to participate in the study would in no way a\u00a1ect their accessto other programbene\u00a2ts. While CCFdetermined that identifyingand interviewing these girls was not a securityrisk,theinterviewsweresometimesemotion- ally upsetting for the girls. Some cried while recounting what had happened to them during and after the war. A few girls agreed to the interview, but then did not want to answer any questions once the interview began. For the most part, however, the girls wanted to share their stories, have someone bear witnesstowhat had happenedto them,and to make sure that it does not happen again.Somegirlswaitedforhours,foregoing farm work and daily pro\u00a2ts, because they wantedto share their stories.Cleansing the wounds of war: an examination of traditional healing, psychosocial health and reintegration in Sierra Leone Intervention 2006, V olume 4, Number 3, Page 206 ^ 218 208Copyright \u00a9 War Trauma Foundation.

Because they were not professional translators, but had been selected by CCF based on their language skills, the translators tended to make some common translation errors during the interviews, which may haveskewed the data to make the cleansings appear more signi\u00a2cant than they were. Sometimes,thetranslatoraskedtheintervie- wee leading questions because they knew the type of information that was being sought. Often, translators changed open- ended questions to close-ended questions. For example, one translator shared that he had rephrased the question'How did peoplein your community treat you when you returned?' to 'People provoked you when you came back, didn't they?' A few times, translators interjected their own questions that were sometimes relevant to the \u00a2eld of research, sometimes not. It was critical that the girls felt they could open up to the translator, as well as to the author. Since two of the translators were men, questions as to the extent to which the girls felt comfortable revealing intimatepersonal and sexual details to them were raised.There were also a few instances when the translator did not speak the local dialect and an additional translator was needed. In these cases, we had to rely on a community leader who lived in the village. However, when such a person was in the room, girls seemedtocon\u00a2deless,especiallywithregard totheirowninvolvementinthewarasperpe-trators, not just victims. For example, many of the girls carried weapons, took drugs, and killed. However, if a community leader wasintheroom,thegirlstendednottosharethis sensitive information and focusedinstead on the rape and abuse that was in\u00a3icteduponthem. Analysis .Throughout the process of conduct- ing the interviews, the author was consciousofafewthemesandpatternsemergingbefore beginning the formal analysis. For example, stigmaandridiculeweretopicsthatwereoften mentionedintheinterviews,andthatthecon- ceptof ' noro'or spiritualpollutionwas related toanumberofsocialandhealthproblems.In undertakingtheformalanalysisoftheseinter- views, the process of open coding 1was used to uncover, name and develop these and otherconceptsthathadoriginallystrucktheauthor asimportant.Thepropertiesanddimensions of these initial categories were identi\u00a2ed and comparedforsimilaritiesanddi\u00a1erences. 2 The next step was to return to the originalresearchquestionandcondenseandorganizethe categories under a few main concepts. These concepts:'war experience','cleansing', 'psychosocial health', and 'reintegration', emergeddirectly of coding, the concept 'war experience' referred to the age of the girl when she was abducted, the amount of time she spent with the rebels, her main roles and responsibilities while with the rebels, strategies for survival, and how she even- tuallycametoleavetherebelgroup.'Psycho-social health' combined psychological and social health and included emotional state and feelings, a girl's perception of herself, her relationship with the spiritual world and her social relationships with family and community members. 'Reintegration' referred to the long-term process and tran- sition where female child soldiers returned tocivilianlife.'Cleansing'referredtowhetheror not a girl had been cleansed, how many times, under what circumstances, for how long,towhatdegree,andwithwhatelements hadthe girlsbeencleansed.Lindsay Stark 209Copyright \u00a9 War Trauma Foundation.

Major impacts included 'mental health' ^ theemotional and self per- ceptions of the girls; 'social relationships' ^ relationships and interactions with family andcommunitymembers;' ^ theconcept of spiritual pollution and the girls because of rape; and'func- tionality' ^ the ability to perform expectedsocial roles. In\u00a3uencing factors included 'war roles and with rebels', 'who cleansed the girls', 'who decided the girls should be cleansed','what happened during the cleansing'and'reasons articulated for the cleansing.'Figure1shows anexample of one of the data displays. Results and discussion Thedatadisplaysallowedexaminationoftheeach girl's personal narrative, as well as allowing a comparison along these di\u00a1erent variables. Utilizing these displays, certainpatterns became evident, helping to better understand the full range of experiences and di\u00a1erent degrees to which the girls experienced these variables. For example, every girl in the sample experienced dis- crimination from the community upon returning from the bush. There were no exceptions.Thispatternwasalmostimmedi- ately apparent from the data display. How- ever, in examining the display, the author was also able to analyze the full range anddegree to which each girl encountered dis- crimination.Thisallowedforaricherunder- standing of the girls'experiences, as well as ananalysis of factorsthatmayhave a\u00a1ected, or in\u00a3uencedcommunity relations. Thisdisplayalsoallowedforidenti\u00a2cationof unusual cases that fell outside of the'typical' experience. For example, while nearly all of the girls were able to reconcile with familyand friends after the cleansing ceremonies, one of the girls, Mabinti, still su\u00a1ered from mistreatmentbyherstepmother. Identifying these unusual cases can be just as revealing as identifying the common experiences, and shouldbeexaminedforpotentialin\u00a3uencing factors. For example, one thing that stood outas di\u00a1erent in Mabinti'scasewasthe fact that her stepmother had not supported the cleansing.This\u00a2ndingcouldhaveimportant implicationsifsuchaprogramwastobeinsti-tuted in a less receptive community. Two overarching themes emerge from the data.First,cleansingceremoniesrepresented asymbolicgesture ofcommunityreconciliation. Second, cleansing ceremonies allowed for aspiritual transformation . Both of these aspects of the cleansing ceremonies have a\u00a1ectedgirls'psychosocial health and reintegration, andare discussed in more detailbelow. Reconciliation with families and communities Relationships with family and community members were frequently discussed topics among the girls. As mentioned above, not one of the girls in the sample was able to return to her village without experiencing some stigmatization, provocation or rejec- tion from family or community members. Often their reception was mixed. Parents welcomedtheirdaughterhome,butthecom- munity rejected the girl. Or, parents would shunthegirlanditwouldbelefttothelarger community to show empathy and caring.Mixedemotions withinthe family unit were also frequently noted in the matrix. Parents were happy to have their daughter home, but also fearedthem. Almost half of thegirls in the sample mentioned that their family initially welcomed them, cried with happi- ness upon their return, and tried to help by providing food, clothing, and medicine. However, the same number of girls reportedCleansing the wounds of war: an examination of traditional healing, psychosocial health and reintegration in Sierra Leone Intervention 2006, V olume 4, Number 3, Page 206 ^ 218 210Copyright \u00a9 War Trauma Foundation.

The rest of the community laughed at me and called me a 'rebel from the bush'. When we came into town, the community welcomed us. They were happy with me. They stopped teasing me and calling me names. Since the rebels 'used' me , I needed to be cleansed.The first thing I do in the morning is wash my face. Then I greet my family, sweep, fetch water for the family, bathe, go to school, come home and do the cooking, wash the dishes, fetch more water, bathe, then go to sleep. AminataI felt bad during this time because I had left the rebels and was not used to life here in the village. After this, I felt different. I felt lively. When I met my mother and family, they were not happy with me. They thought I was coming to kill them. Some people in the community called me names like 'rebel' and 'killer', but most were nice to me. Everyone was scared of me, though. Anywhere I went, people shouted at me . They would say 'leave this place, you rebel'. My parents also felt differently. They felt better because I did not return to the rebels. We came to town dancing and singing. Everyone came and we all ate food. My bad luck was also affecting my family. People would provoke my mom that she had 'birthed a rebel'. They would say she had a rebel in her house. The bad luck also affected our rice farming. The whole community did not get good yields during that time. The bad luck also affected my chance to go to school. Since the cleansing, there have been great changes. Now, my family is getting good yields on the farm. My mom bakes bread and gets money. Before, the town was sparsely populated. Now there are more people. Now I get to go to school and the name calling has stopped. Now I get to go to school JeriatuI was feeling bad. My mind was not right because of all of the names I was called. It was not my wish for them to call me these names and I felt so bad. My family was glad to see Now I feel happy. me, but other people were not glad. They called me 'rebel' and were not happy with me. Anywhere I went, people were not happy with me. If I hadn't been cleansed, I would still have bad luck. People would have continued to call me bad names After the cleansing, there were changes. I was not a rebel anymore. I did not have bad luck anymore...If I hadn't been cleansed, I would still have bad luck. People would have continued to call me bad names and I would have no appetite and be very unhappy. Now I feel happy and my business is flourishing. I am in school now. MariatuAfter the cleansing it was different. I was normal. When I saw my parents, they cried because I had been captured and raped. They were afraid of me and felt I had joined the rebels. The rest of the community was not afraid of me. I wanted to be cleansed to wash away the rebel bad luck. I really felt that the medicine removed the bad luck I had had. I am going to school, though, and that makes me feel good about myself. FatmataWhen I came back from the bush, my parents hugged me, but other people weren't happy. They mocked my parents and me. They were very few people in the town at that time and they were not happy. They said that I was captured due to my carelessness. My parents defended me. They said they would cleanse me because of my bad luck. My bad luck came from being used by several men. My bad luck showed itself in different ways. For example, it was hard for me to realize a profit. I lost money. I felt that the part of the 3 days that was the key to my healing was the washing by the stream. I could feel the bad luck leaving me...My luck has improved. Now I am earning money and have better clothing. It was hard for me to realize a profit. I lost money. Now I am earning money and have better clothing.

INFLUENCING FACTORS Reasons Who decided Who cleansed Time w/ Rebels War roles SafanatuI cooked, carried loads, and served as a wife to one rebel. My parents decided I should be washed The ndigbas (traditional healer) cleansed me. I was with them for 2 years and I agreed I also wanted to be cleansed because of what happened with the rebels. Since the rebels 'used' me, I needed to be cleansed. AminataI looted, burned houses, killed people, and was a wife to one man. I was with them for 2 years and 2 months. The sowi/ndigba (traditional healer) gave us medicine (herbs) and w e played, sang, and ate. Karimoko/Moriman (traditional healer)My parents took me to a Karim oko/ Moriman (traditional healer) so that theycould make a sacrifice so that I wouldnot return to the rebels again... I decided to get cleansed [with CCF] and m y parents supported this decision since I had killed people.My parents took me to a Karim oko/Moriman (traditional healer) so that they could make asacrifice so that I would not return to therebels again. They did it to change m y mind. I wanted to be cleansed to wipe out m y bad luck from the killing, rapes, and burning inthe bush. JeriatuI was raped...and cooked for them. I decided to be cleansed and my parents I was with them for 3 months supported me. [The cleansing] made the com munity happy. It was important because when I got back from the bush, I wasn 't feeling happy and I was bored. I wanted to be cleansed to take away the bad luck. I had lost my virginity to someone I did not like at all when I was raped. A lso, my business was not good and phy sically I was not fine. My bad luck affected my family because I slept in the same bed as my mo ther. Her business was also not going w ell and she was stigmatized for sharing a bed with a rebel. MariatuI cooked for the rebels. When they looted villages, they gave the loads to me to carry. I also laundered for them. I was a wife to one rebel. I wanted to be cleansed to wash away the rebel the ndigbas (traditional healer) I was only with them a short time bad luck. FatmataI was abducted and used as a woman. They said they would cleanse m e because of my I was with the rebels for 2 months bad luck.

Relationshipswereoftendiscussedinconjunc- tion with emotional states, suggesting that these categories in\u00a3uencedone another. Pro- vocationandstigmatizationoftencontributed to the girls'negative emotional states. AsJer- iatu described,' I was feeling bad. My mind was not right because of all of the names I was called. Itwas not my wish for them to call me these names and If e l ts ob a d .' Throughout Jeriatu's narrative, sheattributedthemaincauseofhersu\u00a1ering, and her primary reason for the cleansing, to the provocation and rejection from the com- munity. She was not alone. Half of the girls interviewed expressed poor community relationsasareasonforcleansing. When examining how the cleansings aided reconciliation, the data reveal how the com- munity and the girls each played an import-ant part. Community members organized, \u00a2nanced and performed the cleansings. These acts were perceived as signs of caring and concern. Caring was also expressed in family members' decisions to have their daughters, granddaughters and nieces cleansed. For these girls who hadbeen deva- lued,madetofeel'inhuman'andwhohadsur- vived months or years of abuse, this gesture wasrecognizedassomethingthecommunity wasdoingtohelpthemAsonegirlexplained,'My mother said ''I will make you feel better again,'' and took me to a traditional healer .' (Damba). The girls either agreed to enter into the cleansing process, or made the decision themselves. The data display (Figure 1) reveals that for two thirds of the girls, their familiesdecidedthattheyshouldbecleansed. One third of the girls made the decision to be cleansed themselves, and were supportedby their family and other community mem- bers.Thedataseemtosupportthehypothesis thatwhoactuallydecideswhetherthecleans- ings should occur is less important thanwhether or not the decision is supported byboth parties. As mentioned above, Mabinti's was the only case where a family member actively opposed the cleansing, and her cleansing was less e\u00a1ective than the others. She explained,' Idon't like [my current situation] at all. Iam upset. Now in the house, Iam treated likean extra somebody. Only my neighbours care for me. I go to school hungry .' Inadditiontothewillingnessofthegirlsandfamily support for cleansings, a few otheraspects appear to have been critical in the reconciliation process. First is the act of touch. During the two cleansings that the author observed, it was particularly moving the way inwhichthe traditional healers laid their hands on the girls during the washing. It is dicult to convey the emotion and car- ingthattheseeldersexhibitedwhenhandling the girls. They caressed, massaged andprayedoverthesegirlswhosecleansingswere necessitated because of such a di\u00a1erent kind of touch ^ rape.That the traditional healers were so gentle and caring and that the girls were able to receive this act of com- passionwasamanifestationofreconciliation and healing, in and of itself. Thecleansingceremoniesalsoculminatedin a ceremonial gesture of reconciliation. Heal- ers brought the girls from the bush into the village in celebratory fashion and 'reintro-duced' them to the chief and to the rest of the community. Celebrations ensued with singing, dancing and a feast. As Aminata described, 'we came to town dancing and singing.Everyonecameandweallatefood.' InWestAfrica,thisactofsharingacommunal mealis,perhaps, thecriticalgestureofreconci- liation.InSierraLeone,familymealsarecom-monly eaten o\u00a1 of one plate or out of onebowl. For a family member to be excluded is grave. Indeed, there were multiple instances beforethecleansingwhenfamiliesdidnotpro- vide girlswith foodorallow themto eat withLindsay Stark 213Copyright \u00a9 Trauma Foundation. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.the family. For example, Esther noted, ' the welcome from [my family] was very poor . Since I wascapturedbytherebels,myfamilysaidIwasarebel. They refused togive mefood .' The ceremonial act of eating together afterthe cleansing was a signthatthecommunity was now ready to accept these girls as com- plete andviable members of the community. Girls noted the change. Safanatu shared: 'When we came into town, the community welcomed us.They were happy with me.They stopped teasing me and calling me names .' Isatu had a similar experience: ' after the cleansing, the community was nice to me and treated me well.The cleansing was to help me feel better and to help the community accept me... I do not feel excluded and everywhere I go, people like me .' Overwhelmingly, the girls had similar responses of being accepted andembraced by family and community mem- bersthat previouslyhadneglectedorabusedthem. Only Mabinti complained that her stepmother was still treating her poorly. Everyone else reported positive changes in relationships and felt reconciled with the community. Reconciliation and improved relations also positively in\u00a3uenced the emotional state of the girls. In examining the connection between community acceptance and mental state, Esther put it wellwhen she said:' Is e em y family now. After the cleansing, they welcomed me. Myfamilyismoreinterestedinme.Ifeelhappybecause we are one with the rest of the community .'Fatmata sharedhersentiment:' Ifelt reliefbecause I hadn't been mixing with my friends, but after the cleansing they started to embrace me.This provided me much relief.' These acts of reconciliation that came out of the cleansing process appear to be amajorfactorinimprovedpsychosocialhealth. Spiritual transformation and renewal Another major theme that emerged fromthe data was how cleansing ceremonies are amechanism for spiritualtransformation.Two thirdsofthegirlsinthesampledescribedhav- ing 'noro', which translates most closely with spiritual contamination, or bad luck. Thiswas attributed to having been raped during thewar.AsFatmatadescribed:' Mybadluckcame from being used by several men .'Cleansings have beenusedinthesecommunitiesforrapefrom before the war as well. As Sarran explained: 'Ifa woman is raped on afarm, thefood will spoil. So you havetoo\u00a1era sacri\u00a2cetotheancestorsonthefarm and cleanse the girl on the farm .... If a girl is raped by the waterside, you must o\u00a1era sacri\u00a2cebecause theplace is polluted and not \u00a2ne .'Inthewartime con- text, bad luck was also attributed to havingcommitted atrocities. Isatu described:' When I was in thebush, allofthethingsthathappened werelikedirt.Iwascleansedtoremovethedirtandallthose bad thingsfrom me .' The spiritual contamination a\u00a1ected almost every aspect of the girls' lives. Girls felt that bad luck a\u00a1ected their relationships, includ- ing their ability to get married, or \u00a2nd love. Isatuclaimed:' Becauseofmybadluck,Iwasunable toget married .'Noroalsowaslinkedtobadbeha- viour and an inability to function within society. Manyofthe girls described how they were unable to earn an income before the cleansing. Isatu noted:' If we tried to undertake business ventures, we wouldn't be successful ...if we tried to doanything, we wouldn't besuccessful .' Spiritual pollution was also strongly linked to negative emotional states and self- perceptions. Aminta admitted that because of her contamination she' felt inferior compared to the girls around me. I felt inhuman .' Fatmata shared a similar sentiment;' If e l tu n \u00a2 tt ob ei n the community .... I felt inferior .' The girls'con- tamination caused them to feel isolated and separate from the rest of the community,andunabletobe apartof communitylife. In addition to a\u00a1ecting the girls, their spiritual contamination also a\u00a1ected family members and the wider community.Cleansing the wounds of war: an examination of traditional healing, psychosocial health and reintegration in Sierra Leone Intervention 2006, V olume 4, Number 3, Page 206 ^ 218 214Copyright \u00a9 War Trauma Foundation. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.Aminataexplained:' mybadluckwasa\u00a1ectingmy family. People would provoke my mom that she had birthed a rebel ...The bad luck also a\u00a1ected our rice farming.Thewholecommunitydidnotgetgoodyieldsduring that time .'Jeriatu also felt her bad luck extended to family. She noted: ' my bad luck a\u00a1ected my family because I slept in the same bed as my mother. Her business was not going well and she was stigmatized for sharing a bed with a rebel .' The bad luck and spiritual pollution thata\u00a1ected the girls and their families was oneof the main reasons articulated for going through the cleansing ceremony. Almost every girl mentioned that they needed to be cleansedto get ridof the' noro.' In examining the data, it is evident that cer-tain elements of the cleansing ceremony represented a symbolic break from the past and enabled the girls to leave their bad luck behind. The act of washing, for example,appeared to be a baptism of sorts in which the spiritual pollution \u00a3owed away from the girls. Fatmata shared: ' I felt that the part of the three days that was the key to my healing wasthe washing by the stream. I could feel the bad luck leaving me .'A s Isatu put it; ' During the cleansing, Ifeltmyguiltleaveme .'Whilethehealerswashed the girls, they prayed over them and scrubbed their bodies with traditional black soap, ash and herbs. In addition, healers performed specialceremoniestoensurethatthewashingwould be successful. One healer explained how she spread out a mat by the waterside and lit a candle. One by one, she called the girls over tothemat.Whenagirlsatonthemat,shetook some rice in her hand andbrought out a live chicken.Shethensaidtoherself:' Ifthebad luck thatIamgoingtowashawayfromthisgirlwillwork,the chicken will eat the rice. If the chicken doesn'teat the rice, the cleansing will not work .' These ritual acts assured the healers, girls and thecommunitythatthespiritualtransformation wouldbe successful.Finally,thefactthatthegirlsleftbehindtheirold clothing at the waterside and came to town in new attire symbolized the spiritual metamorphosis that they had undergone. The sheddingof oldclothing was a symbolic break from the spiritual pollution and so the girls came to town with new opportu- nities.Whenthe girls describedthe e\u00a1ects of thecleansing,theyoftenusedtransformative language, speaking as if they had become someone or something di\u00a1erent that theywere before. Jeriatu said: ' after the cleansing, there were changes. I was not a rebel an ymore.' Fatmata described a similar transformation; 'before the cleansing, whatever I touched of my sib- lings, they would say, ''Don't touch that. Y ou're arebel!''NowwhateverItouchisOK .'Estheralsofelt the change. She claimed:' I was happy that day because they had removed the bad luck. I felt di\u00a1erent .... I was normal .' In this way, the cleansing was anactof rebirth and renewal. The girls credited their spiritual transform- ation to many of the changes that occurred after the cleansing. 3The girls frequently mentioned improved social relations,emotional states, and superior social func- tioning,andcreditedthesechangestothefact that their bad luck had left them. Aminata shared how her spiritual transformation improved her socialrelations:' Isaw di\u00a1erences and changesafterthecleansing. Before, when Iasked people a question, I would get no response. After , people would respond to me. Even my dad sent a message that he is coming to me. He talks to me now.'Jeriatualsomade aconnectionbetween her luck andthe lackof stigma andprovoca-tion in her social interactions. She shared:' If I hadn't been cleansed, I would still have bad luck.People would have continued to call me bad names. ' She wentonto add;' I would also have no appetite and been very unhappy ,'thus linking her puri\u00a2- cationto her improvedemotional state.Many of the other girls also noted improved self-perceptions and emotional statesLindsay Stark 215Copyright \u00a9 War Trauma Foundation.

Aminata stated: ' after the cleansing it was di\u00a1erent. I was normal .' Girls noted that after the cleansing they stopped thinking about the past and felt 'one with the com- munity'and 'like everyone else,'a sentiment that was clearlyabsentbefore the cleansing. Loss of ' noro' is also strongly associated with improved functioning. Girls credited their schooling and economic successes to their newfound good luck and cleansing. Fatmata said:'myluckhasimproved.NowIamearningmoney .' Isatuagreed:' Thingshavechangedsincethecleans- in them-selvestothislossof ' noro' .Isatuexplained:' Iam not behaving in the same way that I used to behave.At \u00a2rst I would abuse people and threaten them whenIwasmocked,likewithaknife.Iamnotbehavinglike thatanymore .'Mariatuhadsimilarexperiences; 'Ifeltgood after the cleansing. Iabstained from drugs and that feltgood. I behaved like a goodgirl .' By r id- ding themselves of their spiritual pollution,the girls were able to take up socially accept- able roles that they had not previously been ableto\u00a2ll,andthrive. Finally, many of the girls believed that the luck improved for family and community members at large after the cleansings.Aminata said:' since the cleansing, there have been great changes. Now, my family is getting good yieldson the farm. My mom bakes bread and gets money. Before, the town was sparsely populated. Now there are more people .' The data reveal that across the board, girlsbelieved that they and their families were bene\u00a2ting from good luck as a result of the cleansings. There were no exceptions. Inbeginning the analysis, the author had hypothesized that the extent to which one's luck improved might be associated with the length of time a girl was with the rebels andher roles during the war. However, the datadidnot showthistobethecase, andthegirl's spoke of their spiritual contamination and subsequentluckinsimilarwayswhetherthey had killed and spent years with the rebels, orhadsurvivedrapeandlivedwiththerebels for onlya few weeks. Onesurprising\u00a2ndingthatthedatarevealed was that the girls believe that additional cleansings would be bene\u00a2cial and further improve their luck. As Fatmata said;' I believe in the washingand think if it was repeated, it would be a good addition .' Isatu reiterated this senti- ment, saying:' I would like to get cleansed again to get more power .' This interest in additional cleansings merits further investigation todetermine if and how additional cleansings wouldfurtherbene\u00a2tthegirls.Itisalsoworth noting that the girls who had not gone through any cleansing still felt that theirspiritual contamination was a\u00a1ecting them. Miattaworried:' If Iam not cleansed, thebad luck willrunafterme.Iwillnotpro\u00a2tfromanythingItry .' Conclusions and questions for further research T odate,therehavebeenfewformalstudiesof community-based approaches to psycho- socialhealinginresource-poorsettings.Cul- tural apply Western models 'o\u00a1 the shelf,'and attempts to use Western methods exclusively can silence local knowledge, block the recovery oftraditionalmethods,andpromotepsycho- logical imperialism.'

As spiritual degradation and the lack of community reconciliation are oftenprimary sources of stress, these dimen- sions must be incorporated into de\u00a2nitions of,andprogramsfor,psychosocialassistance. Community-based studies such as this one haveotherimportantimplicationsforhuman- itarian aid organizations. Because they arescalable, these types of interventions allow more community members to receive treat- ment thanWestern models that tend to focus on one-on-one interventions. They also sup- port local knowledge and put the power in thehandsofparaprofessionalsandlocalheal- ers.Mostimportantly,theyappeartobee\u00a1ec- tive in mitigating psychosocial trauma and fostering community reconciliation. Whilethisstudyo\u00a1ersapreliminarylookatonepro- gram,itseemstosupporttherecentliterature that argues for more culturally appropriate andcommunity-basedinterventions. This studyalsoraisesanumberofadditional questions for future research. One question, for example, is whether strengthening traditionalsystemslikecleansingceremonies might have the unintended consequence of alsostrengtheningharmfultraditionalprac- tices such as female circumcision. In manycommunities, the healers who cleansed the girls were also responsible for female initiation that includes circumcision. It is possible that empowering these healers has raisedtheir pro\u00a2le inthe community to per- form other traditional ceremonies. It is vital forinternationalorganizationstoahaveafull understanding of the e\u00a1ects of supporting these local traditions. Another questionthatthis study raises is how these girls will fare in the long run. T o date, no longitudinal research examining life outcomes of female former child soldiers has been undertaken.Such studies would be bene\u00a2cial. Finally, itwould be worthwhile to attempt to replicate the \u00a2ndings of this study in other psycho- socialprograms aroundthe world. While many unanswered questions remain, this study seems to point in a positive direc- tion.The large majority of girls interviewed arefeelinghappy.Theyarein school, orrun- ning their own businesses. They have been acceptedbackintotheirfamiliesandarecon- sidered viable members of their commu-nities. Like the name of the program that CCF started for them, these girls have been successfully able to seal the past and are now ready to face the future. References Ager, A. (2002).
