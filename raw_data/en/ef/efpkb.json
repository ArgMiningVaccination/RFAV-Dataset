Enjoy them raw and shredded in a salad or roasted with a drizzle of olive oil. You can purchase a fresh Brussels sprout stalk, which hosts small heads neatly aligned side by side in rows, or you can buy a bag of loose sprouts, fresh or frozen. Brussels sprouts are a cruciferous vegetable that is low in carbohydrates with lots of filling fiber. Many Brussels sprouts recipes call for bacon, butter, or maple syrup, quickly racking up the saturated fat and sugar content. Be mindful of your preparation to get the maximum benefits from this nutritional powerhouse. Brussels Sprouts Nutrition Facts One cup of boiled Brussels sprouts (156g) provides 56 calories, 4g of protein, 11g of carbohydrates, and 0.8g of fat. Brussels sprouts are an excellent source of fiber, vitamin C, and vitamin K. The following nutrition information is provided by the of carbohydrates in a cup of cooked Brussels sprouts, a little over 4 grams are from fiber. Fiber is an indigestible carbohydrate that helps keep you full, reduces cholesterol, regulates bowels, and helps stabilize blood sugar. Brussels sprouts have a low glycemic index, so they are a good choice for those on a low-carb diet or anyone who is watching their blood sugar. Fats Brussels sprouts contain negligible amounts of fat with a greater percentage coming from unsaturated fats than saturated fats. Protein With about 4 grams of protein per 1 cup cooked, Brussels sprouts are a decent source of plant-based protein, especially if you have multiple servings. However, Brussels sprouts are not a complete source of all the essential amino acids, so it is important to eat a variety of protein sources rather than relying on Brussels sprouts alone. Vitamins and Minerals Brussels sprouts are a source of the B-vitamins necessary for cellular energy production, including vitamin B6, thiamine, and folate. Brussels sprouts contain 24% of the daily recommended amount of vitamin A, which is important for eyes and immunity. Brussels sprouts are an excellent source of vitamin C and vitamin K, providing over 100% of your daily value of each based on a 2,000 calorie per day diet. Vitamin K is linked to heart health and longevity and is responsible for blood clotting. Brussels sprouts also contain manganese, which helps with metabolizing carbohydrates, amino acids, and cholesterol. Summary Brussels sprouts are very nutrient dense, providing over 100% of your daily value for vitamins C and K in a low-calorie, nearly fat-free package. They are also high in fiber, potassium, manganese, magnesium, and vitamin A. Brussels Sprouts Calories One cup of boiled Brussels sprouts (156g) provides 56 calories, 65% of which come from carbs, 23% from protein, and 12% from fat. In 100g of brussels sprouts, there are 36 calories. This is how other green vegetables compare per 100g: Green beans: 31 calories Broccoli: 34 calories Spinach: 24 calories Bok choy: 13 calories Zucchini: 17 calories Asparagus: 22 calories Health Benefits Brussels sprouts are an excellent source of vitamin C and vitamin K. They're rich in fiber and phytonutrients, which offer a host of health benefits. Aids Healing Brussels sprouts are a great source of vitamin K. If you cut yourself, vitamin K helps your blood clot to prevent excessive bleeding. Furthermore, vitamin C promotes tissue repair by helping the body produce collagen. Promotes Immunity The immune system benefits of Brussels sprouts likely come from their numerous phytochemicals. Bioactive compounds in cruciferous vegetables, like Brussels sprouts, reduce inflammation, induce immune functions, and stimulate natural detoxification. Supports Strong Bones The vitamin K in Brussels sprouts also plays an important role in bone formation. There are multiple vitamin K-dependent proteins involved in bone mineralization, turnover, and calcification. The protein in Brussels sprouts also helps support muscle and bone strength. Helps Reduce Risk of Metabolic Syndrome The fiber in Brussels sprouts (and other vegetables) has long been associated with appetite control and healthy weight maintenance. Plant-based eating plans have been shown to reduce circulating levels of the appetite hormone leptin. Although leptin sends fullness cues to the brain, high leptin levels can cause resistance to leptin's message. A high-vegetable menu reduces this effect and protects against metabolic syndrome. May Reduce Risk of Some Cancers Brussels sprouts are one of the cruciferous vegetables shown to have anti-cancer properties. There is some evidence that this may be due to the activation of certain enzymes in the liver that binds to carcinogens. Research seems particularly promising in the prevention of breast and ovarian cancer. Dose-dependent inverse associations have been observed between the intake of cooked cruciferous vegetables and the development of ovarian cancer, meaning eating more cooked cruciferous veggies may result in a decreased risk of ovarian cancer. Contains Health Promoting Glucosinolates Brussels sprouts contain glucosinolates which are sulphur glycosides that provide a range of health benefits. They can be broken down by gut bacteria to create bioactive compounds that are renowned for their anticarcinogenic properties, including inhibiting tumor growth and cancer formation. Some of these same compounds, namely indole-3 carbinol has been shown to improve symptoms of poly-cystic ovarian syndrome. PCOS is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles and hirsutism such as facial hair, acne, and weight gain. Allergies People with an intolerance to histamine-rich foods may experience allergy-like symptoms after eating Brussels sprouts. There is potential for cross-reactivity in people with allergies to cabbage, peaches, or mustard. Adverse Effects Brassica vegetables (crucifers) such as Brussels sprouts can cause gastrointestinal issues in some people, especially when eaten raw. Cooking Brussels sprouts makes them easier to digest. Brussels sprouts are not recommended for people following a low-FODMAP diet to manage gastrointestinal symptoms. Cruciferous vegetables like Brussels sprouts are goitrogenic, which means they might interfere with iodine uptake, disrupting the thyroid gland's production of hormones necessary for regulating metabolism. There is a weak association between thyroid cancer, goiters, and the intake of cruciferous vegetables in some populations, particularly in women with iodine deficiencies. There is not sufficient evidence to warrant a dietary restriction of Brussels sprouts, though. If you take the medication Coumadin (warfarin) as a blood thinner, your doctor may advise you to eat a consistent amount of green leafy vegetables, like Brussels sprouts, to keep your clotting levels stable. Be sure to discuss your eating habits with your doctor when taking blood thinners. When It's Best You can usually find Brussels sprouts year-round, but peak season falls in the autumn and winter months. Brussels sprouts are best when harvested after a frost. They should be 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter and hard, green, and compact. Frozen Brussels sprouts are an equally nutritious alternative to fresh. Canned and pickled Brussels sprouts are also available in certain dishes (and even cocktails in place of olives). These preserved varieties are likely to be higher in sodium, with a slightly diminished nutritional value. Rinse before eating to reduce some of the excess sodium. Storage and Food Safety You can store uncut Brussels sprouts in the refrigerator for three to five weeks, but after a couple of days, the quality starts to decrease. For longer-term storage, blanch and freeze Brussels sprouts for up to one year. Before cutting fresh Brussels sprouts, wash your hands well and remove any damaged outer leaves. Rinse Brussels sprouts under running water and dry with a clean paper towel. How to Prepare You can steam, roast, or stir-fry Brussels sprouts, or shred them to use in slaws and salads. Cook them simply with a small amount of salt, pepper, and olive oil, or fancy them up by adding heart-healthy nuts and spices. If using frozen sprouts, let them defrost before cooking.Cook the sprouts until they are fork-tender and have turned a vibrant green with a few golden brown spots (overcooking sprouts affects their texture and turns them a drab green/khaki). This takes about five minutes when pan-frying.To reduce cooking time, you can blanch your Brussels sprouts first. Place them in boiling salted water for about 30 seconds, and then transfer them to an ice bath to slow down the cooking process. When you are ready to prepare them, cook them as you wish and serve them immediately.Turn the sprouts every so often to prevent them from burning. 14 Sources Verywell Fit uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
