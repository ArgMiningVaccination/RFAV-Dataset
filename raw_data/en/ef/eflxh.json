The word has a lexical the teeth. The words in which this sound meaning that describes the striving to regain a occurs are seldom, if ever, connected with the concept of the universe in which the parts that new-fangled vocabulary (of Latin and Greek we are coming to know so microscopically can origin) that inserted itself into the language be seen more in their macrocosmic totality. through the ecclesiasts or through academia; Perhaps this is why the spelling of the word we are led back to a way of life that was at one had to reflect its Greek origin.

Let us investigate these. Whilst not wishing The at-oneness mentality of past ages to add discomfort to the life of fanatical meant that the human being's daily life was phoneticists, here we cannot escape the joy experienced as directly connected with the and seemingly bewildering inconsistencies totality of the universe. When this connection that abound - in words beginning with 'wh', started to fall short, it needed healing. To be like wheeze, Whitehall, vWiodunit, w/iirligig, made hearty' w/iiff. Huckleberry (botanically linked with was a condition of wholeness beyond the mere w/iortleberry) and so on... A longer list is medically sound. Preceding the present concept unnecessary and would probably become of holism was the very being of wholeness.Furthermore, people felt themselves as whole only when they were fully integrated into a social grouping: the tribe, the clan...the glee club, the congregation... Banishment, ostracism, excommunication were worse than death: if banished or ostracised, you lived languorously , half without life. The closely knit entity of a class of young children is an essential element in education, and reminds us of the wholeness of that earlier condition. Children of 12/13 years of age start to form cliques - they are clinging to social forms that echo their earlier status of natural social grouping. Meanwhile today, the individual adult becomes more and more emancipated from society. We do not need to search far for examples: the unions with their traditional relation to the left of politics are becoming subject to new scrutiny; it could be said that it was the increasing pressure of individuality that nally punctured the air-balloon of Soviet ideology; in the West we are out for personal choice - democratic representation; every where we nd supermarkets covering acres of ground with their Milky Way of choice replacing the green-grocer at the comer shop, and hijacking his regular customers, where the conversation that took place while you gave your order verbally, item by item, moved from comments about the weather to news (gossip, too, though not necessarily of the malicious kind) that concemed the whole community. Or, in the nal analysis, admiring the head-and-shoulders-above types, we look ourselves up in Who's Who. As we journey from the wholeness of the past to the holism which is our hope for the future, what are we losing, what have we lost? Rudolf Steiner pointed out that a signicant step in the (descending, one must say) part of this journey was taken in the ninth century AD. At the Oecumenical Council in Constan tinople in 869, the Western Church asserted that the human being was a duality, consisting of body and soul; the former Trinitarian-based doctrine which included spirit in human nature was renounced. Following that, to begin with, life of course persisted at grass-roots level, with its egg- whisks, its w/ieel-wrights and what-not. Butthere can be no denying that the maggot had crept into the apple barrel from the top. Nevertheless, it took a long time for the reality of three-foldness to die; the whole momentum of Greek culture was behind it - in its tripartite socio-political structure (Sparta, Athens, Thebes); in its architectural styles (Doric, Ionian, Corinthian); in the three principle stages of its sculpture (Archaic, Classic, Hellenic). Later, despite the ecclesi astical stance of body and soul (strangely in contradiction with the teaching of the Godhead as a Trinity), the population was surrounded visually in the Middle ages and the Renaissancethrough artistic tradition with triunity of every kind. And not only in artistic tradition: we nd it especially in the fairy stories of folk culture with their ubiquitous three princesses, three sons, three dresses, three tasks... The second blow to the world outlook in which the human being was regarded as three-fold came in the CI7th with the advent of technologically applied science, stemming largely from the work of Francis Bacon. Through it, by degrees, the human being became a soulless pawn in the hands of (whatwe now refer to as) market forces. Admittedly, some belief in the spirit and appreciation of the soul persisted into the twentieth century but it was little more than a fagade, a fagade that was not difcult to demolish. Indeed, the inhumane brutality of, say, the Siberian concentration camp andmany other phenomena of our age force one to ask how much even of the body (in any s e n s e h u m a n ) c a n b e f o u n d i n t h e dereliction of culture from which so many m i l l i o n s h a v e s u ff e r e d . In view of the above, it is helpful to recall in this three-quarter centenary year, that W a l d o r f e d u c a t i o n r o s e f r o m t h e a s h e s o f World War 11914-18, as a result of: (i) the impulse coming from parents who were part of the work-force of the Waldorf- Astoria factory; (ii) the insight of Rudolf Steiner, which was needed to establish a school in which the whole child would receive an education that recognised, reflected and renewed its threefold, fully human nature; 2 3(iii) the wish to serve and support these two factors and make them reality, as living in the enthusiasm of Bmil Molt, one of the proprietors of the factory. In short, a modern way of reinslating spiritiuil and soul-like values (symbolised one could say by the rushing, airy part of 'u7t') - what Smuts called 'holism', what the Poles refer to as 'ecological' and what continues to throw the gauntlet to the Establishment as \"green\", in one guise or another, refusing to be fobbed off as the latest w/iipper-snapper. In the Hermitage at St. Petersburg is an exceptional collection of Rembrandt's paintings, among which is The Prodigal Son (1663). The moment of the son's return to his father's household is depicted. The son is kneeling, the father slightly bending over him with hands placed in the region of the son's shoulder- blades in a gesture in which welcome, relief, compassion, pain, blessing and other inner qualities are mingled. This parable, of The Prodigal Son, narrated in Luke's Gospel, has sometimes been referred to as THE story, yet it did not achieve the popularity among Renaissance painters as did, say, the apocryphal story of Tobias and the Archangel Raphael. Rembrandt does not spare us with regard to the son's wretchedness: we see only the back of his kneeling gure. The sole of his left foot (foreshortened) is prominently revealed by the most mire-splashed of shoes having slipped off. T h e s h o e r e m a i n s d i s c a r d e d i n t h e c o r n e r of the picture. The foot itself, inevitably unlovely as it is, is highlighted by Rembrandt. Daring? Provocative? Mysterious perhaps? Then there is his garment, increasingly shoddy and dishevelled in appearance as one glances f r o m n e c k l i n e t o w a i s t t o k i r t l e . A s i f t o emphasise shame, Rembrandt highlights the nape of the neck, less so the crown of the head, while the remainder of the face is swathed in d a r k s h a d o w. The father bends over him. Apart fromFather and Son {from Rembrandt's 'The Prodigal Son') drawn by an older pupil. the hands already mentioned, other features which reveal his attitude are the seemingly closed eyelids: his eyes are averted - not directed towards the tattered gure. Having feasted them in recognising the flesh and blood reality of his son's return, his gaze i s n o w i n w a r d . H e i s a b s o r b e d i n t h e thankfulness of the son's existence, bathed in the utter contentment of being reunited, yet pierced with the agony of the outer appearance and lled with apprehension at the thought of the son's 'story' which has not yet fully been told. He is torn with theanxieties and mixed feelings that have preoccupied him since the son's departure, he relives the slow revival of buried hope, the welling forth of that love which takes no account of the length of the road... The father's closed eye-lids allow us, more than had they been open, to be participants in the process that is going on within both their souls. The olcial guides in the Hermitage frequently refer to the picture as one of Rembrandt's greatest psychological paintings. The artist builds up the intensity of light, characteristically in patches, allowing it to fall on the father's head via the line of the nose (which commits the left part of the face into darkness), over the eye-brows to the upper forehead where it is again cut off abruptly by a hint of the curve of a skull-cap. This spot of light is lifted above the deep sepia-toned travail of shadow-play - that delves into the spaces between, into the creases of the garments and into the obscure background - and gives us a pool of redemptive calm, a resting place upon which,as it were, the dove of spirit, can settle while the stirred turbulent waters of the past subside. It stands as crown at the climax of the sombre-red, short but ample cloak aroundthe father's shoulders - as when the strength of spirit comes forward, endowing the soul, that has struggled through its inner trials, with quiet triumph. This is not the place to consider the three gures witnessing the scene. Father and son are parable enough. The son's prodigality has led him through the swine-husk turning pointof despair to an inner awakening and thereturn - now, the wiser through suffering - to a life of renewal. In educating out of the threefold image of the human being in the ways that Rudolf Steiner has so richly indicated, Waldorf teachers have the golden opportunity of giving experiences to, of nurturing forces within, and of sharing ideas with the future generation, which can be freely developed in later walks of life. If such development takes place, it will enable a beginning to be made to restore what was lost as a result of869AD and the knock-on effect of C17th mis applied technological thinking. The New Testament translation of the Prodigal Son puts it this way: \"It was meet that we should make merry and be glad,..\" Rembrandt, painting as the C17th was well under way, developed a language that speaks of prophetic compassion for things to come. Might we not in looking back not only at the growth of Waldorf education, but also at the way it hasrestored a threefold quality to all aspects of school life, here strike a festive note - a thankful and congratulatory, though not complacent: \"W/joopee\"? B.M. Announcement Hugh Heiherington (10.9.1917 to 13.10 1993) was editor of Child and Man from 1948-1958. An appreciation of his work will appear in the next issue. 4 5The Title of This Issue The Three Tongues of WaldorfThe College of Teachers by WILLIAM FORWARD Just as in the Middle Ages, it was thought necessary to have a thorough knowledge of Hebrew, Greek and Latin (the three languages -\"tongues\" - in which the inscription on the cross was written) before understanding theology, so it becomes clear, on acquaintance with Waldorf education, that a knowledge of the threefold nature of the human being is essential, both for understanding the develop ment of the child as well as for putting Waldorf into successful classroom practice. This theme therefore is a fundamental one but. at the same lime, full of creative possibilities. It is the theme that forms a basis for all articles in this issue. Some stand on their own. The College of Teachers by William Forward is an article in which is described the mode of working of the responsible leaching body in a Steiner School, with its role in all spheres of the \"threefold social order\": the cultural/spiritual, the sphere of human rights and the economic/ administrative. In Taurus-Aries-Pisces, Christopher Clouder guides the reader through the salient features of three great cultural epochs: the Egyptian, the Greco-Roman- Medieval and the Renaissance... He does this from a Class 9 art history main-lesson perspective. Language is of course one of the m o s t f r u i t f u l e l d s o f r e s e a r c h i n t o h o w human beings experience themselves, the world and life in a threefold way: Brien Masters - in Talk, Talk, Talk - introduces s o m e i t e m s i n t h e Wa l d o r f c u r r i c u l u m o f t h e mother tongue that touch on this. David Tasker, in his article Sleep, not only gives good advice on how parents can support thisextremely important factor in a child's life, but does so by the use of helpful contrasts with those two other vital degrees ofconsciousness: \"dream\" and \"day-wakefulnes.s\". Former Waldorf pupil Professor Jones speaks of his education as having given him \"an intense interest in how the world works, how people live and work together and in the ideas that shape our thinking.\" His work, despite his academic title, is by no means conned to the lecture room, however, but takes him in a fascinating way into all three walks of life. Finally, in view of the fact that Child ami Man has so often featured articles on the main divisions of 'childhood' (0-7 years, 7-14 years and 14-21 years), on this occasion we look more at the transitions: Charlotte Comeras writes on how school readiness begins to surface and be identied at the top end of the Kindergarten. Kevin McCarthy plunges us into the melting pot of a Class 8, prior to the pupils' leaping across the chasm of adolescence. The third transition is when stepping from the Upper School into 'life'; this stage is represented by two articles, written by pupils Andreas Reynolds and Maria Fynes-Clinton, one on Work Experience at Sea, the other on her Interview for the Nursing Profession. T h e b o o k s t h a t c o u l d b e a n d h a v e b e e n written on the subject of threefoldness are with out number. It is hoped that what is here offered will constitute a tting contribution to the theme in this, the 75th Anniversary Year (1919-1994) o f R u d o l f S t e i n e r Wa l d o r f E d u c a t i o n . Ed.Few countries in the world spend more per capita on education than the USA. At the same time one notes that the level of dissatisfaction with education is in proportion. An independent survey was recently conducted in the USA to ascertain among other things why increased expenditure by the State on education seemed to do very little to mitigate this dissatisfaction. The conclusion revealed that those schools worked best which were subject to least outside regulation - i.e. schools which were self-administered. A similar phenomenon was recorded in a report on private education in Sweden last year. The Social Democratic welfare state, evolved in the post-war years and widely admired since, incorporated the view that theState was best qualied to determine and provide for the nation's educational needs: \"Those entitled to an education have normally no possibility of insight or genuine judgement in an area so difcult to survey as that of instruction and teaching in theschool\". A scientic investigation into its efciency however recently determined that \"in the six regions polled, the strongest feelings of civic powerlessness or protest w e r e a r o u s e d i n t h e e l d s o f e d u c a t i o n a n d c a r e f o r t h e s i c k \" . A l l e f f o r t s o f l o c a l a n d national government to marginalise private education initiatives, mainly Steiner schools, came to nothing and in 1992 the National Assembly passed amotion whereby, from Ist July that year, independent schools would be treated the same nancially as state sector s c h o o l s . I n a n a r t i c l e i n D a s G o e t h e a n u m 9.7.92 Frans Carlgren reports: \"This is just one example among many for tendencies that are now coming to expression in the whole country and are leading, for example.to the establishment of more and more self- administering pre-schools and hospital unity ... More and more citizens want... to be directly involved in shaping the social order\". In our own country, whilst there has been a regrettable tendency to centralise control of education in the National Curriculum there has at least been a recognition of the benets of devolving management to the schools themselves. The virtual absence of outer regulation is a helpful feature which Steiner Schools have in common with most independent schools, but what often puzzles parents, visitors and government inspectors alike is the apparent absence of inner regulation as well: questions such as \"Who's in charge here?\" often receive the reply \"We all are\". The role of the head- teacher, with deputies, heads of department etc. is carried out by the College of T eachers, a body which meets, associates and acts in the greatest possible freedom. Freedom, as an essential condition of a healthy educational process, was recognisedby Rudolf Steiner at the time when his efforts as a social reformer were at their peak in the years 1917-1919. In the war-torn Germany of that time there was a wide-spread recognition that new ideas were necessary if any degree of social cohesion were to be achieved by peace ful means. Years of research had led Steiner to the idea that just as the human being is made up of functionally distinct, though mutually interdependent systems or activities (in the body: the nervous, cardiovascular and metabolic systems; in the soul: thinking feeling and willing) so also the society in which he lives needs to be organised to reflect this if onewishes to avoid inhuman or insufciently human social conditions. This idea he put rst 6 7to leading political gures in both Germany and Austria; and (hen. nding insurcienl ability torespond to new thinking in those quarters, he appealed directly to factory workers, putting the case for a cultural life organised under its own direction on the principle of freedom, a rights life on the principle of human equality and an econotriic life on the principle of \"brotherhood\". The response to r/t/.? appeal was much better, all the more so since Stciner was one of the few to recognise that the working class was protesting at least as much over cul tural deprivation as over any other form of deprivation. Thus: \"What the appeal is seeking to point out is that everything of a spiritual or cultural nature is the concern of everyoneand that the spiritual worker is responsible to the whole of humanity. This cannot be achieved unless the cultural life is liberated and placed under its own direction\" (23.4.19). Like any initiative in social tnatters this required a sufciently large number of people to see its relevance (suittibility); and at that time, partly due to the opposition from trades union leaders, this could not be achieved. Nevertheless, as a legacy of this initiative Emil Molt, a director of the Waldorf Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart, co-founded with Rudolf Steiner the rst Waldorf school for the factory w o r k e r s ' a n d o t h e r s ' c h i l d r e n . O f t h i s s c h o o l S t e i n e r s a i i l , \" T h e Wa l d o r f s c h o o l m u s t b e a real cultural deed if it is to achieve a renewal of the spiritual life of our time. We must expect a transformation in every aspect of life. The whole social movement has after all a spiritual origin and the question of education is just one of the many questions that relate to the burning issues of our time. The possibility of the Waldorf school must therefore be fully utilised as a reforming, revolutionary factor in the education system\". The school received its permission to start in 1919 from the Ministry of Education, was funded initially by Emil Molt and was managed increasingly independently of both Emil Molt and even of Rudolf Steiner by its College of Teachers. Much later this (and many other schools in Europe) received state funding, and has had to guard its freedom Jealously fromthe regulatory attempts that generally go with such funding. Given this stated striving for the highest possible degree of freedom from both outer and inner regulation, one might well ask: \"How can such a College work in practice?\" For obvious reasons any attempt to describethis must be prefaced by saying that there will be exceptions to virtually anything said about the College of Teachers. Those teachers who see themselves as carrying the .school, generally full-time teachers committed to working out of anthroposophy, form the College of T eachers and meet weekly on a Thursday to deal with the school's business. Typically this falls into three broad areas, pedagogical, technical and executive. In the pedagogical part there might be a study of a particular child or of a syndrome or of a particular main-lesson and its reception. In this aspect, the teachers' meeting constitutes a kind of rolling teachers' seminar in which all deepen their knowledge and understanding. In the technical part, information is exchanged on forthcoming arrangements, festivals, outings, plays, lesson-cover etc.; and in the executive part, decisions are taken on stafng, deployment, curriculum and development policy. For the rst two of these activities one can readily see that having the teachers all together is a highly efcient way of working - one develops and shares a common understanding of the growing child on the one hand and gets everyone in formed on practical matters on the other. When it comes to the executive, decision-making part however, all kinds of problems can crop up. Any decision-making process will always involve the gathering of information, the forming of an evaluation or judgement on the basis of the information and then the taking of the decision itself. One can easily see that with a group of .sometimes up to 60 or 70 \"decision makers\" the process can become quite labo rious when it comes to forming a coherent judgement on an issue and then coming to a decision that all can \"stand by\". By most modern management standards it might even seem impossible. Nevertheless in Steiner schools round the world there is a constant weeklys t r u g g l e t o a c h i e v e t h e c o n d i t i o n s i n a m e e t i n gw h e r e t h i s b e c o m e s p o s s i b l e , a n d m a n y S t e i n e r t e a c h e r s c a n t e s t i f y t o t h e r e m a r k a b l e f e e l i n g o f acting out of the spirit of the school when in this way individuals have made their contribution, the possible views have been moved to and fro in the circle, and then the moment comes when .someone formulates what everyone can per ceive to be the right decision at that moment. This is not to say that this is always the way . Many colleges delegate some or even most decisions to smaller groups, depending o n t h e d y n a m i c s i n t h e c o l l e g i a t e b o d y . O f t e n t h edifculties arise when it seems necessary toreach a compromise or an appropriate mean between the perceived ideal on the one hand and the perceived necessity on the other. This requires the engagement of the 'middle person'i n e a c h o f t h o s e p r e s e n t . A s S t e i n e r p u t i t i n 1 9 1 9 , Each personality must be fully engaged from the start. For this reason we shall organise the school so that it may be not governed but administered; and administered in a republican way. In a real teachers' republic there will be no cushions at our backs, no directives from the headmaster... each individual must be fully responsible him or herself. For the teachers this striving can be rewarding and can give glimpses of a quality of community that is perhaps still of the future, as well as channelling energy into the daily work. It can also, it has to be said, prove a daunting and occasionally dispiriting challenge. For the parents it can, as suggested at the beginning, seem confusing because it is not so easily grasped as the pyramid structure of man agement found elsewhere. Yet it can also, when it is going well, be experienced as a sense of inner strength, warmth and wisdom radiating through the school and the school community. Most of all it is the pupils who experience the different quality out of which colleagues teach who work together in this way. Not only do they feel they meet the school in the individual teacher, but a healing quality can be experienced particularly by those who bring difculties with them into life at school. To take a prophetic image from the European past-the Round Table of King Arthur and hisknights was felt as a powerful, cultural and civilising influence throughout its surrounding community; yet when individual problems orchallenges came up it was by no means always King Arthur himself who dealt with them. Rather it was perceived in the circle to whom the challenge properly belonged and the adventure to nd the tting remedy began. Thus perhaps we are moving towards a solving of the great riddle of the seeming incompatibility of community and freedom.

When Rudolf Steiner suddenly, as prelude to the dispersing of gave this advice, which he did on many a November fog; as if the mundane colloqui- occasions, it amounted almost to an exhorta- alism of Tom, Dick and Harry or the grey tion, and was addressed quite particularly to drawing-room drawl of Brown, Jones and those involved with the education of children Harrison needed reminding that the Logos between the ages of c. 7-14. How those picturesmust change according to the growing child's needs is a fascinating study in itself; here we are concerned with the language used by the teacher to convey the pictures to the children. Supposing we are giving instructions about keeping Wellingtons in the bootlockers tidy , we are likely on such an occasion only to skim the surface of the pictorial mind: \"... and remember to tuck them right inside your locker, like two sweet-chestnuts, packed cosily inside their prickly shell...\" If we are using the pictorial as a vehicle for teaching say the sign for multiplication, the image we have chosen for the purpose will flow through the whole stream of the language. \"... Then busy Monty Multiplier placed the silver birch branch onto the block and chopped it in two with his little hatchet. He chopped the two into four , the four into eight and the eight into sixteen. He took another branch from the bundle and did the same again - and again and again. Soon the little pieces mounted up into quite a pile. At that, with a deft flick he plunged the sharp corner of his hatchet securely into the chopping block. Then he dug the ngers of both hands into the pile of sticks, scooping up a big bundle into the wheelbarrow. As he did so, some pieces flew hither and thither but soon he had a full load which looked a bit like a spiky nest perched untidily high up in the crown of an oak tree, as part of a rookery . He grasped the handles of the barrow; and the wheel, with its four bright yellow spokes [which made a cross like the sign for multiplication], was soon rolling happily down the pebbly path towards old Mrs Treadle's backdoor. How pleased she was going to be, thought Monty. He imagined her quick, smiling eyes and could almost smell the home-made cheese twiglets which she produced on such occasions...\" Earlier in the morning the class has said the morning verse: \"The sun with loving light/Makes bright forme each day...\". They followed this by reciting some William Blake together: \"Piping down the valleys wild. Piping songs of pleasant glee. On a cloud I saw a child. And he laughing said to me: 'Pipe a song about a lamb!'...\"In poetical language, imagery becomes the key that poets use to assist us lesser mortals in discovering, entering and exploring their world. In the morning verse, \"Loving light\" has nothing to do with the electrician's ampsand volts; the expression points in a totally different direction. Blake's vision of cloud and child, we realise, is no more visionary than the other character in the poem: 'me', the piper in the valley. We need to live with the whole poem. We need to dive deep into Blake's imagery in order to fathom his mood and meaning. The world of which the poet speaks is not to be grasped as is multiplica tion, or to be shoved around as material objects in a bootlocker. We see from the above that straightaway w h e n t h e c h i l d r e n e n t e r C l a s s 1 t h e i r connection with these three worlds - which are related to \"body, soul and spirit\" - needs nurturing and to do that we need to nd the appropriate language. Blake's poem presents us with another aspect of language - also three-tiered. At the beginning of the poem, the piper hears the child speak to him from the realm of the clouds. The \"pleasant glee\" - his music, one could say - flows as a fount of unceasing inspiration -but he (and we) cannot remain'up in the clouds' for too long; he is therefore bidden: \"Piper sit thee down and write\". This reflects the stage in history when oral tradition begins to fade and the scribe steps in. The written characters become a crutch for what was once an inspirative faculty but has now been maimed. As the children step from Kindergarten to Class 1, this phylogenetical journey is repeated. The fairy tales of Class 1 (which Steiner was condent could also be created afresh by each teacher, thereby not solely relying on the treasures collected for example by Afanasiev in Russia, by Asbjomsen in Norway or by the brothers Grimm inGermany) pass \"from mouth to ear\". Simultaneously, preparation is made through introducing the letters of the alphabet for the next two stages of acquiring language skills: writing and reading. When Blake's piper \"stained the water clear\", the ink that 1011resulted was not only an essential ingredient in the 'technology' required to commit his songs to paper: it minors the mental state of his descent from unspotted clairaudience to the \"stained\" consciousness of a later age. In so far as the pupils make their own text-books in Steiner schools, this three- tiered linguistic sequence of oral/aural, written and nally read is something that is impregnated upon the whole pattern of learning throughout all twelve years in a host of different ways. A major approach to learning in the Middle Ages was through the Seven Liberal Arts. These were subdivided into two groups: The Trivium (Grammar, Dialectic and Rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (Arithmetic. Geometry, Astronomy and Music). Although we may discover the Trivium again in m o d e r n e d u c a t i o n i t i s i n a m o d u l a t e d f o r m . Rhetoric is word in action; enaction, gestureand the power and effect of the word are characteristics of how the child before school age uses language and relates to it. Grammar is that which informs the language - one might say its inner discipline. As a result of this discipline the individual words are brought into connection with one another, through the endings of conjugation and declension, and through the word order in each sentence. Like the monarch in medieval society the subject of the sentence (a strange misnomer) asserts its influence on the verb and other words; it causes the noun which is object of the verb to be put into the accusative case and so on. A modifying, mercurial element prevails. It is the grammar of language, in all its ner shades, that children in the Lower School must get a feel for, become aware of and come to grips with. [Yes, there may well be moments where prepositions can legitimately come at the end of sentences - an exception to the 'rule' \"up with which,\" as Sir Winston Churchill impishly scorned, the pedant \"will not put\".] Not until adolescence, however, can one expect the pupil to enter the region of dialectic/logic. First it is a matter of developing inner exactitude and honesty of thought, then ofttingly clothing this in every shade of word. In turn, this can lead to a manner of listening to the other person in which the self withholds its own opinion in order to follow and live with Something ' outside'. Even in everyday conversation, forces of self-sacrice and devotion are needed to exercise this skill. The \"rubicon\", much reckoned with within Waldorf circles, which all children have to cross is that of the 9th/10th year. At this time, children need help in reorientating themselves. This is done partly through connecting them with the local environment, through nding traces of what people have done over the centuries - bridges or roads that have been built, crops that have been grown, grain that has been milled, raw materials that have been quarried or mined or trawled from the sea-bed, goods that have been produced and sold at markets. Moving from orientation in space to its equivalent in time, we are faced with that division of time that is expressed in past, present, and future tenses. The author was once privileged to witness something that demonstrates how such a subject at school can have psychosomatic signicance for the child. He was waiting at a bus stop in Aberdeen, not far from the Waldorf school. A wee laddie of c. 9 years of age joined the queue. His eyes were turned inwards, not solemnly but as if continuing to enjoy something that he had only recently experienced - like the play of light onglistening granite after a spring shower. He s u d d e n l y l o o k e d u p t o t h e s t r a n g e r standing next to him in the bus queue, his eyes now twinkling beneath a rather scrappy forelock of sandy hair: \"D'ye ken the past, the present and the future?\". A further step in inner orientation takes place at the transition from Lower School to Upper School. This step can be taken more sure-footedly if one helps pupils to continued on page 34Sleep From a Parent's Point of View by DAVID TASKER A good friend of mine once surprised me by ^ sleep, we will regain ourselves again on remarking that the nearest he has been to waking and, moreover , so will our family and seeing angels is when he is in the bedroom loved ones.

Sleep can be seen as some kind of voyage; namely the preparation, the sleep (which itself we say 'goodnight' to someone, as when they has a threefold composition) and nally the are setting off on a journey. We trust that recovery or restitution. Parents tend to have just as we 'lose ourselves' when we enter set views and procedures not only on the 1213quality of food but also its preparation. Rhythms and regularity of mealtimes become important and children will usually be sitting still, often in a social grouping around a table and detached from the hurly-burly of life's activities. We organise the food carefully and sometimes artistically on the plate and table. Most importantly we realise that good digesting, good nutrition and good health and development is contingent on what we eat and how we eat. Could we say that good sleep is equally contingent on preparation, and most importantly what of the day's experiences we take with us (ingest) into sleep as well as how these are taken? Bedtimes are notoriously difcult occasions for parents to aspire to heights of child-rearing excellence! One's own tiredness, coupled with an over-tired child, or a child distracted by outside events - the comings and goings of older siblings, unexpected visitors - these can all be obstacles to the calm peaceful space of good sleep preparation. With the humility that comes from my fair share of bedtime 'scenes' with my own children I offer some observations on bedtime preparation. Regular routines and rhythms seem to be the primary goal, particu larly for the child who nds sleep a lonely, frightening journey. To engender a bedtime mood, a mood which can encourage the journey from the full waking life to the realm of day-dreaming, is for me the greatest challenge. Withdrawing from the main living areas of the house to the bedrooms, often a problematic rst step, can be lightened by making this into an imaginative game - a boat or train setting off and chugging its way along passages and stairs. The most beautiful way of accompanying the child into the realm of day-dreams and to the frontier of sleep is through our singing - the lullaby. Even the most rudimentary singing voice seems to provide all that is needed, although I have personally found thatthis is difcult to sustain with my children once they have reached Class Two. Somehow they seem to be too self conscious and singing to sleep belongs, they feel, 'to babies and Kindergarten children'. A quiet, appropriate bedtime story, preferably toldafresh or by memory also allows the child to withdraw from the hard physical world to a day-dreaming imaginative landscape. Aswith singing, 1 have found this hard tosustain and have resorted to reading directly from the books. The choice of book is, of course, important and quite often I nd myself reading so-called bedtime books which are either too old or too young for the child; sometimes it becomes apparent that the content is unsuitable, perhaps too emotional, threatening and brutal or, some times, particularly in contemporary children's books, rather banal and unimaginative. 1 am s u r e t h a t t h i s i s o n e a r e a w h e r e o u r c l a s s teachers can help with recommendations toenable the bedtime reading to be complemen tary to the day time teaching. The reality in this country is that the majority of children (but not, hopefully, in Waldorf schools) will go to sleep having watched a number of television programmes - sometimes for as long as two or three hours and the arguments surrounding television watching have been well raised in Waldorf circles. At present, with my oldest child at 10 years, I personally feel no necessity to introduce a television into our house. My own questions are what mood and what picture experiences do we want our children to take with them to sleep? Can television provide something positive to effect the transition into sleep? My personal experience is that, for young children in particular, television does not enliven the active inner life of imagination and, moreover, the powerful outer sense images which character ise television can often overshadow the more subtle, delicate impressions of schoollessons and the living impressions of the actual world, the world of actions. The thought of the contemporary child being lulled into sleep by a radio cassette or t e l e v i s i o n i s u n c o m f o r t a b l e . continued on page 27School Readiness: The Doorway Between Infant and Schoolchild by CHARLOTTE COMERAS In the play As Y ou Like It by William accompanies the bodily changes that take place Shakespeare, Jaques tells his companions: in the growing child.

Rudolf Steiner with the awakening of puberty at around tells us that during the rst seven years the fourteen years old. There are of course many human being completely transforms the body other subtle changes going on between these inherited from the parents. From within, the two more obvious ones. individuality is busy completing the organs The body and the inner life, or soul life, are and shaping the body to express something of part of a whole human being and naturally the its own inner nature. The environment also one affects the other. It is very obvious when plays a large part in forming the body during one is tired or a little under the weather how the time of intense activity of growth in these it is harder to have clear thoughts; or the other early years. As a culmination of this way round: when one is anxious and upset transformation, the child loses its milk teeth in any way the body starts to show symptoms and grows new strong teeth, including its 'six- of imbalance. So it is that an inner development year-old molars', which will last for life. It is 14 15remarkable to see. when this change of teeth occurs, how the child's face changes and becomes more distinctly individualised. During the rst seven years the life forces within the child have been, for the most part, bound up within the organism, building and forming a strong healthy body. When a certain stage of bodily development has been completed some of the life forces, also referred to as etheric forces, are liberated and available for a different kind of building and forming - the forming of thoughts, at rst mostly in the form of inner pictures. The process of liberating these formative forces is gradual. After age two and a half, when a certain stage in the forming of the head has been reached, the forces now freed allow the child to have the capacity for associative memory and the gradual enhance ment of fantasy forces. These are not to be confused with the capacity to form inner imaginative pictures nor the kind of memory that can be called upon in an abstract way, as if having access to an inner ling cabinet. This stage occurs only when the life forces have completed their task of transforming the whole of the physical body, from head to toe. Then, while of course much of the life force remains bound to the organism, some is free to bring about new inner faculties, including memory and imagination. Before elaborating on the inner capacities born in the child at the turning point during the seventh year, there are more physical changes to observe. The proportions of the young child change considerably during the rst seven years, and reveal a process that proceeds from the head downwards to the limbs. The baby and toddler have a very large head in proportion to the rest of their bodies - a ratio of about 1:4. This changes to about 1:6 by the time the child is of school age and 1:8 when they are fully grown. From the age of three to ve years old the chest broadens and lls out and there is increased activity within the body connected to the organs of heart and lung. Then from about ve to seven years old the limbs become longer. With the lengthening of the body a more sculpturedquality also appears. The jaw becomes more pronounced, the neck becomes more visibleand in the trunk is the rst intimation of the waist. The arch of the foot should be well dened, the curve of the armpit appears and the spine becomes slightly curved. By the time the physical body has undergone the whole process of transforma tion the child has developed many new physical skills. For example, with longer limbs they can now run with more grace and agility. They have, in a way, made their limbs their own and therefore have far more control and balance. The child can now hop, rst on one foot and then the other; skip with a rope; walk along a log or a beam more condently; throw and catch a ball. Also they are more able to do ddly things as their ngers have become more nimble, such as threading needles, tying shoe-laces and doing up difcult zips ontheir jackets. There are ner points of development that a teacher would look for when asking: How will the child cope with writing and reading? If one or more of the answers are negative, there are likely to be difculties. Has laterality been established, parti cularly eye/hand dominance? Has the child grown out of certain primitive reflexes? Has what is referred to as the midline barrier, been crossed? A test for this is asking the child to imitate you as you touch your left ear with your right hand. But all these questions, although important to the teacher, are not really pertinent to seeing w h e t h e r t h e c h i l d h a s c r o s s e d t h e t h r e s h o l d from infant to schoolchild. In many cases, where there have been slight hitches in development, time will not necessarily sort them out and extra help in the form of special exercises will be needed. Children's drawings and paintings present a wonderful window into their development. This is a vast subject and only a few points can be brought in here. When the child has completed the work of transforming and making their body their own from head to feet there is a greater awareness of the body as a whole. continued on page 39\\ - r . . : N- Degrees of incarnation as refected in drawings of 5 year-olds: rmer, above; less rmly, below.

To continue to paint such a picture to socially and politically awake street-wise Brighton teenagers would have been dangerously naive. This is a vital and difcult task for the class-teacher. The pupils are waking up: they are beginning to form their own judgements about the adult world; they are busy rejecting or. at least, experi menting with rejecting the values of their parents, too much awareness too soon can lead to the worst evils of cynicism and nihilism. Somehow, as their eyes open, as they must, to the full truth of the human condition, young people need to have their deep latentT {see article on pa<>e 18); the thirst for power and those ade (pa}ie 21). idealism acknowledged, afrmed, nurtured and fostered. In our work on human physiology, for example, we lived for a month or so with a real human skeleton in the class, which we studied through drawing, modelling and a mathematical investigation of the mysteries of the Golden Ratio in the work of some of the Renaissance philosophers. As well as developing a strange reverence for this bony presence, the pupils were also touched by the complexity and beauty of the human form. But events were moving on and. even as we prepared our own drama of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', another drama was unfolding around the whole future of the school and of the class. For what I have failed to convey so far is the outer context of this class. We were working, not in some purpose-built or long- established Waldorf school but in a somewhatdilapidated wooden building, a former golf clubhou.se on the edge of town. The pupils were a mixed age-group spanning two years,the leading class of a small and still pioneering new school. Throughout the year, there was a constant question-mark hanging over theirfuture. Would it be possible to fund their continued education towards school-leaving age? Would we be able to offer them the possibility of sitting public examinations? Nothing, however, could stand in the way of our rehearsal schedule or prevent us from nalising the details of our two week tour of Steiner schools in France, Germany and Switzerland. This proved to be another revolu tionary experience, another part of the letting go of childhood, another crossing of thresholds and a coming to terms with the realities of life and death. Before continuing, it may be worth mentioning that the tradition in the Waldorfschool is to put on an end of year play which involves the entire class. A Shakespeare play is a favourite choice for this age. The European tour arose out of a previous exchange, which had developed a ne sense of Europeanness in the class. Casting and rehearsals went as they always do. There were wonderful moments and periods of total despair, times when individuals or the whole group crossed a new threshold of self-consciousness, left go of inhibition and rose to a new level. For the lovers this meant losing physical inhibition, touching and embracing without embarrass ment. For the fairy world, there was the challenge of moving with magic and weaving a web of magic. For the mechanicals, there was the gradual discovery of Shakespeare's comic genius. At the same time, there were the costumes to design and make; a portable set to be created; live and electronic music to 2021create; an itinerary to plan; programmes, posters and tickets to dispatch; costing to calculate on the basis of ticket sales including some interesting incidental grasp of the consequences of fluctuating exchange rates! And there was the re, too. For the second time the school suffered an arson attack. This time a really major re wrecked the fabric of the timber building, destroyed many children's work and left a stinking, charred and soggy shell. Although the school was due to vacate the building in any case, somehow it proved to be a body blow to the hopes and plans for expansion. It quickly became clear that this would be a farewell tour, that at the e n d o f ' T h e D r e a m ' t h e c l a s s w o u l d b e dispersing to state schools. It would take too long and exceed my brief here to describe the whole tour. Sufce to say that these were not the same children on their return. They had gone into new countries, often arriving after longjourneys, set up the lighting, experimented with the acoustics, the entrances and exits all with an extraordinary sense of good humour. They went off into the night with new families to speak French or German, to make new and, in some cases lasting friendships, they performed sometimes twice in a day, holding hands together in a moment of silence before each show, cheerfully loading the coach afterwards, counting the Deutschmarks with shrieks of delight. They each brought to their part some new aspect of their emerging teenage personality: passion, warmth, comic inventiveness, regal power, magic... Finally, there was Charlotte. She shared Titania's part with another girl, nding new power in the imperious struggle with Oberon. We k n e w s h e w a s i l l a n d s h e m i s s e d l o t s o f rehearsal for radiotherapy and then the ordeal of chemotherapy which left her drained and exhausted. But she was absolutely determined to come and her tomboyish charm and humour sustained the company in the occa sional post-performance trough. She was sinking fast, though. We returned to England for one last performance in a local school. As the term, andindeed the whole eight year process came towards its end and the class conrmed their new places at secondary school, Charlotte was sent home from hospital. She died just as the new school year began. Her passing brought the entire class back together in a deeply moving funeral and in an extraordinary celebration of her brief life in music, eurythmy , readings and recollections. Here, already grown taller since the summer, the pupils took a further step in their inner maturity, facing death for the rst time, in many cases, and nding in it a sense ofgrief, certainly, a sense of loss, too, but, at the same time, experiencing a deep joy at having shared something of the life of a rare spirit. So, there they are now, out in the big world of comprehensive education, deeply and, on the whole extremely successfully engaged in the GCSEs. And there is no doubt that they have something. I think or, at any rate, hope that they bring to their new classes a warmth and positivity, a lively positivity born not of rosy illusions, but from a dawning understanding of the precious and painfully precarious nature of human existence. For teacher and pupils alike it was a revolution and a revelation.

They questioned the reasoning behind my choosing to do nursing after having sat so many art and craft exams. I saw this as an opportunity to explain how my school believed in having a balance between the artistic and the intellect. This aroused a lot of interest and consequently led me to telling them about the basic principles of Waldorf education.

This ability varies from child to child with conversations with visitors in the bedroom, lights switched on and off rarely causing any stirring for the child in good healthy sleep. It serves as a reminder of how completely the child has 'left' its body and embarked on the journey into sleep. I have often wondered to what extent the state of the bed and bedding after a night's sleep is indicative of the quality of sleep, or kind of sleep footprint? The recovery from sleep in the child is generally easier for parents to deal with, possibly because we too, rst thing in the morning are day dreaming and not normally in the mood for over sensory stimulation.

One side of this tall but compact island ended abruptly in a six hundred foot sheer cliff. Thus did two weeks at sea aboard the M.V. \"Fingal\" pass in pleasant variety. Especially enjoyable was the freedom from parental restriction and school routine. In port I enjoyed having a run ashore with members of the crew... able to return to my cabin when I wanted, without homework, without anyone to tell me: \"Y ou're late! What is the meaning of coming in at this hour?\" The duty watch at the head of the gangplank did not care. T o sum up, this was truly a work 'experience', interesting, varied, full of insight and a real inspiration for my future career at sea. Andreas Reynolds is a pupil at the Rudolf Steiner School of Edinburgh. air. Quite often the difcult, conflicting situa tion occurs when reconciling the slow gradual move out of day-dreaming and the need to arrive at school on time! This can be particularly galling for the young Kindergarten children. I recently heard Waldorf education charac terised as the 'lighting of res' and not the 'lling of buckets'. What a wonderful vision for this education: a re with its unpredictability and uncertainty, its own inner life and abundant energy. Is this a glimpse of the freedom that our education seeks to give to our children? When we hear Waldorf teachers saying that education only really happens in sleep, we as parents must surely feel some sense of responsibility and play our part in this total education of our children. They need our love and care in sleeping as well as in their waking and day-dreaming lives. David Tasker is a parent at the York Steiner School. 26 27A painting by 10year-olds. In the Lower School, the world is e.xperienced in the main 'arti.mcallyus compared with 'e.xperientially' in the Kindergarten and 'cogniiially' in the Upper School.Taurus-Aries-Pisces Three Stages in Culture By CHRISTOPHER CLOUDER When leaching in ilie Upper School il is essential to have foremost in one's mind the 'latent' questions that the students carry. These are questions which should be taken up within the fabric of the lesson, without them having to be vocalised. In adolescence they rise up from a relationship with the world that is undergoing turbulent transformation as the young persons nd new faculties and feelings within themselves as well as viewing the world around them from a different perspective. The curriculum must provide a stable horizon against which these new forces can be measured but also accommodate and encourage change and creativity. Our capacities of thought, feeling and will change as we evolve as individuals, as does our body. Yet at all times these capacities areopen to ideals that too undergo transfor mation while retaining an element of truth. The ideal of beauty has manifested itself in many different ways since humanity rst created art. Yet it remains an ever present yardstick against that which we perceive is judged. What was considered beautiful a few decades or centuries ago is not necessarily seen in the same light in the present, but that does not mean previous concepts of the b e a u t i f u l a r e e i t h e r b e t t e r o r w o r s e t h a n t h o s e w e h o l d n o w . I n f a c t o l d e r f o r m s o f art can often provide a source of inspiration for the pre.sent. Cultural background also m a k e s a f u n d a m e n t a l d i ff e r e n c e b u t w e m u s t remember that culture is an expression of something within us and is a reflection of our views of each other and of the world. Art is a testament to these changes and through the study of art we can begin to appreciate the permanence of the ideal, the struggle to attainit and its multifarious manifestations. It can provide nourishment for that which is within us and. at times of crisis, prove a solace as well as a spur for overcoming the difculties.It is often a direct language that does not always need the medium of words, and its appreciation can enhance both perception and understanding. The Class 9 History of Art main-lesson is based on these principles. The artistic tradition in Europe has its roots in ancient Egypt and il is here that the main-lesson begins. A visit to an Egyptian gallery in a museum and observation of the young children milling about with obvious delight is proof enough that there is a connection between this culture of the past and the present one. Yet the consciousness of those people and their relationship to their natural and social environment was in many ways very different from ours. The ancient Egyptians felt themselves closely connected to the vegetation, geography and climate of the land they inhabited. So much so that they felt that the surroundings were a divine script that could be read and would reveal the will of the Gods. They experienced their bodies as beingimbued with the .same forces that they beheld in the plant kingdom and their rituals re- enforced this close connection. For them the preservation of this connection was the ultimate task of humanity. For three thou.sand years there was little .stylistic change and they considered this long continuity as essential for the well being of the earth. Artistic freedom, originality, human rights were concepts that did not exist. Mankind was here to serve, and in serving he provided a proper place for himself in the afterlife. The Pharaoh was the Gods' representative on earth and their commands 28 29were breaihed into him so that an order would prevail in the Kingdom. The statues of ancient Egypt show this condence. They are rmly planted on the earth yet the idealised portrayal and formal stance embody a quality that is superhuman. This art originated in the tomb. Earthly abodes and earthly pleasures were ephemeral, what counted was the permanent immortality after death that could be obtained by the preparation for death and this task could occupy a whole lifetime. Egypt was a giant necropolis of a people who felt supported, nurtured and subservient to higher beings and whose art encapsulated the strength of that certainty. Yet the very insistence on this belief suggests an anxiousness. That statues were needed to ensure a proper connection between this world and the next is indicative of a split consciousness that is partly fettered to the material as well as the spiritual. Pyramids are petried sunbeams that ensure that there was and always would be a staircase to the heavens. Here then arc the rst halting steps away from an authority yet simultaneously a longing to cling to it. The Egyptian soul was not tormented by logic or the question surrounding personal morality. Obedience was all, but in spite of this the Gods seemed to be slipping further and further away. In this phenomenon we can nd a reflection of our own growing up where we face quandaries surrounding the need for authority and a simultaneous growing beyond it. In the art of Ancient Greece we can trace the emergence of the idea of freedom. Archaic Greek art shows that the early Greeks attributed all initiatives to the Gods; in fact, in the early statues, the difference between godly and hu man is not apparent. The naked male Kouros gures and the clothed female Kore of the C7th BC are very consistent. The Kouros usually has his left foot forward, his weight equally distributed, hands clenched, arms hanging straight down and is facing forwards. Yet he is not a block and his back is as fully carved as the front. From all angles he is a human without the godly support that is found in Egyptian statues. These archaic statueshave an Apollonian serenity that was some what removed from the earth. They all have youthful bodies, slight smiles and an extraor dinary uprightness. As the classical age dawned the statues changed in that the limbs broke free into gesture, the long heavy hair receded leaving the head free to be turned and the feet were posed as if anticipating movement.Now that the bodies could be turned by the will of the individual we nd the emergence of free choice. But not without a struggle, as is depicted in the Lapiths ghting the centaurs, Greeks ghting Persians and Hercules struggling in his twelve labours. The emergence of choice came with the emergence of thinking but to achieve this much had to be overcome and with it arrived responsibility. The Charioteer of Delphi stands there in full command of his horses, his hands loosely gripping his reins.His strength, however, comes from within rather than from the Gods, and is expressed in the dignity of his face and pillar-like folds of his garments. In the last phase of Greek art the struggle become internalised. Now we can see all the human joys and griefs, the flowing movement of youth and the cares of age, the excitement ofthe horse race and the despair of drunkenness and loss. The faces are portraits and the dreamy look of the Classical age vanishes and becomes an expression of experience. The hair lo.ses its regular pattern and becomes .crumpled and unkempt. Pathos becomes the lot of humanity and, if there are gods, they too share all human frailties. We are entering the realm of Dionysos with both its frenzy and potential for new growth. Can we not see in this the steps of our own biography? And how much more telling is it to see the wrestling of our own souls depicted in statues that are recognisably and sympa thetically human. A force of the soul is bornthat attempts to disregard authority in favour of its own searching and because of this reaps the rewards and penalties, j In Roman art character emerges. The Greeks could never have conceived of a portrait of a human as a bust because for them the totality of the human form was signicant, a head without feet would have been an absurdity.To the Romans we all became heads for that is where our character is stamped and it was this strength of character that enabled them to conquer both peoples and lands. The otherworldly beauty is lost and we stand alone as physical individuals. The Romans stood in T acitus's words with \"a spade in one hand and a sword in the other\". At the point that this was most strongly felt, Christianity appeared and there is a marked contrast between the art and architec ture that embellished Roman cities and the unsophisticated but joyous art to be found in the catacombs. Here in the midst of death there was hope and all the pictures of the early Christian centuries abound in the faith that there was an afterlife and that Christ could lead humanity to a new and better wofld. Such a message did not need luxurious illustration or magnicent constructions but could be simply depicted in a way that could speak to the hearts of all that understood it - we are not alone after all and through contemplation of Christ's teaching and deeds we can be led away from the anxiety and despair to which our intellect is prone. When Christianity became the religion of the Empire under Constantine, new problems were created in the conjoining of state and belief; and these questions perplexed and troubled Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages. Art turned away from everyday life on earth and tended to look towards the celestial kingdom. Old ideas were brought back into currency and much effort was put into elucidating what classical philosophers and the early church fathers had said and thought. In Egypt we were looking at the s o u l s w h o f e l t a d i r e c t c o n t a c t w i t h t h e i r immediate environment and felt that environ ment within them. In the passage through Greece, Rome, Byzantium and the Middle Ages art reveals qualities of thought that were applied to humanity's position on earth and the relationship to godly realms. This relationship was no longer something that was felt; it had to be explored with intelligence and the ramications of this exploration are apparent in the history of those times. It isimportant to young people, who experience a similar inward path, to gain a sense of the difference of these two approaches withouttheir having to experience them as abstract philosophy with little bearing on their immediate concerns. The Renaissance then appears as a new and startling development, although the people themselves living at this time saw it as basically a rebirth of an older culture. The Florentine humanist Mattea Palmieri wrote in 1435: \"Now indeed may every thoughtful spirit thank God that it has been permitted to be born in this new age, so full of hope and promise, which now rejoices in a greater army of noble souls than the world has seen in a thousand years that preceded it\". It was an age of optimism that felt it could view the world afresh and in art it rejected the heavenly quali ties of Byzantine and Gothic in favour of infusing this world with an ideal beauty. T o this end gravity reasserted itself: portraits were painted as an exploration of the human psyche, the laws of linear perspective werediscovered and the use of a vanishing point gave pictures the illusion of depth. For the Medieval world, perspective was just an illusion and could be disproved by simple geometry. For the Renaissance artist however it was an expression of an individual \"punto centrico\", an individual perspective of the world: Nature itself was considered to have a mathematical structure and the universe consisted of proportional relationships as an image of the divine order. Through having one focal point where the spectator must stand, man becomes \"the measure of all things\". This is the beginning of the modem age and its emergence can be traced from St Francis and Giotto to the great Renaissance masters. Italian art still retained a sense of the sublime and it was Northern art, with its interest in the narrative, that came closest to the earth again. Pain and suffering are the lot of the Son of Man and of mankind, yet behind it all, if the observer could open his eyes, was redemption. continued on page 34 30 31Former Pupils PROFESSOR DANIEL T. JONES The most important thing that Waldorf educa tion has given me is an intense interest in how the world works, how people live and work together and in the ideas that shape our thinking. This is what has driven my working life. Rather than follow a career path I have always been fortunate in nding the next interesting thing to do. I now recognise the same sense of interestin my children, awakened by their Waldorf education - and I am profoundly grateful for it. I went right through Waldorf education. Kindergarten in Edinburgh and Classes 1 to 11 in Kings Langley, where my father taught Upper School science. I enjoyed school very much. One of the most influential steps in my school life was going with my class to the Freiburg Waldorf School in Germany for a whole Summer term. This opened my eyes to a different culture and awakened a strong sense of being European and not just English. My connection with Freiburg continues to this day. After doing O levels at Kings Langley, s e v e r a l o f u s w e n t o n t o t h e l o c a l G r a m m a r School to do our A levels. From there I went to Sussex University to read economics. I played an active part in the radical politics of the late 1960s - the anti-Apartheid move ment, the anti-Vietnam war movement and the premature flowering of liberty in Czechoslo vakia in August 1968. There I witnessed the frightening spectacle of any army invading a country that had had its rst taste of freedom - a sobering experience. Inspired by a course on the economics of developing countries at Sussex, I then went to Nigeria on Voluntary Service Overseas. For 18 months I ran a sheries extension project on Lake Chad, on the edge of the Sahara desert.That was both a frustrating and rewarding experience. Frustrating because it took for everto get anything done and rewarding because amongst the poverty one also found lots of laughter and happiness. Stepping right outside our western culture gives you a different per spective on life and teaches you self reliance. Having decided not to make a career as an expatriate abroad I had to nd a way back into our society. The easiest way of doing so was to go back to University to do a Masters degree in economics. This I did at Manchester University - where I also met my wife. That led to a job as a research fellow at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London. This was essentially my apprenticeship in the craft of research, working on the introduction of new energy technologies following the 1973 oil crisis and on the causes of Britain's industrial decline. Four years later I joined a research project at the University of Sussex on the creation of a European industrial policy. During this time I was approached by a Professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to run the European part of what turned out to be two global research projects into the future of the automobile industry. This gave me the rst opportunity to visit America and Japan. What interested me most was not just how different societies worked but how major new ideas came to shape the world economy. The c h a o s a f t e r t h e S e c o n d W o r l d a l l o w e d J o h n Maynard Keynes to inspire the creation of thepost war trading system, Jean Monnet to inspire the creation of the European Community and Arnold Toynbee to inspire the peaceful dismemberment of the British Empire. Allthree were horried by what they saw as young m e n a t t h e Ve r s a i l l e s P e a c e C o n f e r e n c e a n d spent the next quarter of a century seeking better alternatives. When the time came they wereready with the ideas for politicians to imple ment. In a similar way after the 1973 oil crisis, Fritz Schumacher laid the foundations for the green movement. During the 1970s it became clear to me that industrial life in the West had become barren and unattractive to those seeking a rewarding career. Yet without a strong industrial base a nation cannot afford to maintain the basic necessities that underpin a free society. The resolution of this problem was particularly acute for post Imperial Britain, seeking a new home in Europe. In thinking about this I became convinced that Bernard Lievegoed's work (inspired by Rudolf Steiner) on organisation development pointed the way forward for a renewal of industrial life. However it was not until I went to Japan that I saw how. From his under standing of the phases in the development of the human being Lievegoed found a similar pattern of development in the life of rms and other social institutions. The pioneer phase is followed by a phase of differentiation, where specialisation and formalisation are taken to their logical extremes. This in turn is followed, after a crisis, by a phase where the disparate parts of the organisation are integrated again. Integration can only be achieved if the work flows towards the customer and the talents of the individual are fully utilised. Most western rms were clearly stuck in the second phase. However, in Japan circumstances had enabled leading rms to develop a very differ ent set of organisational principles, which closely resembled the integration phase in Lievegoed. I became convinced that it was this that gave them the decisive edge in world markets. To convince the sceptics in western management, we collected a team of young researchers from top universities across the globe and spent ve years visiting factories and dis cussing ideas with managers and workers. The result was the most thorough study of the logic underlying Japanese management, backed up by detailed measurement and evidence that it w a s t r a n s f e r a b l e t o t h e W e s t . W h e n w e published the ndings in a popular businessbook it caught the headlines and sold threehundred thousand copies in eleven different languages.* Western managers told us it helped them 'make sense' of the tidal wave of change they were experiencing. While the book was in press my family and I moved to Hereford and I became a Prof essor of Management at Cardiff Business School, part of the University of Wales. My time is now divided between organising research and teaching at Cardiff, consulting and lecturing to rms trying to implement our ideas and writing the next book. I like nothing better than to walk round a factory, brain-storming changes with teams on the shop floor. When they tell me our ideas have helped them transform their work for the better and win new work for the rm it is incredibly rewarding. The shop floor is the leading edge of change in our society todayand the place where I learn most. I am also the part-time Principal of the rst company 'university' in the UK at Unipart, dedicated to helping managers teach their staff the skills needed to match Japanese performance. We moved to Hereford in order to send our children to the Waldorf school that was started in an old village school house in 1983. Being a parent of such a pioneering school means total involvement - helping to build the school build ings, raise funds, sit on School Council and sort out endless problems. However the rewards are also great - we have watched the school grow from 80 to 200 pupils in ve years and ourchildren have had the example of a community of parents who are really committed to the school. My eldest son has just spent a term on his own in the Heidelberg Waldorf School. The fact that they are teaching the same curriculum makes such exchanges uniquely possible between Waldorf schools. Imagine the perspective gained through studying modem history and literature from a German perspective! His class in Hereford has also been enriched by students from France, Germany and Austria visiting for a term or more - a new generation of Europeans in the making, with new interests and ideas for the next century. *Womack, Jones & Roos, 'The Machine that Changed the World', Maxwell Macmillan. 3233continued from page 12B O O K R E V I E W S explore the three basic linguistic styles of Epic, Dramatic and Lyric. Epic seems to anchor a poem rmly in the past. Great sagas come to mind like the Epic of Gilgamesh mdEabani, stories from the Old Testament or the great Homeric marathons (of the Iliad and the Odyssey) where action can be totally suspended in extended, hexameter-clad simile. In a similar category are those scrumptiously descriptive pages in the novels of Sir Walter Scott where the onrush of events stands still, mesmerised by the beauty of a sunset or hushed by the grandeur of a waterfall thundering through a glen. What a contrast is the dramatic tension galloping through an Othello-, or the cut and thrust of a Macbeth, in which the bard keeps us on the edge of our chairs, the lulls in the storm of destiny only serving to intensify the onslaught of the next thunder-crack and its soaking deluge. Lyric is different again. It washes lagoon like onto the shores of the soul, its images lapping with gentle nuance against the hull of its meaning. Whereas the prow of drama cuts tomahawk-like through the buffeting waves of fate as its helmsman clings steadfastly to the wheel, the bows of lyric bob hither and thither as its bark drifts amicably with the currents of the ebbing tide. These three styles are given a broad introduction in the eighth class in a single main-lesson. In the Upper School, they take on a new dimension and a broader signicance. It is often in Class 9 that pupils have to sustain the full impact of adolescence, an impact that is not made outwardly easier through the fact that it is their rst year without the guidance of the class teacher. It is good that some of the confrontational inevitabilities that come in the wake of this experience are projected into drama. The next stage in Class 10 is one that could be described as taking stock. The study of ancient history, through the long term view involved, can become something of a midwife for thesoul in developing the necessary objectivity at this age (15/16 years). Here the great epics of the Nibelungen from Teutonic culture and those by Homer, mentioned above, are amongst the choice available. Finally in the eleventh class, with the ner degree of objectivity that has been gained, the soul turns inward. Delicately it asks itself existential questions: the whole matter of identity, coming to terms with one's self, with the meaning of life... The lyrical tone of the Romantics often proves to be a supportive companion on this inner path. The spiral leads on, of course, to further assessment in Class 12 before stepping into the next stage of life, now with the advantage of having had time to face all three directions - a trifarious preparation for one's destiny - a time to listen to intimations of the future, to gather inner strength and skills before being thrust into taking on the outer responsibilities of life. After class-teaching, Brien Masters has become involved in teacher training in the Michael Hall Education Seminar, the London Waldorf Teacher Training Seminar and elsewhere. continued from page 31 The main-lesson usually concludes with the paintings of Rembrandt, where darkness and light struggle but also reveal and balance each other. In this journey through art we end with a new age, with faculties that are still unfolding within us where light and darkness contend to reveal colour. The History of Art main-lesson is a reflection of historical evolution but also of our own personal pilgrimage of the soul and we can begin to make sense of this journey through the medium of ideals, as expressed in art, which can give us the strength to continue. Christopher Cloiider teaches art history in the Upper School, at the Rudolf Steiner School of Kings Langley, and as a teacher-trainer.Sky Phenomena. A guide to naked-eye observation of the heavens by Norman Davidson. Floris Books pb 208pp \u00a312.99. W e ail grow up familiar with the sun, moon and stars; the sky is, after all, half our environment. By adulthood, unless our educa tion has been exceptional, although many of us can demonstratea degree of astronomical understanding, this is well mixed with a further degree of misunderstanding and muddled thinking about these daily and nightly phenomena. This book sets out to amplify - and/or correct - our conceptions in such a way as to equip us to teach such topics with conviction and imagination. From my point of view it partially achieves its aim but still leaves many of my questions apparently (to me) unanswered. One of the chief merits of the book is the fact that it is aimed specically at the class teacher in a Steiner school and t h e r e f o r e a p p r o a c h e s e a c h a s p e c t o f t h e s e s k y p h e n o m e n a f r o m an earth-centred view - an explanation of what we can actuallysee with the naked eye (given suitable conditions) in the sky . A limited description of how things would look to an observer out in space is then given. The written text is accompanied by line drawings which greatly help understanding through their clarity , simplicity and sheer number (although after nding a really glaring mistake in one* my condence in them was a little shaken). The rst part of the book is broken neatly into chapters on the stars, the sun, the moon, eclipses and the planets with sections, where appropriate, on Mythology connected with the constellations and how, in historical terms humans have related to and made use of the stars, sun, moon and planets.Throughout, although the historical is well covered, the up- to-date is dealt with too. insofar as it concerns direct human experience and not knowledge via the interpretation of technological data. In addition, in these chapters, ideas for classroom exercises are provided. An important chapter deals with the history of the unfolding understanding of what we now call the solar system and the reader is given not only the ideas generated but also descriptive pictures of the major characters involved. Explanations of the relations of the planetary orbits one to another, including those connected with the platonic solids, are especially valuable. Discussion of the phenomena of comets and meteors leads into a set of exercises on how the conic curves can be generated. E v e n f o r t h o s e o f u s w h o l i v e i n t h e N o r t h e r n hemisphere, the chapter 'The Southern Hemisphere Sky' is a valuable inclusion. Early global explorers encountered many unfamiliar but distinctive constellations (notably, of course, the Southern Cross) and developed a mythology in connection with them. Modem travellers to the south, too. need to adjust to the sun travelling daily through the northern half of the sky from 'right to left' as one faces it and to each season occurring at an 'unexpected' time of year. To the class teacher the chapter on 'The Stars in Poetry' can save hours of searching through anthologies. The ninety-odd poems and poetic extracts range from earliest to modem times and their chronological arrangement allows historically changing perceptions of the skies to be followed. In the appendices data on astronomical events, technical information, astronomical symbols, useful materials and publications (both mainly relating to North America) and famous individuals are tabulated along with star maps forobservers at the equator and a glossary which later I found invaluable. Nonetheless, despite the glossary , illustrative diagrams and care with which Norman Davidson presents his information 1 felt that after reading this most attractive book there were fundamental concepts and facts that I had not grasped. I wanted more view from 'outside' in order to really comprehend the reasons for the phenomena observable from the earth. One particular area of confusion for me was the difference between changes in the sky in the course of a night and changes over a .sequence of nights. I felt, too, a shortage of star maps. In conclusion. I think this is a valuable book, uniquely tailored for the class teacher but one that many teachers will only nd useful if read in conjunction with other astronomy books or with a more knowledgeable colleague. the numbering in figures 25 & 27 Lyndall Foster The Second Waldorf Song Book Collected and arranged by Brien Masters, Floris Books sb I43pp \u00a34.99. T e a c h e r s a n d c h o i r d i r e c t o r s w h o s e l i v e s h a v e b e e n revolutionised by Brien Masters' rst Waldorf Song Book (and I know of many) will jump for joy at the advent of the second. \"Everything that takes place in nature is permeated by a mysterious music\", said Rudolf Steiner in one of his Basel lectures; and to help the child nd its own harmony within these sounds and sweet airs, he recommended that part-singing should start at the age of 10-11 (Class 5). The experience of music's unity within its diversity would n u r t u r e t h e n e e d s o f t h e m o r e ' d i v i d e d ' c o n s c i o u s n e s s o f a child looking out on the world, as the astral body begins t o f r e e i t s e l f . There is no lack of delicious nourishment here. Starting with six rounds and melodies with descants (including a most inventive arrangement of \"The Londonderry Air\"), this anthology moves on through two and three-part songs to four- and ve-part settings. A new genre is also offered: that in which the melody is sung by female voices with tenor and bass accompaniment, or by male voices accompanied by soprano and alto. The shifting flavours of major and minor tingle on the tongue in two-part songs like \"La Petite Fille\" and \"Cancibn del Pandero\"; the rollicking alternation of duple and triple rhythms are relished in \"Doha Blanca\", a delightful Spanish hedgehog song, and in the swinging Thor hammer of Brahms' \"The Blacksmith\" in its three-part setting. Masters has researched far and wide. He has rediscovered classics like the Basque Lullaby, and the sunrise Trio from Die Zauberfldte. in fresh, always challenging arrangements which incorporate a wide variety of singing moods and skills. He has unearthed rarities such as an old Spanish St John's Day ballad. And he has offered heroic four- and ve-part arrange ments of a Schubert/Novalis spiritual song and of Carl Loewe's setting of Byron's \"Destruction of Sennacherib\". Songs from France. Spain and Germany are all offered bilingually: for the Third Waldorf Song Book it would perhaps be good to have something from the rich store of the Nordic countries. The provenance of each song, and concise and pertinent performing notes are given at the back.

Hilan' Finch 1 he Chiidi't'ii of Odin: The Book of Norlhern Myths by Padraic Colum, illustrated by Willy Pogany . Floris Books pb 272pp i'6.99. For those teachers, parents and children who have experienced the magic of Padraic ColunT s The King of Ireland's Son. which has become so much a part of the Class/Grade 2 story content, Moris Books have now published his equally beautiful rendering of the Norse Myths for Class/Grade 4. In Tlie Children of Odin. Padraic Colum has managed to weave the stories of the Norse Gods and Heroes into a wonderful tapestry, shot through with the deep wisdom that underlies these tales and the rich humour and colours of the characters. The Volsung Saga, which tells of the Heroes who lived on Earth and how they interact with the Gods, is often left out of the children's experience of these Myths but here it is included before the nal chapter of \"The Twilight of the Gods' and the glimpse of the new world order which is to follow. Padraic Colum is a master storyteller and his prose has a style that is as fluent and direct, as if one is listening directly to him. It will be an inspiration for the teacher for their own retelling of these tales. The Children of Odin would also make a ne 'reader' foi children, as his style is not only beautiful buteasytorcad. He often reinfoa-cs words from senienee to sentence, which is so helpful for the slow reader and in building up vocabulary . The layout is clear with large print and the original line illustrations by Willy Pogany give the reader an anticipation of what is to follow in each chapter. Stephen Sheen Geometry and the Imagination bv Arthur Renwick Sheen. 4WSiVA Publications. A warm welcome to Sheen's newly published book (rst printed as typescript in 1970). It is a useful addition to the very limited range of Anthroposophical teaching sources in the English language. The book is aimed at the teacher but is not a text book in format. To use it in class, one would need to read at least whole chapters, and then create a teaching scheme from their content. As a result it cannot be used ad hoc but it does provide a good proportion of the basis for a complete Waldorf geometry curriculum. TTie introduction is an excellent guide to the whys and whens of geometry teaching which Sheen states more or less without argument. Content and method follow in chapters which are well illustrated with drawings close to the relevant place in the text. The latter not only supplies an outline of method, but places theexercise in the context of the child's development, and the courseas a whole. This makes it wordy , but valuable reading. The chapter on the beginnings of geometry is especially interesting. It includes an unusual demonstration of Pythagoras'Theorem and also a remarkable synthesis of the basic geometric shapes. Sheen's treatment of the four rules in geometry and of solids is very exciting, and contains much that is new. though the value of the orthorgonal projections, which are neitherillusirative nor attractive, remains uncertain. The conics are also well covered though it could be difcultto convey to children Sheen's synthesis of them all as curves of a d d i t i o n .

David Urieli Living a Spiritual Y ear . Seasonal FesllvaLs in Northern and Southern Hemispheres by Adrian Anderson. Anthroposoohic Press 334pp sb \u00a314.95. The author's meticulous research into the meetings, recorded conversations, notes and lectures of Rudolf Steiner has led him to most important insights and conclusions concerning the celebration of Festivals. He conceives two types of Christian festivals, running concurrently. One commemorates the events connected with the 'life of Christ', the main ones being the birth on 25th December , the crucixion on 3rd April and the resurrection on 5th April. ''The priest(ess), through carrying out the rituals invokes spiritual p o w e r s d o w n i n t o t h e e a r t h l y s p h e r e . \" I i m a g i n e n o t e v e r y o n ew o u l d a g r e e t h a t s u c h c o m m e m o r a t i o n s h a v e t o b e l e d b y p r i e s t ( e s s e ) s . T h e o t h e r f o l l o w s t h e l i f e c y c l e o f n a t u r e t h r o u g h the year and is opposite for the two hemispheres of the earth. It would be held in centres other than the church, and would consist of a festival dynamic, \"presented in artistic performance, in meditation, and esoteric commentary\". The festival dynamic arises through an activity which is the reverse of the task of the priest(ess); it \"lifts the consciousness of the participants up to a spiritual sphere\".T h e w h o l e b o o k p r o v i d e s a b a s i s f o r t h i s s e c o n d a p p r o a c h t o the festivals. The author has not merely paddled in the few anthroposophical puddles that have been lying around for the last 80-90 years; he dives deep into the ocean of earthly and cosmic facts, and then orders his ndings with impressive skill. There are two topics where, with comparatively little change in text, the book might have been more expansive. Firstly , there seems no reason for only placing the seasonal celebrations alongside the commemoration of Christian dates. T h e s a m e s e q u e n c e o f s e a s o n a l f e s t i v a l s c o u l d s i t e q u a l l y m e a n ingfully alongside a Jewish calendar year , for those whom it may concern. It would, moreover, be a signicant step in moving away from the denominational character of Christianity which is such a stumbling block in so many contemporary situations. The second concerns the author's remarks about the situation prevailing at the equator. It docs not seem good enough basically to dismiss the matter by saying that it does not concern large numbers of people. Either the subject needs thoroughly going into in the same exemplary fashion as in the rest of the book, or it needs to be admitted that it is beyond the scope of the work and would therefore need separate consideration. Even with these two reservations, however, one could thoroughly recommend the book to anyone, or any group,seeking for some quality of renewal in their lives, or wishing to change direction in the way the festivals are thought about and celebrated.

T h e y m a k e c l e a r t h a t t h e s e a r c h o f a g r o w i n g n u m b e r o f p e o p l e for a 'new spirituality' mostly springs from positive impulses, showing at the same time how this is reflected in the partial resurrection of a variety of phenomena in the light of his under standing of Anthroposophy and his extensive research of the New Age Scene. His thoughts on issues as diverse as collective mediation, channelling, crash courses in psychic healing etc. may help to better understand the reasons for. as well as the dangers of the inclination towards the nebulous-my .stical or e c s t a t i c . C o n s i d e r i n g t h e w i d e l y d i v e r g e n t a i m s o f m a n y N e w A g e initiatives (with a degree of 'Ego fatigue' possibly the only common denominator), it is questionable whether one can indeed speak of a movement. Whilst Wimbauer and his panncr acknowledge that there are many paths towards spiritual perception besides the one described by Rudolf Steiner, it becomes clear that they mostly involve the suppression of the waking day-consciousness and cognitive faculties needed. Aile und Neue Seclenfahigkeitcn, Vol 34. The introduction to this volume is an essay by Frank Linde. lecturer at the Waldorf Kindergartenseminar Hannover. Here he describes in what ways the development of new soul faculties may be compromised and deflected. For this purpose he has drawn together many relevant indications Steiner gave between 1909 and 1919. thereby pointing the reader to the unique aids for orientation afforded by Spiritual Science. Amongst the surx'ey of the manifold forms the quest for the spirit takes today , this book contains two reports about Findhom. the \"grand old\" institution of the New Age, and an intriguing inters'iew with Eileen Caddy, whose visions inspired its beginnings. Of great interest, loo. arc the contributions by J. Pajunk who speaks about his aspirationsto bring Anthroposophy to the Red Indians. Dcstruklive Kuilc, Schwarae Magic, Scxualmagie, Vol 33. All of us are aware of the disturbing power certain cults or sects such as the Mun-Scct or Scientology arc reputed to have over some people. The rst part of this issue discusses in detail thevarious methods these cults use to exploit their victims. It also looks beneath the surface motives of their leaders, such as personal greed or power, and at the spiritual forces that might beinspiring them. Much of what you read in part 11 - where practitioners of different types of magic (none of it white) arc encouraged to reveal all. while their interviewers anxiously avoid peering at them through dogmatic spectacles - makes for bizarre and disturbing reading. However, as Peter Krause reminds us in his introductory essay, it was Steiner's continuous concern that we should know and confront what he called the counterforces. The ever widening spectrum of possibilities for spiritual experiencecertainly calls for great discrimination. From the profusion of groups and movements whose teachings might be seen to oppose the development of human freedom and individuality. Krause chooses tocxamineGideon nachsmann(Fonlalba)and his \"School of the White exemplifying some of the basic charac- teristicsofmany occultisms spreading in the West today . Krausc's insights into the conflicts experienced by the modem soul, caught as it were between the demands of the material world and a burgeoning spiritual awareness, are suffused with the wannth atid wisdom of the experienced pastoral worker. In this manner he admirably fulls his purpo.se of introducing greater clarity in a realm where much seems obscure. Heidi Hernnun-Duvey Vom Genius tiiuropas by Herbert volume With so much one-sided emphasis, through Maastricht, on Europe, the fourth impression of this valuable work is particu larly welcome. In four volumes arc printed 12 monographs of countries in Europe: Italy. Spain. Portugal and France; the Netherlands and \"England\"; Sweden. Denmark, Norway and Finland; Russia and Germany. Though no index is provided, a guide to the contents in the form of descriptive chapter headings is a great help for the sensitive tourist, the anthro pologist. the historian or the lover of art. The author's remark able capacity stands the test of time.

Thus the reader whose lastc-buds for history have been destroyed at school through an indigestible diet of lists of monarchs and battles will nd Hahn's approach appetising. In 1^93 one is acutely aware of the potentiality that exists for companion volumes on the liastern European countries. If there is no-one with the gifts of Nahn, perhaps the publishers could commission a small team. Though there can be no single solution to the problems thai have erupted in the former Yugoslavia, it would certainly be a signicant help if works such as this were available to further our undcrsiamJing of a country and its people. Liebe zu Africa Many passages in this book - the second and revised edition - will remind the reader through their eminent readability of the best travel literature or even of popular works written by naturalists; yet here the author offers us much more. He achieves this through sheer stature, a deep penetration of the phenomena and an ability to express himself in language which is at once precise where it needs to be. while raising the reader's perceptions and understanding to a level bordering onthe imaginative - all richly accompanied by his own drawings which capture the visual essence of each subject in a way that is refreshingly superior to the photograph, or even \"the documentary\", w ith its danger of producing a kind of mental cholesterol. For instance, the attention is drawn to the contrast between the metabolic ruminants, for-cver grazing, and the \"pendulum\"-swing life-style of the predators, one moment Hopped out in a kind of lounge-cushion fashion and the next springing into muscle-tensed energy-expenditure; there are riveting descriptions of the star-formation made by elephants round an acacia \"thinking with their intestines\" or \"weightlessly\" gliding over the savannah; or we are held spellbound by the spiral made by numberless pelicans as they are drawn into the heights; amused to be shown (he ostrich as a ballerina with the feather-duster of her (ail jaunty and untidy bringing up the rear and the minuscule proportions of her head not so much buried proverbially in the sand but curiously eyeing the social landscape to catch up with the latest gossip; or we are surprised by the rhino's amazing armour-plated nimblcncss as he zig-zags in flight,rhc book also displays skill in artistic juxtaposition: the awe-inspiring root system (and behaviour) of the strangle-g, followed immediately by the termite-seething colonies below and above ground, as well as in the tree-tops. All the above arc examples of species with which wc might have thought wc were already familiar. The book alsoabounds in longer or shorter passages describing lesser known species, like the milk-weed buiterflics with their mysterious poison. And from time to time we are allowed toshare in the author's self-gcncraied satellite-type conscious ness as in his brilliant expounding of \"zebra-geography\", from the Somaliland Ass north of the equator to the quagga zebra in the Cape region. A review must stop somewhere; thankfully the book goes on and on from gem to gem. standing out, giraffe-like, head and shoulders among its genre. Florcnz und die Ccburt der Individuuiitiit: with 87 illiislratioiis (col oured and black and while) DM 78. One could think of a dozen places where Florence - in one aspect or another - might feature in the Waldorf curriculum: in Class 12. Brunelleschi's architectural triumph in completing the dome of the cathedral; in Class 11, the part played by Florence in the birth of the diatonic system; in Class 10, Dante as one of the giants of world literature; in Class 9. Florence - from Giotto onwards - as hub of the wheel of Renaissance art that turned in and through the consciousness of Europe. This is only to mention the aesthetics curriculum in the Upper School. In this book - a major work - Kramer provides evidence in plenty to justify placing Florence as the foremost jewel in the crown of the entire Renaissance. He shows how, in the present age, humanity took its rst steps (here. And they were not faltering. The wealth of sculpture, painting and architecture (to mention only the most impressive arts) and its influence on modern consciousness as Kramer traces it through observa tion. description and insight, achieves huge proportions in this work. The signicance of the material he selects, together with his argument, reach well beyond the realm of art historyto that of the development of humanity as a whole, particularly of human consciousness, something that is a central issue for all those concerned with Waldorf education.(continued from page 16 This is reflected in the following way; a young child may draw people with a larger head, a sphere, and then just a few lines beneath it indicating the body; later there will appear gures with a head, a body and sticks for arms and legs. A good indication that a child has reached school age is that they will draw people with head, trunk and limbs clearly dened, and also with hands, feet, and often, ngers too. Another sign to look for is that the person stands rmly on the ground with the sky overhead. There are other motifs in children's drawings which give a picture of what is happening in their bodily development. For example theform of new teeth growing can be seen in birdsthat are flying drawn like 'ems' in the sky, or in small rather pointed mountains on the horizon. Also the appearance of butterflies in the picture show that some of the life forces are now liber ated from the body and are ready for inner picturing, memory and thinking. We are able to witness these new faculties in many ways. The child is now able to grasp the concept of time. They start to see that something will happen tomorrow because of what has been done today. Their language becomes more creative and a child delights in playing with words, especially in making up rhymes. Their games change too. There is less dependence on props and a lot more talking goes on as thechildren now imagine their surroundings: the forest, the Jungle, the stormy sea. If they are building a house with wood and clothes there is much more direction in what they do. A new social maturity also is reached when thechild is ready for school. They can be still and attentive in order to receive instructions to carry out a task or an activity. Their awareness of theneeds of others has grown and they can take more responsibility for helping other children who may be younger. These, therefore, are amongst the important factors to take into account when we look at a child with the questions: Is he or she now a schoolchild? Has the stage of infancy really been completed? We have to build a picture of the child with care and sensitivity, and also with a sense of wonder for the birth of the new, rich phase of life. The better we are able to do this, and give the right momentum to the education that follows, the more will we be likely to change Jaques' acid cynicism (\"... the whining school boy,... creeping like snail/Unwillingly to school.\") to something more hopeful, something more akin to the eager joy and enthusiasm with which a Waldorf Class One child approachesthe doorway of a new school day.
