Is it right for me? The best way to avoid confusion is to rely on a doctor who knows your health goals and has done the research for you. Schedule with your Holistic Health Clinic provider so that they can generate a treatment plan that reflects your personal needs and expectations. You can rest assured you are getting the support your body requires; no more wasted money on supplements you don't even need. Is it high quality/trustworthy? Unfortunately, the supplement industry is not well regulated by the FDA. This allows supplement manufacturers to get away with using cheap or poor-quality ingredients. Some manufactures may even intentionally mislabel their packaging to make an expired, inferior, or counterfeit product appear to be of a higher quality or potency. Your Holistic Health Clinic provider will not only select the right supplements for you, but will select them from the right sources. Our doctors have done the research to ensure that the specific products we recommend have optimal potency, purity, absorption, biological activity, and are non-allergenic. For purchasing these specific supplements, we offer two access points: our onsite dispensary and our online dispensary, Fullscript. We recommend that if you are not purchasing from either of these two sources, you purchase the product your provider has recommended directly from the manufacturer, whether via a pharmacy or the official company on-line store. We do not recommend buying from Amazon or from any supplement reseller. Cheaper is not better and there is no substitution for the highest quality. OUR APPROACH OUR ONSITE DISPENSARY We have an onsite dispensary for most of the products your doctor will prescribe. These products come directly from specific reputable manufacturers that are known for their purity, reliability, and effectiveness. Because botanical and nutritional supplements are prescribed to our patients to treat their health problems, they are not taxable. Buying directly from our dispensary gives you the guarantee of quality, without the expense of sales tax.
