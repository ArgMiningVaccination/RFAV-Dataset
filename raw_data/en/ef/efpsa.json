While we strive for accuracy and completeness, there are surely additional trials that are not included. Because clinical trials are dynamic studies, there may be inaccuracies due to changes in protocol for selected studies. Index Information : The list is arranged in alphabetical order, largely by commercial name. Two indexes (one by generic name or product description, and one by type of MS/type of patient) and a key to abbreviations are included. Trial Information : Where information was not provided to us or has not been reported, we have indicated that this information is \"Not av ailable.\" Trials that have been completed or terminated are marked as such. These studies w ill be removed after two years. We maintain an archive of older lists, in case of an inquiry, and published studies can be found on PubMed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed . ClinicalTrials.gov : Where available, we have provided the link to the study listing on the ClinicalTrials.gov Web site ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ ). A statement from the International Committee of Medical Journal Edit ors released in September 2004 required investigators to register clinical trials, except studies designed to study pharmacokinetics or major toxicity, such as phase 1 trials ( The New England Journal of Medicine 2004 Sep 16;351(12):1250-1). For studies not registered at the time this list was compiled, this information is cited as \"Not available.\" A list of trials recruiting people with MS is available at: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Research-trialsrecruiting.asp This list is indexed by State and includes international studies.
