MSCs are very potent cells that provide trillions of growth factors and anti-inflammatory properties. MSCs have specific enzymes that reduce inflammation and stimulate cell proliferation, promoting angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation), and tissue remodeling, allowing for faster and more effective healing. MSCs have over a trillion growth factors per 1 mL that help repair bone, cartilage, ligament, and connective tissue. PRP supplies abundant growth factors to amplify tissue repair and promote regeneration. This combination of PRP and MSC enhances the potential for tissue healing, reducing inflammation, and promoting the regeneration of damaged and injured tissue. The Science Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) is a concentrated solution of platelets derived from the patient's blood. Platelets contain a variety of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-), which play a crucial role in tissue repair and healing. When PRP is injected into the injured area, these growth factors accelerate the recruitment and activation of cells involved in tissue regeneration, thereby fostering a more rapid and efficient healing process. [Read more about the benefits of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP).](https://myhopehealth.com/platelet-rich-plasma/) [Read more about PRP with (MSCs) Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can differentiate into various cell types, including bone, cartilage, and fat cells. When introduced to the injury site, they can promote tissue regeneration by releasing growth factors and cytokines that stimulate local cell proliferation, modulate the immune response, and enhance the formation of new blood vessels. Why we use Kimera Labs Kimera Labs\u00ae is an FDA-approved lab. MSC contains proteins, enzymes, growth factors, and exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). in 0.9% every lot is tested for sterility and endotoxin and is quantified and qualified via protein concentration, dSTORM microscopic visualization, NanoSight sizing, mRNA sequencing, Mass Spectrometric protein sequencing, flow cytometric surface marker testing, and visual purity assay for the world's first reproducible pure exosome product manufactured to FDA drug and vaccine production guidelines. Understanding MSC-Exosomes Exosomes are like stem cells. They are a protein that can regenerate cells throughout the body, healing damaged tissue. Compared to adult stem cells, exosomes contain nearly three times the amount of growth factors. Exosomes find and locate inflammation in the body. Once the inflammatory sites are recognized, the exosomes will eradicate the inflammatory markers reducing inflammation in the area and promote healing.

This combination enhances the potential for tissue healing, reduces inflammation, and promotes the generation of healthy functional tissue. PRP and MSC together help repair, remodel, rebuild, and regenerate damaged tissue. Physical Therapy After Injection Protocol: 8 Weeks of Physical Therapy Treatment. If you are going to make a financial investment in your health, we are going to make an investment in YOU and provide up to 8 weeks of physical therapy treatment to further increase your strength and help foster your recovery. Treatment may include the following: - Spinal Adjustments: to realign and promote joint mobility to the spinal vertebra. - Spinal Decompression: to decompress the disc and promote mobility to the vertebrae. - Shockwave (ESWT): to reduce scar tissue and adhesions in the muscles to promote additional healing. - PEMF: to improve circulation through a pulsed magnetic field to promote new bone formation (increasing osteoblasts and osteoclasts) to increase blood flow to the disc to help repair disc injury. - Therapeutic Exercise: to increase core stability and flexibility Conditions We treat NeoGenX utilizes Medical, Chiropractic, and Physical Therapy for chronic pain relief.
