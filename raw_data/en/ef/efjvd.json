On June 30, 2022, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) identified the first case of mpox in a Wisconsin resident. DHS con tinues to work with federal, state, and local partners to investigate and monitor the current outbreak of mpox in Wisconsin in order to prevent further transmission. Colleges and universities should use this toolkit to communicate about mpox and how students and staff can protect themselves. DHS encourages colleges and universities to proactively plan for mpox on campus. Campus health officials should follow guidance for congregate settings from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) and plan for the following actions : Determine testing locations for students or staff who are symptomatic. Identify isolation areas on campus for students w ho have results pending or have mpox . Ensure personal protective equipment and cleaning/disinfectant products are available. Monitor vaccine eligibility requirements for pre and post exposure prophylaxis to prevent mpox . Answers to Frequently Asked Questio ns: Question Answer What is mpox ? Mpox is a rare but potentially serious viral illness. The mpox virus is from the same family of viruses as the smallpox virus. Mpox symptoms are similar to smallpox symptoms but are less severe. It is also less transmissible than smallpox and rarely fatal.

Two smallpox vaccines licensed by the FDA are available to p revent mpox : JYNNEOS, also known as Imvamune or Imvanex, and ACAM2000. Am I eligible to get vaccinated? Due to a limited vaccine supply, DHS is currently following the federal government's recommendation to prioritize the JYNNEOS vaccine for individuals at the highest risk of infection. In Wisconsin, vaccination is now recommended for people who had known exposure to someone with mpox and people with certain risk factors who are more likely to be exposed to the virus. This includes: People who know that a sexual partner in the past 14 days was diagnosed with mpox . People who attended an event or venue where there was known mpox exposure. Gay men, bisexual men, trans men and women, any men who have sex with men, and gender non -conforming/non -binary individuals, who have had multiple sexual partners in the last 14 days. People 18 years and older can receive JYNNEOS as either an injection between the skin (intradermally) or beneath the skin (subcutaneously). People under the a ge of 18 can receive JYNNEOS only as an injection beneath the skin (subcutaneously).

Yes. To help prevent the onset of disease, JYNNEOS should be administered within four days from the date of exposure to the mpox virus.

Mpox Communications Toolkit Page 4 P-03300 (12/2022 ) Who should not be given the JYNNEOS vaccine? People should speak with a health care provider to discuss if the JYNNEOS vaccine is safe for them if they have had: An allergic reaction to a previous dose of JYNNOES, OR An allergic reaction to an ingredient (gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, egg protein, benzonase). People should also talk to a health care provider about getting vaccinated if they have any of the following conditions: Severe, life -threatening alle rgies. Are pregnant, think they can be pregnant, or breastfeeding. Have a weakened immune system. How is the JYNNEOS vaccine administered? The JYNNEOS vaccine is a two dose vaccine series. The CDC recommends that the second dose is administered at least four weeks after the first. JYNNEOS can be administered either under the skin (intradermal injection) or into underlying fat (subcutaneous in jection). People 18 years and older can receive JYNNEOS as either an injection under the skin (intradermally) or into underlying fat (subcutaneously). People under the age of 18 can receive JYNNEOS only as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously).

Mpox Communications Toolkit Page 5 P-03300 (12/2022 ) Template Letter for College Students: About Mpox to Stay Protected [date] Dear [student body], [Insert Institution] is working closely with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) and [Local or Tribal Health Dept] to monitor the current outbreak of mpox . While this outbreak is very different from the coronavirus pandemic, university officials and public health leaders have learned many lessons over the past two years to prevent the spread of infectious disease to keep students and staff safe. Although mpox is a viral infection, it does not spread easily to others and is significantly less contagious than COVID -19. Most people with mpox report having prolonged close contact, including kissing, hugging, and sexual activity, with someone else who has mpox . Mpox can also spread through respiratory droplets and by having contact with items that have been contaminated with the fluids or sores of a person with mpox (e.g., bedding, towels, toothbrushes, or sex toys). We want students to know that the risk of mpox spreading widely throughout [community/campus] remains low. To date, [X] cases have b een reported in Wisconsin residents. While most cases are occurring in the sexual network of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, we want to reiterate that mpox can affect anyone.
