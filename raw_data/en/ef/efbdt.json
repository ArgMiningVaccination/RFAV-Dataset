These are new guidelines intended to help bridge the gap between patient care activities that new physicians should be able to perform on day one of residency training and those they feel ready to perform without direct supervision. The aamc released the new guidelines in June in response to feedback from residency pro-gram directors about the clinical preparedness of entering residents, and from emerging literature documenting a performance gap at the transition point between medi-cal school and residency training. The School of Medicine was one of more than 70 aamc mem- ber schools to apply for a spot in the pilot. The high number of applications \"demonstrates the signifi cant energy and commit-ment within academic medicine toward closing the gap between expectations and performance for residents on day one,\" said Darrell G. Kirch, m.d. , aamc president and ceo . The aamc is a not-for-profi t association representing all 141 ac-credited U.S. and 17 accredited Canadian medical schools; nearly 400 major teaching hospitals and health systems, including 51 De-partment of Veterans Affairs medi-cal centers; and nearly 90 aca-demic and scientifi c societies.

Program, a changing of the guard harold shapiro The mystery of medicine Pursuing a passion for problem solving, while quietly making history As a college chemistry student in the 1970s, Michele H. Johnson, m.d., found herself intrigued by the television show \"Quincy, m.e.,\" about a crime- solving forensic pathologist. In one episode \"they found a femur, and in a television hour, they came up with the drawing of the person. This is so hokey,\" Johnson says, but the show led her to an idea: \"Could I use chemistry to solve medical problems?\" Since then, problem-solving has formed the backbone of Johnson's own narrative. She has also followed in the footsteps of her mother, a chemist, and her father, a neurochemist and the first African-American to receive a ph.d. in chemistry from the University of Delaware. After earning her b.a. in chemistry at the same institution, she entered medical school at Temple Uni-versity, where a medical \"mystery\" on a rotation struck a familiar chord. At St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in Philadelphia, Johnson watched Marie Capitanio, m.d., chief of radiology, use a single chest X-ray to diagnose both cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell disease in a teenager. She immediately saw the value in pairing X-ray clues with clinical knowledge to diagnose patients: \"I learned very early that the more clinical information you know and can apply, the stronger diag-nostician you are,\" she says. After her internship and residency in diagnostic radiology at Temple Uni-versity and fellowship in neuroradiol-ogy at the University of Pennsylvania, Johnson returned to Temple to join the diagnostic radiology faculty. It was an exciting time to be in radiology, she says. Bolstered by the appearance of non-invasive technologies like comput-erized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri), the field blossomed in the late 1970s and 1980s. In 1999 Johnson came to Yale School of Medicine ( ysm), where today she confronts medical mysteries rou-tinely. As professor of diagnostic radi-ology, neurosurgery, and surgery, like any good detective, she throws herself into every case. \"We're not just sitting in a dark room looking at films,\" says Johnson. \"We're part of the patient care team, and I'm very proud that that's an important part of what I do.\" Johnson shows off photos on her ever-buzzing phone of one of the latest advances in neuroradiology, a clot retrieval tool no wider than a blood vessel that resembles a Chinese finger trap. To restore blood flow in the brain after an acute stroke, she uses the contraptio n to snak e through vessels , latch onto bloo d clots , and pull them out the same way she went in. One of the field's biggest chal- lenges, Johnson says, is training new radiologists to apply established fundamentals in using newer, non-invasive technologies. Trainees need to develop the ability to take two-dimensional images and make them three-dimensional in their heads. \"Our challenge as faculty is to teach that effectively,\" she says. In 2012 Johnson completed a fellow- ship in medical education through the medical school's Teaching and Learning Center, to stay abreast of pedagogical trends. She challenges students and residents to think creatively and coop-eratively when faced with novel situ-ations. \"I try to teach trainees that it's more effective to be collaborative than confrontational,\" says Johnson. \"You might even have fun in the process.\" In 2014, Johnson became the first African-American woman named a full professor at ysm, but she doesn't dwell on the subject. \"I can teach technique and anatomy,\" she says. \"Can I teach students to work together successfully for the patient's benefit? That would be the real legacy I'd aspire to.\" The School of Medicine's Medical Scientist Training Program ( mstp ), known on campus as the m.d./ph.d.Program, has undergone a change in leadership for only the fi fth time in its 45-year history. James D. Jamie-son, m.d., ph.d. , professor of cell biology and the program's director for more than 30 years, stepped down this past summer. His successor is Barbara Kazmierczak, m.d., ph.d. Kazmierczak, associate professor of medicine and microbial pathogen-esis, earned her bachelor's and mas-ter's degrees at the University of Chi-cago, and her m.d./ph.d. at the Weill Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan-Kettering Tri-Institutional Program. She com-pleted residency and fellowship train-ing at the University of California-San Francisco. Kazmierczak has studied the pathogen Pseudomo-nas aeruginosa extensively, focusing on bacterial factors important for establishment of disease and on host responses to infection.

PD -1/PD-L1 inhibitors come in two types: drugs that co nsist of antibodies to PD-1, such as nivolumab, and drugs th at consist of antibodies to PD-L1, such as MPDL3280A. Both types counteract this immune shutdown, allowing T-cells to proceed with the destruction of cancer cells. (Incidentally, Chen discovered PD-L1 in 1999 at the Mayo Cl inic.) The PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors offer multiple and distinct advantages. Not only do they halt and shrink so many advanced cancers, their effects also last much longer than those of chemotherapy, since the inhibitors bolster the patient's immune system against his own cancer. And because the immune boost happens at tumor sites, most side effects are minor or readily manageable, so the drugs are better tolerated than chemotherapy. \"Patients don't even have to be hospitalized,\" Chen says. \"They walk in, sit for a half-hour or one hour, and then leave.\" Yale researchers hope to develop biomarkers to identify the patients most likely to benefit from immunotherapeu- tic agents from those less likely, so they're taking biop- sies from responders and non-responders to look for key differences (see related story, \"Better predicting a tumor's treatability,\" at left.). Some tumors, for example, express more PD-L1 than others, and so are more apt to respond to an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent. Researchers also plan to develop effective combina- tions with other immune modulatory agents as yet unde- veloped and with other immunotherapy strategies. From here, the possibilities seem nearly limitless. \"We used to have a paradigm in oncology that the amount of excitement is inversely correlated to the amount of clinical data that you have,\" Sznol says. \"Here, the excite - ment is actually driven by very good clinical data. We're just at the beginning of what we can do with these drugs.\"Designed to guide the immune system in fighting cancer, a new class of drugs is altering the landscape of cancer treatment In the 1980s, immunotherapy researcher Lieping Chen, m.d., ph.d. , embraced the career goal of curing one cancer. That lofty-seeming goal is beginning to look more modest today. Recent clinical trials have shown that one cancer after another is vulnerable to immune modulation therapy, a cancer-fighting strategy Chen pioneered that for years was considered marginal. \"Now it seems like I should retire, because I think these drugs can probably cure multiple cancers,\" says Chen, the United Technologies Corporation Professor in Cancer Research at the School of Medicine. \"This is way beyond my expectations already. I'm very happy.\" The drugs Chen refers to are a group of immune modulation agents called PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. These are antibodies that allow the immune system to attack tumors by blocking a pathway that paralyzes the immune re- sponse, and they've achieved dramatic clinical trial results for melanoma. In September the fda approved pem - brolizumab (marketed as Keytruda) for advanced melanoma, while Japan approved nivolumab for the cancer in July. These drugs have also shown startling effects in kidney and lung cancer\u2014the latter result a game- changer, since lung cancer is responsible for more deaths than any other cancer. These advances appear to be just the start. Alone and in combination with many other agents, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are currently under intense scrutiny in hundreds of studies around the world, showing promise for treating Hodgkin's lymphoma, bladder, stomach, ovarian, and head and neck cancers. At Yale, researchers are building on groundbreak- ing results from the last several years to study these agents in a wide variety of s olid and hematologic tumors. In July, Mario Sznol, m.d., pr ofessor of m edicine, u p- dated colleagues at the annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology ( asco) on a remarkable Phase I melanoma trial. It combines nivolumab and another antibody , ipilimumab, in advanced melanoma patients. While ipilimumab acts on the unrelated ctla-4 checkpoint, together the drugs affect the immune system synergistically. Nivolumab produces an already impressive 63 to 73 percent one-year survival rate, but when combined with ipilimumab the rates rose to 85 percent at one year and 79 percent at two years. (By comparison, chemotherapy offers this population of patients a two-year survival rate of around 20 percent.) Early results appeared i n 2013 in the New England Journal of Medicine. If confirmed in Phase III trials, Sznol says, \"this would be the most active combination that we've ever developed for melanoma.\" Another PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, mpdl3280A, is in trial as well. Half of a group of patients with advanced bladder cancer\u2014who haven't responded to standard therapy\u2014have responded to mpdl3280A, says investigator Daniel P. Petrylak, m.d., professor of medicine and urology. That, he says, \"has been pretty much unheard of,\" since no chemo- therapeutic agent currently exceeds a 20 percent response rate. Some patients' tumors have become radiologically undetectable, and responses have lasted more than 18 months. Similarly, in 2013, Roy S. Herbst, m.d., ph.d., Ensign Professor of Medicine, professor of pharmacology, and chief of medical oncology at Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven, reported at asco that mpdl 3280A was durably shrinking advanced solid and hematologic tumors in 21 percent of patients. Such results are prompting oncologists to rethink the role of chemotherapy, which damages the immune system as it targets fast-dividing cancer cells. Immunotherapy, by contrast, relies on intact immunity. That difference makes it problematic to design trials that combine advances Health & Science News To end brain tumor growth: a switch?Better predicting a tumor's treatability Glioblastomas are among the most deadly cancers: fewer than 5 percent of those diagnosed with the brain tumors will survive more than five years. Researchers know that multiple different molecular pathways work in concert to help the tumors grow, and they've struggled to find drugs that block these cancer-enabling factors all at once. Now, a team of School of Medi- cine scientists has discovered a single protein that can simultaneously weaken glioblastomas and make the environment around the tumors less welcoming to the cancer. Sourav Ghosh, ph.d. , assistant professor of neurology, ph.d. , assistant professor of im- munobiology, and colleagues that blocking the protein\u2014called atypical kinase (a pkc)\u2014inac - tivated growth pathways in glioblas-tomas and reduced inflammation in the surrounding tissue. In mice with glioblastomas, they discovered, administering a drug targeting a pkc shrunk tumors by more than half in just a week. And in people with glioblastomas, higher levels of a pkc were correlated with poorer progno-sis, they reported in the Aug. 12 issue of Science Signaling . The findings suggest that drugs blocking a pkc in humans could be an effective treatment for glioblastomas.Predicting whether a patient's tumor will shrink in response to a treatment has often been a bit of a guessing game. But this may be changing: Yale researchers have identified a way to determine ahead of time whether a wide range of cancers will respond to mpdl 3280A, an experimental drug which blocks the protein PD-L1, a critical \"checkpoint\" for the body's immune response to cancer. Roy S. Herbst, m.d., ph.d. , Ensign Professor of Medicine, and colleagues monitored 175 patients before and after treatment with mpdl 3280A. Across patients with a variety of tumors\u2014including melanomas and cancers of the lungs, kidneys, and co-lon\u2014those with higher levels of PD-L1 in their immune cells at the study's start responded better to treatment. The findings, published Nov. 27 in Nature , suggest a way of selecting patients for whom the new drug will work best and highlight the role of immune cells in the drug's mecha-nism. The research \"could help us design new combination therapies,\" Herbst says.Tackling cancer with a new paradigm istockphotoimmunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic agents. But it also means researchers like Chen foresee a day when immunotherapy will replace chemo as a first-line treatment for cancer. \"The direction is very clear,\" says Chen, also professor of immunob iology, dermatolog y, and medicine. Studies that place the burden of a cure solely on immuno- therapeutic agents are already under way. Scott N. Gettinger, m.d., associate professor of medicine, for example, is studying nivolumab alone or in combination with other agents in advanced lung cancer, with promising e arly results. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors work by disrupting an immune \"shutdown\" caused by tumors. Typically, when the immune system's T -cells arrive at cancer sites, they secrete cytokines, which causes tumors and related tissues to make the protein PD-L1. The PD-L1 then binds to PD-1, a receptor on the Lieping Chen, the United Technologies Corporation Professor in Cancer Research, is a pioneer of immune modulation therapy, a cancer-fighting strategy that employs antibodies to guide the immune system in fighting tumors. Research by Chen and School of Medicine colleagues has led to a new class of drugs that are proving to be more effective and better tolerated than chemotherapy. harold shapiro M@Y_October2014.indd 3 12/18/14 4:05 PM4 w ww.medicineatyale.orgSeptember attended 'Just Blue It Up' ,anevent organized by members o f the Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care and S leep Medicine (pccsm )toraise money forthe P ulmonary Fibrosis Foundation. 1.

His eventual goal is to use stem cells to bioengineer a 3-D culture model of the retina, which would enable scientists \"to test new drugs, and could be transplanted into diseased eyes to treat age-related macular degeneration,\" says Rizzolo, associate professor of surgery and of ophthal-mology and visual science. Funding from the state, federal sources, and private donors, such as the Li Ka Shing Foundation and the G. Yale stem cell research boosted by state With seven grants, Connecticut's commitment to innovative research strengthens Yale stem cell biology Although a young and sometimes controversial field, stem cell research has been hailed for its medical importance: increasingly, medicine has turned to stem cell biology in treating a variety of human diseases\u2014ranging from the treatment of neuromuscular and liver diseases to the gen-eration of skin grafts for burn victims. Weimin Zhong, ph.d., associate professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, is getting at the root of what makes stem cells so medically valuable, studying how they balance their abilities to self-regenerate indefinitely, on one hand, and to develop into any kind of bodily cell or tissue, on the other. To better understand stem cell regulation, the team is inducing mouse nerve stem cells to deviate from their normal patterns of replication. Zhong's research is being supported by a new grant from the state of Connecticut, which this past June award- ed $3.6 million to Yale stem cell researchers. While the federal government has not always been fully supportive of stem cell research (between 2001 and 2009, federal fund-ing for human embryonic stem cell research was restricted to a group of four cell lines), the state\u2014partly in reaction to the federal restrictions\u2014has staunchly supported stem cell research for nearly a decade. The grants are part of a 10-year $100 million commit- ment to stem cell research begun in 2006. Connecticut's program aims \"to foster an environment in our state where scientists can pursue innovative research-work that is already promising new therapies for debilitating diseases,\" said Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. The grants will fund seven projects at the Yale Stem Cell Center ( yscc ). Among these, the yscc received one of only two \"core\" grants of approximately $500,000 each, for continued support and technological development of the yscc 's shared facilities, including its five core labs. Some of the grants are funding research into understand-ing fundamental stem cell biology, such as Zhong's project. Others are funding work targeted at specific disease states. photo courtesy of lawrence rizzolo sequenced as a direct result of projects undertaken as part of the collaboration. Rigor-ous analysis of these sequences has revealed several recurring mutations, believed to underlie the development of drug resistance in cancer, provid-ing key insights into the processes driving cancer progression. The find-ings serve as an important catapult for further scientific discovery aimed at finding potential cures. The renewal agreement allows the collaboration to continue growing on several fronts. In addition to the sequencing initiative, Yale has also launched biochemical and pharmaco - logical studies to identify compounds that may lead to therapeutic candi-dates for certain cancers. These ef-forts have yielded promising results, which will be further expanded in this new phase of the collaboration. Greater focus will also be placed on finding a single therapy that could be used in multiple cancers. \"We could not have asked for a better start to our partnership with Gilead,\" says Joseph Schlessinger, ph.d. , chair and the William H.

Yale's , ph.d. , Ensign advances Health & Science News A step forward in treating Alzheimer'sA new piece of the diabetes puzzle Researchers have known that STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase ( step ), an enzyme key to regulating learning and memory in the brain, also plays a role in dis - eases marked by cognitive defects: in people with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, schizophrenia, and other diseases, high levels of step disrupt the normal development and strengthening of the brain's neurons. Now, a team led by Paul J. Lom - broso, m.d. , the Elizabeth Mears and House Jameson Professor in the Child Study Center, has developed a drug that inhibits step 's negative effects. For five years, Lombroso's team screened more than 150,000 com-pounds in search of one that blocks step activity. Eventually they landed on a drug called TC-2153. In the Aug. 5 issue of PLoS Biology , Lombroso's team reported that TC-2153 reversed memory deficits in mice with an animal version of Alzheimer's disease. By entering the brain and effectively binding to and inhibiting step , the drug prevented the protein from dis-rupting synaptic activity in neurons. The researchers are now testing the compound in other animals with cognitive defects. \"Successful results will bring us a step closer to testing a drug that improves cognition in hu - mans,\" says Lombroso, also professor of neurobiology and psychiatry.Since the 1990s, researchers have struggled to explain how leptin, an enzyme that monitors how much en-ergy our bodies generate, lowers high blood glucose in diabetic mice. Under-standing this mechanism, they've known, could pave the way for new therapies for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D). In the July 2014 issue of Nature Medicine , members of the lab of Ger - ald I. Shulman, m.d., ph.d. , George R. Cowgill Professor of Medicine, report - ed on a mechanism by which leptin mediates its action. The team ob - served that fasting T1D and T2D mice had low levels of leptin, and increasing leptin levels reversed hyperglycemia. They found that leptin inhibits the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( hpa) axis, a critical neuroendocrine pathway that regulates body processes such as stress response. The results suggest \"leptin could be an additional therapy [with insulin] that could vastly improve blood glucose control\" in diabetics, says lead author Rachel J. Perry, ph.d. , postdoctoral fellow in medicine. istockphoto // Alliance (from page 1) also grateful to Dennis Spencer for his many years of outstanding leadership and service.\" The Nixdorff-German Professor of Neurosurgery, G\u00fcnel led the genome-wide associa - tion studies of intracranial aneurysms, identifying several susceptibility loci, as published in two papers in Nature Genetics . Through international col - laborations, his lab identified several genes mutated in malformations of cer-ebral cortical development. The work resulted in publications in Nature and Nature Genetics , and recently in Cell and Neuron , in which a team led by G\u00fcnel identified mutations in the clp 1 and katnb 1 genes in patients with com - plex, structural brain abnormalities. In 2013 G\u00fcnel was the senior author of a pivotal manuscript published in Science , which unveiled that somatic mutations in just five genes, including two that have never been implicated in abnormal tissue growth, or neoplasia, can explain the mutational landscape of a majority of meningiomas, the most common type of brain tumor. This and other genomic studies have formed the basis of personalized treatments for brain tumor patients now ongoing at the School of Medicine and ynhh . Also professor of genetics and neurobiology, G\u00fcnel earned his medi - cal degree from Istanbul University and completed his internship and residency in neurosurgery at ynhh .// Chair (from page 1)Lawrence Rizzolo (left) aims to use stem cells to create a three-dimensional culture model of the human retina. (Above) The retinal pigment epithe-lium ( rpe) sits on a bed of leaky capillaries (bottom of image). To form a blood-retinal barrier, the rpe is polarized. One protein (red) anchors other proteins in the microvillar pole, to interact with photorecep-tors. In the basal pole, the green protein converts signals secreted by the capillaries.

Cooley, the C.N.H. Long Profes - sor of Genetics, stepped down as leader of the Combined Program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences (bbs) July 1 to assume the deanship of gsas . She is succeeded as bbs director by Anthony J. Koleske, ph.d. , professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry and of neurobiology. Cooley, also professor of cell biol - ogy and of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, had served as bbs director since 2001. She received her b.a . from Connecticut College, and earned her ph.d. at the Uni - versity of Texas for research carried out with Dieter S\u00f6ll, ph.d., Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry and professor of chemistry . She was a postdoctoral fellow at the Carnegie Institution for Science, where she established new methods using transposable elements Foundation recognizes geneticist's promise Two on faculty assume new leadership roles Panteleimon Rompolas, ph.d. , mba , postdoctoral fellow in genetics, is the recipient of a 2014 Blavatnik Regional Award for Young Scientists in the category of life sciences. The award, which carries an unrestricted cash prize of $30,000, honors Rompolas' contributions to the understanding of tissue development and regeneration. His research, con - ducted in the lab of Valentina Greco, ph.d. , associate professor of genetics and dermatology, includes examining hair follicle stem cell behavior. To directly address how stem cells maintain and regenerate adult tis - sues, he developed a system that es - tablished for the first time the ability to visualize stem cells in their native environment in real-time in mamma - lian skin. This research, published in 2012 and 2013 in the journal Nature , has enhanced our understanding of stem cell function in live mammalian tissue, and the influence of cell posi - tion on cell behavior and fate. Rompolas is a current Drucken - miller Fellow with the New York Stem Cell Foundation and in 2013 received the Merton Bernfield Memorial Award from the American Society for Cell Biology. He earned his b.sc. at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in Greece, and his ph.d. and mba at the University of Connecticut. The Blavatnik Regional Awards for Young Scientists were established in 2007 to honor outstanding postdoctor - al scientists in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. They are administered by the Blavatnik Family Foundation, which is led by industrialist and phi - lanthropist Len Blavatnik, and the New York Academy of Sciences, an inde - pendent non-profit group committed to advancing science, technology, and society worldwide. Panteleimon Rompolas (left) is a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Valentina Greco (right). for genetic and molecular analysis of genes in the fruit fly Drosophila . Koleske has served as director of graduate admissions for the bbs Program's Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry track and its succes - sor, the Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology track. He is a member of the executive committees of the Interdepartmental Neurosci - ence Program and the Cellular and Molecular Biology Training Program. Koleske earned his ph.d. and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at mit. His research is focused on the mechanisms underlying cell adhesion and how these processes break down in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.
