Find out why (and how) you should add pumpkin to your fall food menu.", "sitename": "EverydayHealth.com", "date": "2022-11-10", "cleaned_text": "It's safe to say fall has become synonymous with pumpkin \u2014 and pumpkin spice \u2014 season. Even before the first hint of cool weather, Starbucks starts serving pumpkin spice lattes and grocery stores start stocking pumpkin-flavored everything, from granola and yogurt to savory ravioli. And then there's real pumpkin \u2014 that is, the orange squash with the seedy insides, which comes into season as fall rolls around. (Officially, pumpkin season can start as early as August and end as late as December, per [WhenIsTheSeason.com](https://www.whenistheseason.com/when-is-pumpkin-season/), but it's most commonly associated with September through November.) So, should you be eating more pumpkin? If so, how do you go about preparing it? And what is pumpkin spice, anyway? Read on for everything you need to know about this iconic fall fruit. How to Cook It: Pumpkin Pumpkin Nutrition Facts One cup of pumpkin, cut into 1-inch cubes, offers the following nutrients, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): - 30 calories - 1.2g protein - 0g fat - 7.5g carbohydrates - 0.6g fiber - 3.2g - - 0.99mg iron - 394mg [potassium](/pictures/foods-high-in-potassium/) - 1.16mg salt On the vitamins and minerals side, pumpkin has an impressive amount of [vitamin A](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/vitamin-a-oral-injection), with 9,870 international units (IU) per cup, or about 494 microgram (mcg) retinol activity equivalents (RAE). That's a great contributor towards the recommended daily value of 900 mcg RAE for male adults and 700 mcg RAE for female adults; this vitamin supports immune health, vision, and cell growth, according to the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/). Pumpkin also is a good source of [vitamin C](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/ascorbic-acid) and [potassium](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pictures/foods-high-in-potassium/). Like [vitamin A](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/vitamin-a-oral-injection), [vitamin C](/diet-nutrition/vitamin-c/) keeps the immune system humming and plays a particular role in helping wounds heal and protecting cells from damage, according to the [NIH](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/). Potassium helps all around the body, from keeping the kidneys, muscles, and heart functioning properly to monitoring nerve responses, per the [NIH](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-Consumer/). Pumpkin also contains some [zinc](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/zinc/). Zinc [aids metabolism](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/best-worst-foods-boosting-metabolism/) and [immune function](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/7-foods-fight-back-immune-system-boosters/), says [Trista Best, RDN](https://balanceone.com/pages/trista-best), an environmental health specialist and consultant with Balance One Supplements, who is based in Dalton, Georgia. According to the [NIH](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-Consumer/), zinc also helps the body grow and develop, which is why it's especially important for pregnant women and children. [superfood](/photogallery/superfoods.aspx)seeds, either. \"The pumpkin itself shouldn't get all the attention,\" Best says. \"Their edible seeds offer a lot of benefits themselves. These seeds are rich in [antioxidants](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/antioxidants-health-benefits-best-sources-side-effects-more/)and contain many minerals the body needs for optimal health.\" They're rich in fiber and [magnesium](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/magnesium/), in particular, according to the [American Heart Association (AHA)](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/10/25/pumpkin-seeds-pack-a-healthy-punch). Plus, pumpkin seeds offer 2.2 milligrams (mg) of zinc per ounce, making them an excellent source of the nutrient, per the [NIH](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/). While the majority of research into pumpkin seeds has focused on animal studies, a [review published in Scientific African in November 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227620303136)noted that the plant compounds in pumpkin seeds could have a protective effect on brain health, heart health, and diabetes management. Further studies are needed to confirm these effects in humans, though. Common Questions & Answers Health Benefits of Pumpkin Pumpkin and its various forms has been shown to potentially help with: Pumpkin Can Boost Heart Health A [previous study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21545273/) found that postmenopausal women who took 2 grams (g) of [pumpkin seed oil](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/potential-health-benefits-of-pumpkin-seed-oil/) supplements daily for 12 weeks reduced their diastolic blood pressure and significantly increased their \"good\" high-density lipoprotein (HDL) [cholesterol levels](https://www.everydayhealth.com/high-cholesterol/guide/). They also saw a decrease in [menopausal symptoms](https://www.everydayhealth.com/menopause/perimenopause-symptoms/), including hot flashes, headaches, and joint pain. Note, however, that this study involved pumpkin seed oil supplements rather than whole pumpkin. Whole foods in general, including fruits like pumpkin, are associated with heart health, as the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/12-heart-healthy-foods-to-work-into-your-diet/) notes. Pumpkin May Prevent Diabetes Complications Another [prior study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21106396/) in animals found taking a flax and pumpkin powder seed mixture helped [prevent diabetes complications](https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/treatment/type-2-diabetes-complications-heart-disease-diabetic-retinopathy-neuropathy-more/). Note, however, that this doesn't prove the same effect would be seen in humans, so more studies are needed. Pumpkin Could Help Treat an Overactive Bladder Pumpkin seed oil may help prevent and treat urinary disorders such as overactive bladder, which affects about 15 percent of people over age 40, according to [past research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032845/). Again, this study involved pumpkin seed oil rather than whole pumpkin, so more research is needed. Pumpkin Could Protect Eye Health Along with its high [vitamin A](/drugs/vitamin-a-oral-injection) content, pumpkin is a good source of lutein and zeaxanthin, two antioxidants that have been shown to offer a protective factor against age-related macular degeneration, according to a [study published in February 2017 in Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5331551/). [Age-related macular degeneration](https://www.everydayhealth.com/macular-degeneration/guide/) is the leading cause of blindness among older adults. Combating Fertility Issues Anecdotally, some people swear by pumpkin seeds to boost [fertility](https://www.everydayhealth.com/fertility/), possibly due to the [zinc content](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pictures/best-food-sources-zinc/). A [review published in the April-June 2018 issue of the Journal of Reproduction & Infertility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6010824/) found that zinc is essential for [male fertility](https://www.everydayhealth.com/fertility/what-men-women-must-know-about-fertility-infertility-getting-pregnant/) and can both prevent and treat sperm-related issues. What Is Pumpkin Spice (and Is It Bad for You?) It might seem like there's a \"pumpkin spice\" version of everything during the fall season. But you may be wondering what exactly pumpkin spice is, and whether it's all that good for you. You might be surprised to learn that there's actually no pumpkin in pumpkin spice at all. Rather, pumpkin spice consists of a blend of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, according to [Scientific American](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/the-rise-of-pumpkin-spice/). (Ginger and other spices are sometimes added for variety.) It's so named because it was originally intended for making pumpkin pies. The earliest premade pumpkin spice was first available in stores in the 1950s; these days, you can still find it in the spice aisle at your local grocery store, but you can easily make your own pumpkin spice blend at home, too. The rise of pumpkin spice-containing commercial foods can be traced back to the 1990s, and the famous Pumpkin Spice Latte (or PSL) from Starbucks launched in 2003. These days, pumpkin spice can be found in cookies, cereals, coffee creamers, crackers, and more. Pumpkin spice itself isn't bad for you \u2014 but when combined with the multitude of sugary and [processed foods](/diet-nutrition/processed-foods-linked-shorter-life-span-study-finds/) it's now added to, it's a lot less healthy. Before you buy your next PSL, consider the following nutrition facts for a grande version with 2 percent milk, provided by [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/menu/product/418/hot/nutrition): - Calories: 390 (130 from fat) Sugars: 50g The saturated fat and added sugar content of this one beverage alone might be disheartening to read \u2014 the American Heart Association recommends a maximum intake of [13 g saturated fat](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats), and [36 g of added sugar for men or 25 g added sugar for women](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/added-sugars). That means just one PSL will push you well over your maximum recommended intake. But you don't necessarily give up your favorite seasonal drink \u2014 there are some easy tweaks you can make to make this drink a treat, without getting tricked. Aside from moderation (for example, opting for a regular coffee most of the time and splurging on a PSL as an occasional treat), you can also make your pumpkin spice latte a bit healthier by choosing sugar-free syrup, fat-free cow's milk or plant-based milk, and skipping the whipped cream on top. Or better yet, consider making your own with a [Healthier Pumpkin Spice Latte Recipe](https://www.everydayhealth.com/healthy-recipes/a-healthier-pumpkin-spice-latte-recipe/) from Everyday Health's staff nutritionist Kelly Kennedy, RDN. Weight Loss Effect of Pumpkin Pumpkins don't have any weight loss superpowers, but they could help you slim down due to their low calorie density and fiber content. One cup of canned pumpkin without added salt offers a whopping 7.1 g fiber, per the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168450/nutrients), making it an excellent source of the nutrient \u2014 consider adding it to a soup, pasta sauce, or smoothie for a boost of fiber. A [fiber-rich diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/photogallery/fiber-rich-foods.aspx) can help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight. It tends to fill you up, so you'll likely stay satisfied longer and may eat less as a result, according to [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983). Again, be careful not to go overboard with pumpkin spice items \u2014 oftentimes pumpkin flavoring is added to [unhealthy foods](/diet-nutrition/top-10-worst-foods-you-should-give-up/), like super-sweet [coffee](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/coffee-healthy-caffeine-content-nutrition-benefits-risks/) drinks and desserts, which may not even contain any real pumpkin. These foods could derail your weight loss efforts. How to Select Pumpkin When you hear pumpkin, you might immediately think of the big orange pumpkins from a pumpkin patch. Those are great for carving and decorating your front porch, but they aren't the ones you'll want to eat. For that, look for smaller pumpkins at the grocery store or farmers market labeled \"sugar\" or \"pie,\" says [Kelly Jones, RDN](https://kellyjonesnutrition.com/), a sports dietitian based in Philadelphia. \"They're smaller and sweeter than carving pumpkins,\" she says. \"A few examples of varieties include Sugar Pie and Baby Pam.\" You'll want to choose a pumpkin that doesn't have any soft spots or bruises as those indicate rotting, Jones says. Avoid pumpkins with a dried-out stem so you know it won't fall off or start to rot, Jones says. \"While you probably won't see pie pumpkins in stores much bigger or smaller, four to eight pounds is desirable so you have a tender flesh.\" You'll also find canned pumpkin puree at the grocery store. Pure pumpkin puree will offer the health benefits of pumpkin, but check the ingredient label before buying. \"Be mindful when selecting pumpkin puree, as it sits right next to the pumpkin pie filling that contains added sugars,\" says [Julie Harrington, RDN](https://chefjulierd.com/), chef and coauthor of [The Healing Soup Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1641526904/?tag=aiponsite-20&linkCode=ic5&ascsubtag=amzn1.idea.U8OGUHA952EJ&creativeASIN=1641526904&cv_ct_id=amzn1.idea.U8OGUHA952EJ&cv_ct_pg=storefront&cv_ct_wn=aip-storefront&ref=exp_cov_chefjulie_rd_dp_vv_d), who is based in Morristown, New Jersey. \"It should just be the pumpkin itself. Many purees incorporate pur\u00e9ed sweet potatoes or butternut squash, too.\" How to Cut It: Pumpkin How to Eat Pumpkin \"While most people think of a syrup-loaded pumpkin spice latte or a special holiday pie, there are many ways to enjoy pumpkin healthfully on a regular basis,\" Jones says. You'll want to eat the pumpkin flesh and seeds, but not the rind. \"Treat the whole pumpkin like you would any other squash,\" Harrington says. Try roasting it on parchment paper at 350 degrees F for about 45 minutes, suggests the [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/how-to-roast-pumpkin/). You'll want to halve the pumpkin, remove the seeds, and top with a small amount of oil and salt before placing flesh-side down and setting in the oven. Baking recipes often call for pumpkin puree. \"Pumpkin puree is such a versatile ingredient and can be incorporated into dishes from breakfast through dinner as well as snacks,\" Jones says. \"I like to add pumpkin puree to [oatmeal](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/oatmeal-benefits-risks-recipes-more/) and pancakes, as well as energy bites and muffins. You can also mix it with sauce to use as a base on pizza or for pasta dishes, or add to chili for extra flavor and nutrition.\" You can pick up canned pumpkin puree from the store, or make your own puree by taking the roasted flesh and pureeing it in a blender. \"I've noticed when I make my own it tends to have a little more liquid, so I drain it with a cheesecloth,\" Harrington says. Both canned and homemade purees are comparable in terms of nutrition \u2014 the major difference is convenience, Harrington says. As for the pumpkin seeds, your best bet is to source your seeds from pumpkins yourself. The store-bought seeds tend to be loaded with salt and, therefore, sodium. Once you've scooped them out of the pumpkin and rinsed them in water, roast on a cookie sheet for 15 to 20 minutes at 350 degrees F. 6 Pumpkin Recipes to Try Pumpkin is commonly found in recipes for soups, stews, granola, and baked treats. Here are six recipes to try: - Warm up with a dairy-free [Creamy Roasted Pumpkin Soup](https://cookieandkate.com/creamy-vegan-pumpkin-soup/). - Put an autumnal spin on your morning oatmeal with [Cranberry Pumpkin Steel Cut Oats](https://minimalistbaker.com/cranberry-pumpkin-steel-cut-oats/). - When stew season is calling, it's time to whip up a [Spanish Pumpkin and Chickpea Stew](https://simple-veganista.com/moroccan-pumpkin-chickpea-stew/). [Healthy Pumpkin Spice Granola](https://veggiekinsblog.com/2019/09/26/healthy-pumpkin-spice-granola/)will help cure your pumpkin spice cravings without refined sugar. - Bring out the blender and use up the rest of your pumpkin puree with this [Pumpkin Pie Smoothie](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/pumpkin-pie-smoothie/). - Start the day on a sweet note with [Pumpkin Pie Chia Seed Pudding](https://sweetsimplevegan.com/2019/11/pumpkin-pie-chia-seed-pudding/). Other Uses for Pumpkins This fall fruit is good for more than just eating. For example, you could make a DIY face mask using pumpkin and a few kitchen staples, acording to [Allure](https://www.allure.com/story/diy-pumpkin-face-mask). [Recent research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36015077/) also suggests that pumpkin seed oil may help with overall scalp and hair health \u2014 even possibly reducing hair loss \u2014 due to its potential anti-inflammatory effects. Once you've taken out the nutritious insides, use the hollowed-out pumpkin as a festive way to serve food or drinks, says [People.com](https://people.com/food/alie-georgia-pumpkin-serving-bowls/). Or, you can make a bird feeder using just a pumpkin, sticks, twine, and birdseed, according to the [National Audubon Society](https://www.audubon.org/news/pumpkin-bird-feeder-makes-happy-harvest-birds). Pumpkin may also help if your dog is dealing with diarrhea. [The American Kennel Club suggests](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/can-pumpkin-help-with-dog-diarrhea/#:~:text=To%20help%20abate%20your%20dog's,your%20dog%2C%20consult%20your%20veterinarian) adding 1 to 4 tablespoons of pumpkin to your dog's food to help with digestion. Start small though to see how your pup reacts, and be sure to check with your vet first to make sure this is a safe remedy for your furry companion. Side Effects of Pumpkin There aren't any notable side effects to eating pumpkin. \"Pumpkin is very nutrient-dense, versatile, and pretty welcoming to all diets, though it's always best to check with your doctor if you are unsure about incorporating a certain food into your diet,\" Harrington says. Also, while considered rare, it's possible to be allergic to pumpkin, especially if you have a history of any allergies to other winter squash like spaghetti or butternut squash. If you develop any suspicious symptoms, such as itchy eyes, [skin rashes](/skin-and-beauty-photos/common-skin-rashes.aspx), or other possible allergic symptoms after preparing or eating pumpkin, the [London Allergy and Immunology Centre](https://www.allergycliniclondon.co.uk/does-my-child-have-a-pumpkin-allergy/) recommends seeing a doctor for testing and treatment. Finally, a [case study published September 2021 in Nutrition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34091191/) investigated the possibility of [allergic reactions](/allergies/) to pumpkin seeds, noting an instance where a 2-year-old experienced [anaphylaxis](/anaphylaxis/guide/) after eating pumpkin seeds. The same patient was not allergic to pumpkin pulp. Again, it's important to talk with a doctor if you experience any signs of an allergic reaction to pumpkin pulp, seeds, or rinds. A Summary on Pumpkin Pumpkins are everywhere in the fall, and they make a nutritious addition to your meals, too. Pumpkin is rich in vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium, and the seeds offer fiber and magnesium. While more research is needed to support specific health claims, experts do know that pumpkin is beneficial to your health overall. Enjoy it roasted or pureed and added into stews and baked goods. Just beware of pumpkin spice treats \u2014 they tend to be overly sweetened and devoid of real pumpkin. Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking - Pumpkin.
