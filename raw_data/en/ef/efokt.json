Eleven children died and multiple children were disabled following the trials. In 2000, a reporter at T he Washington Post published an expos\u00b4 e alleging Pfizer's fault in the children's deaths and for unethical medical trials. The news sent shockwaves throughout Nigeria , sparking a series of protests led by Muslim religious leaders alleging that Pfizer and \"the West \" were trying to kill Muslims with medicines and calling for boycotts of vaccinations among Muslims. The subsequent reduction in routine child vaccination among Muslim mothers set back global polio eradication efforts by over a decade; negative effects lasted for up to 12 years after the initial disclosure. The event provides evidence to study the effects of negative news about vaccination on vaccine hesitancy and noncompliance. We assess the effects of the 2000 Washington Post disclosure on child vaccination outcomes using a difference- in-differences strategy comparing differences in child vaccination outcomes across Muslim versus non -Muslim mothers (first difference), for children born before versus after the Washington Post revelation of the Pfizer drug trials in 2000 (second difference). We focus on Muslim mothers because the victims were Muslim children and the boycotts against vaccination were led by Muslim religious leaders in the aftermath of the drug trial disclosure in 2000. We find that the Washington Post disclosure of the Pfizer trials led to significant reductions in routine vaccination \u2014namely, tuberculosis (BCG), diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT), polio, and measles vaccinations \u2014of children born to Muslim mothers after the disclosure. Muslim mothers reduced BCG, DPT, polio, and measles vaccination rates by 9.1 percentage points (pp), 8.9 pp, 5.1 pp, and 8.6 pp, respectively, equivalent to an 11 percent to 27 percent reduction in child vaccination of children born to Muslim mothers relative to the pre -disclosure sample mean. We show that the effects are largely driven by educated Muslim mothers and Muslim mothers residing in minority Muslim neighborhoods with relatively stronger ties to religious networks. The disclosure did not affect other health- seeking behavior of mothers; the reduction effect is specific to child vaccination, not other child health outcomes. The results provide insight into the drivers of vaccine he sitancy and noncompliance, with 3 over 1.5 million people, many of them children, dying each year from vaccine preventable diseases.1 We add to several distinct literatures. First, our work is relate d to the recent economics literature on the role of medical malpractice and negative news on long- term trust in health institutions and health behavior (Alsan and Wanamaker, Chou, and Lai, 2020; Chang, 2018); including work on the effects of the Tuskegee trials on health outcomes of African American men (Alsan and Wanamaker, 2018), a CIA vaccine ruse on immunization in Pakistan (Martinez- Bravo and Stegmann, 2021), and colonial medical campaigns on mistrust in medicine in Africa (Lowes and Montero, 2020). We complement previous work by examining how mothers choose to vaccinate their children in response to negative news about vaccines. We also show how such responses are driven by the mother's education (Cutler and Lleras -Muney, 2010; Ke nkel, 1991; Anderberg, Chevalier, and Wadsworth, 2011). Our work also adds to the nascent literature on the economics of religion. Past work focused on Christians/churches has linked participation in religious networks to economic development (Iannaccone, 1998; Iyer, 2016) and demand for insurance (Auriol et al., 2020). Here, we provide evidence from Muslim populations, an understudied group in this literature, and focus on the important role of religious networks in diffusing information on health, particularly among minority communities where individuals may cleave more strongly to these networks in the absence of neighboring family ties. Past research has shown that these networks can be particularly important ways of spreading information to improve health among minority communities (Ellison and Sherkat, 1995; Levy -Storms and Wallace, 2003). Our paper illustrates how religious networks can reduce health behavior by diffusing negative news about vaccines, with consequences for future vaccine hesitancy. 2 Context: The Pfizer Epidemic Drug Trials in Nigeria In 1996, Nigeria experienced one of the worst meningitis epidemics in the country's history, with 109,580 cases and 11,717 deaths (Mohammed et al., 2000). Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the lining of the brain that is especially virulent in children, and endemic in N orthern Nigeria (Archibong and Annan, 2017). Northern Niger ia is also a majority Muslim region ; around 99 percent of residents in Kano state, where the infectious disease hospital was located, identify as Muslim (Figure 1). At the hospital in Kano, the nonprofit Doctors Without Borders treated children 1 Children's Hospital of chloramphenicol, a well-known antibiotic endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to treat bacterial meningitis (P erlroth, 2008). Over the same period, Pfizer, a U .S. pharmaceutical company, was trying to launch its new antibiotic drug, Trovan. While Pfizer had tested the drugs on adults, it had not yet been tested on children (Perlroth, 2008). Additionally, early testing on adults had shown some serious side effects of the drugs, including liver problems and cartilage abnormalities (P erlroth, 2008). After being alerted to the news of the meningitis epidemic in Nigeria, Pfizer decided to use the epidemic as an opportunity to test the efficacy of Trovan in pediatric settings. Pfizer staff flew to Kano, set up a site beside the Doctor Without Borders testing area, and over 2 weeks selected a sample of 200 children aged between 3 months and 18 years to participate in drug trials for Trovan. One hundred children were given full daily doses of Trovan over the course of a five-day treatment in the treatment group. The other 100 children in the control group were given ceftriaxone, an antibiotic widely recognized as standard treatment for meningitis. The children in the control group were given a lower than normal dose of ceftriaxone, allegedly only a third of the WHO- recommended dose at the time, over 4 of the 5 days of the treatment course (P erlroth, 2008; Ahmad, 2001). A month later, 11 of the children that had participated in the Pfizer trials were dead. Additionally, numerous parents of children involved in the trials reported disabilities among their children, including paralysis and liver failure. In December 2000, a reporter at T he Washingto n Post broke the story of the Pfizer epidemic drug trials in a series of expos\u00b4es, alleging Pfizer's fault in the deaths and disabilities of multiple children and accusing Pfizer of conducting unethical experimental trials on children without attaining informed consent of participants (Stephens , 2000; Ezeome and Simon, 2010). A snapshot of the headlines is shown in Figure A1 in the Appendix. Parents alleged that they had not been inform ed of the experimental nature of the Pfizer trials, with many reporting that they thought they were receiving the standard medication issued in the neighboring Doctors Without Borders area at the hospital site in Kano (Ahmad, 2001; Perlroth, 2008; Wise, 2001) .2 The disclosure sent shockwaves throughout Nigeria, prompting a series of protests in Muslim states in northern Nigeria in 2001. Protesters, led by Muslim religious leaders, highlighted the deaths of Muslim children and the fact that the trials had been conducted in a Muslim state as evidence for the claim that Pfizer and its associated \" Western \" institutions were targeting and trying to kill 2 After approving Trovan for other uses in 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised Pfizer to pull the drug citing safety concerns over deaths from Trovan -linked liver injuries (Perlroth, 2008). 5 Muslims with vaccines (Yahya, 2007). Pfizer denied any wrongdoing, stating that the children died of meningitis not their drug (Ahmad, 2001; Perlroth, 2008). 2.1 The Aftermath Following the Washington Post revelation, a panel of experts hired by the Nigerian government conducted its own investigation and released a report finding Pfizer at fault in the children's deaths and guilty of conducting human trials without informed consent (Ezeome and Simon, 2010; Lenzer, 2006; Stephens, 2006). The report cited the Washington Post article as how the officials discovered news of the trials, with a snapshot of the report shown in Figure A2. In the following years, a series of lawsuits were filed against Pfizer by parents of children involved in the trials and the Kano state government. An out-of-court settlement was reached for, allegedly, $75 million to Kano state and $175,000 to four families of dead children in 2009. The incident heightened distrust among Muslims toward vaccination campaigns led by \"Western \" nonprofits like the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), a consortium including the W HO and the Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), aimed at eradicating polio worldwide (with a particular focus on Nigeria where more than 40 percent of the 677 new polio cases worldwide were recorded in 2002) (Y ahya, 2007; Frishman, 2009). Tensions culminated in a 2003 boycott , led by Muslim religious leader s, of the GPEI -led polio mass vaccination campaigns in five Muslim northern states in Nigeria, buoyed by rumors that the vaccination effort was part of an effort by Westerners to spread HIV among Muslims and cause infertility in Muslim girls. In interviews explaining support for the boycott, respondents explicitly cited the Pfizer drug trials, with one respondent stating, \"We cannot trust the white man or our federal government because many years ago they were in partnership when they brought medicine to poison our people\" (Yahya, 2006; J egede, 2007) . The boycotts continued for over a year and ended only after federal government officials worked with local religious leaders to demonstrate the safety of the vaccine (Yahya, 2006; Ghinai et al., 2013) . The boycott also led to a 30 percent increase in polio prevalence, setting back global polio eradication efforts by over a decade, with Nigeria becoming one of the last countries in the world to be declared polio- free in 2020 (Ghinai et al., 2013; Yahya, 2007). The Pfizer trials remain a point of tension among Muslims in Nigeria, with the specter of Muslim children's deaths often referenced any time health authorities attempt to conduct mass vaccination campaigns in the country (Masquelier et al., 2012; Nasiru et al., 2012). 6 3 Data and Empirical Strategy 3.1 Data To examine the effects of the 2000 Washington Post news revelation of the Pfizer drug trials on child vaccination outcomes, we use available data from the birth recode (BR) of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for four rounds of surveys between 1990 and 2013. The dataset documents individual mother s' reported vaccination of children born between 1985 and 2013.3 It also records the mother's religion. The DHS sample reflects the religious composition of Nigeria and is split almost evenly between Muslims (57 percent ) and Christians (41 percent ) (Archibong, 2019),4 varying geographically by state as shown in Figure 1. We assemble available information on routine vaccination in the DHS, namely: BCG (tubercul osis), polio, DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus) and measles vaccination. Our main outcome of interest is an indicator that equals one if the child has received the BCG or measles vaccine or any dose of the DPT or polio vaccines. The recommended schedule for routine vaccination of children by WHO standards is at or near birth for BCG, DPT and polio, and at 9 months for measles, with most children receiving recommended vaccines within their year of birth (Organization, 2019) . To examine the effects of the 2000 disclosure on mothers ' own health -seeking behavior, we collect data on mothers ' reported prenatal care source from the DHS. Other child health outcomes examined include whether the child is currently stunted or underweight .5 Summary statistics are provided in Table A1 in the Appendix. To explore links between vaccination rates and cases of disease, we digitized 10 years of available archival data on disease incidence in Nigeria from 1985 to 1995 from the Federal Ministry of Health. Panel A of Table A2 in the Appendix shows a significant negat ive correlation between child vaccination coverage in the prior year, t 1, and current year, t , disease incidence. In line with findings from the scientific literature, vaccination coverage of up to 90 percent in the previous 3 For the BR sample, mothers aged 15 -49 are individually interviewed to gather information on every child ever born to the woman. For each of the women interviewed, the BR has one record for every birth. The dataset is missing data on children born between 1991 and 1997 as the DHS only collects responses for children born in the five years prior to the survey. 4 The remaining 2 percent of the sample identifies as other/traditional religion adherents. 5 A child is considered underweight by WHO standards if they have a weight for age z -score (WFA z) of less than - 2.0 while a child is considered stunted with a height for age z- score (HFA z) of less than -2.0. 7 year is needed for herd immunity/positive external benefits of vaccination in reducing the caseload of disease (Chen and Fu, 2019). Lastly, to explore mechanisms and the potential role of Muslim religious networks in disseminating information around the Pfizer drug trials and intensifying the effects of the news announcement on child vaccination outcomes, we assemble data on religiosity and perceptions of corruption and trust in religious leaders, neighbors , and state officials from available Afrobarometer surveys over four rounds from 2003 to 2014. The data appendix and Table A3 in Section A.2 provide further detail on these sources. Figure 1 shows differences between mothers' outcomes and child vaccination rates for Muslim v ersus non- Muslim mothers of children born between 1985 and 2013. Muslim mothers have lower education attainment, marry earlier , and report lower vaccination and child health outcomes for children. We examine the differences in mean vaccination outcomes for Muslim versus non-Muslim mothers for children born before and after the 2000 Washington Post disclosure of the Pfizer drug trials in Table A1. Muslim mothers in the sample report significantly lower child vaccination rates on average than their non -Muslim counterparts. 3.2 Empirical strategy Our aim is to assess the effect of negative news about the Pfizer drug trials on Muslim children on child vaccination outcomes. We assume that the year of birth and mother's religious identity jointly determine a child's exposure to the shock induced by news of the Pfizer drug trials.6 Since the Pfizer drug trials occurred in 1996, it is plausible that news about the trials may have already begun diffusing among Muslims through religious \"whisper networks\" as has been documented in other settings (Martinez- Bravo and Stegmann, 2021). Given information diffusion among these networks, we adapt the strategy from Martinez -Bravo and Stegmann (2021) and consider children born between 1996 and the 2000 Washington Post disclosure year as partially exposed to the news about the Pfizer trials. Children born after the 2000 disclosure \u2014after the information about the trials is fully revealed \u2014are considered fully exposed to the news. Children born before the trials in 1996 are considered non-exposed . Our main specification is an interacted difference- in-differences (DD) model comparing 6 In contrast with Martinez- Bravo and Stegmann (2021), we do not have complete information on exact dates of child vaccination, so we use the recorded years here. 8 differences in child vaccination outcomes across Muslim versus non- Muslim mothers (first difference), for non- exposed and fully exposed cohorts of children born before versus after the Washington Post revelation of the Pfizer drug trials in 2000, respectively (second difference). To produce a distinct comparison, we exclude partially exposed cohorts from the sample (Martinez - Bravo and Stegmann, 2021). We estimate panel regressions lin king child vaccination outcomes for child i born in year r and located in district d and state s at survey year t to a measure of post -2000 birth year assignment, Post 2000 r, that is interacted with the religion of the child's mother Muslim idst: yidsrt = Post 2000 r midst +Musli midst + XiJ dsrt + \u00b5d + t + r + sr + sidsrt (1) s \u00b8 x Post 2000 r and Muslim idst are binary indicators for children born after (post) the 2000 news revelation and for the mother's reported Muslim religious identity , respectively. This specification includes district fixed effects, \u00b5d, which capture unobserved differences that are fixed across districts or local government areas (LGAs), the smallest administrative neighborhood unit in Nigeria7 It also includes birth year fixed effects, r, that control for potential life cycle changes across cohorts, and survey year fixed effects, t, that control for potential changes across survey collection practices over time. The state -by-year fixed effects, sr, control for time -varying changes to vaccination outcomes that are common across states, e.g., differences in health policies and infrastr ucture across states; such relevant policies are generally taken at the state level in Nigeria (Khemani, 2006). The specification includes controls for the mother's age at birth and level of edu cation, Xidsrt. Our key parameter of interest, , captures the post -2000 birth year effect of being a Muslim mother relative to non- Muslim mothers on child vaccination outcomes for fully exposed versus non-exposed cohorts, controlling for differences in the Muslim -non- Muslim -mother child vaccination rates in each district (). Without preexisting trends in vaccination rates that correlate with the mother's Muslim identity, we expect to find no effects for non- exposed cohorts, i.e. 0. For fully exposed cohorts, 7 Nigeria is a federation with 36 states, a capital at the Federal Capital Territory in Abuja, and 776 local government areas (LGAs). See Archibong (2019) for institutional details on the country. 9 we expect < 0 as exposure to the Washington Post news in 2000 and the subsequent anti -vaccine rhetoric and vaccine boycotts led by Muslim religious leaders make Muslim mothers hesitant to vaccinate their children. For partially exposed cohorts, we also expect negative effects, as their vaccination years occur under the early diffusion of news about the Pfizer trials among Muslim networks. To test that the effects of the 2000 disclosure on child vaccination outcomes of Muslim mothers, , will be stronger among mothers with more information on vaccination\u2014as discussed in Section 1\u2014we conduct heterogeneity analysis, estimating Equation 1 in the split sample among educated mothers, with non- zero years of schooling. To test that will be stronger among Muslim mothers living in minority Muslim neighborhoods with relatively stronger religious networks, as discussed in Section 1, we estimate Equation 1 in the split sample among mothers living in minority Muslim neighborhoods, defined relative to a 50 percent threshold. 3.3 Validity of Design Our empirical strategy requires a primary identifying assumption, namely that in the absence of news about the Pfizer trials, vaccination rates across birth cohorts would have been similar for children born to Muslim and non- Muslim mothers. The evidence shown in the event study coefficients in Figure 2 supports this assumption. The estimates for the non- exposed birth cohorts fluctuate around zero. Additionally, we show that the Muslim -non- Muslim child vaccination gap was generally not systematically different prior to the 2000 disclosure in Table A2 in the Appendix. The estimates for the fully exposed cohorts shown in Figure 2 are negative, in line with the predictions in Section 3.2. There is a sharp drop in vaccination for children born to Muslim mothers after the 2000 news disclosure, with vaccination rates reaching their lowest levels in 2001 for all vaccination outcomes except polio, whe re vaccination rates decline past 2001 and reach their lowest level in 2002. The DD strategy outlined in Equation 1 also requires that the estimates of reflect the effect of the Pfizer drug trials news disclosure on the chil d vaccination outcomes of Muslim mothers as long as there are no other structured shocks to Muslim mothers that affected health access or health -seeking behavior, that were correlated with the timing of the disclosure. The fixed effects and controls included in Equation 1 flexibly control for the pre-disclosure Muslim -non- Muslim - mother child vaccination gap and for time-varying threats to identification such as national trends in vaccination campaigns that affected Muslim women. 10 Comparably, although access to health care, including the numbers of health personnel and quality of health infrastructure , differs and has historically differed for residents in poorer, N orthern Muslim states from their richer, S outhern, less Muslim counterparts ,8 any time-invariant geographic difference s in these factors are absorbed by the district fixed effects. State -year effects net out any time-varying health benefits or costs asso ciated with location that affected the general population and might confute interpretation of our results. If our attempts to control for any changes in health investments that affected Muslim mothers differentially are insufficient, most policy changes coinciding with the timing of the 2000 news disclosure were aimed toward improving access for Muslim populations and would likely bias our estimates toward zero. 9 4 Effects of the 2000 Washington Post Disclosure of Pfizer Drug Trials on Child Vaccination Outc omes 4.1 Main Estimates Table 1 reports estimates of the effects of the 2000 Washington Post disclosure of the Pfizer epidemic drug trials on child vaccination outcomes.10 Our main results are in column (1) across four panels A, B, C , and D for whether or not the child received the BCG, any dose of the DPT, any dose of the polio vaccine , or the measles vaccine, respectively. Across all vaccination outcomes, the 2000 Washington Post revelation of the Pfizer drug trials reduced child vaccination outcomes for children born to Muslim mothers after the disclosure year; the interaction estimates are negative and strongly significant at conventional levels. The 2000 Washington Post disclosure led to a significant reduction in BCG vaccination rates for children born to Muslim mothers after the disclosure by 9.1 percentage points (pp)\u2014approximately 21 percent of the pre-disclosure Muslim mother sample mean. Estimates of the effect of the 2000 Washington Post disclosure on DPT vaccination in column (1) of Panel B, show that Muslim mothers reduced DPT vaccination rates by 8.9 pp\u2014about 22 percent of the pre -disclosure Muslim mother sample mean. Results for the effects of the disclosure on polio vaccination rates are shown in column C, with Muslim mothers reducing vaccination rates 8 Figures A6 and A7 in the Appendix provide a snapshot of access to and quality of health care by state in Nigeria from a comprehensive 2012 survey of health facilities. See (Archibong, 2019) for data details. 9 We find increases in the share of nurses/midwives in health personnel in majority Muslim states between 1991 and 2012 in line with increases in health investments in these areas, with results shown in Table A10. 10 Results with estimates from Equation 1 are provided in Table A4 and overall effects are summarized in Figure A4 in the Appendix. 11 of children born after the 2000 revelation by 5.1 pp\u2014 approximately 11 percent of the pre - disclosure Muslim mother sample mean. Results for the effects of the disclosure on measles vaccination rates are shown in column D, with Muslim mothers reducing vaccination rates of children born after the 2000 revelation by 8.6 pp- approximately 27 percent of the pre-disclosure Muslim mother sample mean. 4.2 Heterogeneous e ffects by education and neighborhood r eligious composition In column (2) to column (5) of Table 1, we explore heterogeneous effects by splitting the sample by education and district or neighborhood religious composition. First, we explore the role of education by dividing the sample into educated (with non- zero years of education) and non- educated (with zero years of education) mothers in columns (2) and (3) respectively. The educated and non- educated samples are roughly equally sized as shown in Table 1. In contrast to results in Alsan and Wanamaker (2018), here we hypothesize that the effects of the 2000 Pfizer drug trial disclosure should be stronger for educated mothers, who would have access to more information, be literate and hence more likely to have read the news and be more informed on health practices as shown in previous literature linking education and news consumption in Nigeria (Larreguy and Marshall, 2017). The results show that the effects of the 2000 Washington Post disclosure on vaccination of children born to Muslim mothers are driven by educated mothers across all vaccination outcomes. Educated Muslim mothers reduce BCG, DPT, polio, and measles vaccination of their children by 7.3 pp, 8.7 pp, 6.7 pp, and 9.1 pp, respectively, an approximately 17 percent , 21 percent , 14 percent , and 29 percent reduction in vaccination relative to the pre -disclosure Muslim mother sample means. There is no significant effect of the 2000 Washington Post disclosure on the vaccination outcomes of non-educated Muslim mothers as shown in column (3) of Table 1. Following the literature on minority group cleavage to own social networks \u2014where, for example, religiou s individuals may cleave more strongly to religious networks in areas where they are the minority and far from neighboring family ties \u2014described in the Introduction, we hypothesize that the effects of the 2000 Pfizer drug trial disclosure may be stronger for Muslim mothers residing in minority -Muslim neighborhoods than those in majority -Muslim neighborhoods. These individuals may be relatively less trusting of their out-group neighbors and consequently adhere more strongly to religious networks and hence would be more exposed to anti -vaccine messaging from religious leaders. Using DHS averages on the share of Muslim mothers in each district over the entire 1990-12 2013 survey, we divide the sample into Muslim -minority districts or neighborhoods where Muslims make up less than or equal to 50 percent of the neighborhood and Muslim -majority districts where Muslims make up over 50 percent of the neighborhood. The majority -Muslim sample has more observations than the minority -Muslim sample. The results are shown in columns (4) and (5) of Table 1 for the Muslim-minority and Muslim-majority neighborhood samples respectively. The effects of the 2000 Washington Post disclosure of the Pfizer drug trials on child vaccination outcomes of Muslim mothers are significantly distinct for Muslim mothers residing in minor ity-Muslim neighborhoods from Muslim mothers in majority -Muslim neig hborhoods at, at least, the 5 percent level. Across all child vaccination outcomes, Muslim mothers in minority - Muslim neighborhoods significantly decrease their vaccination outcomes for children born after the 2000 disclosure by between 6.3 pp (BCG) to 9.9 pp (DPT); the point estimate for the effect of the disclosure on child vaccination outcomes for Muslim mothers in majority- Muslim neighborhoods is essentially 0 as shown in column (5) of Table 1. 4.3 Effects on h ealth -seeking behavior and other c hild h ealth outcomes To evaluate whether the 2000 Washington Post revelation of the Pfizer drug trials affected health behavior and parents ' investments in children's health more generally or just child vaccination behavior of Muslim mothers, we estimate Equation 1 with mother's prenatal care source (own health - seeking behavior) and other child health outcomes (stunting and underweight). The results are shown in Table 2. There is no change in Muslim mothers ' use of nurses/midwives (nurses) or traditional birth attendants post 2000 as shown in Panel A. The only difference is a significant decrease ( -5.7 pp) in the use of doctors for prenatal care in column (1) of Panel A, driven entirely by reductions among non- educated mothers as shown in column (3). The decrease in the use of doctors among poorer, non- educated mothers is in line with previous literature highlighting an exodus of doctors from poorer regions in the Muslim north to richer regions in the less Muslim south or out of the country (Doctor et al., 2012). Table A10 i n the A ppendix shows this de crease in the share of doctors in health personnel in majority-Muslim areas in the post-2000 period. Panel B of Table 2 shows no changes in underweight or infant mortality outcomes for children born to Muslim mothers after the 2000 Washington Post disclosure in columns (4) and (7). If anything, children born to Muslim mothers after 2000 are healthier, as measured by the lowered stunting outcomes in column (1), with outcomes driven entirely by reductions in child stunting among children born to non-educated, Muslim mothers in column (3). 13 4.4 Cost estimates Being unvaccinated increases an individual's risk of infection from the disease (Yahya, 2006). The costs of treatment of these illnesses can be significant and incur large financial burdens on households (Archibong and Annan, 2017). The objective of this section is to conduct simple back \u2014 of-the-envelope calculations on the potential costs of treatment from an increased number of unvaccinated Muslim children as a result of negative news about the Pfizer drug trials. We assemble data on direct medical costs of treatment of the four diseases in Nigeria from the scientific literature and calculate lower bound estimates of the costs of treatment if 20 percent of unvaccinated Muslim children born each year from 2001 to 2013 had fallen ill. We compare these cost figures to the counterfactual scenario if the Pfizer trials disclosure had not occurred, using the regression estimates from Section 4.1. The results are shown in Figure A8 and Figure A9, along with a detailed description of the methodology in Appendix A.5. Using our most conservative estimates of direct medical costs only, and without factoring in any potential deaths from disease, the reduced vaccination of Muslim children in the aftermath of the Pfizer drug trials incurred a total potential cost of treatment of $94,128,449 over the counterfactual scenario. This cost is over $19 million higher than the Pfizer settlement to the Nigerian government of $75 million. 5 Mechanisms The results presented in Section 4, along with the historical context presented in Section 2, are consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction in vaccination outcomes among Muslim mothers after the 2000 Washington Post revelation of the Pfizer drug trials was driven by decreased demand from Muslim mothers with more information and relativ ely stronger ties to religious networks. These mothers were more educated and more likely to reside in minority- Muslim neighborhoods, farther away from family networks and with relatively lower trust in neighbors, and hence more likely to exhibit stronger cleavage to religious networks. To t est the hypothesis on the role of stronger ties to religious networks among Muslims in explaining the results, we assemble Afrobarometer data on religious identity of respondents and reported religiosity and trust in religious leaders, neighbors , and state officials. The Afrobarometer data includes this data only after 2000, with four rounds of surveys from 2003 to 2014, so we conduct a cohort study to exami ne the effects of Muslim religious identity on religiosity and trust attitudes for individuals who would have been adults, and hence more cognizant of the news disclosure in 14 2000. In the cohort study analysis, we investigate whether there is a Muslim -non- Muslim religious gap in trust and religiosity outcomes for individuals a born in year r residing in district d and state s at survey year t and estimate equations of the following form, limiting the sample to adults, aged 18 or older, as of the time of the Washington Post news disclosure in 2000: Trustardst = Musli mardst + XaJ rdst + \u00b5d + t + r + st + sardst (2) Where Trustardst is the trust or religiosity outcome of interest and Muslim is an indicator that equals one if the responde nt indicates that she is Muslim. We include vectors of individual level covariates XaJ dt, including controls for the gende r and educational level of the respondent.11 All regressions include year of birth ( r), survey year ( rt), district ( \u00b5d) and state-by- year ( st) fixed effects with standard errors are clustered at the district level, following the specification in Equation 1. Our key parameter of interest, , captures the effect of being a Muslim relative to non- Muslims on religiosity and trust outcomes for respondents who were adults as of the time of the 2000 Washington Post news disclosure of the Pfizer drug trials. The religious outcomes we focus on are reported religiosity, or how often the respondent s report attending religious services , and the respondents' perception of how many religious leaders are engaged in corruption, a \"revealed preference\" measure of trust.12 We also examine respondents' reported levels of trust in neighbors and relatives , and perceptions of corruption of police and elected members of local governing councils ; these outcomes have been shown in previous research to be results of long- term historical processes like the slave trade (Nunn and Wantchekon , 2011) and colonial prison labor ( Archibong and Obikili, 2020). 11 Data is described in detail in Appendix 12 There is a significant negative correlation between reported trust in religious leaders and the corruption perception measure, with the correlation equal to - 0.28 (p < 0.001). The results are similar using the trust and corruption perception measures. 15 To test that there were no effects of the 2000 disclosure on religiosity and trust outcomes of Muslims, we examine differences in attitudes for adult Muslim cohorts in 2000 versus non-adult cohorts at the time of the disclosure. We estimate equations of the following form: Trustardst = Post + XaJ rdst + r + st + sardst s \u00b8 x Where Post 2000 Adult r is a binary indicator for adults as of the time of the 2000 Washington Post news disclosure and all other variables are as in Equation 2. If there are no differences in adult - non-adult/child cohort as of 2000-disclosure religiosity and trust attitudes, then will be insignificant in Equation 3. In Panel A of Table 3, columns (1), (2), and (3) report results on religiosity, corruption perceptions of religious leaders, and trust in neighbors outcomes , respectively , for the adult cohort in 2000 (Equation 2); columns (4) to (6) show cohort differences as described in Equation 3. Adult Muslims as of the time of the 2000 disclosure report higher levels of religiosity than non- Muslims, an effect size of 4 percent relative to the sampl e mean. The effect is stronger for adult cohorts in 2000 who would have been more cognizant of the Pfizer news and anti -vaccine messaging from religious leaders as shown by the significant interaction term in column (4). Adult Muslims as of the 2000 disclosure are 13 percent less likely to report that their religious leaders are corrupt as shown in column (2) of Table 3, with no significant differences between adult and child cohorts in column (5). Adult Muslims as of the 2000 disclosure also report higher trust in neighbors (11 percent ) than their non- Muslim counterparts in column (3), with no significant differences by cohort in column (6). We examine heterogeneous effects by the neighborhood religious composition, spli tting the adult cohort in 2000 sample by residence into Muslim -minority and Muslim- majority neighborhoods. The results in Panel B show that adult Muslim respondents as of the time of the Washington Post disclosure in 2000 living in Muslim- minority neighborhoods are significantly more religious than their non- Muslim counterparts, an increase of 6 percent relative to the sample mean as shown in column (1). They are also 16 percent less likely to report beliefs that their religious leaders are corrupt as shown in column (2). There is no significant effect of Muslim identity on trust in neighbors for respondents in minority -Muslim neighborhoods as shown in column (3) and Panel B of Table 3. In contrast, adult Muslim respondents as of the time of the 2000 16 Washington Post disclosure residing in majority -Muslim neighborhoods report no significant differential behavior for religiosity (column (4)) or perceptions of corruption of their religious leaders (column (5)). The higher trust in neighbors results for Muslims reported in Panel A are almost entirely driven by Muslims residing in majority -Muslim neighborhoods as shown in column (6) of Panel B. The results are summarized in Figure A5 and robust to changes in the majority- minority -Muslim neighborhood cutoffs as shown in Table A6 in the Appendix.13 There is no significant difference between Muslim and non- Muslim corruption perceptions of police and elected local governing councils and trust in relatives for adults at the time of the 2000 Washington Post disclosure as shown in columns (1), (2), (3) of Panel C. The evidence of higher religiosity and trust in religious leaders among Muslim respondents supports the hypothesis that the reduction in vaccination outcomes for children born to Muslim mothers after the disclosure was linked to information spread among Muslim mothers with stronger religious networks. 6 Conclusion The 1996 Pfizer epidemic drug trials remain a point of tension and source of vaccine hesitancy for Muslims in Nigeria, more than a decade after the initial news disclosure in 2000, with the specter of the trials evoked with every new mass vaccination campaign .14 Our results show significant reductions in routine vaccination of children born to Muslim mothers after the disclosure of the trials in 2000. The effects are driven by educated mothers and mothers living in Muslim minority neighborhoods with relatively lower trust/weaker ties to their neighborhoods/local communities and relatively stronger ties to religious networks. The reduction effect is specific to child vaccination outcomes with generally no reductions in Muslim mother's prenatal care behavior and other child health outcomes. A gr owing body of research has highlighted the importance of public trust for the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns aimed at curbing the spread of disease during epidemics. Our results show that local trust networks can be key drivers of vaccine hesitancy, especially among minority populations within regions with potentially stronger own-group cleavage; hence, policymakers 13 We provide suggestive evidence that the long- term effects of the Washington Post disclosure on child vaccination outcomes are stronger for children born to Muslim mothers living in neighborhoods with higher religiosity and trust in religious leaders in Table A8. 14 Most recently with COVID -19 vaccination: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/03/20/nigeria -pfizer - kano- coronavirus -trovan/ 17 aiming to increase vaccination in the aftermath of epidemics must work to build and leverage trust within these local networks to enhance vaccine uptake. These findings highlight the importance of both careful, ethical , and transparent practices in vacci nation efforts, and institutional and local community network trust in vaccine compliance. The negative externalities from reduced vaccination have global consequences for the resurgence of epidemics of infectious diseases that can persist for years after the initial event and disclosure. 0.000.250.500.751.00muslimMuslim Share Figure 1: Muslim population shares by state with Kano drug trial state labelled (top) and summary statistics by Muslim mother status in DHS sample for children born between 1985- 2013 (bottom) 18Figure 2: Event study coecients (with error bars shown) of the eect of Muslim mother status on child vaccination outcomes by child's year of birth.

The health facility dataset comes from an eort spearheaded by the Nigerian government and researchers from the country's Oce of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on MDGs (OSSAP), in collaboration with the Sustainable Engineering Lab at Columbia University who conducted extensive, comprehensive surveys of schools and health facilities at local government areas (LGAs) in Nigeria. According to the Federal Ministry of Health, Nigeria had 34,423 health facilities as of 2013 (Makinde et al., 2018). Thus, the health facility sample represents about 70% of the universe of health facilities in Nigeria. The health quality infrastructure index is an average of 8 public services reported available at the health facility in each LGA and state in Nigeria, namely: the share of facilities with ante-natal services, family planning services, emergency transport, a freezer for vaccines, vaccines at the facility, caesarian services, improved water supply and grid power access.

Dependent variables are share nurse/midwives, share doctors and share community health extension workers (CHEWs) in total health personnel (where total health personnel is sum of nurses/midwives, doctors and CHEWs) in 1991 and 2012 datasets. Muslim Share is the share of respondents in a state who are muslim in the 1990 and 2013 DHS for 1991 and 2012 respectively. The Muslim Majority Indicator an indicator that equals 1 if the share muslim is greater than 50% in a state.Signicant at the 1 percent level,Signicant at the 5 percent level,Signicant at the 10 percent level. 42A.5 Cost Estimates Being unvaccinated increases an individual's risk of infection from the disease (Yahya, 2006). The costs of treatment of these illnesses can be signicant and incur large nancial burdens on households (Archibong and Annan, 2017). The objective of this section is to conduct simple back of the envelope calculations on the potential costs of treatment from an increased number of unvaccinated Muslim children as a result of negative news about the Pzer drug trials. We assemble data on direct medical costs of treatment of the four diseases in Nigeria from the scientic literature, and calculate lower b ound estimates of the costs of treatment if 20% of unvaccinated Muslim children born each year from 2001 to 2013 had fallen ill. We compare these cost gures to the counterfactual scenario if the Pzer trials disclosure had not occurred, using the regression estimates from Section 4.1. The results are shown in Figure A8 and Figure A9. Using our most conservative estimates of direct medical costs only, and without factoring in any potential deaths from disease, the reduced vaccination of Muslim children in the aftermath of the Pzer drug trials incurred a total potential cost of treatment of $94,128,449 over the counterfactual scenario. This cost is over $19 million higher than the Pzer settlement to the Nigerian government of $75 m illion. Under dierent scenarios, like the scenario in which 50% of unvaccinated Muslim children fall ill, the dierence in costs is even higher, rising to up to over $235 million as shown in Figure A8 and Figure A9. 43Diseasecost of treatment (2010 USD) Year of data Source Description of costs Tuberculosis (BCG) 28.42 2013 Ukwaja et al, 2013 direct medical treatment Diphtheria, Pertussis, and Tetanus (DPT) 10.2 2001 Salako et al, 2001 direct medical cost of antibiotics Polio 0.71 2010 Qadar, 2014 cost of polio vaccination Measles 16.44 2018 Zimmermann et al, 2019 direct medical treatment actual year outcomes diseaseaverage population under 1 year old each year (births)average muslim pop under 1 year each year (births) unvaccinated at risk 20% sick 50% sick cost of treatment (2010 USD)total costs per year if 20% sicktotal costs over 12 years if 20% sicktotal costs per year if 50% sicktotal costs over 12 years if 50% sick population under 1 year old each year (births)average muslim pop under 1 year each year (births) unvaccinated at risk 20% sick 50% sick cost of treatment (2010 USD)total costs per year if 20% sicktotal costs over 12 years if 20% sicktotal costs per year if 50% sicktotal costs over 12 years if 50% costs of treatment 94,128,449 235,321,123Figure A8: Back of the envelope cost of treatment estimates over 2001-2013.
