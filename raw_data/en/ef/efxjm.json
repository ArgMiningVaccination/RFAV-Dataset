General practitioners (GPs) are well placed to offer advice and education to promote and maintain health, and prevent the onset of illness. They can also identify risk factors and symptoms for the early detection of specific disease. About one-third of the total burden of disease in Australia can be attributed to modifiable risk factors.1 Preventive activities prior to pregnancy can include identifying and modifying biomedical, behavioural and social risks to a woman's health or pregnancy outcomes. 2 Genetic screening can be used for a variety of reasons, from preconception planning to detecting risks of adult-onset familial diseases. 3 Older Australians are at increased risk of multimorbidity, which may be exacerbated by issues such as a lack of physical activity,4 taking multiple medications5 and lack of sun exposure.6 More than 4.74 million Australians over the age of 50 years have osteoporosis or poor bone health.7 General practice health checks in middle-aged Australians have been found to improve the frequency of managing smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity behavioural risk factors; screening for cervical and colorectal cancer; and hyperlipidaemia. 8-10 LEARNING OUTCOMES At the end of this activity, participants will be able to: provide preconception advice and healthcare for women planning a pregnancy discuss the indications for genetic testing outline preventive healthcare measures for people in middle age list the recommendations for prevention of osteoporosis discuss the goals of management for patients at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

She says, 'I just need a pill script'. She has been taking a triphasic pill, which was commenced at the age of 16 years to help with her irregular periods and acne. QUESTION 1 What further information would you like? FURTHER INFORMATION When asked for more details, Jessica says that she plans to cease the pill after her honeymoon as she and her fianc\u00e9 want to start a family soon. QUESTION 2 Given that Jessica plans to start having children soon, what additional information should you obtain?QUESTION 3 What else would you consider at this consultation? FURTHER INFORMATION You check that there are no contraindications to Jessica's continued use of oral contraceptives and, as there are none, you write an appropriate prescription. You advise Jessica to book a follow-up appointment for 30 minutes to review her blood test results and discuss preconception issues. One week later, Jessica returns for her follow-up preconception consultation. You note that she has a body mass index (BMI) of 29.6 kg/m2. She is pleased to tell you that she lost 5 kg in the past few months and hopes to lose another few kilograms before the wedding. QUESTION 4 Do Jessica's BMI and plans to lose weight change anything? QUESTION 5 What advice can you give Jessica?CASE 1 check Preventive health5CASE 1 ANSWERS ANSWER 1 Requests from patients for repeat prescriptions give general practitioners an opportunity to consider if the medication is still needed. It is important to ask Jessica about her acne, take a menstrual history and reassess her suitability for the oral contraceptive pill. Additional information to obtain includes Jessica's height, weight and BMI, smoking status, blood pressure and her cervical screening test results. This consultation is also a good opportunity to ask about Jessica's alcohol consumption, check her family history and update her medical history.1 ANSWER 2 Information that you should obtain includes the following: Immunisation history Varicella (chickenpox) and influenza are two vaccine-preventable infections that have significant outcomes for the mother and baby:1,2 Influenza should be recommended to all women during pregnancy and can be given at any gestational age. For women who have a good history of varicella, serology is not routinely required. If women are uncertain or have no history of varicella, serology will tell you if they have been exposed to varicella in the wild. It will not tell you that they have been immunised, as the post-vaccination titres are not sufficient to register with our current testing. 3 Varicella vaccination was introduced to Australia in 2000 and placed on the National Immunisation Program Schedule in 2005. 3,4 Accordingly, most of the women who are currently pregnancy would have been exposed to the wild virus and are immune, even if they have no history of varicella. The single dose of varicella vaccine on the schedule is sufficient to provide significant protection from severe disease, including encephalitis; however, about one in four (25%) immunised children get a breakthrough case of varicella, although this is usually mild. 3,5 It is not clear what the implications will be for women who have had only one varicella vaccine and who are exposed to varicella while pregnant. The need for vaccination, particularly for hepatitis B, rubella and varicella, should be assessed as part of any preconception health check. 1 Medical history This should include past obstetric, surgical and psychiatric history, and medication use (including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, supplements and illicit drugs).1 It is important to check if the patient has any medical conditions that might affect future pregnancies (eg gestational diabetes mellitus [GDM], epilepsy, thyroid disease, blood disorders). This should also include cardiovascular and personal/family history of genetic disorders, and neural tube defect.Family history It is important to ask about Jessica's ethnicity and whether she has a family history of conditions that might affect future pregnancies, such as GDM, thyroid disorders, clotting disorders, thrombosis or heart disease, or familial disorders such as thalassaemia. Refer to Figure 1 for the personal and family history items recommended by Queensland Health for pregnant women. Nutritional history You should assess Jessica's risk of nutritional deficiencies. For example, if she is vegetarian or vegan or if she has coeliac disease, she would be at increased risk of iron deficiency. Folate and iodine supplementation is recommended prior to conception. 1 Periodontal disease According to The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' (RACGP's) Guidelines for the preventive activities in general practice (the Red Book),1 'ask the woman if she has bleeding gums, swellings, sensitive teeth, loose teeth, holes in teeth, broken teeth, toothache, or any other problems in the mouth'. It is important to check the oral cavity for confirmation. Reassure the patient that it is safe to have a range of dental treatments during pregnancy.1Figure 1.

Available at www.health.qld.gov.au/improvement/pathways/docs/ pregancy_rec.pdf [Accessed 29 November 2016].CASE 1 check Preventive health6 varicella serology - at this point in time, most women have had varicella in the wild, hence 'varicella serology', if she has never had chickenpox and has no history of ever being vaccinated. Her vaccination status can be checked on the Australian Immunisation Register data, as it was in place when the vaccine was introduced. A woman with this permission on her My Health Record could look it up 3 possible infections such as hepatits B, hepatits C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, syphilis testing for genetic disorders (only if indicated by history). It is advisable to organise a follow-up appointment to discuss preconception issues.1,6 ANSWER 4 Weight history is important - Jessica's weight together with her history of acne and irregular menses may be a coincidence or may indicate polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which could have an impact on her fertility. Other information Jessica's partner's smoking status is also important to ascertain, as tobacco smoking is associated with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage to sperm and increased risk of malignancy in the children. Medical insurance status If Jessica wants to have private obstetric care, she will need to have an upgraded policy to cover obstetrics for 12 months prior to the birth of the child, even if the child is born prematurely. ANSWER 3 At this consultation, you could do a clinical examination, including a breast examination, if appropriate, and assess Jessica's heart sounds. You could conduct cervical screening, if Jessica is due for one, and order blood tests, including the following: full blood evaluation including iron studies, thyroid function tests and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels if indicated blood group rubella serology Clinical presentation Prevalence - most common endocrine disorder in reproductive aged women (12-18%) Consider if female presents with one or more - menstrual irregularity (>35 or <21 day cycles), overweight, hirsutism, fertility issues, prediabetes, gestational diabetes or early onset type II diabetes, note high risk ethnic groups (Asian, Indigenous, Nth African) Differential diagnosis investigations TSH Prolactin FSH (if premature menopause suspected)Rotterdam diagnostic criteria Requires two of:1.

We are grateful to the Australian Government for their support and funding of the national PCOS evidence-based guideline project and subsequent translational program. \u00a9 Jean Hailes for Women's Health 2017.7 check Preventive healthCASE 1 The diagnosis of PCOS (Figure 2) rests on the identification of two out of three history or investigation results as per the Rotterdam criteria.7,8 As Jessica is taking the oral contraceptive pill, it will not be possible to assess her biochemistry until she has been off the pill for three months, by which time she will be hoping to have conceived. It will be important to track her period regularity (there are apps for this, such as Period Tracker or Sprout Fertility & Period Tracker, or she could use the calendar in the smartphone, if she has one). If she has not conceived within three months of being off the pill, review her regularity and consider imaging and testing. However, Jessica may also have post-pill amenorrhoea, which could complicate the clinical picture. Also, the higher Jessica's weight, the greater her risk of a number of obstetric and neonatal complications, including hypertension, pre-eclampsia and diabetes mellitus, either type 2 or GDM.9 Women whose BMI is >30 kg/m2 are advised to consider having 5 mg of folic acid, rather than 0.5 mg, for the month prior to conception and the first three months of pregnancy. This is a higher amount than the content of the preconception, pregnancy and breastfeeding formula so Jessica may need to purchase an additional supplement.10 ANSWER 5 You should strongly encourage ongoing weight loss and, in agreement with Jessica, set specific goals about the level to aim for, but consider aiming for a 5-10% weight loss. Ideally, it would be best if she was in a healthy weight range for her pregnancy. 1 If she does not reach this level by the time she is ready to start trying to conceive, she can continue her weight-loss program, but it would be wise to involve a dietitian at this time (ie in the preconception phase) and to let the dietitian know Jessica is planning a pregnancy shortly (and may, or may not, have PCOS). There is some good advice available for women about achieving a healthy weight during pregnancy (refer to 'Resources for patients'). Depending on the risk factors identified, Jessica may well benefit from referrals not only to a dietitian but also for a preconception consultation with an obstetrician or obstetric physician.

Jack told his family members to see their doctor for a check as he was told the problem was hereditary and can cause problems if it is not caught early. Joel does not complain of symptoms that could be related to haemochromatosis. QUESTION 1 What should you ask Joel? How would you explain haemochromatosis, the tests that help define the disease, and the gradations of risk the genetic results may pose to Joel? FURTHER INFORMATION You organise for Joel to have testing for the HFE gene, and blood tests for iron, transferrin and serum ferritin levels. He returns a week later for his results, which reveal a homozygous C282Y pattern, the most common mutation leading to iron overload. His serum ferritin is 400 \u00b5g/L. QUESTION 2 How do you explain these results to Joel?QUESTION 3 How do you proceed with a management plan for Joel? FURTHER INFORMATION You go through the Australian Red Cross Blood Service algorithm with Joel. The result is a recommendation for venesection with a recommended schedule. QUESTION 4 What resources are available to assist Joel in better understanding haemachromatosis, to assist him in managing his own disease and in explaining it to others? FURTHER INFORMATION Joel is concerned that his children, aged 12 and 14 years, might develop haemochromatosis and asks if they should be screened. QUESTION 5 Should Joel's children be screened for haemachromatosis?check Preventive health9CASE 2 CASE 2 ANSWERS ANSWER 1 You should ask about the ethnic background of both Joel and his brother Jack as only one in five cases of haemachromatosis are found in non-northern European descendants. You should also take a family history more broadly, looking especially for liver disease, liver cancer, heart failure and diabetes.1 You can explain that although Jack has haemochromatosis, it requires two copies of faulty HFE genes for Joel to also potentially develop it. If Joel and Jack's parents (assuming they have the same parents) both have two copies of the faulty genes, Joel is at risk of developing the disease; otherwise, he may carry one copy of the gene (ie he may be a heterozygous carrier) or none, as is consistent with an autosomal recessive pattern. Most laboratory HFE gene testing is for the two most common genetic changes in the HFE genes - C282Y and H63D . Rarer, non- HFE genetic mutations are not tested for as treatment does not differ.2 The lifetime risk of developing haemochromatosis varies according to the pattern shown in Table 1, with a fasting ferritin estimate assisting in risk stratification. 1,3 Table 1. Lifetime risk of developing haemochromatosis Genotype Risk of total body iron overloadIf serum ferritin is normal Normal genotype No increased risk No further follow-up needed Heterozygous H63D Probably no increased riskNo further no increased follow-up needed Homozygous H63D Very slightly increased riskCheck iron studies every one to five years Compound heterozygous C282Y/H63DIncreased risk Check iron studies every one to five years, test family members Homozygous C282Y Greatly increased risk Check iron studies every one to five, test family members ANSWER 2 You would explain to Joel that he also has haemochromatosis. He has the same genes for it as his brother Jack, and he has evidence of iron overload. You advise Joel that he will need ongoing monitoring and management, but that intervention now should reduce the risk of complications later on. Clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygosity is variable. Iron overload is seen in 30-50% of patients, and haemochromatosis-associated morbidity develops in 10-33% of people who are homozygous for C282Y,2 so being homozygous for C282Y will not necessarily lead to iron overload-induced morbidity. The way to determine Joel's risk is to interpret his iron studies. Joel's serum ferritin, which is >300 \u00b5g/L, is suggestive of high iron stores in men.4,5 ANSWER 3 Joel may be eligible for venesection to manage the risk his elevated total body iron stores pose. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service has developed an algorithm, the high ferritin app, which can be used to determine a patient's need for venesection and, if eligible, to book this service (refer to 'Resources for patients and doctors'). Use of this online tool has very much improved the cost-effective use of this valuable Australian Red Cross Blood Service.4 ANSWER 4 Many high-quality online services exist to assist Joel. Haemochromatosis Australia's website, for example, is very user friendly (refer to 'Resources for patients and doctors'). Resources have been designed to account for the wide range of user health literacy levels, and a mix of media used to convey information. 6 ANSWER 5 The mother of Joel's children should be screened in the first instance and this then helps to determine the risk to the children. Even if their mother proves to be heterozygous or homozygous for the HFE genetic variants, waiting until children are in their late teens is recommended so they can understand the issues and make informed choices about testing and its consequences.1 There have been no reports of iron overload in C282Y homozygosity before the age of 18 years.7 RESOURCES FOR PATIENTS AND DOCTORS Australian Red Cross Blood Service has an algorithm, the high ferritin app, https://highferritin.transfusion.com.au Haemochromatosis Australia, http://haemochromatosis.org.au REFERENCES 1.

Jonas's daughter, a nurse, booked an appointment for him to have an influenza vaccination at your clinic. You ask Jonas some general questions and he tells you he does not have diabetes and drinks alcohol only on special occasions. However, he has been a smoker for many years and smokes about 15 cigarettes per day. His body mass index is 27 kg/m2. Jonas uses a walking stick. As requested, you agree to give him the influenza vaccination. QUESTION 1 What other immunisations are advised for a patient of Jonas's age group? FURTHER INFORMATION Jonas states that he had the pneumococcal polysaccharide and combined diphtheria- tetanus- acellular pertussis (dTpa) vaccines not long ago, probably less than five years ago. You obtain consent to have Jonas's old clinical notes transferred to your clinic to confirm this and to check the exact dates of his vaccinations. Jonas agrees to having the Herpes zoster vaccine. You check his blood pressure, which is 172/88 mmHg. His heart rate is 78 beats per minute and regular. You ask Jonas about his current medications and discover he was prescribed perindopril 4 mg daily for his hypertension. He adds that he is also on a 'fluid' tablet (indapamide), omeprazole, which he has been on for years, and sertraline for the past two years, plus paracetamol fairly regularly. QUESTION 2 What further questions might you ask regarding Jonas's medication?FURTHER INFORMATION Jonas skips the diuretic on most days because he does not like having to rush to the toilet more frequently, especially at night. He takes meloxicam fairly often for his arthritis as the paracetamol does not seem to work (he had some meloxicam tablets in his cupboard that had belonged to his wife). He sometimes takes ibuprofen. QUESTION 3 What are the possible causes of Jonas's high blood pressure today? QUESTION 4 What would your next steps be in managing Jonas's hypertension over the next weeks? What would be an appropriate target for a person of Jonas's age and history? QUESTION 5 Would you ask any further questions to assess Jonas's cardiovascular risk?check Preventive health11CASE 3 FURTHER INFORMATION Jonas's father died at the age of 85 years after a stroke, and his mother died of unspecified heart problems at the age of 82 years. Neither of Jonas's parents had diabetes. His mother had glaucoma and a tendency to 'nerve problems', and his father had lung problems (he was also a smoker). Jonas thinks his own cholesterol is okay, and he feels he has a pretty healthy diet - no fast foods. He does not cook much as he lives alone, but makes sandwiches with healthy ingredients (eg salmon and salad or cheese and tomato), which he also makes for his sister. He always has a bowl of fruit in the house and his daughter was impressed that he had yoghurt in the fridge. Jonas says he has always kept reasonably good health and does not have any cardiovascular symptoms or history. The omeprazole seems to keep his previous reflux under control. The sertraline seemed to help when he felt a bit down while he was caring for his wife. There is no family history of cancer. QUESTION 6 Would you do any blood or other tests on Jonas? QUESTION 7 What is the main preventive measure you would strongly encourage Jonas to undertake himself? FURTHER INFORMATION On taking some further history, you ascertain that Jonas's wife died nine months ago from metastatic breast cancer. He nursed her at home for some time. You need to repeat a couple of your questions as Jonas does not seem to hear them. In passing, you ask what he has been doing lately. Jonas comments that he used to read a lot but has not done so in the past year or so. He and his wife used to go on bus or car trips, but long trips are difficult for him these days. His sister, who lives in the same block of units, is 85 years of age and has early dementia. Jonas visits her every day and helps out.QUESTION 8 Are there any other preventive health issues you would consider checking in Jonas? QUESTION 9 What is an evidence-based approach to falls risk screening within general practice? FURTHER INFORMATION Jonas has not had any falls in the past 12 months, but is feeling increasingly unsteady and lacking in confidence. Some of this relates to his hip and knee pain, which is why he uses the stick. QUESTION 10 What is the best exercise to advise to prevent falls, from an evidence- based point of view? What other interventions may help decrease falls risk in elderly living in the community?check Preventive health12CASE 3 CASE 3 ANSWERS ANSWER 1 In addition to the influenza vaccination, it is advisable for patients aged 65 years to receive the following vaccinations: pneumococcal polysaccharide H. zoster (shingles) vaccination dTpa booster if needed. People in the general population aged 65 years , or 50 years of age for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, are at high risk of pneumococcal disease.1 One pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for people in these age groups, or a booster at five years for those in high-risk groups with chronic diseases.1 H. zoster infection is more common in older patients, affecting half of those who live to 85 years of age. Post-herpetic neuralgia can affect quality of life significantly and is more common with increasing age. A single dose of H. zoster vaccination is recommended for those >70 years of age. 1 The effectiveness of the vaccine in those aged 80 years and older is significantly less. Therefore from November 2016, it will be free for those aged 70-79 years.1 ANSWER 2 Additional questions to ask Jonas about his medications include the following. Is he taking all his medications as prescribed (adherence)? Is he taking any non-prescribed (over-the-counter [OTC]) medications? What does he understand about why is he taking each of these medications (what was the original reason and are they still necessary?) Medication reviews are useful in older patients and indicated for those taking five or more medications. This is part of 'quaternary prevention',2 which is very apposite in the elderly - for prevention of problems from over-treatment. This overlaps very much with the current moves to choosing wisely as per Choosing Wisely Australia,3 deprescribing4 and 'minimally disruptive medicine'.5 There is minimal evidence for routine pharmacist reviews,6,7 but it is accepted as good practice for the general practitioner (GP) to review medications (with or without the pharmacist) and to guard against future polypharmacy, if possible. Interventions may reduce polypharmacy but evidence regarding clinical outcomes is inconclusive.8,9 It may be more useful to target problematic medications or those for which the indication may have lapsed. The Australian medicines handbook aged care companion is a useful tool and a good resource (refer to 'Resources for doctors'). The indications for omeprazole, a of Jonas's history. NPS MedicineWise is a useful resource for such reviews (refer to 'Resources for doctors'). If an antidepressant is indicated, then an SSRI is an appropriate choice for an older patient.10 When prescribing for older patients it is important to consider the appropriateness of specific medications in the context of the patient's overall health. This includes what may be termed their resilience or frailty. 4 Bear in mind that guideliness may be based on evidence gained from patient samples that do not include this particular patient's age group or comorbidities.OTC medicines may add to the medication burden or interact with prescribed medications. An important issue with older patients is to assess the anticholinergic burden11,12 (not significant in Jonas's case). ANSWER 3 Possible causes of Jonas's high blood pressure include: non-adherence to medications addition of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) resistant hypertension (requirement for multiple antihypertensive agents) white-coat hypertension. Non-compliance is common and Jonas has said that he usually does not take his diuretic medication. NSAIDs, among their other effects, may increase blood pressure.13 A large proportion of patients require two or more medications to achieve target blood pressure. Given that this is Jonas's first visit to you, his blood pressure may not represent his blood pressure at home (ie his high blood pressure at this visit might represent white-coat hypertension). 14 ANSWER 4 Steps to be taken in managing Jonas's hypertension include: clarifying what is the patient's perspective: what he understands about hypertension; what he understands about the medications; and what sort of a treatment burden these impose on him repeating the measurement on two separate occasions/consultations clarifying which medications he is taking (or negotiate which ones he is willing to take) advising avoidance of NSAIDs (need to address arthritic pain in a subsequent visit) checking his diet (particularly regarding salt) checking sitting and standing blood pressure checking ambulatory blood pressure if there are any doubts. Blood pressure should be confirmed with repeat measurements, or preferably, ambulatory blood pressure (or home blood pressure monitoring).15-17 There are updated 2016 guidelines, which include levels of evidence and reflect some of the changing advice in the area of hypertension.18 Postural hypotension is common and Jonas's sitting blood pressure may not represent his standing blood pressure, which may drop unacceptably if sitting blood pressure is lowered too much. If postural hypotension is suspected, a repeat measurement should be taken after the patient has been standing for two minutes. 18 The target blood pressure level to aim for is a topic of debate as guidelines keep changing. It is an area where individual application of evidence-based medicine is particularly pertinent. Lowering blood pressure is particularly effective in terms of reduction in stroke risk. However, it needs to be considered in the context of overall cardiovascular risk and other factors, such as falls risk, polypharmacy and side effects. Jonas is mobile, living independently and not on hyper-polypharmacy (10 drugs). Hypertension in the Very Elderly trial (HYVET) supports benefits to treatment of patients >80 years of age. The trial recommended a target of <150/80 mmHg.17 On the basis of recent trials check Preventive health13CASE 3 demonstrating a mortality benefit, the latest National Heart Foundation of Australia guidelines recommend a target of <120 mmHg systolic in older patients. However they advise caution and close monitoring because of increased adverse effects of lower blood pressure in some patients. Treatment-related adverse effects include syncope, electrolyte abnormalities and kidney injury.18 There should be ongoing negotiation with the patient about what his priorities are in terms of management and these priorities can change over time. ANSWER 5 Jonas is already at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) because of his age, and his smoking and hypertension further increase this risk. It is important to ask if he has had any previous cardiovascular events or cardiovascular symptoms, and to enquire if he has hyperlipidaemia or a family history of CVD. ANSWER 6 Given that Jonas is on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor plus a diuretic and an SSRI, he is at risk of hyponatraemia. Therefore, it is very relevant to assess his renal function and electrolyte levels. He is a smoker, so it would be appropriate to assess his lung function. Although routine screening of vitamin D is not beneficial, 19 it might be appropriate to check his level if he does not get much sun exposure. He should, therefore, have the following tests: electrolytes, urea and creatinine (EUC) urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) lipids and blood sugar levels vitamin D spirometry electrocardiography (ECG). A baseline ECG would be reasonable in a patient with hypertension. ANSWER 7 Jonas should be strongly encouraged to quit smoking. This can be difficult, but there are several ways of assisting him. Interventions to encourage smoking cessation include:20 brief advice to quit assessing a patient's readiness to quit offering counselling and pharmacotherapy providing self-help material referral to intensive quit programs such as Quitline and other local and state/territory programs. It is worth asking Jonas if he is thinking of quitting. It is probably not a good idea to persist with advice if he is not ready as this could hinder the development of the doctor-patient relationship at this stage. You can ask if he has tried to quit before and, if he has, what happened. His social situation and recent events may be making it more difficult to quit. Varenicline and combination nicotine replacement therapy are equally effective. It is reasonable to be wary of varenicline in a patient with previous or current depression, although recent Cochrane reports did not confirm early reports of suicidal ideation.21A Cochrane review22 concluded that motivational interviewing may also be of benefit for some patients, bearing in mind that such treatments are often variable in their implementation regarding personnel and length and number of sessions. ANSWER 8 If Jonas has not had a recent health assessment for patients aged 75 years (Medicare Benefits Schedule item numbers 701, 703, 705 or 707) it would be reasonable to book this in as this would cover many of the relevant issues listed below, and also include a functional assessment and questions on dentition. It is worth considering advanced care planning as part of this assessment. Relevant issues to consider include the following. Falls risk screeningFalls are common and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in later years. About 40% of people in Jonas's age range will have had a fall. Up to 30% of older people who fall will incur injuries and 10% will have a fracture; hip fractures are the most serious. Of course, many factors contribute to falls and whether a fall results in a fracture. Women are more at risk than men.23,24 Jonas uses a walking stick, which suggests mobility issues, and he is on a psychotropic medication, both of which are risk factors. Eyesight Poor eyesight is common (nearly 10% of those aged >55 years),25 and may aggravate the risk of falls and have a negative impact on social activities. Jonas also has a familial glaucoma risk. Some causes of poor eyesight are preventable or remediable. One would wonder if eyesight is a reason for his stopping reading (although this could also be due to a lack of interest). Hearing Presbyacusis is common and Jonas appears to have not heard everything you said. Deafness can cause social isolation and often be remediated with hearing aids. There have been advances in cochlear implants.26 There can be significant variation in costs to the patient and some hearing aids may be subsidised. Mobility/exercise Maintaining mobility is important in terms of independence, and exercise helps to maintain muscle mass. There are useful government sources of information on physical activity for older people (refer to 'Resources for patients'). Social life Jonas is widowed and living alone. Social isolation contributes to morbidity and mortality, probably through a variety of mechanisms.27 Mental health and carer burden Jonas may still be suffering from grief (after caring for his wife) and he has the additional carer burden of his sister. Elderly men are known to have the highest suicide rate. Recent research found a correlation between suicide and number of morbidities.28 Males living alone often have fewer social supports than females.check Preventive health14Cognitive status About 10% of the population aged >75 years has dementia. Jonas's sister has dementia. It is difficult to know if his decreased social activity has physical causes (eg mobility) or relates to depression or early dementia. It is reasonable to do case finding in those whom you suspect may have suggestive symptoms. 29 General screening for dementia is not recommended. The preventive aspect of case finding focuses largely on the aspects of earlier planning for future care. There are standard tests for possible reversible causes of dementia, although these have low yield. Acceptable tests of cognitive function include Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; on the commonly used software although it is under copyright), the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) for those of non -English speaking background and the Australian developed General Practitioner assessment of Cognition (GPCOG; www.alz.org/documents_custom/gpcog(english).pdf). A useful summary reference regarding dementia assessment is available at www.racgp.org.au/download/Documents/AFP/2012/December/201212pond.pdf Urinary tract symptoms Although incontinence is more common in females, it can still occur in males. Lower urinary tract symptoms are common problems that affect quality of life. 30 Driving Transport issues are important to older people and driving is often important to older men. If Jonas is still driving, it is important to consider if he is still able to drive. 31 ANSWER 9 Falls risk screening can be assessed by a simple:19 question on number of falls in the previous 12 months physical test or two such as 'chair stands', 'get up and go' or 'alternate step test'. Poor performance in one of the physical tests nearly doubles the risk of fall. Poor performance in two tests increases the risk significantly further. Using three or more tests does not increase the predictive ability by much more. It would be sensible, therefore, to use one or two validated tests that are feasible within the constraints of general practice in regard to space and equipment.32 This is worth doing because preventive activities can then decrease the risk. There are many useful articles on falls risk assessment. For those who wish to explore further there are many publications from Professor Lord's unit (refer to 'Resources for doctors'). Many factors can potentially contribute to falls risk, including underlying medical conditions and the number of medications, which are often an indication of poor health. In terms of medications, the most significant are psychoactive medications, which are also the most difficult to withdraw long term. All these factors probably act through various functions such as sensory, balance, muscular problems and reaction time etc. External hazards aggravate risk. ANSWER 10 The best types of exercise for preventing falls are those incorporating balance (eg Tai Chi).19Initially, starting an exercise program can increase falls. High challenge, balance training reduces falls and may decrease the severity of falls outcomes. The recommendation is at least two hours per week for six months. High-risk groups show less effect (probably because it is harder for them to comply). Low-intensity activities such as walking are ineffective in preventing falls.33-35 Other interventions to prevent falls include: home modifications multidisciplinary assessment cataract operation, when needed medication reviews. Home modifications have moderate evidence for high-risk patients, as does multidisciplinary assessment. There is some evidence for: prompt first cataract operation advice against using multifocals outdoors medication reviews. Although some medications increase falls risk, studies to modify this have had variable results - it is very hard for patients to stop psychotropics (and not regress).Vitamin D supplementation has some evidence but this relates to those in residential care and those with low vitamin D levels. 35 CONCLUSION It is quite appropriate to initiate primary prevention (eg immunisation, healthy diet, stopping smoking) in older patients who are fit and have an expectation of many more years of life. Older patients tend to have more conditions that entail secondary prevention - to treat something prior to the occurrence of symptoms (eg treatment of hypertension). More frail older patients require tertiary prevention for existing diseases (eg rehabilitation of stroke). Quaternary prevention includes ways to mitigate the effects of unnecessary or excessive treatments (eg medications or over investigation) and is very relevant to many older patients. Appropriate deprescribing is an important task. Older patients tend to have a base level of low physical activity and low sun exposure. If they live alone, they are at risk of poor nutrition and social isolation. Carers, in particular, are at risk of depression. Jonas is at high risk of these latter problems despite being physically reasonably well for his age. It would benefit him if he could be encouraged to become involved in activity that incorporates physical and social activity. A health assessment that involved a home visit and falls risk assessment in his home would be useful. He would benefit from continuity of care from his GP.

Her mother, aged 75 years, was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis after falling and fracturing her wrist. Jenny wants to avoid developing the same problem, so together you review her risk factors. QUESTION 1 What areas would you cover? FURTHER INFORMATION Jenny is Caucasian and lives in Hobart. She quit smoking 15 years ago after an eight-year pack history (10 cigarettes per day for 15 years). You congratulate her on keeping off her cigarettes and mention that osteoporosis prevention is just one more reason never to resume smoking. You find that Jenny's alcohol intake exceeds the recommended limit (two standard drinks on any given day), as she shares a bottle of wine with her partner most nights. You advise her that there are many reasons, including osteoporosis prevention, to cut down on her alcohol consumption. Jenny's body mass index (BMI) is 27 kg/m2. You note that there are few known health benefits to being overweight or obese, but osteoporosis prevention may be one of them; however, reaching her ideal weight would be wiser. Jenny admits to a recent decline in her previous exercise regime - she used to walk her dog for 30 minutes before work until a year ago when her dog died. You note that combining a decrease in daily alcohol consumption and an increase in her exercise regime could lead to health-enhancing weight loss.1 Jenny wants to resume her exercise regime and asks for advice about the sorts of exercises she can do to prevent osteoporosis. QUESTION 2 What types of exercise are beneficial in preventing osteoporosis?FURTHER INFORMATION Jenny tells you that her mother has been put on a combination of calcium and vitamin D tablets, and had her vitamin D level measured after her fracture. Jenny tells you that she consumes at least one serve of dairy products per day and asks if that is sufficient or if she should be taking a calcium supplement. She also asks if she should have her vitamin D level checked. QUESTION 3 What can you tell Jenny about calcium supplementation and testing for vitamin D levels? QUESTION 4 Given that her mother has osteoporosis and needs to take vitamin D and calcium supplements, would it be advisable for Jenny to have a bone scan?check Preventive health17CASE 4 CASE 4 ANSWERS ANSWER 1 You should start by noting that although there is evidence of interventions that can prevent osteoporosis, the evidence that these will prevent fractures later in life is missing, as it is difficult to prove.1 However, it is still worth reviewing the measures that Jenny can take to prevent thinning of her bones.2 If Jenny is still having regular periods, and as long as her menopause arrives at the average age of 50 years, this aspect of her health poses no increased risk for osteoporosis.2 Once the menopause arrives, Jenny's risk for bone loss will accelerate. ANSWER 2 There is increasing evidence for particular types of exercise that can help to maintain bone density. Osteoporosis Australia's website has collated this evidence to produce age-specific guidelines.3 Different types of exercise have differing benefits. Walking fast enough to increase heart rate and respiratory rate, and generate sweat, is especially good for overall health, especially heart health.2 For the bones, this type of exercise has some benefit; however, bones will respond best to a combination of progressive strength training (eg lifting weights, increasing the number of kilograms over time) and high-impact weight bearing exercise (eg jumping, skipping, dancing, basketball, tennis).4,5 Any plan that Jenny adopts should include a combination of these exercises three to five times per week for at least 30 minutes each. ANSWER 3 Osteoporosis Australia has a calcium fact sheet and a table of the calcium content of selected foods on their website,6 which can be helpful in illustrating the dietary calcium requirements, and how to explain them to patients. For premenopausal women, foods containing 1000 mg/day or more are recommended. For postmenopausal women 1300 mg/day is recommended. People should be encouraged to consume dairy products and eat other foods rich in calcium. Depending on a person's age and the type, and quantity of food eaten, your patient may need from three to five serves of calcium-rich food per day. 7 The measurement of vitamin D for those with no particular risk of severe deficiency is not recommended. Osteoporosis Australia has also produced a fact sheet on vitamin D, which is on their website.8 People who are fair-skinned and living in areas with good exposure to sun are not at risk for severe vitamin D deficiency. 5 Although vitamin D levels are lower in winter, taking a supplement of vitamin D has not been proven to be useful in asymptomatic people at low risk of deficiency, such as Jenny. 2 ANSWER 4 The test that Jenny's mother had was probably a dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to measure bone mineral density. As Jenny is at no increased risk for osteoporosis at this stage, she would not need a DXA scan.2RESOURCES FOR DOCTORS www.osteoporosis.org.au/sites/default/files/files/GP_ Snapshot_2nd_Ed_07-16.pdf www.osteoporosis.org.au/health-professional-resources REFERENCES 1.

He owns and manages a small retail business. He is married and has two adult children (a son aged 28 years and a daughter aged 24 years). Nabil has hypertension, which has been controlled for the past eight years with 40 mg of telmisartan daily. His blood pressure today is 130/80 mmHg (seated). He has been overweight for at least 15 years, since arriving in Australia from Egypt. He is 177 cm tall, weighs 98 kg and has a waist circumference of 103 cm. He does not smoke, eats three fruit or vegetable portions per day and does <15 minutes of moderate activity on most days. His mother, aged 89 years, has type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and his father died of a heart attack at the age of 60 years. QUESTION 1 What is Nabil's body mass index (BMI)? What does this BMI indicate? What does his waist circumference indicate? QUESTION 2 Using the Australian type 2 diabetes risk assessment tool (AUSDRISK; www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content diabetesRiskassessmentTool), what is Nabil's risk of developing T2DM? QUESTION 3 What other assessments and tests would you perform on Nabil? FURTHER INFORMATION Nabil's test results are shown in Table 1. QUESTION 4 What further tests are required to assess if Nabil has metabolic syndrome?Table 1. Nabil's test results Test Result Reference range HbA1c 7.3% <7.0% Fasting glucose 6.8 mmol/L <5.5 mmol/L What is the significance of metabolic syndrome? QUESTION 6 What would be your main goals for managing Nabil? QUESTION 7 What additional medications would you consider?QUESTION 8 What are some additional longer term goals? FURTHER INFORMATION Nabil achieved 8% weight loss over six months, but he regained the weight over the next 18 months. He maintained his physical activity. His lipid levels and blood pressure were adequately controlled on a statin and fibrate, and an increased dose of telmisartan, respectively. However, he needed to commence metformin after two years as his HbA1c increased to 8%. This reduced his HbA1c to 6.9%. QUESTION 9 What other interventions could be considered to control his weight and reduce his risk?check Preventive health20CASE 5 ANSWERS ANSWER 1 The formula used to calculate BMI is weight (kg)/height2 (m).1 Nabil's BMI is 31.3 kg/m2. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) classification of BMI in adults is shown in Table 2.1 According to this classification, Nabil's BMI is in the 'Obesity I' range. The risk associated with a given level of BMI varies across different ethnic groups. For example, a BMI >23 kg/m2 in patients of Chinese descent is associated with an increased risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.2,3 For patients of Middle Eastern descent, the distribution of risk appears to be similar to Europeans. Waist circumference is a useful predictor of visceral fat. Compared with BMI, waist circumference is a better predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and metabolic syndrome in men. 4 A large waist circumference significantly increases the risk of heart disease and Nabil's results are high at 102 cm for men.2,5 ANSWER 2 AUSDRISK is based on data from the Australian AUSDIAB study.6 The tool assesses risk on the basis of age, gender, ethnicity, family and past history of diabetes, current medications, smoking status, diet, physical activity, BMI, and waist circumference.7 An AUSDRISK score of 12 is considered high risk.6 Nabil's AUSDRISK score is 25, indicating that he is at high (one in three) risk of developing T2DM. This risk is equivalent to having impaired glucose tolerance and Nabil would benefit from lifestyle intervention to prevent diabetes. For example, weight loss of 5-10% (5-10 kg) can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes and CVD.8 ANSWER 3 It is important to assess what Nabil perceives is important for him. This may be challenging given his depression and lack of health literacy. However, if he can identify some goals (eg living to see his grandchildren or engaging in a pleasurable hobby) this should help in the implementation of an agreed plan for his management.Table 2. NHMRC classification of I 35.0-39.9 Obesity II 40.0 Obesity III Absolute CVD risk assessment should be performed to help inform the general practitioner (GP) and Nabil's decisions. This can be done using the Australian CVD risk charts or calculator, which assesses risk on the basis of age, gender, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background, smoking status, diabetes status, blood pressure and total/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio. Absolute CVD risk assessment should be conducted every two years in adults aged 45 years who are not already defined to be at high risk because of known CVD or clinically determined high risk. 9 The CVD calculator places Nabil's CVD risk at 13%, which means he is at high risk of developing CVD in the next five years. 1 It is important to take time explain this to Nabil and (with his permission) to his family (this may require a longer consultation as it will take 15-20 minutes). Describe his risk as a ratio (one in six risk of the heart attack) rather than percentages. Use graphic display of his risk compared with other patients and show how this might be reduced by changes in the risk factors. Ask Nabil to say back what he has understood and what it means to him. Note that adults who meet any of the following criteria are already considered to be at high risk of CVD and do not require an absolute CVD risk assessment:9 diabetes and aged >60 years and >3.5 mg/mmol for females) moderate or severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; persistent proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 2) previous of (FH) systolic blood pressure 180 mmHg or pressure 110 mmHg serum total cholesterol >7.5 mmol/L Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples aged >74 years. The following investigations should be performed:8 Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) can be used to test for T2DM and is also a marker of insulin resistance. 10 HbA1c estimates tend to be 1-2% lower in patients with renal failure than in other patients with diabetes. 10 It may also be influenced by haemoglobinopathies11 UACR and eGFR should be performed to assess for renal disease9 Plasma lipids (including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [LDL-C], HDL-C and triglycerides) should be assessed as abnormalities are markers of increased risk of CVD. The frequency of testing is every five years from 45 years of age. 9 ANSWER 4 No further tests are required for Nabil at this stage. The presence of any three of the five risk factors shown in Table 3 is diagnostic of metabolic syndrome. 12 Nabil has all five criteria indicative of a metabolic syndrome. Measurement of insulin resistance or glucose tolerance test is not required.CASE 521 check Preventive healthTable 3. Criteria for clinical diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome13 Criterion Categorical cut-off point Elevated waist circumference >94 cm in Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Sub-Saharan African men >90 cm in Asian, Central or South American men >102 cm in European men Elevated triglyceride levels (or drug treatment for elevated triglycerides)>1.7 mmol/L Reduced HDL-C (or drug treatment for reduced HDL-C)<1.0 mmol/L in men and <1.3 mmol/L in women Elevated blood pressure (or drug treatment for hypertension)>130 mmHg (systolic) or >85 mmHg (diastolic) Elevated for elevated glucose)>5.5 mmol/L HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ANSWER 5 Patients with metabolic syndrome have at least twice the risk of CVD, diabetes and renal failure, compared with those without the condition, and at 60% greater risk of premature death.14,15 ANSWER 6 It is important to discuss with Nabil what his own goals are. From the perspective of his metabolic syndrome, Nabil's management should address the individual risk factors that contribute to his metabolic syndrome, and elevated risk of diabetes and heart disease. These include the following: Weight loss This should focus on achieving and maintaining 5-10% weight loss. 8 The 5As approach can be used to assist with this intervention. It involves:9 asking patients about their weight concerns assessing their risk, motivation and health literacy providing advice agreeing on realistic goals and assisting with education and coaching arranging long-term follow-up. Weight loss can be achieved by reducing dietary caloric intake, aiming to achieve a deficit of about 2500 KJ (or about a quarter of current energy intake). In Nabil's case, limiting foods high in saturated fats is also important in reducing his CVD risk. He should also reduce portion size, increase fruit and vegetable intake, and avoid drinks with a high sugar content. This is unlikely to be achieved with brief advice alone, and will require more intensive education and support over at least six sessions.16 Patients should be assisted by referral for diet and physical activity assessment, and education from a dietitian and exercise physiologist, followed by coaching for six to eight sessions (which may be delivered by telephone) and follow-up in general practice.2,17,18Physical activity Increased physical activity and reduced sedentary activity will not only contribute to weight maintenance, but also help improve Nabil's lipid profile and reduce his CVD risk. This should be tailored to his age and lifestyle. He should accumulate 2.5-5 hours per week of moderate intensity physical activity, 1.25-2.5 hours per week of vigorous intensity physical activity, or a combination of these per week. 9 Moderate physical activity involves a moderate amount of effort with some acceleration in the heart rate (three to six Mets). Vigorous physical activity requires a large amount of effort causing rapid breathing and significantly raised heart rate (>6 Mets).19 The use of activity trackers is still unproven, but may provide a way of monitoring changes in his level of activity. Nabil should also do muscle strengthening activities on at least two days a week, avoid prolonged sitting (>2 hours) and break up periods of sitting. Optimal management of Nabil's hypertension This should include weight loss, physical activity, and limiting alcohol (2 standard drinks per day for men, 1 for women ) 9 and salt intake (4 g/ day or 65 mmol/day sodium).9 It is important to recognise the cultural factors that may influence salt use, especially in cooking, and the cultural and religious sensitivities that may be involved in admitting to drinking alcohol (as these may forbid alcohol use). ANSWER 7 Diabetes medications Metformin may be considered if Nabil's repeated glucose levels are consistent with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (fasting >7 mmol/L or HbA1c >48 mmol/L or 6.5%) and they cannot be controlled with diet and weight loss. Metformin may reduce triglyceride levels and aid weight loss, but is not approved for treatment of metabolic syndrome or obesity in the absence of diabetes in Australia. 8 Box 1. PBS criteria for prescribing statins or fibrates Patients identified as being in one of the following very high-risk categories may commence drug therapy with statins or fibrates at any cholesterol level: coronary heart disease which has become symptomatic cerebrovascular disease which has become symptomatic peripheral vascular disease which has become symptomatic diabetes mellitus with microalbuminuria (defined as of >2.5 for males, >3.5 for females) diabetes mellitus in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander patients diabetes mellitus in patients aged 60 years or more family history of coronary heart disease which has become symptomatic before the age of 55 years in two or more first degree relatives family history of coronary heart disease which has become symptomatic before the age of 45 years in one or more first degree relative.

Available at www.pbs.gov.au/info/news/2006/09/Eligibility-cholestl-lwring-meds [Accessed 26 October 2016].CASE 5check Preventive health22Lipid medications Nabil's high CVD risk means that he should be prescribed lipid-lowering medications. Treatment with a statin may be commenced, aiming to reduce LDL levels to <2.0 mmol/L. A fibrate, such as fenofibrate, should be considered as Nabil's triglyceride level is >2.3 mmol/L and his HDL is <1.0 mmol/L.1 The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) criteria (Box 1) for prescription of lipid-lowering medications allow prescription of a statin or fibrate after a trial of diet for patients with a total cholesterol >5.5 mmol/L.20 For patients at high risk, a statin or fibrate may be prescribed concurrently with diet management. Hypertension The continued use of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (telmisartan) is likely to be helpful in reducing Nabil's risk of renal disease. Given his high CVD risk, his dose of telmisartan may need to be up-titrated to reduce his blood pressure towards a target systolic blood pressure of <120 mmHg if this can be tolerated. 9,21 ANSWER 8 Nabil's wife and family need to be educated about his risk of CVD (and possibly their own risk) and the role they can play in supporting his lifestyle change. He is likely to need support, especially if his cultural and family eating practices run counter to his treatment goals. ANSWER 9 Bariatric surgery could be considered if Nabil's BMI is >35 kg/m2. However, at a BMI of 31 kg/m2, even with his high-risk waist circumference, Nabil would not meet the criteria in the NHMRC guidelines.2 Referral to a dietitian or a telephone coaching program could be considered. If Nabil is referred, it will be very important to provide referral navigation: explaining why he has been referred, what the dietitian will offer and any co-payments that he would have to make. A very low-energy diet could also be considered to help him achieve weight loss. However, the main challenge will be to maintain any weight loss. Of currently available weight loss medications, orlistat could be considered.2 However, it has gastrointestinal side effects, which may not be acceptable to Nabil.22 The GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide has been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia for weight loss.23 However, it is expensive and weight regain after cessation of these drugs has been reported.24 Each of these options (eg referral, dietary interventions, weight reduction medications) need to be carefully communicated and discussed with Nabil, including their possible benefits and disadvantages. Nabil and his wife should be given the opportunity to ask questions and provided with translated written information countaining diagrams and visual information. REFERENCES 1.
