Philosophy and Comments http://byregion.byregion.neUcgibin/users/profiles .pl?username=suzeangel#OPT2 1/3 12/31/2017 Feldenkrais Movement, Bones For Life Exercises to Prevent Osteoporosis , Chi Gong, Qigong, Sounder Sleep, Stress Reduction My personal journey of rehabilitation from a serious back injury has given me an understanding of how the emotional process is involved in physical recovery. For over 30 years I have explored many different approaches that have contributed to my knowledge of the interaction of the body and the mind to create vibrant health in a strong, functional body. For 12 years I periodica lly translated classes for Paul Chauffour, a French Osteopath who created Mechanical Link, a systematic approach to how eight fascia! systems control the body's structure. I worked with Chi Energy with a Qigong Master from China and took courses from the Upledger Institute in Cranial-Sacral Therapy and Visceral Manipulation. I have done Pilates, Egoscue, Nia, Yoga, Zumba, ballroom dance and belly dancing. I have been massaged, Rolfed and Hellerworked. I have experienced and observed all these various activities and techniques in a very \"Feldenkrais\" way, analyzing how they affect movement and body structure. My work has matured over the years. My most recent discoveries have centered around the function of the hip joint as prime mover of the body. I am appalled to see how many babies are strapped into chairs and car-seats at such an early age that they do not learn to roll over, sit up on their own, or even crawl, which should precede walking. As a results they lack coordination and never learn to use their hips joints properly. I am also disheartened to see how many people need hip joint and knee replacements in their 50's and 60's, frequently not because of injury but because they wear them out over time with improper use. I believe these problems are exacerbated by the fact that many people sit in front of computers for hours on end. My mission is to help people learn to use their not only their hip joints, but their whole body properly, so that they can have a strong, fully supported skeleton with mobile, flexible bones that last until they are 100 years old. I believe this is possible, especially with the correct nutritional support. I had my first and only child at age 46, and with pregnancy , childbirth and breastfeeding experienced a major breakdown of the integrity of my joints. That was quickly followed by menopause and all those hormonal changes. Fortunately I discovered some excellent nutritional supplements that have helped me rebuild those structures and have helped my brain and memory function better. I quickly became a believer in the efficacy of certain products and recommend the ones that helped me to my clients, helping them maintain youthful vigor. My philosophy is that movement is the key to independence at any age. We can definitely improve our bodies and our minds by monitoring how we move and what we put into our mouths, and that's food for thought. Work Hours and Fee Schedule Individual sessions combine techniques from CRANIAL-SACRAL THERAPY, VISCERAL MANIPULAT ION, MECHAN ICAL LINK and QIGONG with FELDENRKAIS FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION. This combination integrates all systems of the body while engaging the brain and relaxing the nervous system. The result is greater body awareness, improved body function and more effective movement.

Drink 2 or 3 glasses of water (16 to 24 ounces) first thing every morning before coffee, tea, medicine or food. Wait 20 to 30 minutes before eating breakfast and repeat this before each meal. Good hydration improves digest, elimination, circulation, muscle function and health. 2. Get your blood pumping and brighten your mood by walking outside every day. Swing your arms and breathe in the fresh air. Walking 10 minutes is good, 20 better and 45 best. 3. Reduce Oxidative Stress, the damage to your cells from free radicals by taking Protandim , the Nrf2 Synergizer. One pill a day turns on your survival genes so YOU make your own antioxidant enzymes. FEEL BETIER, LOOK BETTER AND PERFORM YOUR BEST! 4. Balance your calcium and magnesium for better heart and metabolic function. Excess calcium contributes to muscle cramps, constipation , kidney and gall stones and irregular heartbeat. Magnesium reduces stress, relaxes muscles and moves calcium into the bones. It is essential for energy production and over 300 enzymatic processes. 5. Avoid sitting slumped in couches or Lazyboy chairs for long periods. This posture curves your spine, tilts your pelvis under, and brings your head forward. It compresses your heart, lungs, and abdominal organs and promotes poor standing and walking posture. Sit upright in a straight-backed chair and get up to walk periodically. 6. Breathe into your diaphragm and relax your belly while you are sitting. Your abdomina l organs need room to move in order to function properly. Position your head over your pelvis, aligning your ear, shoulder and hip joint. To stand up out of a chair without using your arms, bend your pelvis, torso and head forward from the hip joints and then straighten your legs. 7. Pay attention to how you move, vary your movements and try out new activities. Break up patterns of stiffness with Feldenkrais Movement. Re-educate your muscles through baby movements to wake up your brain and keep your body healthy, resilient and responsive. 8. Find your passion, something you love doing. Enthusiasm will boost your energy level and transform the smallest happenings of your day into fun, exciting events. 9. Set flexible goals and acknowledge your small achievements along the path toward a larger dream. Never beat yourself up for not getting there quickly. Give up the pursuit of perfection. Life is a process to experience and enjoy, not a destination. 10. Take time to relax and laugh out loud. Laughter opens the diaphragm and stimulates endorphins that can heal the body and make you feel happy. Avoid the news before bed.
