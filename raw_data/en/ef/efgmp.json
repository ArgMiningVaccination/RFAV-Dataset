Thetrial protocol and statistical analysis plan appear in Supple- ment 1. The study was approved by the institutional review board at Washington University in St Louis and was con-ducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, 13the Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local regulatoryrequirements.Allparticipantsprovidedinformedconsentviae-consentorwrittenconsent. Study Design This trial was conducted in the greater St Louis metropolitanarea (eastern Missouri and southern Illinois). Patients wererecruited from April 10, 2020, to August 5, 2020. The 30-daypostrandomization follow-up assessment was completed onSeptember 19, 2020. This was a fully remote (contactless)clinical trial. 14Participants were recruited via electronic healthrecords,physicianandotherhealthprofessionalrefer-rals, study advertisements near COVID-19 testing centers andin emergency departments, referrals by colleagues, a studywebsite, and communication in local television and newspa-pers. Participants were enrolled without regard to sex, race,ethnicity, or religion. Potential participants underwentscreenings by email and phone, and provided informed con-sent,typicallyelectronically. Study supplies were delivered to self-quarantined study patients as a package left at their door and the study materi-als consisted of the study medication, an oxygen saturationmonitor, an automated blood pressure monitor, and a ther- mometer. Participants then self-assessed using the equip-ment provided and confirmed vital signs within range (sys-tolic blood pressure between 80 mm Hg and 200 mm Hg,diastolicbloodpressurebetween40mmHgand120mmHg,andpulseratebetween50beats/minand120beats/min),preg-nancy status when indicated, and oxygen saturation of 92%or greater. Study staff called participants, informed them ofeligibility,andinstructedthemtotakethestudymedication.The study medication was targeted to start on the same daythatparticipantswerefirstcontactedandscreenedbythere-searchteam. All data collection was done by twice-daily REDCap sur- veyssenttopatientsviaemail,withphone-baseddatacollec-tionasbackuptoensurethatindividualswithoutinternetac-cess were able to participate. The surveys recorded oxygensaturation,vitalsigns,medicationadherence,andCOVID-19symptoms.Fixedraceandethnicitycategorieswereusedbyinterviewers as part of the demographic information col-lectedtocharacterizethesample.

Randomization schedules were generatedthat stratified by age (18-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65 years) 16 and sex. Treatments were randomly allocated using alternat-ingblocksizesof2and4.Randomizationallocationwascon-ducted via REDCap, which displayed randomization assign-ment to the laboratory manager (J.S.), who prepared thestudy materials, including the study drug or placebo. All out-come assessors, investigators, and research staff who were incontact with participants were blinded to participant treat-mentassignment. Intervention Participants received a dose of 50 mg of fluvoxamine (ormatchingplacebo)intheeveningimmediatelyafterthebase-line assessment and confirmation of eligibility, then for 2days at a dose of 100 mg twice daily as tolerated, and thenincreasing to a dose of 100 mg 3 times daily as tolerated through day 15 then stopped (additional details appear inSupplement 1 ). This dose range was determined based on the binding affinity of fluvoxamine for the S1R. 17After the completionof15daysoffluvoxamineorplacebo,participantswere given the option to receive a 6-day open-label course offluvoxamine. This optional open-label phase was a changefromtheoriginalstudyprotocol. Primary and Secondary End Points The primary end point was clinical deterioration defined byboth the (1) presence of dyspnea (ie, shortness of breath) orhospitalization for shortness of breath or pneumonia and(2) decrease in oxygen saturation (<92%) on room air orsupplemental oxygen requirement to maintain oxygen satu-ration of 92% or greater.

The primary analysis was the survival analysis for the primary outcome (clinical deterioration) using a log-ranktest. This analysis treated participants a priori as censored onthedaythattheymettheprimaryoutcome,oronthelastday that they filled out an outcome assessment. The rate of miss-ingness for survey completion was measured. To determineif missingness was nonrandom, the available scores immedi-ately before and after each missing score and their meanwere compared with the total mean score for both shortnessofbreathandoxygensaturation.

Participants were well matched in demographic and clinical characteristics ( Table 1). Of the 152 participants, 38 (25%) were Black adults and the mean age was 46 years (SD,13 years). The most severe presenting COVID-19 symptomvaried, with fatigue (23%) and loss of sense of smell (29%)being the most common. The baseline oxygen saturationlevel did not differ between the groups (median of 97%[interquartile range, 96%-98%] for fluvoxamine vs 97%[interquartile (distributionsshownineFigure3in Supplement2 ). Efficacy of Fluvoxamine vs Placebo Clinical deterioration occurred in 0 of 80 patients in the fluvoxamine group and in 6 of 72 (8.3%) patients in the pla-cebo group (absolute difference, 8.7% [95% 1.8%-16.4%]by survival .009; Table 2 andFigure2 ).Intheplacebogroup,casesofclinicaldeterio- ration ranged from 1 to 7 days after randomization and from3to12daysaftertheonsetofCOVID-19symptoms.Fourof6patients were hospitalized for COVID-19 illness, with thelength of stay ranging from 4 to 21 days. One patientrequired mechanical ventilation for 10 days (Table 2) and nopatients died. Detailed vignettes of clinical deteriorationappear in eResults 1 in Supplement 2 . Among fluvoxamine-treated participants, 18 of 80 stopped responding to the surveys prior to day 15 comparedwith 19 of 72 who were randomized to placebo.

The mean score for oxy-gen saturation was 97.3% for both those with missing dataand overall and the median was 98% for both. Therefore, thedata appeared to be missing at random and no data imputa-tion was conducted. For the participants who stoppedresponding to the surveys prior to day 15 because they mettheprimaryendpointorforotherreasons(Figure1),thedatawere censored. In 31 individuals who stopped responding tothe surveys prior to day 15 for other reasons, we confirmedthat none received medical care at a hospital or emergencydepartment for worsening COVID-19. However, for 6 of these individuals, we could not exclude the possibility that theyreceived care at an urgent care center that was outside themajorregionalhospitalsystems. Discussion Inthispreliminaryrandomizedclinicaltrial,fluvoxamine(anS1Ragonist)wasassociatedwithareductioninclinicaldete-riorationinadultoutpatientswithCOVID-19.Nofluvoxamine-treated patients met criteria for clinical deterioration as de-finedinthestudy,whereas8.3%ofpatientstakingplacebomet this end point. However, bec ause of study limitations, these findingsneedtobeinterpretedashypothesisgeneratingratherthanasademonstrationofefficacy. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clini- cal trial demonstrated the feasibility of a fully remote(contactless) study during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adultoutpatients with COVID-19 are in self-quarantine, but fewstudies have focused on the care of this vulnerable popula-tion. This design included a short time from symptom onsetto first dose of medication (median, 4 days), efficient studytreatment initiation (92% took the first dose on the same dayas they were contacted), and representative sample of raceand sex. 20The study required approximately 4500 hours of stafftimeand30hoursoftimeperparticipant. If fluvoxamine is determined to be effective in treating COVID-19, the underlying mechanism needs further clarifi-cation. The study was prompted by a hypothesis involvingtheinfluenceoffluvoxamineontheS1R-IRE1pathway.Anti-inflammatory (cytokine reduction) actions resulting fromS1R activation would fit with recent findings of benefits ofother anti-inflammatory drugs, such as colchicine and corti-costeroids,forCOVID-19. 21,22However,ar ecentstudyfound lower levels of cytokines in patients with severe COVID-19vs patients with bacterial sepsis. 23Alternative mechanisms of a potential fluvoxamine benefit include direct antiviraleffects via its lysosomotropic properties, 24modulation of the effect SSRI tion of potential advantages of fluvoxamine for outpatient treatmentofCOVID-19includeitssafety,27widespreadavail- ability, low cost, and oral administration. Fluvoxamine doesnotpromoteQTprolongationunlikeotherSSRIs. 28However, fluvoxamine has adverse effects and can particularly via inhibition of cytochromes P4501A2 and 2C19. 29 Limitations This study has several limitations. First, it was a small studyand it was conducted within a single geographic area, sothese findings should be regarded as preliminary. The studyneeds to be replicated in larger trials with a more heteroge-neousstudypopulation. Second, there was a small number of end point events, which makes the findings extremely fragile. Third, it is pos-siblethatthedifferencesinclinicaldeteriorationmayhavebeenareflectionofthecomparativebaselinedistributionsofoxy-gensaturationratherthananeffectoftreatment. Fourth, the method of measuring the most severe base- line symptom over time did not appear to provide validdata, so potential effects of fluvoxamine on symptomaticimprovement are unknown. Fifth, 20% of study partici-pants stopped responding to surveys during the 15-day trial.Although it was confirmed that none of these participantsrequired medical care, such as hospitalization or an emer-gency department visit, it is possible that some receivedcare at an urgent care center outside the major regional hos-pital systems.Table 3.
