This Fair Registration Practices Report was produced as required by: the Fair Access to Regulated Professions and Compulsory Trades Act (FARPACTA) s. 20 and 23(1), for regulated professions named in Schedule 1 of FARPACTA the Health Professions Procedural Code set out in Schedule 2 of the Regulated Health Professions Act (RHPA) s. 22.7 (1) and 22.9(1), for health colleges. Describe how you make information about registration practices available to individuals applying or intending to apply for registration. Specify the tools used to provide information, and the manner in which you make that information available, current, accurate and user friendly in each of these subcategories: a) steps to initiate the registration process There are several ways CTCMPAO makes information about the registration process available to applicants. The primary method is through CTCMPAO 's website at www.ctcmpao.on.ca. The website allows applicants to access the information from anywhere, at any time and the website is managed in house by CTCMPAO Communication/IT staff that can be updated immediately if information changes. Applicants can access registration information on the home page ; the \"For Practitioners \" tab located in the centre of the home page and new information are also posted under \"Featured\" tab located on the left side of the home page. There are five Classes of Registration: Grandparented, General, Student, Temporary and Inactive. In 2014, CTCMPAO accepted applications for three of those Classes: Grandparented, General and Inactive. CTCMPAO expects to have applications for Student and Temporary Class of Certificate registration available sometime in 2015. Pursuant to section 6 (1) 2 of the Ontario Regulation 27/13, Registration (the \"Registration Regulation\"), effective April 1, 2014 entry to the Grandparented Class was closed. CTCMPAO announced this timeframe by way of newsletters, public Council meetings, press releases, and numerous information sessions. CTCMPAO had embarked on a huge public media campaign to remind practitioners that March 31, 2014 was the deadline for applications for Certificates of Registration in the Grandparented Class. To reach out to all eligible candidates for Grandparented Class, CTCMPAO posted a notice on its website in five different language groups: English, Chinese, Russian, French and Korean; and executed several email notifications to members, applicants and associations. Moreover, CTCMPAO reached out to the TCM community, placing over 50 advertisements in local and mainstream newspapers targeting seven different language groups: English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Russian, French, Korean, Vietnamese, Indian, and Iranian. The campaign had been tremendously successful in encouraging applicants to get their applications in before the deadline. The campaign was launched on February 28, 2014 and carried on throughout March, 2014. Approximately 500 applications for the Grandparented Class were received in the month of March. Moreover, in order to address the issue of deficiencies in a number of applications received by CTCMPAO, nine in -person advising sessions were held throughout the year at CTCMPAO 's office to over 570 applicants with the opportunity to submit the additional documents required to complete their applications. Applicants personally attended CTCMPAO 's office in this time period to receive one -on-one support from staff with the processing of their application materials. Provision of Information About Registration Practices (1 / 13) Page 1 of 55 Under our Registration Regulation, effective January 1, 2014, the General Class of Certificate of Registration (Provisional) is no longer accepting application. Starting 2014, applicants applying for General Class of Certificate of registration will have to complete all registration requirements, including the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations to be eligible for registration with CTCMPAO. CTCMPAO relayed this information on its website, council meetings and several email notifications were sent to members, applicants and associations. Although, the deadline to submit completed application in the General Class to use the Provisional title was December 31, 2013, many candidates had not been able to successfully complete Pre-Registration Tests (i.e. Jurisprudence Course Test and Safety Program Test) prior to the deadline and as such, had not met the requirements for entry to practice. Therefore, CTCMPAO extended the deadline to March 31, 2014 for those General Class applicants who had submitted applications to use the Provisional titles by the deadline of December 31, 2013, but had not yet completed the Tests. CTCMPAO staff are responsible for updating registration information of the website and ensuring it is current, accurate and presented in a user friendly manner. Changes to the information on the website are made immediately if a requirement changes or new information are identified based on regulations and feedback received by CTCMPAO from applicants, members or other stakeholders. When staff are provided with feedback from applicants/members or identify a problem with any information posted on the website (either inaccurate or confusing) they notify and changes are managed by Communication/IT department. CTCMPAO also has dedicated staff readily available to answer phone calls and e -mails during business hours. There is also staff available on -site to meet with individuals for walk -in or pre-scheduled meeting at CTCMPAO 's office. Staff assist applicants who had missing documentation or had not submitted evidence of completion of non - exemptible registration requirements by written follow up, emails, letters, telephone calls and where necessary personal appointments. Each registration application form comes with a checklist to help applicants determine if an individual is ready to apply for registration and identify the next steps in the registration process. All staff are trained to address questions about the registration requirements and process or, to process submitted applications. As necessary they will direct applicants to other CTCMPAO staff or third party organizations for additional assistance. CTCMPAO has been made aware that some members/applicants have been provided with information that runs contrary to that being provided by CTCMPAO. Therefore, CTCMPAO created a Myths and Facts page which allows applicants/members to clarify their position and ensure compliance with CTCMPAO 's registration requirements. Finally, CTCMPAO provides \"Fact Sheets \" to assist its applicants on topics such as Professional Titles and Certification and the Registration Examinations. CTCMPAO accommodates all requests for accessible communication for people with disabilities to the point of undue hardship. As a next step, CTCMPAO is conducting a complete review of CTCMPAO 's website to ensure that it describes in plain and accessible language and with intuitive search features all of the programs, registration requirements and regulatory activities of CTCMPAO. CTCMPAO received approximately 1200 applications and issued 1045 Certificates of registration in 2014. Approximately 800 of those applications were received between January 1, 2014 and April 1, 2014. As of December 2014, CTCMPAO had issued 3031 Certificates of registration within a twenty month period since proclamation, which was April 1, 2013. Grandparented Class of Registration The intent of the Grandparented Class is to permit entry to those practitioners who were practising traditional Chinese medicine in Ontario at the time of proclamation of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Act, 2006. However in order to ensure the public is protected, certain safeguards are required. These include requiring applicants to provide CTCMPAO with evidence of having completed a minimum of 2,000 traditional Chinese medicine patient visits in Canada in the five years before April 1, 2013 (the date the Registration Regulation came into force), and successfully completing CTCMPAO 's Jurisprudence Course and Safety Program. As of December 2014, CTCMPAO had issued 2718 Grandparented Certificates of Registration. As noted above, under the Registration Regulation, entry to the Grandparented Registration Class of Certificate is time -limited. Pursuant to section 6(1)2 of the Registration Regulation, entry to the Grandparented Registration Class of Certificate was closed on April 1, 2014. Page 2 of 55The steps to initiate the registration process in the Grandparented Class of Registration are as follows: Complete Application Form Complete Jurisprudence Course Complete Safety Program Complete 2,000 patient visits in Canada, which may include traditional Chinese acupuncture patient visits, in which traditional Chinese medicine diagnoses was utilized in the five years immediately before proclamation which was April 1, 2013 Provide proof of meeting all non -exemptible requirements for registration Provide details on previous professional conduct Provide results of a criminal background check Ability to speak, read, and write either English or French with reasonable fluency (applicants for Grandparented Class lacking in fluency in either English or French must provide a written plan on how to communicate with patients and other healthcare professionals to ensure continuity of care.) Applicant must not have a physical or mental condition or disorder that may impact the ability to practise the profession safely Applicants registered by any regulatory body in any profession in Ontario or another province must be in good standing Provide evidence of Professional Liability Insurance coverage Pay required fees Complete and sign declaration on Application Form Submit completed Application General Class of Registration General Class of Registration is intended for applicants who may not have extensive practice experience in Canada; however have education and training in traditional Chinese medicine that meets the entry to practice competencies required to practice in Canada. In 2013, CTCMPAO accepted applications in the General Class to use the Provisional title/designation. Under the Registration Regulation,Provisional Registration was intended to allow General Class applicants to be registered and practice to ensure practitioners, who have the required TCM education and were practising traditional Chinese medicine in Ontario prior to proclamation, can continue to practice until the approval and implementation of a Registration Examinations -Pan-Canadian Examinations. Thus, if a General Class member has not completed the registration (entry -to-practice) examinations he or she must indicate \"(Provisional) \" after their designation ( \"R. TCMP\" or\" R.Ac\"). Once a member with a General Class Certificate of Registration (\"Provisional\") passes the examination within two consecutive attempts, the \"Provisional \" title will be removed. As of December 2014, the CTCMPAO had issued 178 General Provisional Certificates of Registration and 36 General Provisional members have successfully completed the Registration Examinations to remove the Provisional title/designations. On May 23, 2013, CTCMPAO approved the Registration Examinations, the Pan -Canadian Examinations developed by the Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bodies of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists (CARB -TCMPA), the national organization of provincial and territorial regulatory bodies that govern and monitor the practice of TCM Practitioners, Acupuncturists and/or Herbalists in Canada. In 2008, the Transitional Council joined the regulators of traditional Chinese medicine in British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador in forming the Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bodies of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists ( \"CARB\"). CARB-TCMPA's purpose was to develop a plan to remove provincial barriers to registration by, among other things, setting up similar processes and sharing information. The Registration Examinations -Pan-Canadian Examinations is in two parts, Written and Clinical Case Study. Under our Registration Regulation, effective January 1, 2014, with the approval of the Registration Examinations by CTCMPAO, the General Class of Registration to use the Provisional title/designation will no longer be accepting applications. Starting 2014, applicants applying for General Class of Registration will have to complete all registration requirements including the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations to be eligible for registration with CTCMPAO. As of December 2014, 81 members were holding a Certificate of Registration in the General Class. Page 3 of 55The steps to initiate the registration process in the General Class of Registration are as follows: Complete four -year full-time post-secondary traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) program or a three - year full-time TCM acupuncture program or a program of equivalent duration Complete Supervised Clinical Experience (500 Hours) Complete Jurisprudence Course Complete Safety Program Complete Registration Examinations -Pan-Canadian Examinations (Provisional title/designation holders complete the examination after being registered with CTCMPAO) Provide details on previous professional conduct Provide results of a criminal background check Be able to speak, read and write either English or French with reasonable fluency Applicant must not have a physical or mental condition or disorder that may impact the ability to practise the profession safely Applicants registered in any profession in Ontario or another province must be in good standing Applicants applying under the Labour Mobility Act, must be in good standing and be able to provide a letter of good standing issued by the Registrar of the College of the other Province Provide evidence of Professional Liability Insurance coverage Pay required fees Complete and sign declaration on Application Form Submit completed Application Inactive Class This classification does not apply to any applicants not currently registered with CTCMPAO. Only Grandparented and General Class members of CTCMPAO can apply for the Inactive Certificate of Registration. Pursuant to Ontario Regulation 27/13, Registration (the \"Registration Regulation \"), the purpose of the Inactive Certificate of Registration is to allow Grandparented and General Class members to remain as members of CTCMPAO when they anticipate that they will not be practising in Ontario for a period of time (for example when on parental, sick or educational leave or practising in other jurisdictions). Information for Applicants Effective April 1, 2014, CTCMPAO is accepting applications only for General Class of Registration. Individuals interested in applying for registration with CTCMPAO can find information, Registration Application Form, and Candidate 's Guide on CTCMPAO 's website under the Registration Application Forms tab.

Grandparented Class of Registration Grandparenting refers to an assessment process to register existing practitioners who may have a wide range of training, skills and experience in traditional Chinese medicine profession in Canada. Such arrangements balance the need for a standard of competence that will provide the necessary protection to the public with a philosophy that strives to be as inclusive as reasonably possible. To show evidence of successful completion of minimum of 2,000 patient visits in Canada for which traditional Chinese medicine diagnoses is utilized, which may include traditional Chinese acupuncture patient visits, within the five -year period immediately before April 1,2013; section 10 of the Application Form asked applicants to identify which of 52 common TCM disorders the applicant had diagnosed and treated. This is not an exhaustive list of all disorders. The intent is to identify if the applicant has a base level of competency consistent with Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada and experience in traditional Chinese medicine and/or acupuncture. CTCMPAO developed a policy outlining the interpretation of Traditional Chinese Medicine Patient Visits, available on CTCMPAO's website. On the Application Form, applicants indicated whether those visits were for traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture only or whether they were for the full range of traditional Chinese medicine. This information helped determine which title and designation (R.TCMP or R.Ac) the applicant would receive. Grandparenting is an accommodation mechanism for those practising at the time of proclamation; thus Page 6 of 55applicants must have applied for registration within one year of the Registration Regulation coming into force. Pursuant to the Registration Regulation, Applicants must have submitted their completed applications to the Registrar on or before April 1, 2014. Effective April 1, 2014, entry to the Grandparented Class was closed.

CTCMPAO will consider that an applicant has attained the language fluency if he/she can complete the registration Application Form, the Jurisprudence Course and Safety Program, and be able to understand communications coming from the CTCMPAO. CTCMPAO expects members to have the ability to communicate with patients and other health professionals in English or French to the extent that he/she: Understands the information provided by patients Able to give advice to patients and patients understand Can obtain patient consent Can discuss treatment plan with patients Able to document and maintain patient records Respond to inquiries from patients or about patients from another health professional Able to comprehend and understand patient records sent by other health professionals Able to provide speedy and accurate information about a patient during emergency In addition, it is important for members to be able to communicate and work collaboratively with regulated health professionals, hospitals, long -term care homes, emergency responders and other stakeholders in Ontario 's health system. CTCMPAO is currently considering developing and implementing a language proficiency policy that is transparent, objective, impartial and fair . However, in recognition of the language challenges that some applicants for Grandparented Class may encounter, s. 4(2) of the Registration Regulation exempts applicants for Grandparented registration from the requirement to speak, read and write English or French with reasonable fluency. Any Grandparented member who is not fluent in either English or French must have a written language plan that will effectively deal with inter -professional collaboration and continuity of care posed by lack of fluency in either English or French. General Class of Registration General Class of Registration is intended for applicants who have formal education and training in TCM profession, who, however, may not have substantial work experience in the profession. To assess a General Class applicant, we review and consider what the applicant has completed in the course of study and the extent of equivalency to our approved Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada.The Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations must be completed prior to submitting an application for a Certificate of Registration in the General Class with CTCMPAO.

When applicants apply for the Registration Examinations -Pan-Canadian Examinations, as a part of the application process, General Class applicants ' completed education program is assessed by CTCMPAO to identify the extent of the relevance to the Council 's approved and published competencies for traditional Chinese medicine practice in Canada. Candidates will be required to submit information that details how their completed education is aligned to the competencies. Unlike approval of an education program, the assessment focuses on the cumulative competencies applicants have obtained through formal education and post -graduate studies. This competency based assessment process ensures a fair and objective evaluation process of both internationally -trained and Canadian -trained candidates. To assist applicants to understand the competency assessment process, CTCMPAO has developed the Guideline for Evaluation of Applicant 's Traditional Chinese Medicine and/or Acupuncture Education or a Substantially Equivalent Education Program and Assessment of Competency and can be found on CTCMPAO's website. A passing result on the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations indicates that the applicant has demonstrated a minimal standard of competence. Under the Registration Regulation, General Class applicants must complete the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations within three attempts. Applicants who fail the examination three times are not eligible to repeat the examination fourth time unless the applicant completes the further education or training or combination of education and training required by a panel of the Registration Committee.There are two components to the Pan -Canadian Examinations: 1.A multiple -choice written examination 2.A written clinical case study examination An applicant must successfully complete the multiple -choice Written Examination before sitting the written Clinical Case Study Examination.

The Registration Application Form and the Candidate 's Guide are available on CTCMPAO 's website. d) any education or practical experience required for registration that must be completed in Ontario or practice that must be supervised by a member of the profession who is registered in Ontario There are no education or practical experience requirements that must be completed in Ontario. With respect to supervision of applicants, under the Registration Regulation, all General Class applicants must complete a supervised clinical experience program. Generally, applicants who complete formal education in Ontario after proclamation of the TCM Act, which was April 1, 2013 are required to ensure that such supervisions are performed by qualified members of CTCMPAO as per section 29(1)(b) of the Regulated Health Professions Act (RHPA). Grandparented Class of Registration To obtain a Grandparented Certificate of Registration applicants are required to submit evidence of 2,000 patient visits for which traditional Chinese medicine was utilized in Canada within the five years prior to April 1, 2013. Given that CTCMPAO was proclaimed in April 1, 2013, it was important for CTCMPAO to recognize those individuals practising traditional Chinese medicine or traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture during proclamation through a Grandparented Registration process. Thus, this Certificate of Registration was intended for those individuals who were practicing the profession in Canada during proclamation. It is not appropriate to consider practice outside of Canada for this purpose as the applicant is being excused from the formal education and registration examinations requirements. Information regarding the Grandparented Registration requirement of providing evidence for 2,000 patient visits in Canada for which traditional Chinese medicine diagnoses was utilized was available in the Application Form available on CTCMPAO 's website as well as provided to applicants via phone calls, emails, and in -person and during walk -in customer service. General Class of Registration Page 9 of 55General Class applicants are required to successfully complete a structured and evaluated program of clinical experience in the profession taking place anywhere in Canada or outside of Canada. The clinical supervised experience can be obtained either as a part of an applicant 's formal education program or separately, so long as it meets the requirements. On the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations Application Form, a series of questions are asked to help applicants to submit this information; applicants are also required to attach documentation to verify the information submitted. With respect to supervision of applicants, CTCMPAO notes that all applicants must complete a supervised clinical experience program. CTCMPAO has developed a Supervision Policy explaining the obligation of members who agree to supervise applicants. Members who act as Supervisors to applicants do not require pre-approval from the Registrar. However, it is understood that the clinical experience program has adequate measures to ensure that only those that are qualified to supervise in the clinical experience program will do so. Applicants are provided the above information through the Registration Application Form and Candidates Guide to the Application available on CTCMPAO 's website as well as by email, phone calls, in person appointments and walk -in customer service and, where appropriate, via letter. e) requirements that may be satisfied through acceptable alternatives Our Registration Regulation is embedded with alternative provisions. f) the steps in the assessment process Information about the steps in the assessment process is available on CTCMPAO 's website at www.ctcmpao.on.ca > For Practitioners > Registration Application Forms. Applicants can click on one of the following choices: General Class of Registration General Class of Registration (Labour Mobility) Grandparented Class of Registration (Not available effective April 1, 2014) Candidates Guide for General Class of Registration outlines steps and has links to more detailed information. Under our Registration Regulation, effective April 1, 2014,entry to Grandparented Class was closed, thus all information related to registration in this Class had been removed from CTCMPAO's website. Potential applicants can obtain this information by contacting CTCMPAO by telephone or email. CTCMPAO staff is also available to speak to applicants who come to CTCMPAO in person. Changes to update or clarify the Registration process of the website are made by staff as noted above in 1a. The steps are as follows: a. Receive application Envelopes are date -stamped upon arrival and given to a CTCMPAO staff member. The staff member opens the envelope and date -stamps each page of the Application Form and supporting documents, and then scans and saves the photograph. Each application is assigned a reference number. CTCMPAO sends an Acknowledgement of Receipt notice to the applicant by email/mail. b. Screen application CTCMPAO staff inputs the information contained in the Application Form into the CTCMPAO database and verifies that the form and accompanying documents are complete. There are two possible outcomes to this step: Page 10 of 55I. If the file is screened as incomplete (e.g. waiting to complete Jurisprudence Course, Safety Program, Registration Examinations), the staff prints an incomplete letter to be mailed/emailed to the applicant advising which areas of the application need to be completed. Reminder notices via email and personal phone calls to applicants are made on a regular basis until the file is completed. Where appropriate, in - person meetings are arranged to help applicants complete the Application Form. This year CTCMPAO hosted more than nine in -person full day meeting sessions, lead by CTCMPAO staff , where individual applicants were given personal appointment times for one -on-one support in the resolution of outstanding items where the applicant was missing documentation or provided insufficient information. During the reporting period, CTCMPAO staff provided assistance opportunity to over 570 applicants to complete their application through these in person full -day meeting sessions. Approximately 250 applicants personally attended CTCMPAO 's office in this time period to receive one -on-one support from staff with the processing of their application materials. II. If the file is screened as complete, the file is given to the Registration and Examinations Coordinator for an individual assessment or to the Director of Registration and Examinations for review. c. Review, Assess and Register Each applicant file is reviewed and assessed first by an Entry -to-Practice staff member or Registration and Examinations Coordinator and then the Director of Registration and Examinations. The Director of Registration and Examinations then once again reviews all applications to verify that required documents including required examinations are all present and valid. If the applicant meets all the requirements for registration with CTCMPAO, the application is considered to be \"Complete\" and the application proceeds to the Registrar. The Registrar issues a \"Member Letter\", indicating that the applicant is now registered as a member of CTCMPAO.

Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations CTCMPAO 's Council approved Registration Examinations - the Pan-Canadian Examinations developed by the Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bodies of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists (CARB-TCMPA). The Examination is offered in English. There are two components to the Pan -Canadian Examinations: Page 14 of 551.A multiple -choice written examination 2.A written clinical case study examination The CARB -TCMPA is the national organization of provincial and territorial regulatory bodies that govern and monitor the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists. In 2008, the Transitional Council joined the regulators of traditional Chinese medicine in British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador in forming the Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bodies of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists ( \"CARB\"). CARB-TCMPA's purpose was to develop a plan to remove provincial barriers to registration by, among other things, setting up similar processes and sharing information. The Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations will use the same standards and processes to ensure safe, effective and ethical practice to evaluate both internationally -trained candidates and Canadian - trained candidates. These national examinations are also meant to ensure quality standards and facilitate labour mobility across provinces. To ensure a fair and transparent assessment process, CARB -TCMPA, representing all five TCM regulatory bodies across Canada contracted an examinations administration consulting firm to administer and score the Pan -Canadian Examinations on behalf of each province. However, each provincial regulatory body including CTCMPAO makes all decision respecting the result of each applicant's assessment of successful completion of the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations. CARB-TCMPA is responsible for: Developing the Pan -Canadian Examinations based on the occupational competencies that entry -level TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists must have to practise safely, effectively and ethically, in consultation with all members of CARB -TCMPA, which includes TCM experts from all five provinces. Developing the Blueprint document to describe the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations in consultation with all members of CARB -TCMPA to facilitate the development of reliable and valid examinations to assess applicants fairly, in a consistent and transparent manner. Developing new examination questions and revising and analysing performance of existing examination questions and thus, update the item bank to ensure a robust item bank Determining the passing score in consultation with all members of CARB -TCMPA The CARB -TCMPA-selected examinations administration consulting firm is responsible for: Marking answer sheets and confirming scores; Sending results of each applicant 's assessment to CTCMPAO; and Providing a transparent, objective, impartial and fair process, including addressing candidates ' concerns, such as requests for re -scoring, if warranted.

The Grandparented Class is a time -limited accommodation mechanism for those practicing at the time of proclamation in Canada. CTCMPAO announced this time frame by way of newsletters, public Council meetings, press releases, and numerous information sessions. CTCMPAO had embarked on a huge public media campaign to remind practitioners the deadline for applications for Certificates of registration in the Grandparented Class. To reach out to all eligible candidates for Grandparented Class, CTCMPAO posted a notice on its website in five different language groups: English, Chinese, Russian, French and Korean; and executed several email notifications to members, applicants and associations. Moreover, CTCMPAO reached out to the TCM community, placing over 50 advertisements in local and mainstream newspapers targeting seven different language groups: English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Russian, French, Korean, Vietnamese, Indian, and Iranian. The campaign had been tremendously successful in encouraging applicants to get their applications in before the deadline. The campaign was launched on February 28, 2014 and carried on throughout March 2014. General Class Registration Currently, if a member has a General Certificate of Registration that indicates \"(Provisional) \" after their designation ( \"R. TCMP\" or \"R.Ac\"), he or she has not completed the Registration Examinations - Pan- Canadian Examinations. Under the Registration Regulation, Provisional status allowed to begin registering members while Registration Examinations components to support the Certificate of General registration were being developed and approved by Council. The Registration Examination is in two parts, Written and Clinical. Once a member with a General Class Certificate of Registration passes the examination, within two consecutive attempts, the \"Provisional \" element of the title will be removed. In May 2013, Council approved the Registration Examination, the Pan -Canadian Examinations developed by CARB-TCMPA. Under our Registration Regulation, effective January 1, 2014, the Class for General Registration to use the Provisional title/designation will no longer be accepting applications.

Jurisprudence Course The Jurisprudence Course Test offered by third party accommodates individuals with various disabilities, including learning disabilities, for example by providing more time to complete the Jurisprudence Course or allowing the candidate to complete the course in a separate examination area. To accommodate language needs of Grandparented applicants who declared lack of reasonable fluency in English, CTCMPAO dedicate test dates in its office and allow applicants to bring their own interpreters to the test. CTCMPAO emailed applicants who had failed the test due to a lack either in English or French language proficiency and communicate that they could write the test with the assistance of a translator. This information is available on CTCMPAO's website. To date, approximately 53 applicants completed Jurisprudence Course through language accommodation. Safety Program The Safety Program Test offered by a third party, accommodates those with health or physical challenges and gives more time for those who need it or allows the candidate to complete the course in a separate examination area. Despite the high pass rate of the Safety Program Test, CTCMPAO took further steps to accommodate language needs of Grandparented applicants. In May 2013, Council approved a \"Safety Test Accommodation Plan\" and posted this information on CTCMPAO 's website along with an Application Form. CTCMPAO also advises Grandparented applicants who failed the Safety Program Test via email and phone calls that if they declared that they could not speak, read or write English or French with reasonable fluency, CTCMPAO will permit them to write the test again at home with the assistance of a translator retained by the applicant. CTCMPAO deems all applicants who take the Safety Program Test at home with the assistance of a translator to have successfully completed review of the Safety Program Handbook content if they are able to satisfactorily respond to a series of questions that CTCMPAO provides. The questions require applicants to, among other requirements; explain how they will apply safety standards in their own practice. Although no \"pass or fail\" is given, practitioners who cannot demonstrate that they understand the safety requirements are asked to resubmit their responses. To date, 129 number of applicants completed Safety Program through language accommodation. Applicants can obtain the information from CTCMPAO 's website. Registration Examinations -Pan-Canadian Examinations CTCMPAO 's third party administrator of the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations accommodates various disabilities that could adversely affect an applicant 's performance on an examination and requires the applicant to complete a Testing Accommodation Candidate Application Form.

The formal diagnosis must describe the disability. During the reporting period, only 5 applicants requested for accommodation to write the Registration Examinations. Please identify and explain the changes in your registration practices relevant to this section that Page 20 of 55BACK TO INDEX BACK TO INDEXoccurred during the reporting year. Are any of the fees different for internationally trained applicants? If yes, please explain. There is no difference in fees for internationally trained applicants. Please identify and explain the changes in your registration practices relevant to this section that occurred during the reporting year. CTCMPAO's fee schedule is set out in the College By -Laws. On April 7, 2014, following the required sixty day by-laws circulation to each members, Council amended the by -laws to set the 2014 -2015 Registration application fee to $252.75 and approved that effective June 1, each fee [but for 2014 -2015] described in the by-laws shall be increased annually by 2% plus the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for goods and services in Ontario as published by Statistics Canada or any successor organization.Amount of Fees (2 / 13) a) What are your timelines for making registration decisions? Once an application meets all the registration requirements and all of the documents (criminal report and statutory declaration, etc.) have been submitted, the file is considered complete and applicants are issued a Certificate of Registration and provided with written confirmation of their registration via email and mail within three to eight weeks of CTCMPAO 's receipt of a complete registration application. Approximately 95% of the applications received in 2014 were processed within the above timeline. An applicant will also be informed in writing if her or his application are referred to the Panel of the Registration Committee (s 15 (1) b of the code). When an application is referred to a Panel of the Registration Committee for review, the timeline for making the registration decision is generally two to six months. Registration Committee decisions are sent to the applicant in writing via registered mail within two to four weeks of a Panel of the Registration Committee meeting date. CTCMPAO posts information about the next available examinations on its website. Once applicants have completed their Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations, Jurisprudence Course and Safety Provision of Timely Decisions, Responses and Reasons (3 / 13) Page 21 of 55Program, CTCMPAO forwards results, and in case of Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations, subject area mark breakdown, within one to two weeks. The amount of time the registration process takes depends to a great extent on the time the applicant needs to gather and submit his or her documents. If an application is missing any information, a deficiency notice is sent to the applicant and in some cases, CTCMPAO staff makes in -person appointments to help applicants complete their applications. This year CTCMPAO hosted more than nine in -person full day meeting sessions, lead by CTCMPAO staff, where individual applicants were given personal appointment times for one -on-one support in the resolution of outstanding items where the applicant was missing documentation or provided insufficient information. In 2014, CTCMPAO staff provided assistance opportunity to over 570 applicants to complete their application through these in person full -day meeting sessions. When an application is referred to a Panel of the Registration Committee for review under section 15(1)b of the Code, the registration decision may take several months to be processed, as the Panel of the Registration Committee usually meets once every six weeks; the complexity of the application being reviewed by the Panel of the Registration Committee is also a factor. The Panel will review the individual 's application and supporting documentation before making a decision in respect of that application. Applicants are advised of the decision in writing within two to three weeks of the Panel meeting. However, the written reasons for the decision will be sent to the applicant within ten to twelve weeks. From January until December 2014, the Registration Committee Panel met ten times to deliberate on seventy - seven applications. As of December 2014, CTCMPAO has successfully registered 3031 applicants over a twenty month period since proclamation. The Application Form and Candidates Guides are available on CTCMPAO 's website, as well as at CTCMPAO's office, provides a general explanation regarding the registration process and timelines to help applicants identify the next steps. CTCMPAO continues to offer face -to-face communications with individuals visiting the office by appointment, as well as via phone calls and email. CTCMPAO handles over 100 inquiries on a daily basis regarding registration, renewals, Registration Examinations and general inquires. b) What are your timelines for responding to applicants in writing? Every effort is made to respond to written requests for information within five to seven business days. However, starting 2015, CTCMPAO will establish a process to respond to inquiries within two to three business days . Upon receipt of an application, CTCMPAO staff responds to the applicant with a letter of acknowledgement, and within two to six weeks of receiving an application, CTCMPAO notifies the applicant of any errors or omissions in their package. Where an application meets all the registration requirements, applicants are provided with written confirmation of their registration via email within three to eight weeks of CTCMPAO 's receipt of a complete registration package. If an application is referred to a panel, the applicant is notified in writing by letter of the referral to the panel (s 15(3) of the Code). This letter of notice of the referral informs the applicant of the statutory grounds for the referral and the applicant's right to make written submissions to the panel for a period up to thirty days after receiving the notice (s18(1) of the Code). After the panel meeting, Registration Committee decisions are sent to applicants in writing via registered mail and email within two to three weeks of a Panel of the Registration Committee meeting date. However, the written reasons for the decision will be sent to the applicant within ten to twelve weeks of a Panel of the Registration Committee meeting date (s 20(1) of the Code). Page 22 of 55Starting 2015, CTCMPAO will conduct a review of it's timelines for responding to applicants in writing. c) What are your timelines for providing written reasons to applicants about all registration decisions, internal reviews and appeal decisions? Registration decisions are organized around the Registration Committee meeting schedule. The Registration Committee typically meets every six weeks, although a teleconference may be held in the interim should it be necessary to deal with an urgent matter. Applicants for whom positive decisions are made (i.e., with no conditional requirements attached) may act on the decision immediately; written reasons are not required. An applicant, whose application has been denied, is issued a formal Panel order including written reasons (s 20(1) of the Code). CTCMPAO 's timeline to provide the applicant with a Panel Order is ten to twelve weeks from the date of the Panel meeting. These Panel Orders are accompanied by a written letter advising the applicant of their right to appeal the decision to the Health Professional Appeal and Review Board within thirty days of the date of the cover letter (s 20(2) of the Code). d) Explain how your organization ensures that it adheres to these timelines. All applications are date -stamped to record the received date and applications are processed and reviewed in the order they are received. CTCMPAO ensures that it adheres to these timelines by holding regular Registration Committee meetings and by informing Committee members of time -sensitive issues as soon as possible. Timelines are tracked using a logbook, which tracks the timeline for providing written decisions by CTCMPAO 's Panel of the Registration Committee. Timelines are also tracked on the database to monitor the time it took to process each registration application, to help ensure the timelines are met. Although Registration Committee meets every six weeks, to review the high number of applications referred to the Panel in 2014, the Panel sometime met every three to four weeks to deliberate on applications. College operation and systems assist in adhering to these timelines. These include: Continuously monitoring and evaluating the service standard and timelines Grouping of applications from similar issues/jurisdictions to one evaluators so that efficiencies are achieved Staff goals for providing reasonable processing turnaround times are monitored All general inquiries are tracked in a logbook and replied within three to five business days Immediately before the entry deadline to the Grandaprented and General Class (Provisional) of registration, as prescribed by Ontario Regulation 27/13, Registration (the \"Registration Regulation\"), CTCMPAO had to undertake several emergency measures at the beginning of March in order to deal with the influx of applications. Eleven additional full -time temporary staff had been hired throughout the year for a period of time to assist with the processing of applications. Moreover, staff worked overtime, including statutory holidays, to process applications to ensure applicants could be granted registration in due time. Please identify and explain the changes in your registration practices relevant to this section that occurred during the reporting year. Page 23 of 55BACK TO INDEX a) Describe how you give applicants access to their own records related to their applications for registration. CTCMPAO has not received any such requests from applicants to access their own records as applicants have provided most of the documents that appear in their file. The applicant is also informed of the documentation reviewed by the Registration Committee and if registration is refused,the applicant will receive a copy of the reasons and decisions issued by the Panel of the Registration Committee (s 20(1) of the Code). In 2014, CTCMPAO has developed a policy in accordance with the Health Professions Procedural Code, Schedule 2 to the Regulation Health Professions Act, 1991 , which states that upon written request CTCMPAO will provide an applicant with a photocopy of his or her application materials.The applicant must submit the following service fee with their written request (s 16(1) of the Code): $50.00 per request, which includes copies of the first twenty -five pages, and $1.00 per page thereafter, plus HST b) Explain why access to applicants ' own records would be limited or refused. The Registrar may refuse to give an applicant access to anything in the record that may, in the Registrar 's opinion, jeopardize the safety of any person (s. 16(2) of the Code). c) State how and when you give applicants estimates of the fees for making records available. Information about the fees for making records available is included in the Candidate 's Guide available on CTCMPAO's website. This information can also be found by communicating with staff. Once the applicant has made a request for copies, CTCMPAO staff will confirm the number of pages to be copied with the applicant before the request is processed. d) List the fees for making records available. Please see 4a. e) Describe the circumstances under which payment of the fees for making records available would be waived or would have been waived. A portion of all or any prescribed fee may be waived only at the discretion of the Registrar,in financial hardship Access to Records (4 / 13) Page 24 of 55BACK TO INDEXsituations. Please identify and explain the changes in your registration practices relevant to this section that occurred during the reporting year. Developed a policy on Access to Records as indicated above. a) List and describe any resources that are available to applicants, such as application guides, exam blueprints or programs for orientation to the profession.

College By -laws b) Describe how your organization provides information to applicants about these resources. CTCMPAO 's website is the main source of information for applicants. Potential applicants are first guided to the appropriate section of the website where they can access registration Application Form, including the checklist that applies to applicants. This information is available on the Registration Application Forms section of the website, in the For Practitioners section. The Registration Examination Application Package is available on the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations section in the same For Practitioners section. Registration Policies are available on the Policies section of the website under the For Practitioners section. The Jurisprudence Handbook and Safety Program Handbook are available on the website under the For Practitioners section, and are provided to applicants in hard copy upon request for a service fee of $15.00 + HST. CTCMPAO 's website has links to third party exam administrator -Safety Program and Jurisprudence Course test administrator including resources to assist candidates in preparation to write the Safety Program and Jurisprudence Course tests. Information on Safety Program and Jurisprudence Course language accommodation tests are also posted on the CTCMPAO's website. Staff also directs individuals to the CTCMPAO website when they call in to CTCMPAO 's main phone number. Staff also refer applicants to the website for more information about the registration process. Any written correspondence provided to applicants advises them about the appropriate CTCMPAO staff person to contact if they require further assistance. Please identify and explain the changes in your registration practices relevant to this section that occurred during the reporting year. Page 26 of 55In this section, describe your internal review or appeal process. Some regulatory bodies use these two terms (internal review and appeal) for two different processes, some use only one of these terms, and some use them interchangeably. Please use the term that applies to your profession. If you use both terms (for two different processes), please address both. a) List your timelines for completing internal reviews or appeals of registration decisions. The Office of the Fairness Commissioner (OFC) has advised CTCMPAO that they consider any referral to the Panel of the Registration Committee to be an \"internal review \". CTCMPAO is responsible for administering the registration function of CTCMPAO in a manner consistent with the Regulated Health Professions Act . If the Registrar has reason to believe an applicant has not met all of the requirements for a certificate of registration, or proposes to refuse an application, the application is referred in writing to a panel of the Registration Committee [s 15.(1)(b) of the Code]. A panel is comprised of a minimum of three members of the Registration Committee (i.e., two members of the College and a Council member who is a public member) [s 17.(2)of the Code]. The applicant is notified in writing of the grounds for the referral and the applicant is given 30 days to make submissions (s 18 (1) of the Code). After reviewing applicants ' submissions, the Panel of the Registration Committee may request for more information/clarification from an applicant, which will may be required to assist the committee in making a fair and well reasoned decision. The Registration Committee/Panel generally meets once every six weeks or as needed to review referrals of the applications. Once a decision is made, the decision, reasons and next steps are immediately communicated to the applicant (s 20(1) of the Code). If an applicant 's registration is denied, the cover letters for decision and reasons provide applicants with instructions about filing an appeal with HPARB (s 20(2) of the Code). Appeals of CTCMPAO Registration Committee decisions are heard by HPARB, which is solely responsible for its own timeline. When an application is referred to a Panel of the Registration Committee under section 15(1)b of the Code, the timeline for making registration decision is generally two to six months. Registration Committee decisions are sent to applicants in writing via registered mail and email within two to three weeks of a Panel of the Registration Committee meeting date. However, the written reasons for the decision will be sent to the applicant within ten to twelve weeks of a Panel of the Registration Committee meeting date. The range of time will vary depending upon whether or not the panel requires for information from the applicant. CTCMPAO is responsible for making decisions regarding applicants ' successful completion of the Jurisprudence Course, Safety Program and Registration Examinations. CTCMPAO also confirms and informs applicants of their results of the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examination reviewed/re -scored by the CARB -TCMPA appointed examinations consulting firm. CTCMPAO advises applicants in writing by email and mail of their results of Jurisprudence Course and Safety Course tests within two weeks of the date it receives the results from it's third party. Registration Examination results are advised in writing by email and mail within one week of the date it receives the report from the exam administrator. i. State the number of internal reviews or appeals of registration decisions that exceeded your timelines. There were six files for which the internal reviews of registration decisions exceeded timelines. As mentioned earlier, the amount of time the registration process takes depends to a great extent on the time the applicant needs to gather and submit his or her documents. The deadlines were surpassed because of the Internal Review or Appeal Processes (6 / 13) Page 27 of 55relative newness of the registration regulation and therefore, the application of the specific provisions of the registration regulation required legal opinion as to their proper interpretation and application to an applicant's file, and also requested for more information from the applicants in order for the Registration Panel to reach a decision in a fair and objective way. When an application is referred to a Panel of the Registration Committee for review (s 15(1)b of the Code), the registration decision may take several months to be processed, as the Panel of the Registration Committee usually meets once in every six weeks. From January until December 2014, the Registration Committee Panel met ten times to deliberate on seventy -seven applications. ii. Among internal reviews or appeals that exceeded your timelines, state the number that were from internationally trained applicants. There were no internal reviews or appeals from internationally -trained applicants that exceeded timelines. b) Specify the opportunities you provide for applicants to make submissions regarding internal reviews or appeals. Given that the definition of an \"internal review \" is a file that is referred to a Panel of the Registration Committee, the submissions regarding the \"internal reviews \" are the documents in the initial application. Once an application is referred to a Panel of the Registration Committee, applicants are advised by a written letter of their right to submit any additional documentation within 30 days (s 18(1) of the Code); sometimes the 30 -day waiting period may be waived if an applicant provides written confirmation that they wish to be referred to the Panel of the Registration Committee sooner. Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations The Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations applicants can request to have their examination results reviewed/re -scored by the CARB -TCMPA appointed examinations consulting firm, by submitting a signed and dated written request to CTCMPAO, to the attention of the Registrar, within 40 days of the date of the examination. Examination answer sheets are carefully scored according to psychometric best practices. All results and decisions made by CTCMPAO on re -scoring of an examination are final. c) Explain how you inform applicants about the form in which they must make their submissions (i.e., orally, in writing or by electronic means) for internal reviews or appeals. CTCMPAO staff inform applicants via email and mail regarding their opportunity to make submissions, which is generally in writing. d) State how you ensure that no one who acted as a decision -maker in a registration decision acts as a decision-maker in an internal review or appeal of the same registration decision. CTCMPAO has not received any such requests for internal review or appeal of the same registration decision. Registration decisions are made either by the Registrar according to the requirements established in regulation, by -law and/or policy, or if Registrar is in doubt, decision is made by a Panel of the Registration Committee (s 15(1)b of the Code). Panel members declare any conflicts of interest they may have before proceeding with a review. CTCMPAO staff may provide the Panel of the Registration Committee with Page 28 of 55information regarding the application upon request; however, the decision is made by the Panel members exclusively. CTCMPAO staff do not provide opinion or judgement on the material provided to the Panel. e) Describe your internal review or appeal process. CTCMPAO staff reviews all applications for the appropriate information and requirements. If there is a question whether an application meets the requirements for registration, CTCMPAO staff refers the application to the Registrar for review. If the Registrar proposes to refuse an application, to place terms, conditions or limitation on an applicant's certificate of registration, or has any doubts as to whether the applicant meets the registration requirements, the application is referred to a panel of the Registration Committee [paragraph 15.(1)(b) of the Code]. A panel is comprised of a minimum of three members of the Registration Committee (i.e., two members of the profession and a public member of Council) [s 17.(2) of the Code]. Panels are convened at least once in every six weeks to review such applications. The panel reviews the individual 's application and all relevant information before making a decision in respect of that application.The chair of the Registration Committee may choose to schedule a panel meeting at any time to address applications requiring review. A Panel of the Registration Committee reviews these applications for the appropriate information and requirements. The Panel of the Registration Committee may allow the application, deny the application, allow the application subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations or request further information (s 20(1) of the Code). The Panel of the Registration Committee evaluates each application in accordance with CTCMPAO regulation and policies with regard to registration.The panel reviews the individual facts and circumstances of the applicants file and the reasons for referral, on a case by case basis. The panel may request additional information of the applicant and/or legal advice where such information or advice may be appropriate or required by the case under review in order to reach a decision in a fair and objective way,having access to all pertinent information, and having legal opinion on the proper interpretation of the registration regulation. The panel also considers precedent established through its past determinations made in prior decisions involving similar circumstances. Prior to the Panel meeting, the Director, Registration and Examinations, reviews each file to determine if there is any additional information the applicant may be advised to submit to aid in the Panel 's consideration of the application. Once a decision of a Panel of the Registration Committee is made, an applicant may appeal this decision to the Health Professions Appeal and Review Board(s 20(2) of the Code). f ) State the composition of the committee that makes decisions about registration, which may be called a Registration Committee or Appeals Committee: how many members does the committee have; how many committee members are members of the profession in Ontario; and how many committee members are internationally trained members of the profession in Ontario. Under the College by -laws, the Registration Committee shall be composed of a minimum of two members of Council who are members of the College, a minimum of one member of Council appointed to the Council by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, one or more members of the College who are not a member of the Council, if Council so wishes. During the first month of the reporting period, the Committee had three members of the Council who were members of the College and two members of the Council appointed by Lieutenant Governor in Council. During the last eleven months of the reporting period, the Registration Committee was composed of four members of Page 29 of 55BACK TO INDEX BACK TO INDEXthe Council who were members of the College and three members of Council appointed to the Council by Lieutenant Governor in Council. All professional members in the committee have received international training. Please identify and explain the changes in your registration practices relevant to this section that occurred during the reporting year. This section refers to reviews or appeals that are available after an internal review or appeal. Describe how you inform applicants of any rights they have to request a further review of or appeal from a decision. The College informs applicants of any rights they have to request a further review or appeal from a decision by written letter. Following each panel meeting, applicants are informed of the panel decision by email and mail within two to three weeks of a Panel meeting date. Included in the email and mail is notification of the applicant's right to appeal the panel's decision to the Health Professions Appeal and Review Board (HPARB). An applicant whose application has been denied or who is not satisfied with the Panel's decision is issued a formal Panel Order [s 20.(1) of the Code]. These Panel Orders are also accompanied by a letter advising the applicant of their right to appeal the panel's decision to HPARB within 30 days of the date of the cover letter [s 20.(2) of the Code]. A link to the HPARB website is also available on the Candidates Guide at CTCMPAO's website. The Candidates Guide, which explains the panel process, also provides the information about the right to an appeal by the HPARB, contact information and the applicable timelines to make an appeal. Please identify and explain the changes in your registration practices relevant to this section that occurred during the reporting year. Information on Appeal Rights (7 / 13) This category covers your processes for assessing all qualifications, such as academic credentials, competencies, language ability or practical experience.Assessment of Qualifications (8 / 13) Page 30 of 55a) List the criteria that must be met in order for an applicant 's qualifications to satisfy the entry -to- practice requirements for your profession. The criteria are as follows: Grandparented Class of Registration Substantial work experience in connection to the practice of the TCM profession in Canada to ensure that the level of experience of applicants and the currency of his/her knowledge, skill and judgment meets the entry -level occupational competencies required to practice the profession in Canada. Ability to speak, read, and write either English or French with reasonable fluency to ensure effective communication within the healthcare system. CTCMPAO does not require applicants to take any formal language tests such as TOEFL. CTCMPAO will consider that an applicant has attained the language fluency if he/she can complete the registration Application Form, the Jurisprudence Course and Safety Program, and be able to understand communications coming from the CTCMPAO. Applicants for Grandparented Class lacking in fluency either in English or French may provide a written language plan on how to communicate with patients and other healthcare professionals to ensure continuity of care (e.g. in case of an emergency, to share information with other healthcare providers for the patient). Successful completion of the Safety Program to ensure public safety. Successful completion of the Jurisprudence Course to ensure applicants have the knowledge in the context of practice within Ontario 's healthcare system including the legislative framework, regulatory requirements, etc. An applicant 's previous conduct must afford reasonable grounds for belief that he/she will practise the profession in a safe and professional manner. The purpose of the good conduct requirement is to protect the public and maintain high ethical standards and public confidence in the profession. Applicants must disclose any details if they have been found guilty of an offence and/or an offence related to the practice of TCM. If the applicant is currently or has ever been registered or licensed in Ontario in a profession other than TCM, or in another jurisdiction in TCM, the applicant must advise if he/she is the subject of any current professional misconduct, incompetence, incapacity proceeding or a similar proceeding or has been the subject of a finding of professional misconduct, incompetence, incapacity or a similar finding. Applicants are required to submit a criminal background check report using the database of the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) operated by the RCMP with their application form. Applicants must provide evidence satisfactory to the Registrar that the applicants will have professional liability insurance in the amount and in the form as required by the College by -laws for the issuance of his or her certificate of registration. The applicant must have paid any fees required under the College by -laws for the issuance of the certificate of registration for which the applicant applied. General Class of Registration Successful completion of a full -time post-secondary program in traditional Chinese medicine or traditional Chinese medicine Acupuncture to ensure applicants have acquired a breadth and depth of knowledge, skill and judgement from a formal, comprehensive and focused education program. Our Registration Regulation defines full -time education as a program of study that annually consists of at least 480 hours of classroom theoretical instruction or at least 620 hours of practical instruction or some combination of the two where, for every hours of classroom theoretical instruction that is less than 480 hours there must be a corresponding increase of 1.3 hours in the number of hours of practical instruction. Successful completion of clinical experience in the profession at least 45 weeks of clinical experience involving 500 hours of direct patient contact to ensure applicants are able to consolidate academies learning and able to develop skill and judgement under supervision and evaluation. The clinical supervised experience can be obtained either as a part of an applicant 's formal education program or separately, so long as it meets the requirements. However, if the supervised clinical experience is Page 31 of 55obtained as a part of an applicant 's formal education, the hours of instruction must be in addition to those hours counted towards meeting the educational requirement. In other words, one cannot use the same hours of instruction to satisfy the formal education requirement and the supervised clinical experience requirement. The clinical supervised experience involves 500 hours of direct patient contact with the individual communicating a traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis and performing acupuncture pursuant to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Act 2006 , plus repeated and reliable performance consistent with the required Entry -Level Occupational Competencies in a clinical environment with a variety of patients. Direct patient contact experience refers to shared supervised clinical activities or solo supervised clinical activities involving direct patient contact. In supervised clinical training, students ' work directly with patients in a setting designed to provide patient care. Students must be supervised throughout their clinical education, in a manner that facilitates their development of clinical abilities while ensuring that patient care is safe, effective and ethical. The observation hours and simulated practice hours may not be included towards meeting direct patient contact requirements. Clinical observation hours refer to activities where applicants have no active involvement. Simulated practice refers to activities using standardized or simulated patients and case conferences with clinical supervisors refer to discussions between applicant and applicant 's clinical supervisor related to a specific patient. Successful completion of the Safety Program to ensure public safety. Successful completion of the Jurisprudence Course to ensure applicants have the knowledge in the context of practice with in Ontario 's healthcare system including the legislative framework, regulatory requirements, etc. Successful completion of the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations to assess applicants ' entry-to-practice competencies. Ability to speak, read, and write either English or French with reasonable fluency to ensure effective communication within the healthcare system. CTCMPAO does not require applicants to take any formal language tests such as TOEFL. CTCMPAO will consider that an applicant has attained the language fluency if he/she can complete the Registration Application Form, the Jurisprudence Course and Safety Program, Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations and be able to understand communications coming from CTCMPAO. An applicant 's previous conduct must afford reasonable grounds for belief that he/she will practise the profession in a safe and professional manner. The purpose of the good conduct requirement is to protect the public and maintain high ethical standards and public confidence in the profession. Applicants must disclose any details if they have been found guilty of an offence and/or an offence related to the practice of TCM. If the applicant is currently or has ever been registered or licensed in Ontario in a profession other than TCM, or in another jurisdiction in TCM, the applicant must advise if he/she is the subject of any current professional misconduct, incompetence, incapacity proceeding or a similar proceeding or has been the subject of a finding of professional misconduct, incompetence, incapacity or a similar finding. Applicants are required to submit a criminal background check report using the database of the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) operated by the RCMP with their application form. Applicants must provide evidence satisfactory to the Registrar that the applicant will have professional liability insurance in the amount and in the form as required by the College by -laws for the issuance of his or her certificate of registration. The applicant must have paid any fees required under the College by -laws for the issuance of the certificate of registration for which the applicant applied. The above information is available in the Candidates' Guide to Application form and can be found on CTCMPAO's website. b) Describe the methodology used to determine whether a program completed outside of Canada Page 32 of 55satisfies the requirements for registration. There is no difference in the methodology used to determine whether a program completed outside or inside of Canada satisfies the requirements for registration. To assist applicants to understand whether the completed program meets the required competency as approved by the Council, CTCMPAO has developed the Guideline for Evaluation of Applicant 's Traditional Chinese Medicine and /or Acupuncture Education or a Substantially Equivalent Education Program and Assessment of Competency. This guideline is available on CTCMPAO\"s website and can be obtained through communication with staff. c) Explain how work experience in the profession is assessed. Grandparented Class of Registration The intent of the Grandparented Class is to permit those practitioners who were practising traditional Chinese medicine in Ontario during the time of proclamation. The Certificate of Grandparented Class of Registration requires applicants to have practised the profession in Canada for at least 2,000 visits in the five years prior to the date the Registration Regulation came into force, which was April 1, 2013. This allows applicants to demonstrate their level of experience and the currency of their knowledge, skills and judgement. The Application Form asks applicants to identify which of 52 common TCM disorders they have diagnosed and treated. This is not an exhaustive list of all disorders. The intent is to identify if applicants have a base level of competency consistent with the Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada and experience in traditional Chinese medicine and/or acupuncture. To assist applicants in understanding the interpretation of TCM patient visits, CTCMPAO drafted a definition of \"traditional Chinese medicine patient visits \", which can be found in the policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine Patient Visits, available on the website. On the Application Form applicants indicate whether those visits were for traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture only or whether they were for the full range of traditional Chinese medicine. This information will help determine which title and designation (R.TCMP or R.Ac) the applicant will receive. General Class of Registration Currency Requirement If the applicant completed the post -secondary program in TCM or TCM acupuncture more than one year before applying for registration, the applicant must demonstrate that his or her knowledge, skill and judgment is current. This can be done in one of two ways: The applicant has, within the 12 -month period before applying for registration, successfully completed a refresher program OR The applicant has practised the profession within the three years before applying for registration, involving a minimum of 500 TCM patient visits, which may include traditional Chinese acupuncture patient visits To assist applicants in understanding the interpretation of TCM patient visits, CTCMPAO drafted a definition of \"traditional Chinese medicine patient visits \", which can be found in the policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine Patient Visits, available on CTCMPAO's website. Page 33 of 55Similar to the Grandparented Class of Registration Application Form, section 15 of the General Class of Registration 's Application Form asks applicants to identify the TCM disorders that the applicant had diagnosed and treated with TCM techniques. This is not an exhaustive list of all disorders. The intent is to identify if the applicant has a base level of competency consistent with the Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada and experience in traditional Chinese medicine. Generally, the patient visits cannot include visits in Ontario after March 31, 2013. Since that date, performing a controlled act (i.e., communicating a TCM diagnosis and/or acupuncture) is illegal unless the person is registered with CTCMPAO or was delegated the authority to perform the act by a member of CTCMPAO. Therefore, procedures performed in Ontario after April 1, 2013 would not qualify for currency (i.e., no diagnoses). Detailed explanation of these requirements can be found on the Candidate 's Guide available on CTCMPAO's website. d) Describe how your organization ensures that information used in the assessment about educational systems and credentials of applicants from outside Canada is current and accurate. This question does not apply to our context. There is no difference in the assessment process for education completed at a national or an international institution as our Registration Regulation does not have any requirements for Canadian credentials. To assist applicants understand the education and competency assessment process, CTCMPAO has developed the Guideline for Evaluation of Applicant 's Traditional Chinese Medicine and /or Acupuncture Education or a Substantially Equivalent Education Program and Assessment of Competency available on CTCMPAO's website. e) Describe how previous assessment decisions are used to assist in maintaining consistency when assessing credentials of applicants from the same jurisdictions or institutions. Currently,Ontario does not have any government accredited or certified TCM education program. The current private school programs vary in content and intensity. Thus, CTCMPAO has developed the \"Entry-Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of traditional Chinese medicine in Canada \" as the minimum entry standards. As a part of the application process, each General Class of Registration applicants ' completed education program will be assessed by CTCMPAO to identify the extent of the relevance to the Council 's approved and published competencies for traditional Chinese medicine practice in Canada. Unlike approval of an education program, the assessment focuses on the cumulative competencies applicants have obtained through their formal education and post -graduate studies. The College maintains a database of past decisions and assessments which are regularly reviewed and referenced by staff members in the Registration department who are involved in the assessment process. While these past decisions are used as a reference point, each application is treated individually and assessed independently to ensure all of the College 's registration requirements are fulfilled. f ) Explain how the status of an institution in its home country affects recognition of the credentials of applicants by your organization. The status of an institution does not affect recognition of the credentials of applicants, as the assessment focuses on the cumulative competencies applicants have obtained through their formal education completed at Page 34 of 55any institution. g) Describe how your organization accommodates applicants with special needs, such as visual impairment. Please refer to answer 1.p). h) State the average length of time required to complete the entire registration process, from when the process is initiated to when a registration decision is issued. Please refer to answer 3 above. The length of time required to complete the registration process is largely dependent on the applicant. It may take applicants three months or more to complete all required examinations and become eligible for registration. The application process can take three to eight weeks once an applicant has become eligible for registration and has submitted all supporting documentation. i. State whether the average time differs for internationally trained individuals. The time is the same for domestic and internationally trained applicants. ii. If the average time differs for internationally trained individuals, state whether it is greater or less than the average for all applicants, and the reasons for the difference. There is no difference in average time for nationally and internationally trained individuals. i) If your organization conducts credential assessments : i. Explain how you determine the level (e.g., baccalaureate, master 's, Ph.D.) of the credential presented for assessment . To be eligible for the General Class of Registration , an applicant must complete a post -secondary program in traditional Chinese medicine consisting of at least four years of full -time education or education that is of equivalent duration, and in the case of a traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture program, consists of at least three years of full -time education, or education that is of equivalent duration. Currently, Ontario does not have any government accredited or certified TCM education program. The current private school programs vary in content and intensity. Thus, we have developed the \"Entry-Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada \" as the minimum entry standards. As a part of the Registration Examination application process, each General Class of Registration applicants ' completed education program will be assessed by CTCMPAO to identify the extent of the relevance to the Council's approved and published competencies for traditional Chinese medicine practice in Canada. Unlike approval of an education program, the assessment focuses on the cumulative competencies applicants have obtained through their formal education and post -graduate studies. Page 35 of 55The Registration Regulation further defines the full -time education program as a program that annually consists of: At least 480 hours per year of classroom theoretical instruction; or At least 620 hours per year of practical instruction; or Some combination of the two where, for every hour of classroom theoretical instruction that is less than 480 hours, there must be a corresponding increase of 1.3 hours in the number of hours of practical instruction. For example: Year 1 Completed Theory (Hours): 300 Completed Practical (Hours): 200 Required Practical hours to make up the gap of theory hours: (480-300) x 1.3 = 234 Year 1 would not qualify as a full -time education program. This is due to the fact that when 180 (the amount by which the theory component is deficient) is multiplied by 1.3 it amounts to 234. Therefore, in order to qualify as a full-time education program, the practical hours must amount to at least 234 hours. Unfortunately, the practical hours were only 200 hours so the year does not qualify as full -time education. Classroom theoretical instruction refers to education/learning which takes place in a classroom or through guided independent study, in which students develop knowledge and thinking skills, and beliefs and values, which enable them to demonstrate relevant Performance Indicators developed based on the Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practice in Canada . Practical instruction refers to education, in which students work directly with an experienced practitioner and a simulated patient, to develop hands -on abilities which enable them to demonstrate relevant Performance Indicators developed based on the Entry -Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine practice in Canada . There are two components to the assessment of whether an educational program meets the requirements of the regulation: 1.Does the program have the minimum hours of theoretical / practical instruction? 2.Does the program teach traditional Chinese medicine (either full traditional Chinese medicine or traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture)? Evaluation of applicants learning /education program against Entry -Level Competencies: A full traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and/or TCM acupuncture education program or substantially equivalent education is evaluated against the Entry Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada established by CTCMPAO to ensure applicants are competent to practise the profession in a safe and professional manner. Applicants must demonstrate through verifiable evidence how their completed formal education and learning meets the required entry - level competencies. Process of Evaluation: CTCMPAO will consider the following evidence to evaluate applicants ' education programs against the entry level competencies and standards of practice related to registration with CTCMPAO. Official transcripts Detailed course outline Program content Length of program completed Total number of hours completed Page 36 of 55Description for the completed theoretical/practical instruction that aligns with the required competencies and full-time education hours, prepared by the applicant CTCMPAO may request additional information and clarification of the information provided by the applicant. To assist applicants to understand the competency assessment process, CTCMPAO has developed the Guideline for Evaluation of Applicant 's Traditional Chinese Medicine and /or Acupuncture Education or a Substantially Equivalent Education Program and Assessment of Competency. This guideline is available on CTCMPAO's website and can be obtained by communicating with CTCMPAO staff. ii. Describe the criteria that are applied to determine equivalency. Please see the above answer. iii. Explain how work experience is taken into account. Work experience is taken in to account for the Grandparented Class of Registration. Please see answer 1c. j) If your organization conducts competency assessment : i. Describe the methodology used to evaluate competency. CTCMPAO does not conduct competency assessments. ii. Explain how the methodology used to evaluate competency is validated, and how often it is validated. CTCMPAO does not conduct competency assessments. iii. Explain how work experience is used in the assessment of competency. CTCMPAO does not conduct competency assessments. k) If your organization conducts prior learning assessment : i. Describe the methodology used to evaluate prior learning. CTCMPAO does not conduct Prior Learning Assessments for Applicants. ii. Explain how the methodology used to evaluate prior learning is validated, and how often it is validated. Page 37 of 55CTCMPAO does not conduct Prior Learning Assessments for Applicants. iii. Explain how work experience is used in the assessment of prior learning. CTCMPAO does not conduct Prior Learning Assessments for Applicants. l) If your organization administers examinations: i. Describe the exam format, scoring method and number of rewrites permitted. Jurisprudence Course Test (Accommodation) Format To accommodate language needs of Grandparented applicants who declared lack of reasonable fluency either in English or French, CTCMPAO hold tests in it's office and allow applicants to bring their own interpreters to the test. This information is available on CTCMPAO's website. The Jurisprudence Course is an open -book multiple -choice test with 30 questions. Candidates are allowed up to 180 minutes (3 hours) to complete the test with an assistance of an interpreter. Candidates are allowed to refer to dictionaries and their Jurisprudence Course Handbook published by CTCMPAO when answering questions. There are no questions that require candidates to create a written response or provide an oral response. Scoring Practitioners demonstrate successful completion of the Jurisprudence Course by sitting and passing (demonstrated by obtaining a mark of 60% or better) the Jurisprudence Course open -book tests. All questions are weighted equally. Candidates are expected to select the best or most suitable answer from the choices available, based solely on the content that is provided in the Jurisprudence Course Handbook. All questions are scored as either correct (1 mark) or incorrect (0 marks). Candidates will not be advised of their score on the test. All tests that have scores below 60% will be re - scored to verify results. After scores have been verified, the candidate may not appeal the decision. Practitioners can write the test as many times as they wish until they pass it. To date, approximately 53 applicants completed Jurisprudence Course through language accommodation. Number of Rewrites Applicants can retake the test until they pass it. Safety Program Test (Accommodation) Format To accommodate language needs of Grandparented Applicants, in May 2013, Council approved a \"Safety Test Accommodation Plan \" and posted this information on CTCMPAO 's website along with an Application Form. Under the accommodation plan, Grandparented applicants who failed the Safety Program Test and if they declared that they could not speak, read, or write English or French with reasonable fluency, CTCMPAO will permit them to write the test again at home with the assistance of a translator retained by the applicant. CTCMPAO deems all applicants who take the Safety Program Test at home with the assistance of a translator to have successfully completed review of the Safety Program Handbook content if they are able to satisfactorily respond to a series of questions that CTCMPAO provides. The questions require applicants to, among other Page 38 of 55requirements; explain how they will apply safety standards in their own practice. The applicant will have to submit in writing, within a defined period, answers to five to six questions to demonstrate his/her understanding of the content of the Safety Program Handbook. Scoring Although no \"pass or fail\" is given, practitioners who cannot demonstrate that they understand the safety requirements are asked to resubmit their responses. To date, approximately 129 applicants completed Safety Program through language accommodation. Number of Rewrites Applicants can retake the test until they pass it. ii. Describe how the exam is tested for validity and reliability. If results are below desired levels, describe how you correct the deficiencies. Jurisprudence Course (Accommodation) A bank of multiple -choice Jurisprudence Course test questions was developed by our legal counsel, Richard Steinecke of the law firm Steinecke, Maciura LeBlanc. The examination questions were reviewed and validated by the two non -TCM practitioners on the transitional Council and the Registrar and staff to ensure applicants are able to answer the questions by using the Handbook. CTCMPAO has not been faced with a situation where test results were below desired levels. The passing rate for the Jurisprudence Course (Accommodation) tests held in 2014 is approximately 95%. As well, applicants can retake the test until they pass it. Safety Program (Accommodation) CTCMPAO engaged the services of a consultant, Curriculum Services Canada (CSC), to develop the Safety Program Handbook, under the direction of the Steering Committee, comprising Board members of CTCMA -BC and transitional Council members of the Registrars of CTCMA -BC and TC -CTCMPAO. The Safety Program Accommodation questions were developed based on the Safety Program Handbook. The examination questions were reviewed and validated by the TCM practitioners on the transitional Council and the Registrar to ensure applicants are able to answer the questions by using the Handbook. Based on the Safety Program handbook, the applicant will be provided a set of questions. The applicant will have to submit in writing, within a defined period, answers to five to six questions to demonstrate his/her understanding of the content of the Safety Program Handbook and explain how he/she apply safety measures in his/her day to day practice. iii. State how often exam questions are updated and the process for doing so. Jurisprudence Course and Safety Program Examination questions for both the Jurisprudence Course (Accommodation) and Safety Program (Accommodation) were developed in 2012 and 2013. CTCMPAO is currently considering establishing a process to update the examination questions. The current bank of questions is sufficient to conduct the tests for next few years. It is important to note that, with the closing of entry to Grandparented Class as prescribed by the Registration Page 39 of 55BACK TO INDEXRegulation, CTCMPAO expects to offer sufficient number of language accommodation tests only for an additional year or two to ensure Grandparented applicants who declared lack of language fluency in English or French have opportunity to complete the assessment in a timely manner. Please identify and explain the changes in your registration practices relevant to this section that occurred during the reporting year. a) List any third -party organizations (such as language testers, credential assessors or examiners) relied upon by your organization to make assessment decisions. The Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bodies of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists (CARB -TCMPA) to conduct the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations Professional Testing to administer and score the Safety Program Test and Jurisprudence Course Test b) Explain what measures your organization takes to ensure that any third -party organization that it relies upon to make an assessment : i. provides information about assessment practices to applicants CTCMPAO recruits its third parties through a comprehensive and rigorous selection process to ensure third parties are able to provide quality services and ensure public safety. CTCMPAO maintains a contractual agreement with all of its third parties to ensure third parties are assessing applicants in a transparent, objective, impartial and fair way. Third parties are also required to provide reports to CTCMPAO to ensure a timely exchange of information and to maintain an open and cooperative working relationship in order to ensure a successful delivery of all Assessments. Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations CTCMPAO 's Council approved examinations for registration - the Pan-Canadian Examinations developed by the Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bodies of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists (CARB-TCMPA) - with input from TCM experts. The CARB -TCMPA is the national organization of the provincial and territorial regulatory bodies that govern and monitor the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Practitioners,TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists. CARB-TCMPA developed a Blueprint document describing the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations with the purpose and intent of facilitating the development of reliable and valid examinations to assess fairly and in a transparent manner, the candidates applying for registration to practise the TCM profession. The Blueprint document has two major components: 1) the content domain (practice areas) to be measured and 2) explicit guidelines on how this content is to be measured. The content domain consists of the measureable competencies expected of entry -level TCM practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists. The Blueprint also includes a list of suggested references for these Registration Examinations - Third-Party Organizations (9 / 13) Page 40 of 55Pan-Canadian Examinations. CTCMPAO has representatives on CARB -TCMPA's Steering Committee, Examination Committee and Blueprint Committee. CTCMPAO attends meetings of CARB -TCMPA, provides input into any policy, process or decisions, and reports back to Council on a regular basis. Applicants can find the Blueprint document and other information regarding the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations on CTCMPAO 's website. Jurisprudence Course and Safety Program Test - Professional Testing Starting 2014, Professional Testing administered and scored both the Safety Program Test and Jurisprudence Course Test on behalf of CTCMPAO. Information about assessment practices and Application Form, including candidate instruction guide are linked to CTCMPAO 's website. CTCMPAO works closely with Professional Testing to ensure successful delivery of the tests as well as offering tests frequently to accommodate applicants waiting to register with CTCMPAO.

Describe the exam format, scoring method and number of rewrites permitted. Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations Format Pan-Canadian Examinations - Written Component The Pan-Canadian Examinations -Written component consists of multiple -choice questions. The multiple -choice questions are presented either as case -based or independent questions. Case -based questions include a set of approximately three to five questions associated with a brief case scenario. The candidate is required to read the case scenario carefully and use the content to assist in answering all the associated questions. Independent questions contain the information necessary to answer the question. Every question consists of a stem (question) and four possible options. There is only one correct or best answer for each question. Pan-Canadian Examinations - Clinical Case -Study Component The Pan-Canadian Clinical Case -Study component consists of six to eight clinical case -study situations requiring open -ended candidate responses. For each case, the following presenting conditions may be provided: Chief complaint(s) Symptoms and signs General patient information, such as age, gender, occupation and marital status Personal history and medications, including supplements Family history Other necessary information, such as lifestyle, diet, exercise and environmental factors. Candidate responses to the clinical case -study situations are assessed based on the following six criteria: (a) diagnosis (TCM illness and syndrome differentiation); (b) etiology and pathogenesis; (c) treatment principles; (d) acupuncture treatment; (e) herbal therapy; and (f) biomedical diagnosis and treatment considerations. Scoring Written Component The computer answer sheets are electronically scanned and scored. Quality control reports and checks are completed during and after marking to ensure accuracy. Each multiple -choice question is worth one point. A correct answer receives a score of one point and an incorrect answer receives a score of zero. There is no penalty for incorrect or blank responses. The passing score for the examination is set by the Examination Committee of the CARB -TCMPA using the modified Angoff method. The modified Angoff method requires each member of the Committee to independently rate each question on the examination in terms of the minimally competent candidate. The minimally competent candidate can be conceptualized as the candidate possessing the minimum level of knowledge and skills necessary to perform at a registration/licensure level. To do the rating, the committee members ask themselves \"what percentage of minimally competent candidates will answer this question correctly? \" The ratings from all members are then collated and tabulated to achieve the Page 43 of 55average rating per item. These ratings are then averaged to obtain the passing score for the total examination. Clinical Case -Study Component Each case -study examination situation, depending on the components of the question, is scored on a scale ranging from 0 (no understanding of the problem) to 4 points (complete response). The final mark for a candidate is simply the sum of all score points for the clinical case -study questions. The passing score for the examination is set by the Examination Committee of the CARB -TCMPA using the extended Angoff method. Instead of asking participants to estimate the probability of a correct response on a multiple -choice question, the participants are asked to indicate the score a minimally competent candidate would obtain out of the maximum points allowed for the question. Thus, the passing score for the exam is the average rating of all the participants ' standard-setting responses. Number of Rewrites There are two components to the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations: Written component Clinical Case -study component Successfully completing the examination means passing both components. Candidates are required to pass the written component before advancing to take the clinical case -study component. Under the Registration Regulation, applicants must successfully complete the Registration Examinations within three attempts. Applicants who fail the examination three times are not eligible to repeat the examination fourth time unless the candidate completes the further education or training or combination of education and training required by a panel of the Registration Committee. Safety Program Test Format The Safety Program Test is an open book multiple -choice test with 40 questions. All candidates are allowed up to 120 minutes (2 hours) to complete the test. Candidates are expected to bring their personal printed paper copy of the Safety Program Handbook in English (published by the Transitional Council of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario) to the test as a source of reference. There are no questions that require candidates to create a written response or provide an oral response. Starting 2014, the tests administered by Professional Testing (third Party) are digital and taken at the Professional Testing office using a laptop. Candidates were accommodated with paper copy tests, if the need arose. Scoring A candidate is deemed to have successfully completed the test by correctly answering 70% of the questions. All questions are weighted equally. All tests that have scores below 70% will be re -scored to verify results. After scores have been verified, the candidate may not appeal the decision. Candidates are expected to select the best or most suitable answer from the choices available, based solely on the content that is provided in the Safety Program Handbook. Questions that are left blank are scored as incorrect. Questions that have two or more answers identified are scored as incorrect. All questions are scored as either correct (1 mark) or incorrect (0 marks). Number of Rewrites Applicants can retake the test until they pass it. Jurisprudence Course Test Format The Jurisprudence Course Test is an open book multiple -choice test with 30 questions. All candidates are allowed up to 90 minutes (1 1/2 hours) to complete the test. Candidates are expected to bring their personal printed paper copy of the Jurisprudence Course Handbook to the test as a source of reference. Electronic devices are not permitted during the test, so candidates may NOT reference the Jurisprudence Course Handbook electronically during the test. Candidates are allowed to bring and to use a dictionary (e.g., Page 44 of 55Mandarin and English dictionaries) during the test to assist with understanding of terms. Candidates will use a computer (touch screen application) provided by the testing centre to complete the test. Candidates were accommodated with paper copy tests, if the need arose. There are no questions that require candidates to create a written response or provide an oral response. Scoring A candidate is deemed to have successfully completed the test by correctly answering 60% of the questions. All questions are weighted equally. Candidates are expected to select the best or most suitable answer from the choices available, based solely on the content that is provided in the Jurisprudence Course Handbook. All questions are scored as either correct (1 mark) or incorrect (0 marks). Candidates who successfully complete the test (achieve 60% or more) are notified, by the CTCMPAO, that they have completed this requirement of their registration with CTCMPAO. Candidates will not be told their final score on the test. All tests that have scores below 60% will be re -scored to verify results. After scores have been verified, the candidate may not appeal decision. Number of Rewrites Applicants can retake the test until they pass it. ii. Describe how the exam is tested for validity and reliability. If results are below desired levels, describe how you correct the deficiencies. Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations The Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations are based and have been derived from the Entry-Level Occupational Competencies for the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada. The Blueprint document developed by CARB -TCMPA intends to facilitate the development of reliable and valid examinations to assess fairly, in a consistent and transparent manner, the candidates applying for registration to practise as TCM Practitioners, TCM Acupuncturists and/or TCM Herbalists in Canada. 15 -20 TCM experts from all five provinces selected by CARB -TCMPA Steering Committee had reviewed and validated the examination. If results are below desired levels, the CARB -TCMPA Examination Committee will review the questions and will take measures in consultation with CARB -TCMPA Steering Committee to correct deficiencies. Each year the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations questions will be reviewed, updated or revised and new questions will be developed by the CARB -TCMPA Examination Committee, consisting of TCM experts from all five provinces. If a question does not perform well in the testing, it will be removed. Safety Program CTCMPAO had engaged the services of a consultant, Curriculum Services Canada (CSC), to develop the Safety Program Handbook under the direction of the Steering Committee comprising Board members of CTCMA-BC and transitional Council members of the TC -CTCMPAO, the Registrars of CTCMA -BC and TC - CTCMPAO. CSC further recruited from BC and Ontario three experts in TCM to help draft the technical content of the program handbook. Some 30 registered members from BC and practitioners from Ontario then reviewed and verified the handbook content, section by section, and validated the bank of test questions. On behalf of CTCMPAO, CSC completed the validity and reliability assessment of the multiple -choice exam questions with some 15 volunteer practitioners. The pilot was conducted in a supervised and controlled setting in which a number of currently practicing Ontario practitioners responded to a pre -determined sample of questions that simulated the testing conditions that were to be employed for wide -scale administration. As a result, on behalf of CTCMPAO, CSC selected questions from the edited piloted bank of multiple -choice items that could best be used validly and reliably in the testing of safety concepts relevant to candidates in Ontario pursuing the title TCM Practitioner (R.TCMP) or the title Acupuncturist (R. Ac). CSC currently maintains those questions that met the established standard in a secure environment and uses them during the safety testing. The test is administered in a supervised setting at CSC 's test centre. Please note, CSC later Page 45 of 55BACK TO INDEXchanged it's business name to Professional Testing. CTCMPAO has not been faced with a situation where test results were below desired levels. However, if such situation occurs CTCMPAO will take measures to correct deficiencies. The passing rate for the Safety Program tests held during the reporting period was approximately 93% and applicants can retake the test until they pass it. Jurisprudence Course A bank of multiple -choice Jurisprudence Course test questions was developed by our Legal Counsel, Richard Steinecke of the law firm Steinecke, Maciura LeBlanc. The examination questions were reviewed and validated by the two non -TCM practitioners on the transitional Council and the Registrar and staff to ensure applicants are able to answer the questions by using the Handbook. CTCMPAO has not been faced with a situation where test results were below desired levels. The passing rate for the Jurisprudence tests held in 2014 was approximately 92 % and applicants can retake the test until they pass it. iii. State how often exam questions are updated and the process for doing so. Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations Each year the Registration Examinations - Pan-Canadian Examinations questions will be reviewed, updated or revised and new questions will be developed by the CARB -TCMPA Examination Committee, consisting of TCM experts from all five provinces. If a question does not perform well in the testing, it will be removed. Safety Program and Jurisprudence Course Examination questions for Safety Program and Jurisprudence Course were developed and offered in 2012. Currently CTCMPAO is considering developing an established process to update the examination questions. The current bank of questions is sufficient to offer more tests for next few years. Please identify and explain the changes in your registration practices relevant to this section that occurred during the reporting year. a) Describe the training that your organization provides to: i. individuals who assess qualifications All staff involved in registration participate in orientation and training offered by CTCMPAO 's Legal Counsel. During the reporting period, the orientation included a review of:Training (10 / 13) Page 46 of 55the roles of staff, Committee chair and Committee members; overview of the Regulated Health Professions Act; Traditional Chinese Medicine Act; Ontario Labour Mobility Act; Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act; registration processes; appeal process; a transparent, objective, impartial and fair assessment process; tools, checklists and criteria used for assessment; policies and procedures for file assessment; a sample file; conflicts of interest; human rights code; confidentiality of information; Occupational Health and Safety Act; transparency requirements; reasons and decision writing training, facilitated by Richard Steinecke of Steinecke, Maciura LeBlanc; and objectives of the Fair Access to Regulated Professions Act , 2006 (FARPA). When staff are hired, they receive an orientation to the CTCMPAO, including relevant legislation, policies and procedures. All Registration staff meet on a weekly basis to update their knowledge and skills in areas related to registration. Newly hired staff also engage in a structured mentoring and job shadowing experience related to aspects of their role such as setting up an applicant file, inputting data into the College database system, screening applications, and providing service to applicants and members by phone and email. Legal Counsel is also available throughout the year to provide additional training or support to the committee/staff as needed. Each staff member has a resource manual for registration policies and procedures, relevant legislation aid in making consistent, fair and impartial decisions. During the reporting period, all staff attended a workshop on \"Differences in Cultural Backgrounds \" offered by the Ontario Regulators for Access Consortium (ORAC). Senior staff were invited to appear as key -note speakers to speak on Registration Practice at the 2014 Canadian Network of National Associations of Regulators ' (CNNAR) annual conference held in Montreal. College staff works closely with OFC to ensure registration practice complies with the FARPA Act and attended a conference hosted by OFC \"Transforming Access: A Forum on the Licensing of Internationally Educated Professionals and Tradespeople \". Senior staff regularly attends ORAC and Federation of Health Regulatory Colleges of Ontario (FHRCO) meetings to learn and share best practices from other regulatory bodies to continue to improve access by national and international candidates to the TCM profession. CTCMPAO staff are trained by senior staff to handle applications from applicants who have completed a full - time TCM or TCM Acupuncture education program. This training includes verification: of whether submitted documents are genuine; that transcripts indicate completion of the degree/program; of whether the program have the minimum hours of theoretical/practical instruction to meet the definition of full-time education as prescribed in the Registration Regulation; of whether the program teaches traditional Chinese medicine (either full traditional Chinese medicine or traditional Chinese medicine Acupuncture); that certificates indicate completion of the program/degree; that program contents meets the entry -to-practice competencies; of completion of the practical training that is part of an education program; of declarations and documents verifying good standing with other regulatory provinces; of completion of the application, including signature of the applicant; and of name against documents, or verification of a name change. Page 47 of 55If there is a question whether an application meets the requirements for registration, staff members consult the Registrar for advice. ii. individuals who make registration decisions Registration decisions are made by the Registrar and by the Registration Committee. All staff involved in registration participates in orientation and training, as do members and the Chair of the Registration Committee. When the Registrar is hired, he or she receives an orientation to CTCMPAO, including relevant legislation, policies and procedures. The Registrar has a resource manual for registration policies and procedures to aid in making consistent, fair and impartial decisions. Registration Committee Members receive an orientation before participating in any registration decisions. The orientation includes a review of: the roles of staff, Committee chair and Committee members; Regulation Information; Regulated Health Professions Act of Ontario (RHPA); College By -Laws; a resource binder for Committee members; registration processes; appeal process; a transparent, objective, impartial and fair assessment process; tools, checklists and criteria used for assessment; policies and procedures for file assessment; a sample file; conflicts of interest; confidentiality of information; Ontario Labour Mobility Act; Traditional Chinese Medicine Act Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act; code of conduct; human rights code; Occupational Health and Safety Act; media communications; transparency requirements; legislation, ethics and standards of practice; timing of the decisions; reasons and decision writing training, facilitated by Richard Steinecke of Steinecke, Maciura LeBlanc; and objectives of the Fair Access to Regulated Professional and Compulsory Trades Act, 2006, presented by the OFC Legal Counsel is available throughout the year to provide additional training or support to the committee as needed. iii. individuals who make internal review or appeal decisions Page 48 of 55BACK TO INDEX BACK TO INDEXSame as above.

Additional comments: Under the Registration Regulation, in 2013, CTCMPAO accepted applications in the General Class to use the Provisional title/designation. Provisional Registration was intended to allow General Class applicants to be registered and practice to ensure practitioners, who have the required TCM education and were practising traditional Chinese medicine in Ontario prior to proclamation, can continue to practice until the approval and implementation of a Registration Examination -Pan-Canadian Examinations. Thus, if a General Class member have not completed the registration (entry -to-practice) examination he or she must indicate \"(Provisional) \" after their designation ( \"R.TCMP\" or \"R.Ac\"). Once a member with a General Class Certificate of Registration passes the examination, the \"Provisional \" title/designation will be removed.
