Biosafety Levels BIOSAFETY LEVELS (BSL) There are four levels of biosafety used to desi gnate and regulate lab work with microorganisms. Each level is designed to prevent lab-acquired infec tions and to protect the environment from potentially hazardous agents. The higher the level of the biosafety lab, the more st ringent the level of protection required to work in these areas. BSL-1: Microorganisms not known to cause disease in healthy adult human beings. Potential hazards to laboratory personnel and the environment are minimal. Work is conducted on open be nch tops using standard microbiological practices (lab coats, safety glasses and gloves). Lab personnel have specific training in the procedures conducted in the lab and are supervised by a scientist with general training in microbiology or a related science. BSL-1 labs are located in high school and college-level biology and chemistry classrooms and research institutions. BSL-2: Microorganisms of moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment. Lab personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic agents and are supervised by scientists competent in handling infectious agents and associated procedures. Access to the lab is limited wh en work is being conducted. All procedures in which infectious aerosols or splashes may be created are conducted in biological safety cabinets or other physical containment equipment. BSL-2 labs are located in research institutions, essen tially all hospitals, and medical and veterinary schools. An example of a microorganism that would be studied in a NBAF BSL-2 lab is the inactivated virus that causes foot and mouth disease. BSL-3: Microorganisms present in the United St ates, and foreign and em erging agents that may cause serious consequences in livestock but are not harmful to human beings because of available protective measures. Lab personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic microbes potentially lethal to animals and are supervised by trained scientists who are experi enced in working with these agents and associated procedures. Access to the lab is controlled (i.e., card reader for entry; self-sealing, double door access, etc.) All procedures involving the manipulation of infectio us materials are conducted within biological safety cabinets or other physical containment devices, or by personnel wearing appropr iate personal protective clothing and equipment. BSL-3 labs have special engineering and design features to enhance safety. BSL-3 labs are located in research institutions, hospitals, and medical and veterinary schools. An example of a microorganism that would be studied in a NBAF BSL-3 lab is the live virus that causes foot and mouth disease in cloven-hoofed animals. BSL-4: Microorganisms that pose a high risk of life-threatening disease and for which there is no known vaccine or therapy. Lab personnel have specific and thorough training in handling extremely hazardous infectious agents and fully understand all containment functions, practices, equipment and lab design characteristics. Lab personnel are supervised by trained scientis ts who are experienced in working with the microorganisms and with associated procedures. Access to the lab is strictly controlled. The facility is in a controlled area within a building, which is completely isolated from all other areas. There are four BSL-4 facilities currently operating in the United States in populated urban areas: Atlanta, Georgia; Fort Detrick, Maryland; Galveston, Texas; and San Antonio, Texas. There has never been a public exposure at a BSL-4 lab in the United States. Examples of microorganisms that could possibly be studied in a NBAF BSL-4 lab include Nipah and Hendra viruses, both of which are emerging zoonotic diseases that can spread from their natural reservoir to human beings, and are often fatal. Glossary of Technical Terms Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs): The most effective and the most commonly used primary containment devices in laboratories working with infectious agents. There are three general types available (Class I, II, III). Properly maintained Class I and II BSCs, when used in conjunction with good microbiological techniques, provide an effective containment system for safe manipulation of moderate and high-risk microorganisms (biosafety level 2 and 3 microorganisms ). Class II BSCs also protect the research material itself through high-efficiency particulate air filtration (HEPA filtration) of the air flow down across the work surface. Class III cabinets offer the maximum protection to laboratory personnel because all hazardous materials are contained in a totally enclosed cabinet. Biosafety Levels (BSLs): There are four levels of biosafety used to designate and regulate lab work with microorganisms. The range is BSL-1 in which the microorganisms are not known to cause disease in healthy adult human beings to BSL-4 in which the microorganisms pose a risk of life-threatening disease and for which there is no known vaccine or therapy. BSL-3Ag refers to research involving large agricultural animals. There are guidelines in place to ensure safe work sites through a combination of engineering controls, management policies, work practices, and procedures. Increasing levels of personnel and environmental protection are provided for by the different biosafety levels used in microbiological/biomedical laboratories. The higher the level of the biosafety lab, the more stringent the level of protection. Countermeasures: A collective term used in biocontainment laboratories to include vaccines, biotherapeutics, diagnostic assays, therapies, and vector control. Diagnostic Assay: A test to determine presence or absence of infectious agents or antibodies to determine if an animal has or has been exposed to an agent. Environmental Impact Statement: A document required of federal agencies by the National Environmental Policy Act for major federal actions that may significantly affect the quality of the environment. A tool for decisionmaking, it describes, analyzes, and compares the potential environmental impacts of the alternatives to accomplish the purpose and need to which the agency is responding. Glovebox: A sealed container designed to allow a trained scientist to manipulate microorganisms while being in a different containment level than that of the agent they are manipulating. Built into the sides of the glovebox are two glove ports arranged in such a way that one can place their hands into the ports, into gloves and perform tasks inside the box without breaking the seal. There are three general types available (Class I, II, III) based on the material the box and gloves are made of. High-Consequence Foreign Animal Diseases (FADs): Diseases not present in the United States that are capable of rapidly spreading and causing high numbers of deaths and/or devastating economic consequences (e.g., foot and mouth disease). Homeland Security Presidential Directives 9 and 10: These directives established a national goal to protect agricultural infrastructure to ensure our livestock and food safety and security. Host: In biology, a host is an organism that harbors a virus or parasite, typically providing nourishment and shelter. National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF): Proposed facility that would address both current and future requirements in research, diagnostics, and training for combating high-consequence agricultural threats. Research would focus on early development and discovery of vaccines and diagnostic tests for these important agricultural diseases. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA): Requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for major federal actions that may significantly affect the quality of the environment. In NEPA, the term \"environment\" encompasses the natural and physical environment (i.e., air, water, geography, and geology), as well as the relationship of people with that environment (i.e., health and safety, socioeconomic conditions, cultural resources, noise, and aesthetics). Natural Reservoir: Refers to the long-term host of the pathogen of an infectious disease. It is often the case that hosts do not get severely ill. Pathogen or Infectious Agent: A biological agent that causes disease or illness to its host. The term is most often used for agents that disrupt the normal physiology of an animal or person. Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC): U.S. laboratory for the diagnosis, research, and training for foreign animal diseases. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory is located at PIADC. This laboratory has the capability of diagnosing over 30 foreign animal diseases and is responsible for educating veterinarians in the recognition and diagnosis of these diseases. The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) operates a program focused on basic discovery and research of foreign animal diseases. The DHS scientific program focuses primarily on the advanced development of vaccines and other countermeasures. Wildlife Reservoir: Wildlife, normally defined as wild, free-roaming animals (e.g., mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians), therefore, this refers to a wild animal as long-term host of the pathogen of an infectious disease. It is often the case that hosts do not get the disease carried by the pathogen or it does not show symptoms of the disease and is non-lethal. Zoonotic: A term for diseases transmitted by animals to humans. Flora Industrial Park Site Flora, Mississippi CONSORTIUM The Gulf States Bio and Agro-Defense Consortium is a coalition of public and private entities working collectively to attract the National Bio and Agro-Defen se Facility (NBAF) to Mississippi. The Consortium is comprised of the State of Mississippi, the University of Mississippi (UM), the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), Mississippi State University (MSU), Jackson State University (JSU), Tulane University, the Tulane National Primate Research Center, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), Tougaloo College, and Battelle Memori al Institute. Except for UTMB, a ll members of the Consortium are within a two-hour drive of the proposed site. The C onsortium has committed to providing regular shuttle services to and from the NBAF for all university participants. PROPOSED NBAF SITE LOCATION The proposed site is located in the Flora Industria l Park in Madison County, Mississippi. A mixed-use commercial park, the Flora site offers a gentle rolling terra in with nearby access to interstates, railways, and the Jackson-Evers International Airport. The Madison County Economic Development Agency maintains the park's more than 150 acres. The portion under consideration for the NBAF currently has no tenants or physical structures and is approximately 150 acres. The only te nant in the Flora Industrial Park is Primus, a manufacturing company. COMPLEMENTARY RESEAR CH AND WORKFORCE The Consortium partners bring a diverse set of capabi lities and significant biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) and BSL-4 experience to NBAF operations. MSU has a veterinary school, maintains significant research programs in animal sciences, and operates a BSL-3 facility on its main campus. MSU also operates the state diagnostic veterinary laboratory in Pearl, Mississippi, a 40,000 square foot facility that will have an active BSL-3 within two years. The university also has collaborations with th e U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Services (ARS), a facility that has the distinction of possessing the greatest number of agricultural doctorate degrees in the nation. The UM has a world renowned progr am in pharmaceutical sciences that would be crucial to NBAF's countermeasure development and licensing activities. The National Center for Natural Products located at UM currently screens more than 30,000 samples and houses more than 18,000 natural products with proven medicinal/agricultural properties. UMMC and Tulane University have programs in medical research and in clinical trial development and execution. Currently, UMMC has over 350,000 square feet of researc h space, with an additiona l 178,000 square feet of new construction to be completed with in two years. UMMC researchers have recently been recognized at the national level for research involving anthrax and potential treatments. Both institutions have infectious diseases doctoral and medical training and operate BSL-3 facilities certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Federal Drug Administration. TNPRC has a free-standing 3,000-square foot facility dedicated to BSL-3 animal research. UTMB has an established research program in infectious diseases directly relevant to bioterrorism and operates one of the few BSL-4 fac ilities in the nation. Battelle has a long history of successfully managing national laboratories, includi ng West Jefferson BSL-3 laboratory, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center. Battelle is responsible for the operation of over 50,000 square feet of res earch facilities with research and development totaling over $4 billion. JSU has a National Center for Environmen tal Health and the National Center for Biodefense Communications. The Consortium also provides a strong workforce for the NBAF in Mississippi. JSU and Tougaloo College are Historically Black Colleges and Universities that produ ce significant numbers of African-Americans in the sciences. Collectively, the Consortium graduates a pproximately 40 doctorate-, 100 masters- and 370 MISSISSIPPI SITE ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION baccalaureate-level students in relevant life sciences each y ear (average over the past five years). Their fields of study include biology, chemistry, biochemistry, an imal sciences and physiology, bioengineering, and pharmaceutical sciences. Annually, approximately 100 medi cal doctors, 50 doctors of veterinary medicine, and 75 professional pharmacists graduate from the Consortiu m academic partners. Currently, approximately 60 percent of bachelor-level and above-degree professi onals leave the area because life sciences opportunities cluster elsewhere in the nation. AVAILABLE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE The proposed site is adjacent to U.S. Route 49, a majo r four-lane divided highway. It is connected via major highways Interstate 55 (approximately 17 miles), which supports north/south interstate traffic, and to Interstate 20 (approximately 20 miles), which sup ports east/west interstate traffic. The State of Mississippi will commit to providing any needed utility improvements for the NBAF . The utilities for the site are supplied by Entergy Corporation, which has a three-phase power onsite. Natura l gas is available onsite (6-inch main). Water is supplied by the Town of Flora. Currently, the site is supplied by a 10-inch pipe adjacent to the site, with 100,000- and 200,000-gallon storage tanks located within 0. 75 miles. Sewer services (treatment plant) are also provided by the Town of Flora; there is currently an 8-inch main adjacent to the site. Manhattan Campus Site Manhattan, Kansas CONSORTIUM The Heartland Bio Agro Consortium (HBAC) is led by Kansas State University and the Midwest Research Institute, with the Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute providing the cohesive leadership that unites the diverse membership. HBAC partners include a number of research universities within the Kansas, Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska region, and several research uni versities outside the region chosen to complement strategic research foci. HBAC partners include privat e research institutes and research hospitals. The greater Kansas City area is a major hub of the veterinary pha rmaceutical industry, having companies in the vaccine development, production, and distribution arenas. HBAC partners include a number of these organizations. PROPOSED NBAF SITE LOCATION The proposed site for locating the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) is on the Manhattan, Kansas, campus of Kansas State University, immediately adjacent to the Biosecurity Research Institute (BRI). The BRI is a $54 million research/education facility having biosafety level (BSL-3E), and BSL-3 Agriculture (BSL-3Ag) state-of-the- art research space. The site borders on the research laboratories and teaching hospital of the Kansas State University College of Veterinary Medicine. Adjacent land is available for pasturing animals. The Kansas legislature has passed a bill authorizing the transfer of all or part of a tract of land located in township ten (10) south, range eight (8) east of the sixth (6th) Principal Meridian in Riley County, Kansas. The total acreage is just less than 45 acres when the land containing the BRI is subtracted. COMPLEMENTARY RESEAR CH AND WORKFORCE HBAC is a unique combination of research universiti es, research institutes and hospitals, subject-matter experts, and leading firms in the bioscience industry - all capable of providing a collaborative, enriched, and valuable environment for the NBAF. A spectrum of activ ities comprises the lifecycle of bioscience/biomedical innovation, including basic research, discovery, valid ation, Good Labor Practices (GLP) manufacturing, government regulatory issues, clinical trials, in-hospi tal diagnostic support, and de fined outcomes. HBAC and the Kansas City region have adopted a one-medicine/one-health approach which links the animal health and the human health communities in a joint search for answers to intriguing h ealth and bioscience questions. This approach is particularly relevant to biodefense and emerging infectious disease research for several important KANSAS SITE ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION reasons. First, many of the emerging diseases are zoono tic in nature, and these diseases pose real threats not only in the food animal and wildlife arenas, but on the human health side as well. Second, solutions to the problems in both animal health and human health re quire a fundamental understanding of the same basic principles of disease physiology and require the same tool s and technology to bring the solutions from concepts to reality. HBAC is in a region rich in animal infectious disease research, pharmaceutical production, and workforce availability. The Kansas City bioscience industry is an in ternationally-recognized lead er in the animal health arena. Its strength is in its numbers: the region is hom e to 165 life science companies, with 37 focused on protecting and securing animal health. Within the $14.5 billio n animal health industry, more than 40 percent of the U.S. sales and 26 percent of worldwide sales are t hose of companies having a presence in the Kansas City area. There is a major focus on research and de velopment, GLP/Good Manuf acturing Practices(GMP) manufacturing, and translation into the marketplace. Mo re than 5,000 animal health workers provide a uniquely skilled workforce. AVAILABLE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE Utilities available to the site include water, electricity, sewer, telecommunications, and natural gas. The site is within 1,000 feet of a fire station and within 1 mile of a hospital having emergency room service. Adjacent to the site is the Kansas State University Research Park, allowing co-location of industrial research facilities as the NBAF matures. The Biosecurity Research Institute and th e College of Veterinary Medicine ensure a critical neighboring mass of infectious disease research. Texas Research Park Site San Antonio, Texas CONSORTIUM The Texas Biological and Agro-Defense Consortium (TBAC) is a collection of stakeholders formed to bring the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) to San Antonio. Members of the TBAC include the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (SFBR), the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Ant onio (UTHSCSA), Brooks Development Authority (BDA), and the Texas Research & Technology Foundation (TRTF). SFBR is a leading independent biomedical research institution, home to the Southwest National Primate Research Center, which includes the capacity for non-human primate studies in biosafety level 4 (BSL-4), and a veterinary technical staff experienced in the ma nagement and use of nonhuman primates ranging from chimpanzees to marmosets. UTSA has created several research centers and institu tes which have formed collaborative programs with institutions and private research entities. A number of research programs are focused on parasitic and fungal disease, biotechnology problems of national strategic need, including detection and analysis of influenza, genomic sequencing of biothreat agents and novel vaccine development. UTHSCSA is home to numerous research programs fo cused on established and emerging infectious diseases caused by parasitic, fungal, viral, and bacterial pat hogens. A significant number of these programs in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology focus on pot ential bioterror threats related to the NBAF mission. TRTF owns operates the 1,236-acre Texas Park (TRP). TRTF is a 501(c)(3) non-profit innovation-based economic developer for San Antonio and South Texas. PROPOSED NBAF SITE LOCATION The San Antonio site alternative is located on 100 acres within the TRP, Bexar and Medina Counties. The TRP site is part of a former working ra nch that was donated to TRTF in 1986. The TRP is approximately four miles west of the City of San Antonio; it is in its extra-territo rial jurisdiction, and it is a Designated Industrial District of the City. COMPLEMENTARY RESEAR CH AND WORKFORCE San Antonio is home to a comprehensive research community with ongoing research programs related to the NBAF mission. The bioscience and healthcare industry sector is the largest economic generator in the community. The TRP site is within proximity of skilled research and technical staff with expertise in design, construction, and operations conducte d at biological and agricultural research facilities. AVAILABLE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE Available site utilities are adjacent to the TRP site w ith capacities that meet or exceed NBAF requirements. Facilities to increase water capacity ar e currently under construction, as is a 200-megawatt electrical substation in the TRP. Natural gas capacity is more than adequate for the NBAF and future resident tenant needs. Existing wastewater lines are adequate, and planned upgrades w ould service the NBAF and future tenant needs. Transportation arteries are adjacent and nearby the TR P and the alternative site. The TRP fronts on State Highway 211 (Texas Research Parkway). To the south, State Highway 211 connects to U.S. Highway 90 approximately two miles from the TRP. To the north , State Highway 211 insects with State Highway 1957 TEXAS SITE ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION (Potranco Road) and will be extended nor thward within four years to connect to the northwest segment of State Highway 211. Umstead Research Farm Site Butner, North Carolina CONSORTIUM The North Carolina Consortium for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) is a statewide public- private partnership. Academic members include two la nd-grant agriculture universities, a veterinary college, three medical institutions (two with public health components), and the North Carolina (NC) Community College Bionetwork. Government participants include federal, state and local officials, in addition to the North Carolina Departments of Agriculture, Health, Commerce, Environment, and Crime Control. Agriculture is represented by our major livestock associations (beef, dair y, poultry, and swine), the NC Farm Bureau, and the NC Agribusiness Council. Biotechnology is represented by non-profit groups promoting biotechnology statewide, and by private sector members in biologi cal research and development, vaccine manufacturing, diagnostics, and similar fields. PROPOSED NBAF SITE LOCATION The proposed site comprises 195 acres in the Granville County portion of the 4,035-acre NC Department of Agriculture Umstead Research Farm (URF). The parcel is unimproved land that was partially logged in 2000. There is a 54-acre area on the northeast side available for expansion, although there are other expansion options available within the farm. URF neighbors include the NC Department of Health and Human Services, a National Guard facility, NC State University, and federal, county, and state entities. Four large universities, the Research Triangle Park, the Eastern Regional Offices of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service-Veterinary Services (APHIS-VS), and state agencies, are within a 25- to 45-minute drive. The site's proximity to nationally ranked research universities, the Triangle area's private sector, our agriculture resources, and government facilities, offers opportunities for synergies, communications, collaborations, and efficiencies that make it highly attractive. COMPLEMENTARY RESEARCH AND WORKFORCE The Triangle region, and the state, have garnered multiple awards and continuous r ecognition for its depth in science and engineering. This strength is generated by its research universities and community college training programs, and is enhanced by its extensive science a nd technology-based private sector, supported by science- and engineering-friendly communities. The Research Tria ngle region of North Carolina, within which the URF is centrally located, is a national resource in health, engineering, general science, and technology research. In the past few years, North Carolina ranked 7th and 15th nationally for total National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation research funding. The Consortium also excels at moving research into the NORTH CAROLINA SITE ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION marketplace as evidenced by having two partner instituti ons (NC State University and UNC-Chapel Hill) in the Milken Institute's September 2006 top 25 U.S. Universities for Technology Transfer a nd Commercialization. Resources are plentiful. Based on a quick survey, it is estimated that in the Research Triangle Park and immediate vicinity, private sector companies with at l east 20-percent research laboratory space have nearly 8.6 million square feet of research laboratory space dedicated to addressing NBAF relevant issues. Note this does not include the large federal (U.S. Environmental Prot ection Agency and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences), state (NC Agriculture, Environment, and Public Health), or university facilities. The availability of highly trained workers extends acro ss NBAF workforce needs, starting with construction and design workforce availability. From 2003 to 2006, the Research Triangle Regional Partnership projected a Triangle area three-year track of $800 million in bi otechnology construction projects employing over 15,000 workers. North Carolina has approximately 30 architect ure/engineering companies, and as many contractor companies, with a total of more than 1,500 employees w ith expertise in laboratory planning. At least five national architecture/engineering firms with experien ce in high biocontainment facilities have offices and employees in the area, with yet another moving to the Triangle this year. The workforce availability also includes those in the technical life science disciplines. Nearly half of North Carolina's 48,000 bioscience- related business employees work in the Triangle area. Approximately 10,000 employees work for pharmaceutical companies statewide carrying out aseptic manuf acturing operations at the highest standards. The workforce pipeline in North Carolin a is also formidable. Central to this is the NC Community College System's (NCCCS) BioNetwork, a statewide program o ffering training from short courses and certificates through associate degree programs in biomanufacturing, bi otechnology, and facility validation for life science technical, design, and construction workers. Statewide, during past three years nearly 2,850 students were enrolled in NCCCS biotechnology programs. For the acad emic year ending in 2005 , over 1,200 more enrolled in relevant continuing education courses. In addition, the University of North Carolina system provides advanced training and facilities in these areas throughout the state. During the 2005-2006 academic year, NC institutions conferred nearly 8,000 bachelor's and graduate degrees in NBAF relevant areas. AVAILABLE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE A major interstate highway (Interstate 85) is within three miles of the site, and connects with Interstates 40 and 95. Service spurs for the Norfolk-Southern Railroad exis t in Butner, approximately three miles south. The Raleigh-Durham International airport is less than 25 mil es away, and the Piedmont-Triad International airport is just over an hour drive from the proposed site. Public safety is managed by the NC Department of Crime Control & Public Safety, which offers the formidable resources of state-level security and protection to the NBAF site. Power is supplied by Duke Energy Corp oration (also supplies power to the Research Triangle Park), and would be able to provide any load demand to the NBAF. Natural gas is supplied by Public Service Company of North Carolina, a regulated public utility serving ov er 400,000 customers thro ughout a 28-county area. Telephone and telecommunications is supplied locally by the town of Butner and/or the NC Department of Health and Human Services. Business telephone service is offered by Sprint/Embarq, and multiple cellular companies cover the area. Telecommunications availability includes the T1 service at the John Umstead Hospital in Butner, as well as regular commercial services vi a several private companies. Water and sewer service is supplied by the South Granville Water and Sewer Authority. It has an operating water and sewer capacity of three million gallons per day (MGD) and five MGD, respectively, and is operating at approximately 50 percent capacity. Power, water, and co mmunications are currently su pplied throughout and around the URF, allowing several options for br inging service to the proposed site. South Milledge Avenue Site Athens, Georgia CONSORTIUM The Georgia Consortium for Health and Agro-Security is headed by Governor Sonny Perdue, a veterinarian who appreciates the threats to Georgia's citizenry and economy posed by zoonotic diseases, along with Senators Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson. The consortium includes our Congressional delegation, Department of Economic Development, the Board of Re gents and Chancellor of the University System of Georgia (USG), the state's research universities and Ge orgia Research Alliance (GRA); Mayor Heidi Davison and other state and regional government leaders and ag encies; Georgia Department of Agriculture and a coalition of Georgia's agricultural associations and stak eholder groups formed to attract the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF); Georgia Power, Merial and other companies; private/non-profit biomedical and health agencies; local and state economic development foundations and chambers of commerce; Georgia's Department of Technical and Adult Education (DTAE) and Athens Technical College; the Office of Homeland Security/Georgia Emergency Management Agency; local health officials, including the CEOs of Athens Regional and St. Mary's hospitals. The University of Georgia (UGA) has provided leadership and will have close ties to the NBAF and serve as its local host. PROPOSED NBAF SITE LOCATION The proposed site is a 67-acre parcel owned by UGA lo cated southwest of the intersection of South Milledge Avenue and Whitehall Road in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia. It is located behind the UGA Livestock Instructional Arena and is used as horse pasture. Th e site, currently known as a portion of Tax Map Parcel No. 18-3-010, is surrounded by a large tract of UGA propert y. There are no adjacent neighborhoods. The title to the property is vested in the USG Board of Regents, which will deed the property to the federal government if the site is selected for construction of the NBAF. COMPLEMENTARY RESEAR CH AND WORKFORCE UGA excels in research relevant to the NBAF, with pr ominent programs in livestock and wildlife health and disease surveillance, global emerging infectious diseases, microbiological food safety and agro-security. UGA has new initiatives in public health, and with the Me dical College of Georgia is planning a new Athens' medical campus to open in 2009. It has made major inv estments in relevant research infrastructure, including the Paul Coverdell Biomedical and Health Sciences Cent er and the Animal Health Research Center, and has a history of productive interactions with university, federa l and industrial partners. Al so in Athens, Merial - a world-leading producer of animal health care products - has expertise in vaccine production that would greatly assist the NBAF, and the U.S. Department of Agri culture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Southeast Poultry Research Lab is a principal repository of national expertise in avian influenza. A major pharmaceutical company is considering Athens as one of two sites for construction of a major pandemic vaccine production facility, which would doveta il perfectly with the mission of the NBAF. The Athens site would locate the NBAF an hour away from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the world's health sentinel, which responds to emerging infectious diseases and thus would naturally interact with the NBAF. Also in Atlanta, Emory's School of Medicine and School of Public Health are world class and offer vaccine and infectious disease research programs that are among the nation's best. Additionally, Georgia Tech is increasing its biomedical programs and offers state-of-the-art engineering solutions to diagnostic and therapeutic problems, and Georgia State has a National Resource Center for Viral Immunology. Collectively, these Athens-Atlanta asset s offer the NBAF the best potential to respond to natural pandemic or bioterror threats in a robust, well-coordinated fashion. Other features distinguish the research environment o ffered by an Athens location. Building on strengths identified by outside consultants, the Georgia Re search Alliance recently received the first $10 million GEORGIA SITE ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION installment on a major, multi-year state investment in vaccine and anti-viral research infrastructure. The Georgia life science industry is booming and now ranks 7th in the United States for number of companies. And, Georgia has invested statewide in specialized containment facilities for infectious disease research - from biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities at the CDC and Georgi a State in Atlanta to the BSL-3-Ag facilities at the USDA, and the near-completed UGA Animal Health Research Center in Athens. Thus, Georgia has ample high-containment design, building and operations expertise, and it also offers relatively low building costs in a national comparison. Athens provides an attractive location in which to recr uit scientific staff, and the state provides a robust and customizable pipeline for workforce recruitment and training. The USG graduates over 7,000 bio-/health science majors per year and Georgia offers state-of-the -art programs for tailored workforce recruitment. DTAE and Athens Technical College, in particular, provide a range of biotechnology workforce training, and DTAE's nationally recognized Quickstart program allow for custom ization of workforce training to meet specific NBAF needs. This commitment and array of unique programs ensures the availab ility of a well-trained and sustainable NBAF workforce. AVAILABLE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE Athens-Clarke County (ACC) has ample water and sewer capacity to serve the NBAF. ACC can withdraw 35 million gallons per day (MGD) from Bear Creek reservoir and another 28 MGD from the North and Middle Oconee Rivers. The ACC water treatment facility can treat 28 MGD but will be upgraded and expanded to 32 MGD by 2008. ACC's existing peak-day water demand is 26 MGD. An 8-inch water line is accessible on South Milledge Avenue, but will be upgraded to a 12-inch line to better serve the NBAF . There are no sewer lines close to the proposed site, hence a force main will be installed along South Milledge Avenue and waste pumped via an onsite lift station to the ACC's Middle Oconee Wastewater Treatment Facility (about threee miles away). Currently, the facility has a capacity of 6 MGD with an existing demand of 3.5 MGD. The facility will be upgraded and expanded to 10 MGD by 2012. Georgia Powe r will provide electrical service from two separate substations through existing electrical distribution infrastructure, mitigating transient power loss. The site is located 1.5 miles from the Athens Perimeter (Loop 10), a four-lane bypass that quickly connects to Atlanta and Hartsfield Jackson International Airport via Georgia Route 316, or to Interstate 20 or 85 via U.S. Route 441.
