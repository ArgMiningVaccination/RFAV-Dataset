Like all holistic health systems, Ayurveda emphasizes the unshakable connections between the body, mind, and spirit. However, Ayurveda's connectedness extends far beyond the individual, reaching into the universal. Basic tenents include: - All things in the universe, both living and nonliving, are joined together. In fact, everything in the universe is actually made of the same five gross natural elements: space, air, fire, water, and earth. - There is a deep connection between the self and the [environment](/node/1255). - We are all initially connected within ourselves, to people surrounding us, to our immediate environment, and to the universe. This balanced connectivity ensures good health. - We remain healthy if we retain balance, interacting with our environment in an effective and wholesome way. - However, our initial balance is often disrupted by our lifestyles. Choices about [diet](/node/437), [exercise](/node/487), [profession](/enhance-your-wellbeing/purpose/life-purpose/discover-your-calling), and [relationships](/node/484)all have the potential to create physical, emotional, or spiritual imbalances. - This imbalance causes a lack of harmony, and makes us more susceptible to disease. - Human beings are responsible for their choices and actions. We can attain and maintain good health if we make balanced choices that promote connectivity and harmony. "}
