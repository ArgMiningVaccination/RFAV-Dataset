A clinical trial is a research study with human volunteers that determines the effectiveness of an investigational cancer drug. Prior to its approval, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a new drug to be tested in a clinical trial to determine its safety and effectiveness. Although today's FDA-approved cancer treatments are a result of clinical trials, not all clinical trials result in drug approvals. A non -FDA-approved drug is investigation al and must undergo vigorous testing to ensure that i t is safe and effectiv e. A clinical trial is also known as a \"research study\", \"study\", or \"trial\" . Why are clinical trials important? Clinical trials advance science and medicine to aid in the development of treatments that are more targeted, often with fewer side effects. Participation in clinical trials offers the potential for access to treatments that ar e not otherwi se ava ilable. Results of clinical trials help to advance patient care, in addition to the advancement of scientific knowledge about cancer. How ca n I learn about a clinical trial? There are a few ways to learn about the clinical trials available at Northwestern: 1. By asking one of your o ncology healthcare providers. 2. By w ebsite - http://cancer.northwestern.edu/clinicaltrials/index.cfm . 3. By phone - (312) 695 - 1102. 4. By email - cancertrials@northwestern.edu . 5. Informed consent forms - documents that provide details about the trial, describe the risks vs. benefits, and the treatment schedule. After you decide to sign the consent form and take part in the tri al, you have to right to withdraw from participation at any time. What are the clinical trial phases? Clinical trials are comprised of different phases that provide information about the drug. x Phase I trials test the safety of the new drug and determine how much of it should be given . x Phase II trials test the new treatment to determine if it is effective. x Phase III trials compare the effectiveness of the new treatment against the standard drugs currently available to find out which one is better . x Phase IV trials monitor ongoing safety and side effects . When c an I ask my healthcare team if a clinical trial is right for me? Anytime you are facing a treatment decision you should ask your healthcare providers if a clinical trial may be appropriate for you. Clinical trials are not just for advanced stage cancer - clinical trials are available for all stages of cancer. Clinical Trials ! works by killing cells that divide rapidly. Cancer cells grow rapidly but so do many normal cells in your body, like the cells in your bone marrow, cells that line your mouth, stomach and intestines, as well as the cells that make your hair grow. That is why you may experience some side effects to chemotherapy. Not everyone has side effects and if you do not have any, it does not mean that the chemotherapy is not working. This section wil l talk about some of the common side effects and what you can do to help control them. Infection White blood cells help your body to fight infection. They are some of the fastest dividing cells in your body and are often affected by chemotherapy. There ar e different types of white blood cells. One kind that your doctor and nurse will follow closely is called a neutrophil, as this cell is especially important to fight infection s. When this type of cell is low (often around 10 -14 days after treatment), it i s very important to watch for any signs of infection. Some signs of infection are: x Fever of 100.5 or higher x Chills, shaking or dizziness x Coughing up yellow or green mucous x Sores in your mouth x Burning when you urinate x Diarrhea x Difficult breathing or feeling short of breath. What you can do to manage or prevent infection x Good hand washing with soap and water is your best defense against infection. It is especially important to wash your hands before preparing food or eating; after you cough, sneeze, or blow your nose; after you use the bathroom or touch animals. If you have pets ask someone else to change the litter or be the \"pooper -scooper\". Carry some hand sanitizer with you to use if you are not able to use soap and water. x Clean surfaces that you touch like telephones, computers, doorknobs with disinfecting wipes. x Try to stay away from people who are sick. x Take good care of your mouth. Brush your teeth at least twice a day using a soft toothbrush and rinse your mouth with an alcohol free mouth wash or a salt and baking soda rinse (\u00bd teaspoon of salt an d \u00bd teaspoon of baking soda in 2 cups of water). x Eat a well balanced diet. Wash raw fruits and vegetables well before eating. Do not eat raw seafood (sushi) or undercooked meat or chicken as these may conta in bacteria. Call your doctor or health care provider right away if you have a fever of 100.5 \u00b0 F or higher or think you have an infection. The number to call 24 hours a day/ 7 days a week is: 312-695-0990 Side Effects and How to Manage Them Fatigue Fatigue means feeling tired or weak and it is not always relieved by rest or sleep. It may last for a few days between treatments or be constant throughout treatment and last for a few weeks or months after your treatment is complete. If you are receiving radiation treatment along with chemotherapy, you may feel even more tired. Fatigue can be a side of effect of the chemotherapy drugs but some other causes of fatigue include: x Anemia (low red blood cells) o Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. Chemotherapy can cause you to have fewer red blood cells and make it harder for your body to get the oxygen it needs. x Some of the medicines we use to treat nausea, anxiety, or pain can also cause fatigue. x Stress or depression can increase fatigue. Having cancer and receiving chemotherapy is stressful. It can affect your family life, work and finances. We have support available to help you handle the increased stress in your life. Please talk to your doctor or nurse about your feelings, so we can get you th e help you need. What you can do to manage fatigue x Try to get 8 hours of sleep each night. Listen to your body. You may need a short nap or to sit down and put up your feet for a bit during the day. (Do not sleep more than an hour during the day so that you can still sleep at night). x Getting some exercise each day such as walking or riding a stationary bike can help reduce fatigue. x Try to balance periods of rest and activity. Let family and friends help you with some of your chores or errands. x Eat a well balanced diet and drink 8 to 10 glasses of fluids each day. (We have dietitians who can help you to meet your dietary needs. Ask your nurse to arrange a visit). x Attending support groups or talking with a therapist can help you control the stress you experience. Bleeding or Clotting Platelets are cells that cause your blood to clot. Chemotherapy can lower the number of platelets that you have which can increase your risk for bleeding. Some types of chemotherapy work by targeting the blood vessels a tumor needs to grow. These medicines can also increase your risk for bleeding or forming a blood clot. What you can do to manage bleeding or clotting x Use a soft toothbrush to clean your teeth. x Use an electric shaver instead of a razor. x Be careful when using sharp objects. x Blow your nose g ently. It may help to use nasal saline spray to keep your nose moist. x Wear shoes, even indoors, to protect your feet. x Do not play contact sports or other activities that could injure you. x Drink plenty of fluids and increase fiber in your diet to prevent st raining to have a bowel movement. x Try not to cross your legs when sitting as this can affect your blood circulation. x Do not take aspirin or over the counter medicines, vitamins or herbal supplements unless you check with your doctor or nurse. Call our off ice at 312 -695-0990 if: x You have bleeding from your nose or a cut that you cannot stop with firm pressure. x You have red or pink colored urine. x You have blood in your bowel movements or they look black and tarry. x You have heavy vaginal bleeding during your period or bleeding when you are not having a period. x Swelling, warmth, or tenderness in your leg or arm. x You have headaches or changes in your vision. Nausea and Vomiting Some chemotherapy can cause you to feel sick to your stomach (nausea) or can cause you to throw up (vomit ). Usually the risk of this is greatest in the first 24 to 48 hours after you are treated. There are many good drugs to control nausea and vomiting. If you are receiving a treatment which can cause nausea, your nurse will g ive you some medicine before the chemotherapy to help prevent it. You will also be given prescriptions for medicine to take at home with instructions on when and how to use it. What you can do to manage nausea and vomiting: x Take your medications exactly the way your nurse instructs you, even if you do not think you need it. It is easier to prevent nausea than get rid of it after it happens. If your medicine does not seem to work, please call your nurse or doctor. There a re many different kinds of anti -nausea medicine and if one doesn't work we can prescribe another. x Eat simple, bland (non -spicy) foods on the day you are treated like soup, eggs, toast or plain pasta. You may also find it easier to eat small, frequent meals instead of 3 large ones. x Foods th at are not too hot or too cold may be better tolerated. x Try to stay away from foods with strong smells. x Drink 8-10 glasses of clear, caffeine -free fluid daily. x Acupuncture may also help with nausea. There is an acupuncture therapist available on certain d ays and times in the clinic, or an appointment can be made at the Center for Integrative Medicine. Your nurse can give you the information. Call our office at 312 -695-0990 if: x You are experiencing nausea and vomiting a t home despite taking your anti -nausea medicine x You feel weak or dizzy. x You are not making as much urine as you usually do or it is dark in color. Hair Loss Some chemotherapy drugs damage the cells that cause your hair to grow. You may lose all of your hair or just have some thinning of your hair. Hair loss can affect all of your body hair - face, eyebrows, eyelashes, arms, legs, underarms, and pubic hair. If you are receiving a drug that causes hair loss, it usually starts about 2 to 3 weeks after your first treatment. It may gradually thin or fall out in clumps. Many people find it easier to cut their hair short or shave their heads when this happens. Your scalp may feel tender or tingly when hair loss is about to begin. Your hair usually begins to grow back about 2 months after comple ting treatment but it may be different in color or texture. What you can do to manage hair loss x Ask your doctor or nurse if you are likely to have hair loss. x Be gentle with your hair. Use baby shampoo and pat it dry. Avoid use of hair dryers, curling irons, hair dyes, or perms as these can damage your hair. If you are interested in obtaining a wig, it is best to do this before you start chemotherapy so that you can match your color and style. Some insurance companies will pay for a wig with a prescript ion from your doctor. The American Cancer Society can also provide a wig for you. x Some people are more comfortable covering their heads with a scarf or hat. Diarrhea Diarrhea means that you have bowel movements more often than normal, and they may be watery or very soft. If you have an ostomy, diarrhea means that your bag is filling up faster and your stool may be softer or more watery. Some types of chemotherapy can cause diarrhea. Radiation therapy to your abdomen or pelvis can also cause diarrhea. What you can do to manage diarrhea: x Imodium (loperamide) is an over the counter medicine used to control diarrhea. Use it the way your nurse or doctor tells you (this may be more often than the package directs). If it does not work be sure to let your nurs e know as there are other medications that can be used. x Drink 8 to 12 glasses of fluids every da y to stay well hydrated. Water, clear soda like ginger ale, apple juice, clear chicken broth or Pedialyte are good choices. Alcohol and caffeine can make diarrhea worse. x Eat small frequent meals instead of 3 large ones. Avoid greasy or spicy foods, or foods that cause gas like cabbage or broccoli. x Soft, bland foods like bananas, white rice, applesauce, toast, eg gs, plain noodles, jello, or baked chicken or turkey without the skin are good choices. x Clean your skin gently after a bowel movement. Use a baby wipe or squirt bottle with warm water to clean yourself. You may need to use an ointment like Desitin or A&D t o soothe your skin. Call our office at 312 -695-0990 if: x You have a fever of 100.5 degrees F or higher. x You feel weak, dizzy, or short of breath. x The medicines you are taking for diarrhea are not helping. x You notice blood in your stools or dark, tarry sto ols. Constipation Constipation means that it is hard to have a bowel movement. Your stools may be harder than normal and you may have more gas and bloating. Some chemotherapy can cause constipation. Pain medicines or some of the medicines to prevent nausea can cause this too. What you can do to manage constipation: x Drink plenty of liquids. Try to drink at least 8 -10 glasses every day. Prune juice or other fruit/ vegetable juices may help. x Eat high fiber foods like bran, whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables, nuts, or popcorn x Stay active! Walking or riding an exercise bike can help. x Your doctor or nurse may recommend a laxative like Senna -S\u00ae or Miralax \u00ae. Do not use an enema or suppository without asking your nurse or doctor first. Call our office at 312 -695-0990 if: x You hav e not had a bowel movement for 3 days. Mouth Sores Some types of chemotherapy can cause your mouth to feel dry or cause sores in your mouth, throat or around your lips (like canker sores). This can make it harder for you to eat and drink. What you can do to manage mouth sores: x If possible, see a dentist before starting chemotherapy to have your teeth cleaned and take care of any problems you may have. If you must go to the dentist while on chemotherapy, let your doctor or nurse know so they can check your blood counts and make sure it is safe. x Keep your mouth clean. Brush your teeth after eating and at bedtime using a soft tooth brush. x Rinse your mouth frequently (4 or 5 times a day) with a salt and soda solution (\u00bd teaspoon sal t and \u00bd teaspoon baking soda in 2 cups water ). You may use Biotene, which is available over -the-counter. Do not use mouth wash that has alcohol in it as this can dry your mouth more. x If your mouth is sore eat foods that are soft and moist like scrambled e ggs, mashed potatoes with gravy, or pudding. Stay away from citrus (oranges, lemon or grapefruit), crunchy foods or foods that are spicy. x Tobacco and alcohol can also aggravate mouth sores. x If your mouth is dry, suck on hard candy or chew sugarless gum. x Sucking on ice chips or popsicles may also help dry mouth and to relieve pain if mouth is sore. x Keep your lips moist with a moisturizer like petroleum jelly (Vaseline \u00ae) or lip balm.

Use gloves or pads to protect your hands when getting something f rom the refrigerator or freezer. Let cold foods come to room temperature before eating. Skin and Nail Changes Chemot herapy can cause changes in your skin and fingernails. Your skin may feel dry and itchy or you may notice tenderness and peeling especially of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet or have a rash. Some drugs can cause a rash that looks like acne on your face, neck, back and chest. Your nails may be brittle and crack or you may get tender areas around your nail beds. You may also get a sunburn more quickly when on chemotherapy. Some drugs may cause darkening along your veins where the IV medicine was given. What you can do to manage skin changes: x If you are getting a drug that is likely to cause a rash, your doctor may have you see one of our dermatologists (skin doctor) who will give you medicines and creams to help. x To help with dry skin, take quick showers instead of long baths; use a mild moisturizing soap; pat dry gently and use lotion or creams while skin is still damp. x A dusting of cornstarch may help itching or using a colloidal oatmeal bath (you can buy over -the- counter) may also help. x Avoid direct sunlight; wear a hat when outdoors and use a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 (30 is better!) . Hot Flashes Chemotherapy can cause changes in your body's level of estrogen. Due to a decrease in circulating estrogen, your body may have sympt oms simi lar to going through menopause, such as hot flashes. What you can do to manage hot flashes : x Avoid caffeine products such as coffee . x Avoid spicy foods . x Acupuncture may help relieve your symptoms, if interested, please talk with your nurse . Sexual health is the state of well -being that focuses on our feelings about our own sexuality, and may include the physical, emotional and cultural aspects of sexual well -being. What is sexuality? Sexuality may include : x Our bodies. x The act of sex. x Our sexual orientation. x Gender identity (male or female). x Our values about life, love and the people in our lives. Will my sexual desire change as I go through cancer treatments? You may notice a change in your sexual desire during cancer treatment. This may be due to: x Pain. x Fatigue. x Changes in hormones. x Depression and anxiety. x Changes in your self -image. How can I express intimacy without sexual intercourse? Love and affection can be expressed in many ways. x Kissing. x Hugging. x Fondling. x Cuddling. x Touching. x Holding hands What should I do if I want to have sex with my spouse/partner? Talk to your doctor or nurse to see if it is all right to engage in sexual acts during active cancer treatment. Questio ns to ask your doctor or nurse during cancer treatment: x When can I have sex? x What can I expect? x What can I do to protect myself and my partner during sex? x Are there any restrictions on sexual activity during or after treatment? Sexual Health and Cancer Precautions during sexual activity: x Use a barrier contraceptive, such as condoms. This prevents exchange of body fluids. During cancer treatment, semen and vaginal fluids may contain chemotherapy byproducts. Barrier methods also help prevent the spread of STDs (sexually transmitte d diseases). x Use 2 forms of protection to prevent pregnancy. Chemotherapy may affect male semen and female eggs. Medicines you are taking may be harmful to a developing fetus. Talk to your doctor or nurse about birth control methods (e.g., condoms, spermic ide, diaphragms and cervical caps). x Before having intercourse, your neutrophil count should be over 2,000 cells/mm3. If your counts are lower than this, talk to your doctor or nurse. A low neutrophil count increases your risk for infection. When your white blood cell count is very low, the pressure of sex may cause bacteria from the vagina or rectal areas to get into the bloodstream. You may get sick if this happens. To help prevent this from occurring, it is recommended that you wash your genitals before a nd after sex. x Before having intercourse, your platelet count should be above 50,000 cells/mm3. When your platelet count is low, you have a greater risk for bleeding. x To promote hygiene during sexual acts: Wash hands before and after sexual activity . x Avoid rectal intercourse, which can increase your risk of infection and risk of bleeding. x Avoid excessive friction during intercourse by using a water -based lubricant, such as K -Y Jelly\u00ae or Astroglide\u00ae. Do not use petroleum -based jellies or lubricants. x Repo rt any unusual pain, fever, bleeding or discharge to your doctor or nurse. Important signs and symptoms to report to your doctor or nurse: x Changes in sexual drive. x Men: Genital pain, pain during erection and/or ejaculation or problems having an erection. x Women: Dryness in the vagina, unusual discharge from your vagina, hot flashes, pain during sex, discomfort, bleeding during or after intercourse. Tips to promote sexual health: x Be responsible. x Get professional help when needed. x Talk with your healthcare provider. x Talk to your partner about your feelings. x Take time for intimacy other than intercourse. x Keep an open mind about ways to feel sexual pleasure. x Focus on your physical recovery first. It's OK not to have sex. Health Information Resources For more information, visit Northwestern Memorial Hospital's Alberto Culver Health Learning Center.

Sexual Health Resources Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy can cause problems with cognitive (mental) functioning. Patients can experience changes such as trouble with concentration or memory. The effects are sometimes referred to as \"chemobrain\" or \"chemo fog\". Health care providers are unable to predict which patients might be affected by this treatment side effect. Patients may notice this problem during chemotherapy treatment as wel l. Typically, patients find these difficulties greatly improve or no longer exist within one year of treatment. Symptoms: x Trouble remembering things (difficulty with short -term memory) x Trouble paying attention or with concentration x Trouble finding the right word x Difficulty with new learning x Difficulty multitasking x Taking longer to do things x Trouble setting priorities Causes: The exact cause of cognitive changes is unclear. The possible causes that can contribute to these difficulties include: x Low blood counts x Stress x Depression or Anxiety x Fatigue or difficulty sleeping x Certain medications x Hormone changes from some treatments What You Can Do to Cope: x Make lists. Carry a pad with you and write down the things you need to do. For example, keep list s of things to buy, errands to run, phone calls to return, and even the times you need to take your medicines. Cross items off as you finish them. x Use a portable planner or personal organizer. These can help you stay on top of day -to-day tasks and keep tra ck of appointments and special days like birthdays and anniversaries. Paper and electronic versions are available. x Organize your environment. Keep things in familiar places so you will remember where you put them. x Avoid distractions. Work, read, and do your thinking in an uncluttered, peaceful environment. This can help you stay focused for longer periods of time. x Keep your mind active. Do crossword puzzles and word games, or go to a lecture on a subject that interests you. x Proofread. Double -check the thing s you write to make sure you've used the right words and spelling. x Exercise, eat well and get plenty of rest and sleep. Research shows that these things help keep your memory working at its best. x Tell your loved ones what you're going through. Depending on how private a person you are, you might tell your family and friends, so that they'll understand if you forget things you normally wouldn't forget. They may be able to help and encourage you. Cognitive Changes After Chemotherapy The dedicated Fertility Preservation team works across many specialties in order to best accommodate our patients' specific needs. This emphasis in collaboration allows for truly comprehensive treatment in an effort to optimally educate and inform patient s about fertility before, during and after treatment. Patients who have questions about fertility or fertility preservation can call the Patient Navigator at 312. 503-3378. Asking your physician these 5 questions can help you learn more about your upcoming treatment and its impact on fertility: How quickly do I need to start treatment? Will my disease or its treatment affect my future fertility? What fertility options are there for me? Should I see a reproductive specialist? Can I have my own biological children after my treatment? For women, infertility means not being able to initiate or maintain a pregnancy. This can happen when: The ovaries no longer contain a supply of healthy eggs. Damage to the reproductive system prevents a fertilized egg from successfully implanting and growing in the uterus. There are many options patients can pursue before, during and after treatment Some of these options are: x Embryo Banking x Egg Banking x Ovarian Tissue Banking x Medication treatment x Fertility sparing surgery For men, infertility means not being able to get a woman pregnant. For men, infertility happens when the body does not make enough healthy sperm to achieve pregnancy or when sperm is blocked from getting out of the body. There are many fertility preser vation options patients can pursue before, during and after treatment. Some of these options are: x Sperm banking x Testicular Sperm Extraction (TESE) x Testicular Tissue Freezing Fertility It's important to remember that each patient has a unique treatment plan and situation. An individualized consultation can help a patient understand all of his options as well as pursue appropriate treatments quickly, if warranted. If you have questions about fertility after treatment, call the Patient Navigator at (312) 503 -3378. Certain treatments, like chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can negatively impact a patient's fertility - the ability to have children. The Fertility Preservation team at Northwestern Medicine can help patients understand: How fertility can be affected by treatment How to talk with their medical team about fertility How to plan a family before, during and after treatment Cancer treatment can affect your hormones in a number of ways . Lymphedema is a chronic swelling that may occur after radiation treatment for breast cancer or after breast surgery. The lymph system drains fluid and waste from the body. As the fluid travels from the breast to the armpit, it passes through lymph nodes. This helps \"clean up\" and fight bacteria. Removal of, or damage to, the lymph nodes by surgery or radiation increases the risk of lymphedema. When the vessels are blocked or cannot \"handle\" the fluid, swelling occ urs. The swelling may be mild or severe. It can develop soon after treatment or many years later. Your risk for lymphedema increases if you have a history of: x Inflammation of the lymph system (lymphangitis). x Infection of the skin and underlying tissue (ce llulitis). Symptoms Lymphedema often begins slowly. It may occur after an injury, insect bite, burn, muscle strain or infection of the hand, arm or upper body on the side of the surgery or radiation. Swelling may improve by elevating the affected arm. Call your surgeon, or the radiation or medical oncologist, if you have: x Swelling of the arm. Often, the swelling starts on the forearm on the same side as the little finger and under the elbow. Jewelry may feel too tight. x Any signs of infection such as war mth, redness, rash, tenderness, weakness chills or fever of 101.5 F or higher. x Discomfort, tightness, heaviness of the arm and decreased range of motion. Pain is not usually a symptom. Patient Education Coping with Lymphedema Know the risks, signs and steps to ease the effects of lymphedema. Taking Care x Proper skin care is very important. When bathing, gently dry the affected area. x Use gentle or hypoallergenic cleansers and lotions to avoid skin irritation and dryness. Special lotions such as Eucerin \u00ae, Curel\u00ae, or baby products are an option. x Wear a well -fitted bra with soft, padded straps. x During air travel, wear a well -fitted compression sleeve and have extra bandages for long flights. Walk around on flights if possible, and increase water intake. x Keep a healthy body weight. Avoid or limit fatty foods, sweets, salt, and alcohol intake. x Do not smoke. Lymphedema and Breast Cancer Preventing Injury x Avoid cuts, scratches, hangnails, insect bites and burns that may lead to infection. x Avoid cutting or picking your cuticles. Talk wit h your manicurist. x Wear gloves while doing housework and gardening. x Use a thimble while sewing. x Wear oven mitts when handling hot foods. x Apply non -irritating sunscreen and insect repellent when outdoors. x Use an electric razor to remove hair. x Never allow bl ood tests, injections or blood pressure measurement on the affected arm. Wear a lymphedema alert bracelet. x When bathing or doing household chores, avoid extreme temperature changes. Test water temperatures with the other hand. Avoid saunas and hot tubs or keep affected arm out of water. x Avoid tight -fitting clothing and jewelry. Activities Avoid using the affected arm for tiring household and yard chores, such as: x Vacuuming. x Scrubbing. x Washing windows. x Shoveling/raking/hoeing. Do no heavy lifting with the affected arm. Carry shoulder bags or purses on the opposite side. Exercise regularly, in moderation. Avoid repetitive motion activities or resistance exercises using the affected arm. Instead, try walking, swimming, light aerobics, bike riding, yoga or Ta i Chi. Do not overtire the affected arm. If your arm starts to feel tired or aches, stop and elevate it. Treatment While there is no cure for lymphedema, there are treatments to reduce lymphedema and manage symptoms. Lymphedema can be managed by Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT). CDT can include: x Manual lymph drainage, including bandaging. x Graduated compression garments. x Therapeutic exercise. Your doctor or lymphedema therapist can talk with you about this in more detail. When to Call the Doctor Check the affected arm for signs of infection. Contact your doctor and lymphedema therapist right away if you have: x Redness. x Warmth in the affected arm. x Swelling that increases or doesn't go away. x Pain or tenderness. x Fever.

It has a small catheter or tubing attached which is placed into a large vein. When not in use, i t will show only as a nickel sized bump underneath your skin. The port is placed by a doctor in the Interventional Radiology department. You will be given some medications to relax and the doctor will use local anesthesia (numbing medicine) where the port is inse rted so you will be comfortable. The area may be tender for a few days after the port is placed. You must arrange for a ride home after the procedure as you will be too tired to drive. The nurse will use a special needle to access the port when it is needed and the needle will be removed when your treatment is completed. There are many advantages to having a port. It is a safe way to give chemotherapy that could irritate or damage your skin and tissues if it leaked outside of the vein. Some treatments require the patient to go home with a chemotherapy infusion pump and a port will make it easier for you to move about while getting treatment. A port can be used to draw blood as well as receive chemotherapy, IV fluids and other medicines so it will decrea se the number of times you have to be \"stuck\" with a needle. Also a port is a good idea if you have tiny veins that are hard to find. The port will need to be flushed every month if it is not being used. You can make an appointment with our cancer center n urses to do this if needed. PORT -A-CATH A computed tomography (CT) scan is a special way of looking inside your body. The images produced are cross -sectional planes taken from a part of your body, much like slices taken out of a loaf of bread. The length of the exam will depend upon the area to be scanned and specific information needed by your doctors. The CT scan is done in the Radiology (X -ray) department. Please tell your doctor or the X -ray staff if you: x Are pregnant, might be pregnant, are tr ying to get pregnant or are breastfeeding. x Are allergic to contrast dye. x Are on dialysis or have known kidney disease. x Are diabetic. x Have had a problem with this exam (or other contrast exams) in the past. Preparation for the Test If you have a contrast dye allergy or are taking metformin (Glucophage\u00ae, Glucophage XR\u00ae, Glucovance\u00ae), you will be given special medication instructions. It is important that you follow these instructions carefully. For dialysis patients, the CT scan may need to be scheduled on the same day as your dialysis treatment. Patients over the age of 70 or those having known risk factors may require kidney function tests. Other preparations for the CT scan will vary depending on the area of the body to be examined. Your doctor will inform you of any needed preparations. These may include: x Pregnancy testing and advice for withholding breastfeeding. x Diet restrictions. x Proper fluid intake. x Laxatives or bowel preparations. Patient Education Patients will need t o change into a hospital gown for this exam. Outpatients will be shown to a dressing area for changing. You will need to remove any loose or hanging jewelry, such as necklaces. It is not usually necessary to remove rings or watches, but you may choose to d o so for comfort. For certain tests, you may be asked to drink a liquid contrast agent. This oral contrast agent outlines the stomach and bowel on the pictures and will make certain parts of your body appear bright on the pictures. This step is important in obtaining accurate results. If you have any stomach upset or diarrhea, please tell the CT staff. Another contrast agent, a dye, may be needed during the scan. This is injected through an IV (into the vein) line. This line may be started before the CT s can begins. Computed Tomography (CT) Scan During the Test Before the test begins, the CT staff will explain the test and the equipment used. You will be asked to lie on a table connected to the CT scan machine. The technologist (tech) will line up the part of your body to be examined. The table will then move so that you are in the center of the machine. The tech will keep in contact with you throughout the exam by intercom. As the exam begins, it is very important that you lie still and follow the instructions of the tech and doctor. The tech may ask you to hold your breath several times during the test. If needed, a doctor, nurse, or tech will inject the IV contrast. As it is injected, you may feel warm and flushed or feel the urge to urinate. You may also note a metallic taste in your mouth. These are normal effects, although most people will feel nothing at all. Please tell the staff right away if you note any of the following: x Shortness of breath. x Hives. x Itching. After the Test You may resume your normal activities and diet after the test. If you received a contrast agent during the test, it is suggested that you drink an additional 1 or 2 glasses of water. The contrast agent will not discolor your urine. Although it is rare to have any delayed allergic reactions, contact the CT d epartment or your doctor if any rash or swelling occurs. If you received an oral preparation, you may notice a change in the color and frequency of your bowel movements. If any change lasts more than 2 to 3 days, please contact your doctor. If you have a ny questions or concerns about this test, please ask your doctor, nurse or Radiology staff. Radiation Safety CT scans use radiation to produce images needed for diagnosis and treatment. There are risks to radiation exposure. It is important to talk with y our doctor before having the test to learn about: x Its risks and benefits. x The reason for the test. At Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH), we are committed to your safety. This means that your scan will be done with the least amount of radiation without reducing the quality of the exam. The NMH CT department is proud to be accredited by the American College of Radiology (ACR). Earning this designation ensures that: We have undergone a thorough review process. x Our staff is well qualified, through educatio n and certification to perform and interpret your test results. x Our equipment is suitable for the test or treatment provided. x We meet or exceed national quality and safety guidelines.

In many cases, the test can detect this condition before it can be seen on standard X -rays. A bone scan uses a small amount of radioactive material (tracer) that is absorbed into the bones. The amount of radiation used in this test is small, and well within limits that are not considered harmful. Your total test time is about 4 hours. Before the Test There is no special preparation for the t est. On the day of the test, please come to the 8th Floor reception desk in the Galter Pavilion, 201 E. Huron St., at your scheduled appointment time. Parking is available for patients and visitors in the garage at 222 E. Huron, across from the Feinberg an d Galter Pavilions. For discounted rates, please bring your parking ticket with you. Tickets can be validated at the Customer Services Desks on the 1st, 2nd and 8th floors of the Feinberg and Galter Pavilions, and the 1st floor of Prentice (including the Prentice 24 -hour desk near the Superior St. entrance). Be sure to bring: x Your doctor's written order for the test. x A list of allergies. x A list of all your current medications (prescription, over -the-counter, and herbals). x Photo ID. x Medical insurance information. x Medicare card (Medicare patients only). During the Test When you arrive in the Nuclear Medicine department, a nuclear technologist (tech) will ask you questions about your medical history. If you think you might be pregnant or are breastfeeding, please tell the tech before you are given any injection. You will then be given an IV (into the vein) injection of radioactive tracer. The tech will ask you to return to the Nuclear Medicine department about 2 to 4 hours later. This time i s needed for the tracer to localize into your bones. When you return, the scan will take about 1 to 2 hours. You will be asked to empty your bladder. This is done so that the pelvic and hip bones will show up clearly. You will then be asked to lie down on a table and a total body image will be taken. A doctor will review your bone scan and, in most cases, will ask for extra images to obtain more detailed information. After the Test You may resume your normal activities and diet. The injection you were give n is not harmful and will become non -radioactive within hours. Talk with your doctor about your test results. You may obtain a copy of your results at Medical Records on the 2nd floor of the Galter Pavilion. Bone Scan If you have any questions about this test, please call the Nuclear Medicine Department at 312 -926-2320, Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Health Information Resources For more information, visit one of Northwestern Memorial Hospital's Health Learning Centers.

It is different from an X -ray. It uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create the pictures. During the test, a contrast agent (dye) may be given. This makes certain parts of your body appear brighter on the pictures. The exam time depends upon the area to be scanned and the information needed by your doctors. Most exams last about 45 to 60 minutes. The MRI is done in the R adiology (X -ray) Department. Northwestern Memorial Hospital offers the option of 4 locations: x Feinberg Pavilion at 251 E. Huron St. x 441 E. Ontario St. x 1913 W. North Ave nue in Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood. x Prentice Women's Hospital at 250 E. Superior St. Before the Test Please tell your doctor if you might be pregnant, are trying to become pregnant or are breastfeeding. Also, please notify your doctor if you are on dialysis or have known kidney disease. If you are on dialysis, you will need to schedule dialysis on the day of your MRI, as well as the following day. This helps rid the body of any contrast dye used during the MRI exam. Every MRI patient will be screened to ensure that certain safeguards are in place. Please tell your doctor or MRI staff before the exam if you have any metal inside your body. This may include: x Pacemaker x Aneurysm clip x Ear or eye implant x Joint or bone rods or clips x Metal plate x Bullets or shrapnel Patient Education It is also helpful to talk with your doctor if you: x Cannot lie flat for about an hour. x Have claustrophobia (are uncomfortable with closed -in spaces). Please ask your doctor if you need to make any changes in your diet before this exam. Otherwise, there is no special preparation for this test. On the day of the test, plan to arrive 30 minutes before your test time. Also, be sure to bring: x Your doctor's written order for the test. x A list of all your current medications (prescription and over -the-counter). x Medical insurance information. x Medicare card (Medicare patients only). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) If plans were made to give you any medicine to help you relax, you also will need a responsible adult to take you home. Also, there are special diet instructions. The scheduling MRI staff will discuss these with you before the exam. Upon arrival, you will be asked to complete an MRI safety questionnaire and a medical history form. Prior to the test, you will be taken to a locker room to change into a hospital gown and store your belongings. It is important that you remove all metal, including jewelry, credit cards, keys and dentures. The staff nurse then reviews your completed forms with you. An IV (into the vein) line is started in your arm or hand. During the Test Once you are taken into the exam room, you are introduced to the technologist (tech) and nurse who will perform the test. They can answer any questions you may have. You are asked to lie on a table attached to the MRI machine. The nurse and tech help position you comfortably on the exam table. You are given a hand -held device to help you contact the tech during the test as needed. Ear plugs also are provided. If medication to relax you was ordered, it is injected into the IV at this time. You may be given an IV contrast agent (gadalinium dye) during the test. As the dye is injected, you may feel warm or flushed or you might notice a metallic taste in your mouth. This is normal. However, please notify the staff right away if you have shortness of breath, hives or itching. Your body and the machine are lined up so that the proper area of your body can be examined. Then the table moves so that you are in the center of the machine. The tech keeps in contact with you throughout the exam. During the MRI, you will hear a loud drumming noise. It is very important that you lie still and follo w instructions. Between scans, the drumming noise stops. You may be asked to hold your breath several times during the test. When the exam is over, you will be assisted off the exam table. After the Test If relaxing medication was given, you must remain in the department for about an hour. Your blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen level will be monitored by a nurse. Unless told otherwise, you may resume your normal activities and diet after the exam. It is helpful to drink extra fluids if a contrast agent was given. The contrast agent does not discolor your urine. Most often, initial findings are sent to your doctor within 48 hours. A full report follows in about 5 business days. Health Information Resources For more information, visit Northwestern Memorial Hospital's Alberto Culver Health Learning Center.

A Voice in Your Future: Your Health, Your Decision At Northwestern Memorial Hospital, we honor your right to make your healthcare wishes known. The Illinois Power of Attorney for Healthcare was created so that you have a voice in your medical treatment even if you are unable to speak for yourself. The law allows you to complete a Power of Attorney for Healthcare to designate someone to make healthcare decisions if you cannot. For any of us, the time may come when an accident or illness leaves us temporarily unconscious or otherwise unable to make decisions. The time may come when no medical treatment will restore our physical health. Because this can happen to anyone, we encourage everyone to designate a decision maker. It is easy to complete a Power of Attorney for Healthcare: There is no cost. You do not need a lawyer. You can prepare it at home or at the hospital. The Power of Attorney for Healthcare allows you to name a person to act as your \"agent\" to make decisions on your behalf when you cannot do so. Your Agent Acts for You Only When You Cannot Make Your Own Decisions. You can appoint any adult as your agent, except a healthcare provider involved in your care. Most people appoint a trusted family member or friend. Before you appoint an agent, we recommend that you ask the person if they are willing to make decisions on your behalf and make certain they understand your wishes about the kind of medical treatment you want. You can have only one agent, but it is a good idea to list \"successor\" agents in case the rst person you choose is unavailable. The agent's role is to make healthcare decisions for you. You may give your agent all the powers that you would normally have and the power to consent to, or refuse, any type of healthcare. You can place limitations on your agent's power or can give your agent specic rules to follow. If you have registered to be an organ donor in Illinois (donatelifeillinois.org), your agent does not have to make this decision. If you have not registered, your agent would have to make that decision.The standard form of the Power of Attorney for Healthcare contains blanks for you to ll in, if you choose, with instructions for your agent. It also contains three statements about life-sustaining treatment. You can select the statement that is closest to your own intentions or you can write your own. If you decide to write your own, we recommend you discuss it with your physician to be sure that it reflects your own medical situation. Facts About the Power of Attorney for Healthcare You may use a standard form or you may write your own. The form does not need to be prepared by a lawyer. The form does not need to be signed by a physician. However, we encourage you to discuss your thoughts and preferences with your physician to make sure that your form reflects the choices you want. The form is free and you can nd it at www.nmh.org/nm/hospital-guide-advance-directives , in our Health Learning Center, on the State of Illinois website at idph.state.il.us/public/books/advin.htm or by asking a chaplain, social worker or patient representative at Northwestern Memorial. If you used a form from another state that meets the Illinois legal requirements, we will honor it. How Do I Prepare a Power of Attorney for Healthcare? While you are a patient, the hospital sta ff can assist you in completing the Power of Attorney for Healthcare. In the hospital's Health Learning Center, you can nd educational videos and other resources about advance directives. What Do I Do With the Power of Attorney for Healthcare When I Complete It? Give copies to your primary care physician, your hospital physician and close family members or friends. If you are admitted to the hospital, we will scan the documents into your electronic medical record so they are available to the clinical team. We encourage you to talk with your physicians, family and friends about how you want to be cared for if you can no longer speak for yourself. It is especially important to discuss the kind of treatment you would like to receive if you have a terminal condition or are unable to make your own decisions for an extended period of time. We also encourage you to talk to a trusted physician who knows you well as you think about these issues. Consider: Do you believe that sometimes the burden and pain of treatment might be greater than the benet? Do you have special concerns or questions about articial ventilation, tube feedings or other kinds of treatment administered when you are terminally ill? Do you have any special concerns about pain or comfort care? Your physicians and nurses will always provide pain management and comfort care along with other care and treatment according to your needs and preferences. If you complete a Power of Attorney for Healthcare and later change your mind, you can revoke the document by tearing it up or stating that it is being revoked. Each time you are admitted to the hospital, we will ask you if we have the most current copy. Other Advance Directives There are other forms of advance directives that some patients may wish to use. The Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order is helpful to patients nearing the end of life who do not want any attempts made at CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), including shocks attempting to restore heartbeat and support of breathing by a tube placed in the windpipe and attached to a breathing machine (ventilator). While you are in the hospital, your physician can enter an order so that CPR is not attempted. Patients with a DNR order may still receive the full range of other necessary medical treatment, including pain management and comfort care, medication, therapy, dialysis and sometimes even surgery. If you want to have this order available even when you are at home, the State of Illinois has a form you may use at idph.state.il.us/public/ books/advin.htm or you can ask for it at the hospital. This order must be signed by the patient and a physician. If you bring this order to the hospital, it will be honored. If you would like to prepare one before you go home from the hospital, we will assist you. A Mental Health Treatment Preference Declaration lets you say whether you consent to receive electroconvulsive treatment, psychotropic medicine or admission to a mental health facility when you have a mental illness. You may name someone to make decisions about mental health treatment if you are incapable. A form is available at idph.state.il.us/public/books/advin.htm. If You Do Not Specify a Decision Maker If you decide not to designate an agent and if you cannot make your own decisions, under Illinois law, a limited range of healthcare decisions will be made by your legal \"surrogate,\" in this order of priority: 1. Court-appointed guardian (if any) 2. Spouse 3. Adult child 4. Parent 5. Adult brother or sister 6. Adult grandchild 7. Close friend 8. Court-appointed guardian of the estate If more than one family member is in the same category, the majority must make the decision. For example, if there are three adult children, at least two must agree. In making healthcare decisions, the family members or friends must try to come to the same decision that the patient would have. However, a surrogate under Illinois law does not have the same authority or decision-making power that an agent has under the Power of Attorney for Healthcare.We recommend that everyone complete a Power of Attorney for Healthcare to be sure that your wishes will be followed.

Northwestern Medicine. Published by the Department of Communications, Northwestern Memorial HealthCare 4449-13 Dear Patient, In this packet you will find a copy of the official State of Illinois \"POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE .\" We invite all patients to complete this form, so that you can tell us who can speak for you if there is ever a time when you cannot speak for yourself. When you complete this form, you are choosing one person who will have all the same power you would have to make decisions for yourself, if there is ever a time when you cannot make them. If you don't use a Power of Attorney document , then Illinois state law determines who can speak for you as your \"surrogate.\" However, a health care surrogate's power to make decisions may be very limited in certain situations. For example, a health care surrogate cannot tell your health care providers to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment unless you have certain \"qualifying conditions.\" You may want these limits, or you may not. If you want to be specific in choosing who will make decisions for you, and what limits there should be on those decisions, then the Power of Attorney for Health Care is the best way to make your wishes known. Hospital staff are available to help you complete this form if you wish. Please ask your nurse to contact a chaplain, social worker, or patient representative. We encourage you to discuss this subject with your doctor and your family as well. A witness to your signature is required by law. Information on who may and may not serve as a witness to your signature is found at the end of the Power of Attorney document. We will store this document with your medical record. However, we will ask you for the document at each visit or admission, because it is important for your care that we have the most recent one readily accessible. Please bring it every time you come to NM for care. Thank you for taking time to plan so that you receive the care that is right for you. 504358 (2/15) ILLINOIS STATUTORY SHORT FORM POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE WHAT ARE THE THINGS I WANT MY HEALTH CARE AGENT TO KNOW? The selection of your agent should be considered carefully, as your agent will have the ultimate decision - making authority once this document goes into effect, in most instances after you are no longer able to make your own decisions. While the goal is for your agent to make decisions in keeping with your preferences and in the majority of circumstances that is what happens, please know that the law does allow your agent to make decisions to direct or refuse health care interventions or withdraw treatment. Your agent will need to think about conversations you have had, your personality, and how you handled important health care issues in the past. Therefore, it is important to talk with your agent and your family about such things as: (i) What is most important to you in your life? (ii) How important is it to you to avoid pain and suffering? (iii) If you had to choose, is it more important to you to live as long as possible, or to avoid prolonged suffering or disability? (iv) Would you rather be at home or in a hospital for the last days or weeks of your life? (v) Do you have religious, spiritual, or cultural beliefs that you want your agent and others to consider? (vi) Do you wish to make a significant contribution to medical science after your death through organ or whole body donation? (vii) Do you have an existing advance directive, such as a living will, that contains your specific wishes about health care that is only delaying your death? If you have another advance directive, make sure to discuss with your agent the directive and the treatment decisions contained within that outline your preferences. Make sure that your agent agrees to honor the wishes expressed in your advance directive. Illinois Statutory Short Form Power of Attorney for Health Care (continued) 504358 (2/15) NOTICE TO THE INDIVIDUAL SIGNING THE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE No one can predict when a serious illness or accident might occur. When it does, you may need someone else to speak or make health care decisions for you. If you plan now, you can increase the chances that the medical treatment you get will be the treatment you want. In Illinois, you can choose someone to be your \"health care agent.\" Your agent is the person you trust to make health care decisions for you if you are unable or do not want to make them yourself. These decisions should be based on your personal values and wishes. It is important to put your choice of agent in writing. The written form is often called an \"advance directive.\" You may use this form or another form, as long as it meets the legal requirements of Illinois. There are many written and on-line resources to guide you and your loved ones in having a conversation about these issues. You may find it helpful to look at these resources while thinking about and discussing your advance directive. WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS CAN MY AGENT MAKE? If there is ever a period of time when your physician determines that you cannot make your own health care decisions, or if you do not want to make your own decisions, some of the decisions your agent could make are to: (i) Talk with physicians and other health care providers about your condition. (ii) See medical records and approve who else can see them. (iii) Give permission for medical tests, medicines, surgery, or other treatments. (iv) Choose where you receive care and which physicians and others provide it. (v) Decide to accept, withdraw, or decline treatments designed to keep you alive if you are near death or not likely to recover. You may choose to include guidelines and/or restrictions to your agent's authority. (vi) Agree or decline to donate your organs or your whole body if you have not already made this decision yourself. This could include donation for transplant, research, and/or education. You should let your agent know whether you are registered as a donor in the First Person Consent registry maintained by the Illinois Secretary of State or whether you have agreed to donate your whole body for medical research and/or education. (vii) Decide what to do with your remains after you have died, if you have not already made plans. (viii) Talk with your other loved ones to help come to a decision (but your designated agent will have the final say over your other loved ones). Your agent is not automatically responsible for your health care expenses. WHOM SHOULD I CHOOSE TO BE MY HEALTH CARE AGENT? You can pick a family member, but you do not have to. Your agent will have the responsibility to make medical treatment decisions, even if other people close to you might urge a different decision. The selection of your agent should be done carefully, as he or she will have ultimate decision -making authority for your treatment decisions once you are no longer able to voice your preferences. Choose a family member, friend, or other person who: (i) is at least 18 years old; (ii) knows you well; (iii) you trust to do what is best for you and is willing to carry out your wishes, even if he or she may not agree with your wishes; (iv) would be comfortable talking with and questioning your physicians and other health care providers; (v) would not be too upset to carry out your wishes if you became very sick; and (vi) can be there for you when you need it and is wil ling to accept this important role. Illinois Statutory Short Form Power of Attorney for Health Care (continued) WHAT IF MY AGENT IS NOT AVAILABLE OR IS UNWILLING TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR ME? If the person who is your first choice is unable to carry out this role, then the second agent you chose will make the decisions; if your second agent is not available, then the third agent you chose will make the decisions. The second and third agents are called your successor agents and they function as back -up agents to your first choice agent and may act only one at a time and in the order you list them. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I DO NOT CHOOSE A HEALTH CARE AGENT? If you become unable to make your own health care decisions and have not named an agent in writing, your physician and other health care providers will ask a family member, friend, or guardian to make decisions for you. In Illinois, a law directs which of these individuals will be consulted. In that law, each of these individua ls is called a \"surrogate.\" There are reasons why you may want to name an agent rather than rely on a surrogate: (i) The person or people listed by this law may not be who you would want to make decisions for you. (ii) Some family members or friends might not be able or willing to make decisions as you would want them to. (iii) Family members and friends may disagree with one another about the best decisions. (iv) Under some circumstances, a surrogate may not be able to make the same kinds of decisions that an agent can make. WHAT IF THERE IS NO ONE AVAILABLE WHOM I TRUST TO BE MY AGENT? In this situation, it is especially important to talk to your physician and other health care providers and create written guidance about what you want or do not want, in case you are ever critically ill and cannot express your own wishes. You can complete a living will. You can also write your wishes down and/or discuss them with your physician or other health care provider and ask him or her to write it down in your chart. You might also want to use written or online resources to guide you through this process. WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS FORM ONCE I COMPLETE IT? Follow these instructions after you have completed the form: (i) Sign the form in front of a witness. See the form for a list of who can and cannot witness it. (ii) Ask the witness to sign it, too. (iii) There is no need to have the form notarized. (iv) Give a copy to your agent and to each of your successor agents. (v) Give another copy to your physician. (vi) Take a copy with you when you go to the hospital. (vii) Show it to your family and friends and others who care for you. Illinois Statutory Short Form Power of Attorney for Health Care (continued) WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND? You may change your mind at any time. If you do, tell someone who is at least 18 years old that you have changed your mind, and/or destroy your document and any copies. If you wish, fill out a new form and make sure everyone you gave the old form to has a copy of the new one, including, but not limited to, your agents and your physicians. WHAT IF I DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS FORM? In the event you do not want to use the Illinois statutory form provided here, any document you complete must be executed by you, designate an agent who is over 18 years of age and not prohibited from serving as your agent, and state the agent's powers, but it need not be witnessed or conform in any other respect to the statutory health care power. If you have questions about the use of any form, you may want to consult your physician, other health care provider, and/or an attorney.

(ii) Agreeing to admit me to or discharge me from any hospital, home, or other institution, including a mental health facility. (iii) Having complete access to my medical and mental health records, and sharing them with others as needed, including after I die. (iv) Carrying out the plans I have already made, or, if I have not done so, making decisions about my body or remains, including organ, tissue or whole body donation, autopsy, cremat ion, and burial. The above grant of power is intended to be as broad as possible so that my agent will have the authority to make any decision I could make to obtain or terminate any type of health care, including withdrawal of nutrition and hydration and other life -sustaining measures. I AUTHORIZE MY AGENT TO (please check any one box): Make decisions for me only when I cannot make them for myself. The physician(s) taking care of me will determine when I lack this ability. (If no box is checked, then the box above shall be implemented.) OR Make decisions for me starting now and continuing after I am no longer able to make them for myself. While I am still able to make my own decisions, I can still do so if I want to. The subject of life -sustaining t reatment is of particular importance. Life -sustaining treatments may include tube feedings or fluids through a tube, breathing machines, and CPR. In general, in making decisions concerning life-sustaining treatment, your agent is instructed to consider the relief of suffering, the quality as well as the possible extension of your life, and your previously expressed wishes. Your agent will weigh the burdens versus benefits of proposed treatments in making decisions on your behalf. Additional statements concerning the withholding or removal of life-sustaining treatment are described below. These can serve as a guide for your agent when making decisions for you. Ask your physician or health care provider if you have any questions about these statements. 504358 (2/15) Page 1 of 2 (2/15) SELECT ONLY ONE STATEMENT BELOW THAT BEST EXPRESSES YOUR WISHES (optional): The quality of my life is more important than the length of my life. If I am unconscious and my attending physician believes, in accordance with reasonable medical standards, that I will not wake up or recover my ability to think, communicate with my family and friends, and experience my surroundings, I do not want treatments to prolong my life or delay my death, but I do want treatment or care to make me comfortable and to relieve me of pain. Staying alive is more important to me, no matter how sick I am, how much I am suffering, the cost of the procedures, or how unlikely my chances for recovery are. I want my life to be prolonged to the greatest extent possible in accordance with reasonable medical standards. SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS TO MY AGENT'S DECISION -MAKING AUTHORITY: The above grant of power is intended to be as broad as possible so that your agent will have the authority to make any decision you could make to obtain or terminate any type of health care.
