Through the perspiration process, acid and waste residue like toxins, sodium, alcohol, nicotine, cholesterol and the potentially carcinogenic heavy metals are removed from the cells (especially zinc, lead, nickel, cadmium, etc). As well as the pores of our skin opening and discharging waste products, the skin sheds any old skin cells, leaving it glowing and immaculately clean, with improved tone, elasticity, texture and colour. Soothing music, cool towels and fruit infusing living water is provided during this therapy. *Exclusive to our Roseville location. 30 MINUTES $30 AYURVEDIC BLISS THERAPY An Ayurvedic Bliss Therapy is a combination of an Ayurvedic Massage, Shirodhara and Herbal Steam Therapy.
