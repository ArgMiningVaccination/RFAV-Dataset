A particularly fun example is [carcinization], the tendency of animals to evolve into crabs. [View attachment 61267] It strikes me that [giant isopods]look quite similar to trilobites; though isopods are much more recent and are not closely related. Size in general is a defense against predators. Once a Carp gets to about 10 pounds there are few fish that can eat them.If it made it to adulthood without the extra segments, surely there must have been more involved in the tradeoffs - otherwise just not growing any bigger would have been an option. I would assume that there must have been other benefits to size as well as the extra gills, even if these allowed it to grow to sizes it could not have otherwise. Since trilobites were probably closer to horseshoe crabs than the modern crabs that might not be the best tasting ramen on the menu.So, you're saying that [trilobite ramen]would have been a trend back in the day? Surprised you didn't also notice the author spelled the name of the creature three different ways: Konickii, Knoickii and Koninckii. Or am I missing some odd rule biologists have about naming variants?Grammar nazi mode: anoxia doesn't mean low oxygen, it means no oxygen. Hypoxia might be preferred. You can have as many gills as you want and anoxia is still going to kill you. Both terms are subtle in that they refer to the oxygen available in the tissues of a creature, not the environment, although there is obviously a relationship. It was spelled correctly the majority of the time, let's grant the author that.Surprised you didn't also notice the author spelled the name of the creature three different ways: Konickii, Knoickii and Koninckii. Or am I missing some odd rule biologists have about naming variants? At the risk of being pedantic, you are erroneously confounding incorrect grammar with incorrect diction. You are simultaneously technically correct and incorrect.Grammar nazi mode: anoxia doesn't mean low oxygen, it means no oxygen. Hypoxia might be preferred.

Maybe not eat, but we have been \"milking\" them for blood for decades. The lysate of their amoebocytes has been an irreplaceable* medicinal test tool for detecting bacterial toxins in practically everything.Since trilobites were probably closer to horseshoe crabs than the modern crabs that might not be the best tasting ramen on the menu. Tangentially, that catch & fillet article you linked tastes like a ChatGPT piece. Please cook up a better link next time ;-)Can You Eat a Horseshoe Crab? [https://catchandfillet.com/can-you-eat-a-horseshoe-crab/] Be careful to not trilobite off more than you can chew?\"Organisms sometimes evolve in a way that protects them against the greatest of multiple dangers.\" When is this 'sometimes' not 'always'? When species go extinct I suppose. Because there's a lot of randomness in the process--the required mutations have to be possible at all, have to occur in the first place, and they have to survive in the population long enough--all in the face of competing demands. Evolution is better at tuning for \"does not kill the organisms\" than \"actually helps them,\" particularly in the short term.\"Organisms sometimes evolve in a way that protects them against the greatest of multiple dangers.\" When is this 'sometimes' not 'always'? Since a trilobite isn't just legs, each body segment with legs has to be able to exchange enough gas to account for its own needs plus some. The more leg segments, the more \"plus some\" can be accommodated.Wouldn't more segments, & therefore body mass, require more oxygen to maintain/fuel? If so I wonder what was the net benefit of more segments & gills? Yeah that's what i'm saying, i think we agree;Because there's a lot of randomness in the process--the required mutations have to be possible at all, have to occur in the first place, and they have to survive in the population long enough--all in the face of competing demands. Evolution is better at tuning for \"does not kill the organisms\" than \"actually helps them,\" particularly in the short term. I'd be wary. Giant isopods usually accompany an appearance of Godzilla.So, you're saying that [trilobite ramen]would have been a trend back in the day? Have another, this time about the one that lived... I mean, the technicians don't look all that stressed...Maybe not eat, but we have been \"milking\" them for blood for decades. The lysate of their amoebocytes has been an irreplaceable* medicinal test tool for detecting bacterial toxins in practically everything. *: it's now being slowly replaced by biosynthesised recombinant factor assays, which is probably quite a lot easier on both the crabs and lab technicians milking them... I think we're making diametrically opposite statements. All creatures have a \"greatest danger\" that they can't defend against, both the extinct and the living ones. Sometimes--usually, even--the \"greatest danger\" in an environment isn't an extinction-level one.Yeah that's what i'm saying, i think we agree; either species always evolve to face the greatest danger or they go extinct there is no 'sometimes' that's compatible with a species survival (otherwise, it's not the greatest danger by definition) Net gain in blood oxygen levels. Segments capture more oxygen than they need, the excess is used by the rest of the body.Wouldn't more segments, & therefore body mass, require more oxygen to maintain/fuel? If so I wonder what was the net benefit of more segments "}
