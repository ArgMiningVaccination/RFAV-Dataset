However, while detoxification helps rid the body of harmful substances, it is not a quick fix. Instead, it is the beginning of a long journey. Substance addiction is a chronic condition that affects people both physically and psychologically. These persons will benefit from detox programs that target their substance use disorders (SUD) and address the major health changes and complications in their brain chemistry that resorts to using drugs. New Directions for Women is a drug rehab center in California that provides a safe environment for women to recover. We understand that each patient's addiction and medical background are unique. Our holistic treatment and patient-specific programs help us meet all patient needs for the best outcome. Our goal is to ensure our patients go through detox safely and effectively. What is a Detox? The body undergoes withdrawal when an addict stops using a drug, whether slowly or abruptly. The body needs a detox period to completely get it out of the system. Long-term dependence on a drug or alcohol changes the patient's brain chemistry, making it dependent on that substance to get a high, euphoric, or relaxed state. Once a person starts using a drug, it creates a dependency on it, especially with continued use. Medical detox is the process of safely ridding the body of abused substances. Depending on the patient's dependency level, mental state, and other co-occurring medical conditions, it can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks. Professional medical detox gives recovering addicts a safe space to rid their system of their preferred substance. They can start healing under the constant supervision of a qualified and compassionate medical team. Therefore, doctors can always diagnose and treat any complications that may arise during the detox program, such as severe withdrawal symptoms. At New Directions for Women, we use evidence-based addiction treatments and therapies for detoxification from substance use. We understand how difficult it is for addicts to stop substance abuse independently. We offer the support and safety needed to ensure a safe medically-assisted detox program. Drugs Needing a Medical Detox Medical detoxification can be a challenging time, even for well-supported patients. But it is the most effective treatment method that provides structure and accountability to help doctors and patients navigate complex situations. While some drugs may require slow, controlled weaning to reduce and stop their dependency, others require patients to use medications during detox to manage their withdrawal symptoms and cravings. 1. Alcohol [Alcohol](https://www.newdirectionsforwomen.org/treatment/alcohol/) is a mind-altering, mood-changing \"drug.\" If consumed excessively over time, it can cause severe withdrawal symptoms when the addict suddenly ceases its use. This is because the addict's [ central nervous system (CNS)](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/central-nervous-system) gets used to releasing endorphins (feel-good hormones) in the brain. Drinking heavily for years and then stopping consuming alcohol suddenly may cause severe withdrawal symptoms, such as: - Headaches - Bodily shaking - Intense restlessness, irritability - Nausea and vomiting - Insomnia or difficulty sleeping - High fever or excess sweating - Severe fatigue In some cases, patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal can have even more intense, life-threatening symptoms, such as: - Delirium - Hallucinations - Seizures Abrupt cessation of high alcohol consumption can be dangerous, possibly life-threatening, and must only be done under medical supervision. 2. Prescription Opioids & Heroin [Opioids](https://www.newdirectionsforwomen.org/treatment/opioids/) and opiates are highly addictive drugs like Fentanyl, OxyContin, and heroin. These drugs bind to specific receptors in the addict's brain, blocking pain while producing a sense of euphoric calm. Addicts that quit these drugs after using them for long periods may experience severe withdrawal symptoms that include: - Severe sweating and/or chills - Nausea and vomiting. - Severe muscle aches and spasms - Rapid heart rate and possible seizures - Stomach cramps and diarrhea - Extreme restlessness and irritability - Intense anxiety - Depressive episodes Most withdrawal symptoms from opioids are not often life-threatening. However, they can be challenging to manage, especially self-detoxing at home, without proper medical assistance. Withdrawal from prescription drug abuse can be so uncomfortable that many recovering addicts revert to the drug. 3. Benzodiazepines [Benzodiazepines](https://www.newdirectionsforwomen.org/treatment/benzodiazepines/) are central nervous system depressants that help patients calm their anxiety and panic. Some common drugs in this category include Valium, Xanax, Ativan, and Klonopin. These drugs increase the effect of [ gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513311/) in the brain. GABA produces feelings of relaxation and calmness. However, as with alcohol and opioids, the body quickly develops a tolerance and dependency to these drugs from continued use. Addicts may experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop using benzodiazepines. These symptoms may include: - Severe headaches - Nausea and vomiting - Muscle spasms and tremors - Sweating and/or chills - Intense restlessness and irritability - Anxiety - Seizures We highly recommend seeking medically-assisted detox support when detoxing from benzo addiction.

How Women Differ in Inpatient Detox Women differ from men in many ways, even dealing with SUD. Addiction in women exposes them to completely different difficulties and experiences, prompting the need to accord them an appropriate detox and treatment plan tailor-fitted to their recovery needs. These include: - Physical and medical issues: women addicts are often exposed to more severe medical and health complications from their addictions. Some common issues may include memory problems, cancer, and organ or system failure. - Mental health disorders: women are also more likely to suffer from co-occurring mental disorders than men, as their addictions are often linked with mental illnesses like anxiety disorders, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Family issues and social stigma: women who suffer from substance abuse disorder are often viewed more negatively than men with the same addiction problem (whether society admits it or not) - Pregnancy and fertility issues: female detox specialists must carefully handle the detoxification of pregnant women by providing round-the-clock monitoring, supervision, and excellent medical care. Medical personnel must take all necessary precautions to protect the mother and unborn child.
