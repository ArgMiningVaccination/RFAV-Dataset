Reproduction prohibited without the written permission of the NRMP.Background The first edition of Charting Outcomes in the Match was published in August 2006 to document how applicant qualific ations affec t success in the Main Residency Match \u00ae. The report was published biennially between 2007 and 2011 and was a collaboration of the National Resident Matching Progra m\u00ae (NRMP\u00ae) and the Association of American Medical Colleges \u00ae (AAMC\u00ae). Match outcome data from the NRMP were combined with applicant characteristics from the AAMC's Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS \u00ae) and United States Medical Li censing Examination (USMLE \u00ae) scores from the AAMC data warehouse. However, starting with the 2014 Main Residency Match, the NRMP adde d a Professional Profile section to its Match registration process to collect the USMLE scores a nd othe r applicant characteristics. NRMP has used those data to independently produce this report since the 2014 version of Charting Outcomes in the Match . In prior years, this report exam ined the Match success of only two applicant groups: senior students from U.S. allopathic medi cal schools and independent applicants. Inde pendent applicants included all applicant types other than U.S. seniors: previous graduates of U . S . allopathic medical schools, students/graduates of osteopathic medical schools, students/graduates of Fifth Pathway programs, students/graduates of Canadian medical schools, and U.S. citize n and non-U.S. citizen students/graduates of international medi cal schools. Because independent appli cants are a heterogeneous group, a decision was made this year to report data separately for U.S. allopathic medical school seniors, students/graduates of osteop athic medical schools, U.S. citi zen students/graduates of inter national medical schools, and non-U.S. citi zen students/graduates of int ernational medical schools. This report examines the character istics o f U.S. allopathic seniors. Data Match success, specialty preference, and ranking information we re collected through the Main Residency Match. The 40 U.S. medical schools receiving the highest total s of National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants were obtaine d from the NIH website. Other a pplican t characteristics, including USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK scores, a cademic degrees, publications, Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society (AOA) membership, and research, work and volunteer experiences, were self-reported through the Professional Profile se ction o f the NRMP's Applicant Registration Form for the Match. To comple te the form, applicants were asked to answer the questions as t hey di d in their ERAS Common Application Form (CAF). Completion of the form was optional, and applicants who completed the form coul d consent or decline to participate in NRMP research. Data collection for the self-reported Profe ssional Profile section was gra nted exemption by the American Institutes for Research (AIR) Institu tional Review Board (IRB). A total of 18,187 U.S. allopathic seniors submitted certified r ank order lists in the 2016 Main Residency Match. After excludi ng the 9.4 percent of U.S. allopathic seniors who did not give consent to participate in NRMP research, 16,484 applicants were included i n the final dataset. Missing data were found in Step 1 scores (2.0% missing ), Step 2 CK scores (4.0%), number of research experiences (14. 6%), number of abstracts, presentati ons, and publications (14.9%), number experiences of volunteer Ph.D. graduate degree (8.8%), and AOA membership (9.3%). To ensure that USMLE Step scores were not misreported, the NRMP asked medical schools to verify the scores of their U.S. senio r students. In 2016, 91 percent of the Step 1 scores and 92 perc ent of the Step 2 CK scores used in this report were verified, corrected, o r supplied by U.S. medical school s. Because the self-reported sco res are highly accurate (the intr acorrelation coefficient (ICC) between the self-reported scores and school-verified scores was 0.981 for S tep 1 scores and 0.978 for Step 2 CK scores), both verified and unverified scores were used to prepare this report. Methods Specialties that offered 50 or more positions in the 2016 Main Residency Match are included in this report. Over the years, ne w specialties have been added to the report, including Otolaryngo logy and Neurology in 2007, Neurological Surgery in 2009, and C hild Neurology and Vascular Surgery in 2014. Transitional Year progra ms were excluded beginning with the 2011 report because they ar e not viewed as a specialty choice. Twelve measures are incorporated in this report. Probability an alysis using a simple logistic regression model was introduced in 2009 to evaluate the relationship between Match success and contiguous ranks and USMLE Step 1 scores. Probability analyses in this rep ort used data on U.S. seniors who participated in the Match in 2014, 201 5, and 2016.

Reproduction prohibited without the written permission of the NRMP.It is important to note that for purposes of this report, Matc h success is defined as a match to the specialty of the applican t's first-ranked program, or \"preferred specialty,\" because that is assumed to be the specialty of choice. Lack of success includes matching to another specialty as well as failure to match at all. No distincti on was made based on whether applicants matched to the first, second, third, or last choice program. Summary Some general observations apply to all specialties in this repo rt. U.S. allopathic seniors who are successful in matching to t heir preferre d specialty are more likely to: Rank more programs within their preferred specialty Have higher USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 scores Be members of Alpha Omega Alpha Although other measures seem to be related to Match success for some specialties, the relati onships are not consistent enough to draw broad conclusions across specialties. In addition, the data sou rces used for Charting Outcomes in the Match do not include othe r important applicant factors such as course evaluations, reference letters, and the Medical School Performance Evaluation (MSPE ). Despite the fairly strong relationship between USMLE Step score s and Match success, the distributions of scores show that prog ram directors consider other qualifications. A high score is not a guarantee of success, and a lower score is not a bar to succes s. Even in the most competitive specialties a few individuals with higher scor es are not successful. In the less competitive specialties, U.S . seniors with scores slightly above passing usually match to their preferred specialties. The data also are reassuring because they indicate that at leas t some programs do not employ an a rbitrary cutoff or decline to consider applicants with less th an excellent test performance. The data in this report support the following straightforward advice one should give to an applicant: Rank all of the programs you really want, without regard to you r estimate of your chances with those programs. Include a mix of both highly competitive and less competitive p rograms within your preferred specialty. Include all of the programs on your list where the program has expressed an interest in you and where you would accept a position. If you are applying to a competitive specialty and you want to have a residency position in the event you are unsuccessful i n matching to a program in your preferred specialty, also rank yo ur most preferred programs in an alternate specialty. Include all of your qualifications in your application, but kno w that you do not have to be AOA, have the highest USMLE scores, have publications, or have participated in research pro jects to match successfully. Program directors and applicants will find the tables and chart s for the specialty of their particular interest later in this report.

To quantify thi s aspect of applicant behavior, we tallied the number of programs ranked in the first-choice specialty before a program in another specialty appeared on the applicant's rank order list ( contiguous ranks). Chart 4 displays the median num ber of contiguous ranks by prefe rred specialty for U.S. allopathic seniors who matched an d did not match to their preferred specialty. The chart shows con siderable variation across the specialties for U.S. seniors. Neurological Surgery had the longest average contiguous rank list (16) for matched U.S. seniors and Dermatology had the shortest (8). For all specialties, U.S. seniors who matched to their preferred specialty had m edian contiguous rank lists tha t were longer than those of U.S. seniors who did not match. The principal message of these gr aphs is that applicants with longer rank order lists are more successful than those with shor ter ones. The NRMP has been recommending longer lists for many year s, but some applicants apparently do not heed the advice. Others may have shorter lists because they found only a few pro grams willing to entertain their applications or because they could not afford a large number of interview trips.

Although such knowl edge is only one facet of applicant qualifications considered by program directors in their selection process, a Step 1 score is the only qualification that is universally available for al l applicants during the interview season and prior to the NRMP's ranking deadline. Overall, U.S. allopathic seniors who matched to their preferred specialty have mean USMLE Step 1 scores of 233.2 (s.d. = 17.4), well above the 2016 minimu m passing score of 192.

Three-quarters (75.8%) of U.S. seniors reported work experiences, with an average of 3.2 work experiences for all U.S. seniors. Differences in mean number of work experiences are small in most specialties. Copyright \u00a92016 NRMP.

AOA membership is limited to students in medical s chools that sponsor an AOA chapter. Most, but not all, allopathic schools in the United States participate. An analysis of its relationship with success in the Match is limited by t he relatively small number of applicants who are members, by the f act that some schools do not have AOA chapters, and by the fact that other schools elect AOA members too late in the acade mic year for it to be considered in the application process. Data on AOA membership are self-reported. Overall, 16.9 percent of U.S. seniors included in this report claimed AO A membership. Among applicants who matched to their preferred spe cialty, 17.5 percent reported AOA membership, compared to 12.6 percent of unmatched applicants. As with several of the other measures, the most competitive specialties are able to attract the greatest proportion of AO A members. All specialties attract some AOA applicants, but for m ost specialties AOA members account for fewer than one in four successful applicants. Copyright \u00a92016 NRMP.
