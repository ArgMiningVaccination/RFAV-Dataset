In patients with ischemic stroke, motor and sensory impairments are common and are associated with functional disability. Conventional physiotherapy (CP) is the primary modality of rehabilitation for post-stroke sensorimotor dysfunction. Ayurveda is a commonly practiced alternative system of medicine that offers unique rehabilitative measures for post-stroke recovery. We hypothesize that Ayurvedic rehabilitative treatment (ART) is superior to similar duration CP in improving the sensorimotor recovery of patients with ischemic stroke at 90 days after enrollment. AyuRvedic TrEatment in the Rehabilitation of Ischemic STrOke Patients in India: A Randomized controllEd trial (RESTORE) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-arm, blinded outcome assessment trial being conducted under the Indian Stroke Clinical Trial (INSTRuCT) Network across the four comprehensive stroke centers in India. Consecutive hemodynamically stable adult patients with their first acute ischemic stroke between 1 and 3 months from stroke onset are being randomized (1:1) into two treatment groups to receive either 1 month of ART or 1 month of CP. The primary outcome measure is the Fugl Meyer Assessment-upper extremity for physical performance at 90 days. The secondary outcomes are the modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Berg Balance, and SF-36 at 90 days. The safety outcomes include a composite of irreversible morbidity and mortality. A sample size of 140 (70 in each group) patients with ischemic stroke will allow us to detect a minimal clinical important difference of 9.4 (standard deviation) with superiority margin of 5, an attrition rate of 10%, alpha of 5%, and power of 80%. This randomized trial will systematically assess the efficacy and safety of traditional ART compared to CP. The trial has been registered in the Clinical Trial Registry India (CTRI/2018/04/013379).", "sitename": "Karger Publishers", "date": "2023-04-06", "cleaned_text": "Abstract In patients with ischemic stroke, motor and sensory impairments are common and are associated with functional disability.
