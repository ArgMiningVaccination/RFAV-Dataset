Lori From New York, NY \"It was if all of the kindness that I had given throughout my entire life were repaid to me during my 7 day retreat.\" Margaret From St. Pete, FL I was so stressed from work that I chose Ayurveda Health Retreat almost as a drowning man would a life rope. I was stressed and in physical and mental pain and desperate. I am amazed at the rejuvenation the past 5 days has given me. I wouldn't have believed so many changes were possible so quickly. I feel reborn and I will definitely be back again and again. "}
