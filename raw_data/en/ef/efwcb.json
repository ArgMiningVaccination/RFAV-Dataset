A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. Task 3 In contemporary society modern medicine usually takes on a curative role, it attempts to cure. Complementary therapy however takes on a very different role; it is used to maintain wellbeing and health as well as a helping to restore wellbeing to before illness or poor health. These therapies are usually used in conjunction with modern medicine. This is usually to relieve symptoms that traditional medicine fails to help with or to boost a person's emotional or physical health. An Art of Balance: The Role of Holistic Medicine in Modern Healthcare By: Alex C. Thau Bioethics 4242 12/3/16 Over the last 10,000 years, humans have evolved more than any other species that has ever set foot on planet Earth. As a population we have grown exponentially and made changes to our society that allow us to do things that have not been done before. In 1878, Thomas Edison recognized the ability of a bamboo filament that was connected to platina wires, to burn for significant periods of time: resulting in the first formation of the light bulb. Suddenly, the human race no longer had to endure the darkness that each night brought at the end of a 12-hour light period. Today we have alternative medicine which was developed thousands of years ago and have a long-standing historical value of effectiveness, advantages, and some drawbacks. Diagnosis was the first approach to any illness. Alternative medicine looks at the factors of equilibrium and the environment in which one lives and the disease is considered an imbalance between the two; cleansing the whole body than on a particular problem to get the balance back in sync. Very much the description of the Buddhist and the Greek cultures of medicine and healing the There are still many people on both sides of the spectrum that are skeptical about treatment methods that differ from what they are used to. The validity of an herbal healer in the western world is more likely to be questioned than that of a medical doctor; while in the east, families may have been seeing a healer for decades and are more likely to question the validity of a doctor practicing western Dr. Tieraona Low Dog, Fellowship Director, Arizona Center For Integrative Medicine explains how we want to expose clinicians to a broader way of seeing the patient a deeper understanding of healing and a larger toolbox from which to choose for therapies. She talks about how if patients were treated with different procedures such as acupuncture or holistic healing, we as consumers would not have to pay out so much on treatment. Procedures such as these would actually benefit us because we would not need to see doctors nearly as much as we do now, because we would not be \"treating\" the diseases with chemicals (pharmaceutical drugs) which have many side effects. Also, the pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies would never let this happen because then they would be out of money because people would not have to see their doctors nearly as much in hence means that these \"cattle runners\" would not be making the money they are. Do not exhaust all other options before determining if you can benefit from natural medicine. Conventional medicine is not always the best option, but of course, your doctor is not going to tell you about natural ways to cure common health problems because the medical community is groomed throughout their education to over-prescribe. Then, once Because there is not a treatment for all modern diseases, it is not necessarily classified as a reliable source for the population, for now. Holistic medication is often prominent in other countries throughout the world and is currently spreading in the United States. It is often said in lesser-developed countries that \"'if there's a disease on this earth, then there's a cure for it somewhere in nature'\"(Krivyanski). Similar to the modern medical industry today, they are still trying to find cures for cancer, newfound diseases, etc. and the same can be said for holistic medications. Though the country had started out with this way of life, it got overshadowed and lost in the sea of advancement, but now that people are not content with the uncontrollable medical field, they're drifting back to old ways. Similar to scientific researchers finding new cures for the future, holistic doctors have to dig up old cures from the Holistic healing aims at improving the health of both mind and body. Rather than simply masking pain like traditional medicine, a holistic approach targets multiple aspects of one's being, so healing can occur naturally. At Center for Extraordinary Outcomes in Phoenix, AZ, the expert holistic therapist, Victoria Benoit, M.C., helps people live well again. Changes in Treatments: A Historical Perspective Word Count Introduction Health is a field of science that is constantly changing, whether it's referring to what we believe to be healthy or what we do to improve our own health. The way we treat illnesses is a good example to show how health has changed throughout history. Traditional medical practices did not rely on the advanced technology that our practices rely on today. Traditional medicinal practices relied on herbalism, or the use of herbs that were found in the nearby area. Herbs were used to make products that were used to cure illnesses or for therapeutic purposes. According to a 2007 survey, the use of herbal medicines is still seen today in about forty Holistic Medicine Holistic Medicine, commonly referred to as \"Alternative Medicine\", is a vast and rapidly growing new scientific field. It is derived mainly from ancient, traditional methods of healing that have often been practiced in the East for centuries. These include a variety of techniques from herbal healing to acupuncture to homeopathy to energy channeling. Due to the large number of methods that are covered by the term, there are various definitions of Holistic Medicine. However, all literature seems to agree that Alternative Medicine, is exactly what the name suggests: an 'alternative' approach to healing and medicine. It is a more personal move toward health care, which attempts to connect the mind, body and spirit. The population is aging. The older population has grown discontented with traditional medicine methods and they look for alternative ways to treat their aches and pains. Holistic healing is a method that has gained tremendous acceptance across the country and the world. Holistic medicine is concerned about treating the entire person. Therefore, their methods might center on paying stronger attention to the body and mind connection. However, it is important to understand that Holistic Healing centers vary. Some of the centers might specialize in Chinese traditional medicine or another method. II. Herbal medicine has been used for many, many years and is a great natural alternative to modern medicine. Most patients now prefer herbal medicine as compared to medicinal drugs. They are becoming popular to treat everything from minor to major to diseases. The reason why people are so into herbal medicine is because of their natural qualities that promote a healthy method of healing various products. These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
