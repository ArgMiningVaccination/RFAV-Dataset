Ayurvedic understanding of digestion is based on the strength of Agni or digestive fire. It also suggests the use of herbs and spices to boost the function of the digestive system. How does ayurveda view indigestion? Digestive problems are the most common reasons why people seek medical advice. Ayurvedic understanding of digestion is based on the strength of the digestive fire, known as Agni. Composed of various enzymes and acids, Agni is seated inside the lower stomach and small intestine and relates to Pitta dosha. Ayurveda views indigestion as a key factor for all diseases. Ayurveda refers to individual general digestive capabilities in reference to Agni. While it's common to use terms such as Agni and \"digestive fire\" interchangeably, there are actually a total of 13 distinct Agnis regulating all metabolic functions of the human body. Any procedure involving heat, light, transformation, and conversion relates to Agni. On a worldwide scale, Agni is the creative fire of intellect that's present in all life. After an individual's present Doshic condition, Agni is the most significant element in determining dietary needs. It's a readily observable truth that most of us digest food differently. One person may gleam with satisfaction after a meal, while the other individual could clutch his stomach in agony after eating precisely the same thing. The digestive system breaks down food into basic components for cells to use for energy, building materials & catalysts- life depends on it. Ayurveda describes digestive health imbalances as the root cause of most major diseases. Research has established that a major part of the immune system is located in the gut - GALT gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the prominent part of mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and represents almost 70% of the entire immune system. The digestive system has its own autonomous nervous system - enteric nervous system- that has more number of neurons than the brain. Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of the mind and sense organs in the proper functioning of the digestive system. The human intestines harbor ten times more bacteria than there are cells in the body - concept of Gut flora & intestinal dysbiosis leading to the leaky gut syndrome [See: Bananas for heartburn & acid reflux](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/bananas-for-heartburn-acid-reflux) Gut and Immune Function: Chewing in the mouth stimulates the parotid glands to release hormones that stimulate the thymus to produce T lymphocytes, which are the core of the protective immune system. Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) is located in the lining of the digestive tract and intestinal mucosa. If an antigen (foreign substance/allergen) enters the digestive tract, specialized cells called M-cells carry the antigen to the lining of the tract. [See: Baking soda for heartburn & acid reflux](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/baking-soda-for-heartburn-acid-reflux) Specialized cells (Peyer's patches) in the intestinal lining check them out. These cells alert the B & T lymphocytes, which then carry the antigens to the intestinal mucosa, where they are ingested by macrophages. Secretory IgA, present in the gut mucosa, signal cytokines to begin the inflammatory process designed to rid the body of antigenic materials. Agni & concept of digestion Concept of Digestion The digestive system is self-running and self-healing. Its function is to breakdown complex food into assimilative microscopic particles that cells use for energy, maintenance, growth, and repair. The digestive tract is a 25-35 foot hose that runs from the mouth to anus. The ingested food is squeezed through this tract by rhythmic muscular contraction called peristalsis. Along the way, the body breaks down food- carbohydrates into glucose, proteins into amino acids & fats into fatty acids & glycerol- unblocked flow of nutrients is critical for optimal health & function. You aren't just what you eat but also what you digest, absorb, assimilate, and eliminate. [See: Essential oils for heartburn & acid reflux relief](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/essential-oils-for-heartburn-acid-reflux-relief) In accordance with Ayurveda, Agni is a source of life. 'Agni' is a Sanskrit word that refers to fire and connotes the Vedic fire god of Hinduism. According to Vedic civilization, an ancient Indian civilization, fire is essential for the warmth and light it provides and for its ability to cook meals. Agni is also considered to be one of the five building blocks that form the world. In the context of health, 'Agni' describes digestive fire or the capacity of the body to digest food. Ayurveda considers that Agni is among the most effective tools required for the correct functioning of the body. [See: GERD Diet Plan To Prevent Heartburn](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/gerd-diet-plan-to-prevent-heartburn) Specifically, Ayurveda considers that Agni has an essential role in balancing your health. Balanced Agni can help you attain a healthy, happy, and long life, whereas impaired Agni contributes to diseases. Ayurveda creates awareness of our body and mind that may help us heal. When we know the nature of sacred fire and its importance in maintaining harmony with the world, we can better comprehend the potent healing force of digestive fire. In Ayurveda, Agni is the digestive fire in our own bodies, which determines the condition of our health. Our Agni is located inside the lower stomach and small intestine that contains acids and enzymes. The notion of Agni is closely linked to the digestion of food, which only indicates the ability of your body to metabolize food and nutrients into energy, which sustains life. Our Agni is powerful when we have healthy digestion. A healthy digestive system contributes to well-balanced Agni, which in turn will help to support overall wellbeing. Why is Agni Important? According to Ayurveda, Agni has a close relationship with your physiological physique, also called Prakriti. Ayurveda posits that you're comprised of three distinct sorts of doshas or energies, namely Vata (air), Pitta (fire), and Kapha (water). Ayurveda believes your Agni is dependent upon your dosha type. [See: Home Remedies for Heartburn](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/home-remedies-for-heartburn) All you take in through your body, whether that be food and drink or the stimuli around you, such as discussions, sights, and other information, must be processed and digested. As we go through life, we're continually bombarded with outside stimulation and other influences that we have to deal with. For balance, your body and head must process each new thing that it receives. [See: Home Remedies For Indigestion Relief](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/natural-home-remedies-for-indigestion-relief) When you eat food or drink, it engages the Agni in the body. Accumulated toxins, undigested food, and digestive tract diseases can elevate the quantity of digestive fire in your body, which could have a negative impact on your wellbeing. When you know your Agni and learn how to balance it, you will experience healthful digestion, excellent flow, and a clear mind. To prevent or overcome ailments, you should learn how to encourage the healing power of Agni. Well-balanced Agni will cause a healthy mind and body and supply a natural glow to your skin and sparkle to your eyes. Healthy Agni may also help resolve gut and bowel problems in the body. You will need to support and nurture your Agni for optimal health. Functions of Agni Agni or digestive fire supports many important digestive processes: - Supports digestion and absorption - Creates healthy digestive enzymes - Enhances metabolism - Offers nourishment to the body's cells - Offers energy and strength - Promotes mental clarity and awareness - Results in good health and longevity Types of Agni Agni is the term used in Ayurveda for fire. In terms of human physiology, agni refers to the broad classification of digestive fire and metabolic factors that include gastric juice & enzymes for digestion and metabolism at systemic and cellular levels. Charaka Samhita classifies agni into 13 types based on their function. - JATHARAGNI - BHUTAGNI - 5 types based on Pancha maha bhuta (5 basic elements) - DHATVAGNI - 7 types based on Sapta dhatus (7 basic tissues of the body) [See: Is yogurt good for acid reflux & heartburn](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/is-yogurt-good-for-acid-reflux-heartburn) Importance of agni - Food provides nourishment to all tissues of the body and maintains the vital energy (Ojas) required for sustenance of life. Agni plays a vital role in this connection as the transformation of ingested food into body tissues can only happen with optimal digestion, absorption, assimilation, and excretion. Primary anatomical location: Midsection of the body in the gut (KOSHTA) where the stomach, duodenum, liver, and small intestines are located, also referred to as the 'Pitta sthana or grahani'. It could be correlated to the digestive enzymes of the digestive tract. Main function: Process of transformation of complex food nutrients into simpler form for absorption into the intestinal wall and bloodstream Agni is responsible for transforming heterogeneous elements in the food ingredients into homologous elements for permeability through the intestinal mucosa (villi and microvilli). Jatharagni is the chief among all categories of agni because bhutagni and dhatvagni are dependent on it. Aggravation or diminution of the jatharagni results in aggravation and diminution of other agni types as well. Wholesome food and drinks should be taken to carefully maintain the jatharagni because the life and strength of an individual are dependent on it. \"Just like the fire placed below the vessel helps cook the food in it, so does the agni in the amashaya digests food and produces rasa and mala\" - Bhutagni: This refers to the agni inherent in the five basic elements (pancha maha bhuta). - Parthivagni - inherent agni in element earth - Apyagni - inherent agni in element water - Taijasagni - inherent agni in element fire - Vayavagni - inherent agni in element air - Akashagni - inherent agni in element ether/space See: [Functional Medicine For GERD](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/functional-medicine-for-gerd) These five agnis are inherent in the food ingredients and get stimulated and activated by the jatharagni in the gastrointestinal tract. The bhutagni, during digestion, disintegrates the mahabhuta (carbohydrates, proteins, fats etc.) in the food ingredients and manifest their respective qualities (guns). The ingredients and its attributes or qualities in food are heterogeneous (in the non-assimilative form) prior to bhutagni paka (digestion). It becomes homologous (in the assimilative form) after bhutagni and jatharagni paka (digestion). The body takes up the qualities of the food that is ingested. If you eat a healthy and balanced diet, you get a healthy and balanced body. - Dhatagni: This refers to the inherent agni in the 7 basic tissues (dhatu) of the body, as described in Ayurveda. The seven tissues are Rasa, Rakta, Mamsa, Medas, Asthi, Majja, and Shukra. This concept explains cellular metabolism and tissue growth. Agni based on the dominance of dosha: Based on the tridosha dominance (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha), agni is classified as Sama agni and Vikrita agni. - Samagni - balanced state of tridosha - Vikritaagni is of 3 types: - Teekshnagni - the predominance of Pitta - Mandagni the of [Homeopathy For GERD](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/homeopathy-for-gerd) Can you balance your Agni?
