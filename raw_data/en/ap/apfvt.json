Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California's oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorousundergraduate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, education, engineering, coun- seling psychology, law, and pastoral ministries. The University boasts a diverse communityof scholars characterized by small classes and a values-oriented curriculum and is dedicated to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The traditions of Jesuit education\u2014educating the whole person for a life of service\u2014run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs. Santa Clara University is perennially ranked among the top comprehensive universities by U.S. News & World Report. SCU has one of the highest graduation rates for undergrad- uate students among all comprehensive universities. The University has a national reputa-tion for its undergraduate program that features a distinctive core curriculum, an integratedlearning envir onment, and r esearch oppor tunities for undergraduate students. The MBA program in the Leavey School of Business is annually ranked in the top 20 among the nation's part-time programs and in the top five in California. The School of Law is rankedin the top 100 of the nation 's law schools with its intellectual property program recognized among the top 10 of such programs in the country. The U niversity was established as Santa Clara College on the site of the Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally operated as a preparatory school and did not offer courses of collegiate rank until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. O ne-thir d of the students w ere enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college's preparatory and high school departments. Santa Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added.In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business began in 1926 and, within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the countr y to r eceive national accr editation. For 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admissions explosion\u2014from 1,500 students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began thelargest building program in school history, building eight residence halls, a student union,and an athletic stadium. In the early 1970s, the Board of T rustees voted to limit the sizeof the undergraduate population, an action that was intended to pr eserve the character and ensure the quality of the University for generations to come. In 1985, the University adopted \"Santa Clara University\" as its official name. 1SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 3 Commitment to Students. As teachers and scholars, mentors and facilitators, we nurture and challenge students as we help them become independent learners and responsible lead-ers in society. Service to Others. We promote throughout the University a culture of service\u2014service not only to those who study and work at Santa Clara but also to society in general and to its mostdisadvantaged members. Community and Diversity. We cherish our diverse community and the roots that must sustain it: shared values amidst diversity, close personal relationships, effective communica-tion, respect for others, and an engaged concern for the common good of the campus, the local community, and the global society. Jesuit Distinctiveness. We preserve and renew the Jesuit tradition that incorporates all of these core values. Our tradition is an expression of Christian humanism in which faith andreason together animate the most fundamental human quest: the pursuit of truth and good-ness. This pursuit challenges us to counter inhumanity with humanity, to act ethically, andto promote justice with faith. We also take part in the broader Catholic tradition to whichJesuits have made a major contribution.

The Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, S.J., Solidarity Program offers students, faculty, staff, and alumni immersionexperiences in the reality of our globalizing world. 2 The Santa Clara Undergraduate Program Santa Clara University is committed to the education of the whole person in the Jesuit and Catholic tradition with a vision of developing men and women to be leaders of com- petence, conscience, and compassion. The Santa Clara undergraduate program is designedfor students who seek an integrated education with a strong humanistic orientation in a primarily residential setting. An integrated education is one that encourages students to seek connections between differing ways of knowing and being in the world, between differentforms of knowledge within established disciplines, and between new knowledge and thatwhich preceded it. Santa Clara 's concept of the \"whole person\" inevitably embraces our social nature. When he inaugurated Santa Clara's sesquicentennial year, Father Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, superior general of the Society of Jesus, noted that \"Tomorrow's 'whole person' cannot be wholewithout an educated awareness of society and culture with which to contribute socially,generously, in the real world.\" Calling for a new Jesuit educational standard, \"to educate thewhole person of solidarity in the real world,\" he explained: \"Students, in the course of theirformation, must let the gritty r eality of this world into their liv es, so they can learn to feel it, think about it critically, respond to its suffering, and engage in it constructively. They should learn to perceive, think, judge, choose, and act for the rights of others, especially thedisadv antaged and the oppressed.\" The S anta Clara undergraduate pr ogram offers a curriculum and other learning experi - ences whose content and pattern combine the acquisition and cr eation of kno wledge with the quest for meaning and purpose. The learning environment encourages students to make connections acr oss the Cor e Curriculum, the academic major, and elective courses. It helps students relate their classroom learning with out-of-classroom learning through community- based education, R esidential Learning Communities, student organizations, athletics and recreation, and other experiences. In a more general way, the undergraduate program nur-tures students' ability to knit the intellectual, social, moral, spiritual, creative, and behavioralaspects of life into a coherent and meaningful whole.

THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 9 Habits of Mind and Heart To contribute to a rapidly changing, complex, and interdependent world, students must develop ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that allow them to educate themselves for therest of their lives with passion and purpose. By attending to the cognitive and affective di-mensions of human experience, the Core Curriculum enables students to think more deeply,imagine more freely, and communicate more clearly. Engagement with the World To engage with the world in meaningful ways, students need opportunities to explore and refine self-knowledge in relation to others. The Core Curriculum enhances students' un-derstanding of the integrity of their own lives and the dignity inherent in the lives of oth-ers, especially the impoverished, suffering, and marginalized. The goals within each broad category are listed in the table below. Student Learning Goals in the Core Curriculum8 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The School of Engineering offers majors in civil engineering, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, engineering, mechanical engineering, and Web design and engineering. A wide range of departmental and school minors, emphases in majors, and concentrations in degree programs are available to enhance the major field of study for students. Consistent with the commitment to an integrated educational experience, interdisciplinary minors are offered in Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern studies; Asian studies; biomedical engineering; biotechnology; Catholic studies; international studies;Medieval and Renaissance studies; musical theatre; retail studies; science, technology, and society; and urban education. THE SANTA CLARA CORE CURRICULUM A university expresses its most basic values in its core curriculum, the part of an under- graduate education required of all students. Santa Clara University is implementing a newCore Curriculum in 2009, building on the strengths of the former Core Curriculum. SantaClara's new Core Curriculum explicitly integrates three traditions of higher education. Asa Catholic university, Santa Clara is rooted in the tradition of pursuing an understandingof God through the free exercise of reason. As a Jesuit university, Santa Clara promotes a hu-manistic education that leads toward an ethical engagement with the world. As a compre-hensive American university committed to liberal education, Santa Clara seeks to prepareits students for intelligent, responsible, and creative citizenship. Reflecting these three traditions, the Core Curriculum provides every undergraduate with the common learning that all students need to become leaders of competence, con - science, and compassion. The distinctiveness of a Santa Clara education emerges in the Core Curriculum, both in its sense of purpose rooted in the University's traditions and in its commitment to abreadth of learning that complements and suppor ts all majors. The Cor e Curriculum opens students to the study and practice of the ar ts, humanities, mathematics, technology, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. It educates students for an ethically informed par-ticipation in civic life, emplo ying experiential learning to form compassionate women and men attentive to human suffering. Reflecting the University's founding mission, the Core Curriculum includes a disciplined and critical r eflection on the r eligious dimensions of human existence. I n addition, because the Cor e Curriculum continually highlights the crit - ical and compelling questions facing individuals and communities, the Core Curriculum supports students not only in making professional career choices but also in discerning theirlarger v ocation\u2014their life 's purpose in the world. Learning G oals: What will students lear n in the Cor e Curriculum? Because a liberal education in the Jesuit tradition is oriented toward particular ends, the Core Curriculum affirms a set of central learning goals. These goals are divided among three broad categories\u2014Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World. Knowledge To be prepared for well-informed engagement in society, students must comprehend the forces that have shaped the world they have inherited and the ways the world is interpretedand understood. They must also understand how they might transform the world for the bet-ter. The Core Curriculum deepens the students' knowledge of the most profound ideas andways of knowing that emerge from the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences.Knowledge Habits of Mind and Heart Engagement with the World Global Cultures: The intertwined development of global cultures,including Western cultures, ideas,institutions, and religions Arts and Humanities: The production, interpretation, andsocial influence of the fine andperforming arts, history, languages, literatures, philosophy,and religion Scientific Inquiry: The principles of scientific inquiry and how theyare applied in the natural and social sciences Science and T echnology: The formative influences, dynamics,social impacts, and ethical conse-quences of scientific and techno-logical development Diversity: Diverse human experi- ences, identities, and cultureswithin local and global societies,especially as formed by relations ofpower and privilege Civic Life: The roles, rights, and responsibilities of citizens and institutions in societies and in theworldCritical Thinking: The ability to identify, reflect upon, evaluate, in-tegrate, and apply different typesof information and knowledge toform independent judgments Mathematics and Quantitative Reasoning: Analytical and logical thinking and the habit of drawingconclusions based on quantitativeinformation Complexity: An approach to un- derstanding the world that appreciates ambiguity and nuanceas well as clarity and precision Ethical Reasoning: Drawing on ethical traditions to assess the consequences of individual andinstitutional decisions Religious Reflection: Question- ing and clarifying beliefs throughcritical inquiry into faith and thereligious dimensions of humanexistence Communication: Interacting effectively with different audi- ences, especially through writing,speech, and a second languagePerspective: Seeking out the experience of different culturesand people, striving to view theworld through their eyes Collaboration: The capacity to collaborate intellectually and creatively with diverse people Social Justice: Developing a disciplined sensibility toward thecauses of human suffering andmisery, and a sense of responsibil-ity for addressing them Civic Engagement: Addressing major contemporary social issues,including environmental sustain-ability and peaceful resolution ofconflict, by participating actively as an informed citizen of societyand the world THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 11 Checklist of Core Curriculum Courses Some courses have prerequisites or must be taken in specific sequences. See the Core Curriculum Web site. Integrations courses can fulfill more than one set of requirements in a single course. Most Cor e Curriculum courses, with a fe w exceptions, are 4- or 5-unit courses. Learning objectiv es for each area of the Core Curriculum are posted on the Core Curriculum Web site. The Core Curriculum and the College of Arts and Sciences Students in the College of Arts and Sciences should consult Chapter 3 for the require- ments for their majors. There are no additional college-wide requirements beyond the re- quirements for the U niversity Cor e Curriculum. The Cor e Curriculum and the Leav ey School of B usiness Leavey School of Business requirements determine how students in the business school satisfy some U niversity Cor e Curriculum requirements. Some Core Curriculum require- ments must be fulfilled with specific courses. Students in the Leavey School of Business should consult Chapter 4 for the complete list of requirements for the majors and the school.10 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Each course in the Core Curriculum addresses at least three of these learning goals. Stu- dents have multiple opportunities to encounter, practice, and master each learning goal.Specific learning objectives for each area of the Core Curriculum have been developed by faculty Core Curriculum committees. These learning objectives describe the knowledge, skills, and values students will be able to demonstrate after completing the courses in theCore Curriculum. The learning objectives are posted on the Core Curriculum Web site. The Curriculum: What courses will students take in the Core Curriculum? The Core Curriculum consists of two phases of coursework designed to foster develop- mental learning and curricular coherence. The first phase, Foundations, consists of courses normally taken in the first year that introduce students to the process and expectations foruniversity-level education: Cultures and Ideas, Critical Thinking and Writing, Mathemat-ics, a second language, and the first course in Religion, Theology, and Culture. This phasehelps students begin to set their own goals for learning, preparing them to make thought- ful choices in the Core Curriculum, their majors, and co-curricular activities. The second phase, Explorations, includes courses that expand students' understanding of a broad range of knowledge and abilities needed for effective participation in contemporarylife. These courses include Ethics, Civic Engagement, Diversity, the Arts, Natural Science (with lab), S ocial Science, a third Cultures and Ideas class with a global focus, a course in Science, Technology, and Society, and two additional courses in Religion, Theology, and Cul-ture. Some Explorations courses have prerequisites or must be taken in specific sequences. The Core Curriculum also includes Integrations that help students make connections among courses in the cor e curriculum and between the Core Curriculum and the major. Integrations are not additional courses. Rather, they are components of other courses. One Integrations course includes an experiential learning element oriented toward issues of jus- tice. One course involves an advanced writing component. Students also link a set of CoreCurriculum, major , or electiv e courses into an interdisciplinary Pathway. The Pathways fos- ter integrative, intentional learning, providing opportunities for undergraduate research, complementing the majors, and encouraging the application of knowledge in the world.Pathways focus on any one of a wide range of themes including Sustainability; Democracy;Vocation; American Studies; Food, Hunger and Poverty; Justice and the Arts; Race, Placeand Social Inequalities; Gender, Sexuality and the Body; and Global Health. Foundations Explorations Integrations Experiential Learning for Social Justice Advanced WritingPathway Students in the School of Engineering take three Pathways courses or 12 units in at leasttwo different disciplines. Students in the College of Artsand Sciences and the LeaveySchool of Business take fourPathways courses or 16 units inat least two different disciplines. Integrations are usually not additional courses. They are usually components of othercourses.Critical Thinking and Writing 1 Critical Thinking and Writing 2Cultures and Ideas 1Cultures and Ideas 2 Second Language MathematicsReligion, Theology, and Culture 1Ethics Civic Engagement DiversityArts Social Science Natural ScienceReligion, Theology, and Culture 2Cultures and Ideas 3Science, Technology, and SocietyReligion, Theology, and Culture 3 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 13 Checklist of Core Curriculum Courses for Students in the School of Engineering For students in the School of E ngineering, some F oundations and E xplorations courses fulfill two sets of r equire- ments in a single course.

The University Honors Program is allied with the Office of Student Fellowships,which helps prepare students to compete for nationally competitive graduate fellowships, such as Rhodes, Marshall, Fulbright, Mitchell, Goldwater, Udall, Jack Kent Cooke, and Gates Cambridge. A competitive annual award permits one Honors Program student tospend his or her junior year at Mansfield College, Oxford University. Courses offered through the University Honors Program can be found in Chapter 6 under Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study. LEAD SCHOLARS PROGRAM The LEAD (Leadership, Excellence, and Academic Development) Scholars Program provides, for selected first-generation University students, a smooth transition to life at SantaClara. Participation in the program is by invitation. LEAD scholars are selected from amongthose awarded a grant or scholarship by Santa Clara University. The LEAD Scholars Pro-gram forms a community of undergraduate peers and faculty dedicated to rigorous aca-demic achievement and student leadership. The program involves support as well aschallenge throughout the four years, with a special emphasis on the first-year experience. TheLEAD Scholars Program is committed to fostering an atmosphere of successful scholar-ship, community engagement, and service. Social and academic programs include semi-nars, academic advising and support, peer mentoring, team building, and outreach tofamilies. All LEAD Scholars participate in LEAD Week, which is scheduled for the weekimmediately preceding the beginning of the fall term. INTERNA TIONAL PROGRAMS Santa Clara University aspires to create a learning community that promotes competence, conscience, and compassion among students with a mandate to pursue scholarly under-standing and constr uctive engagement with the world. As the principal U niversity-wide organization focusing on international, inter cultural, and global subjects, International Pro- grams provides a variety of academic settings and learning opportunities around the worldthrough study abr oad offerings. Academically the approach is both interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary and recognizes that learning takes place in the classroom, in the field, in the community , and in ser vice to others. I nternational Programs appreciates that intercul- tural competence and kno wledge of the global envir onment should not be limited to the humanities or social sciences, but is relevant to business, engineering, and the natural sci- ences as well. While International Programs' mission is informed by a variety of disciplinesand vie wpoints, it is inspir ed by the challenge offer ed by martyred Salvadorian Jesuit Igna- cio Ellacuria: We, as an intellectual community , must analyz e causes; use imagination and cr eativity together to discover remedies; com- municate to our public a consciousness that inspires the freedomof self-determination; educate professionals with a conscience,who will be immediate instruments of transformation; and con-tinually hone an educational institution that is academicallyexcellent and ethically oriented. Undergraduate students can choose from a variety of study abroad programs in over 100 locations, including Santa Clara's own programs, several direct exchange programs, andTHE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 15 RESIDENTIAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES The Residential Learning Communities were established to further the goal of fostering integrated education within a community of scholars. By creating a culture in which stu-dents connect their academic experiences with their social and residential ones, the learn-ing communities enhance the education of the whole person and deepen the connectionbetween learning and living as responsible members of a community. All entering first-year students, whether or not they live on campus, become members of one of eight theme-based Residential Learning Communities. Nonresident first-year stu- dents are given access to the residence hall in which their learning community is located so that they can participate fully in its programs. Students take some courses in common withothers in their learning community, which enriches coursework and promotes the forma- tion of study groups. Students also interact directly with faculty and staff and participate in theme-based co-curricular and extracurricular activities both on and off campus. The Res-idential Learning Communities are primarily two-year communities, but some offer the opportunity for students to remain throughout their undergraduate careers. UNIVERSITY HONORS PROGRAM The U niversity H onors P rogram pr ovides a learning experience appropriate to students of exceptional academic talent and imagination. The program offers small seminar-style classes, especially in courses fulfilling the University Core Curriculum requirements. Admis-sion to the U niversity Honors Program is by invitation or application and considers the student's academic record, standardized test scores, recommendations, and any other infor- mation the student might pr ovide about interests, goals, or experiences. The program is organized as two distinct but related levels open to undergraduate stu- dents from Arts and Sciences, Business, and Engineering. Level I of the program accepts first-year students for a curriculum organized around courses that satisfy University CoreCurriculum r equirements applying to students in ev ery field. The University Honors Pro- gram requires that all participants maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or higher, and Level I participants must successfully complete a minimum of six programcourses within the first six quarters of enrollment. Most participants complete the Level Iprogram during their first year. Unless exempted by the director, Level I participants mustfulfill specific Foundations courses in the Core Curriculum\u2014Critical Thinking and Writ-ing, C ultures and I deas, and R eligion, Theology , and C ulture\u2014through special class sections arranged b y the program. Participants are also strongly urged to satisfy Core Curriculum re- quirements such as mathematics, ethics, social sciences, natural sciences, advanced writing, and adv anced r eligion, theology, and culture with Honors Program sections. Participants in Lev el I normally continue to Lev el II, in which they complete a minimum of four additional program courses including a senior thesis or project. Students who have completed 32 or more units but not more than 88 units at Santa Clara may apply to enterLevel II b y contacting the H onors Program Office. Students joining the program at Level II complete six program courses including the thesis or senior project. Some Level II courses,while not limited to program participants, offer academic opportunities especially suitablefor them. For both continuing and new participants, the thesis usually grows out of a reg-ular or independent study course taken in conjunction with the par ticipant's major or Path- way. Successful completion of the program at Level II becomes part of a student's permanentrecord and appears on academic transcripts issued by the University.14 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The Panetta Institute's Congressional Internship Program The Panetta Institute at California State University\u2014Monterey Bay, headed by Santa Clara political science alumnus and adjunct faculty member Leon Panetta, offers an op-portunity for students to gain an inside look at the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government and Washington politics. This Congressional internship begins with a two- week course at California State University\u2014Monterey Bay, wherein students work directlywith Leon Panetta or other seasoned veterans examining the legislative process and its func- tions. The remaining two and a half months of the internship are spent in Washington, D.C. working on Capital Hill in the office of a member of the California Congressional del-egation. One exceptional Santa Clara University student is chosen each year for this fully subsidized internship. Eligibility To be eligible to participate in a Public Sector Studies Program, students must have com- pleted at least 88 quarter units of credit by the date that the program of study begins, must not be on academic or disciplinary probation, and must be in good financial standing with the University. Students must also meet grade point average and other eligibility require-ments for the specific pr ogram. For more information about the Public Sector Studies Program, please visit: http://www.scu.edu/cas/polisci/publicsector.cfm or contact the director of the Public Sec-tor Studies Program.THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 17 a number of programs affiliated with other universities and study centers. Credits earned from all approved study abroad programs are accepted as degree credit at Santa Clara, andsome coursework can fulfill University Core Curriculum, major, and minor requirements subject to appropriate approval. Courses offered through International Programs can be found in Chapter 6 under In- terdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study. DOMESTIC PUBLIC SECTOR STUDY PROGRAMS The Public Sector Studies Program at Santa Clara University offers an introduction to the areas traditionally known as public policy, public administration, public affairs, andurban planning, and is designed to provide a closer look at the creation, implementation,and analysis of public policies, and the operation of governments and public organizations.The program also provides an excellent foundation for those who would like to pursuegraduate studies in public policy or public administration and an alternative perspective forstudents who wish to pursue public law. Opportunities for Firsthand Study Through the P ublic S ector S tudies program in the Department of Political Science, stu- dents hav e the opportunity to participate in public sector internships, the Washington Se- mester Program, and the Panetta Institute's Congressional Internship program. Theseprograms offer preparation and training for students interested in working at the city, county,state, or federal level of government, in a public agency or nonprofit organization, or con-sidering graduate-lev el studies in related fields. Internships Perhaps the best way to understand is by doing\u2014students participating in public sector internships not only see what happens in the \"real world,\" but they are able to take part aswell, gaining inv aluable experience and kno wledge. P lacements in the public sector intern - ships have included the San Jose mayor's office, district offices of members of Congress and the California Legislature, government relations departments of high-tech corporations,public law offices, political campaigns, and nonprofit organizations. Many students endtheir internships with excellent employment prospects. The Washington S emester P rogram In the Washington Semester Program, students combine coursework taken at American University with hands-on experience via internships. In the past, SCU students have interned at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI, interest groups, Fox News,various nonpr ofit organizations, and offices of members of the H ouse of R epresentatives. The Washington Semester Program offers students the opportunity to live, study, and work in our nation 's capital for one semester along with other students from throughout the coun- try, as well as from abroad. Numerous programs of study are available, including AmericanPolitics, Public Law, Foreign Policy, International Environment and Development, Eco-nomic Policy, Journalism, International Business and T rade, Peace and Conflict Resolution,Israel Studies, and Contemporary Islam. Students participating in the Washington Semes-ter Program earn 22.5-24 quar ter credits for one semester of study. Grades and units received at American U niversity will count toward the student's SCU GPA and course requirements for the depar tment and the University.16 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 18UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES 19 UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES The College of Arts and Sciences confers the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Ancient Studies, Art History, Chemistry, Classical Languages and Literatures (Greek and/or Latin),Classical Studies, Communication, English, French and Francophone Studies, GermanStudies, History, Individual Studies, Italian Studies, Music, Philosophy, Religious Studies, Spanish Studies, Studio Art, and Theatre Arts.

Westermark Associate Professors: Luis Calero, S.J., Mary Elaine Hegland, Lisa (Department Chair), Russell K. Skowronek Assistant Professors: Michelle Bezanson, Gregory S. Gullette The Department of Anthropology offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Anthropology. A solid undergraduate foundation in anthropology secures the analytical skills needed to undertake professional degrees in anthropology, business, law, public health, social services or provides a foundation for embarking on a number of otherprofessional careers. A minor in anthropology is also available. Special emphasis programs and honors thesis options are offered to qualified majors. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling the University Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree, students majoring in anthropology must complete the following depart-mental requirements: ANTH 1, 2, 3 SOCI for ANTH 50: ENVS 50 or POLI 50) ANTH 110, 112, 114, 198 Five additional approved upper-division courses in anthropology, including at least one selected fr om each of the follo wing four gr (ANTH 180-189) An introductory statistics courseFour anthropology seminars Emphasis Programs in Anthropology Anthropology majors have the option of completing a special emphasis program to complement their majors. The emphasis is not a narrow specialization but reflects com-petence in the applied fields of the discipline. Completion of special emphasis pr ograms will be noted on student transcripts with the approval of the department chair. The emphasis in applied anthropology prepares students to use anthropological knowledge to addr ess pressing human problems in careers outside the University. Through coursework and related internships, students will gain a better understanding of how an- thropological knowledge and skills can be used practically in occupations related to health and medicine, international development, environment, government, business, education,immigration, and poverty.

Hernandez Associate Professors: Susan Felter, Kathleen Maxwell, Andrea Pappas Assistant Professors: Katherine Aoki, Blake de Maria, Don Fritz, Katherine L. Morris Senior Lecturer: Gerald P . Sullivan, S.J. The Department of Art and Art History offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in two undergraduate majors, art history and studio art, with courses in both disciplines fostering a thorough understanding of the history and practice of art. Department faculty encourages interdisciplinary connections with the Santa Clara com- munity through course offerings that fulfill a wide range of College and University Core Curriculum requirements, as well as courses through the Residential Learning Communi-ties and the University Honors Program. ART HISTORY The art history major at Santa Clara is distinguished by excellent teaching and mentor- ing, challenging course work, and opportunities for study abroad, peer educating, and stu- dent internships at local and B ay Ar ea institutions. M oreover, we support, in conjunction with our fully accredited campus museum, Explore with Me, a docent-training program for our students. Advanced art history majors are encouraged to participate in our annual ArtHistory Symposium and the Ar t History Research Paper Competition. The art history major features numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth to understand better the meanings and purposes of the visual arts, including their historic development,their roles in society, and their relationships to other fields in the humanities. Students learnto think critically and communicate clearly about works of art. The art history major de-velops the following skills: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, analysis of visual and tex-tual sour ces, adv anced r esearch and writing skills, and sophisticated oral pr esentations. These intellectual skills enable art history majors to pursue a diversity of interests in a wide spec- trum of fields and professions, including graduate work in art history. STUDIO ART Studio art majors develop comprehensive skills that help prepare them for graduate study or car eers in either the fine or commer cial ar ts. Faculty members emphasize the development of conceptual and technical competence, as well as critical analysis of the student's own work and that of others. By graduation, every student develops a body of original artworkto be exhibited in a senior show in the department gallery. Students are required to articu-late an ar tist's statement r eflecting their o wn engagement with the cr eative process, in con- junction with their senior show. Studio art majors take all three sections of the Western culture art history sequence and are encouraged to continue with one or more courses in 20th-century or contemporary art. The studio seminar is highly recommended for all studio art majors and should be takenin the third year when possible. At the end of each year, students are encouraged to submittheir work to the Annual Student Art Exhibit, which is judged by an outside professionalin the field of art. The department also oversees merit-based scholarships, which are usuallygiven to outstanding students with junior status. S tudio art majors may continue to de- velop their skills in graduate school, or may choose to move directly into art-oriented jobs.

Sweeney Professors: John C. Gilbert (Department Chair), Patrick E. Hoggard (Fletcher Jones Professor), W. Atom Yee Associate Professors: Linda S. Brunauer, Michael R. Carrasco, Brian Professors: Thorsteinn Boothe Steven Suljak, Korin E. Wheeler Senior Lecturer: Steven L. Fedder The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers three baccalaureate degrees: the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, the Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and theBachelor of Arts in Chemistry. The curriculum is accredited by the American Chemi- cal Society, the professional organization for chemistry. The program prepares students for further work in chemistry, either in graduate school or as professional chemists. Inaddition, a chemistry degree is excellent preparation for careers in medicine, dentistry,law, engineering, business, and teaching. A minor in chemistr y is also av ailable. All Bachelor of Science degrees provide graduates with the background necessary to begin a career in chemistry at industrial and governmental laboratories, for admission toinstitutions offering graduate degr ees in chemistr y and biochemistry, and to medical and dental schools as well as other professional programs in the health professions. The chem- istry major pr ovides equal training in all the disciplines in chemistry, and the biochem- istry major combines training in chemistry with additional coursework in cell and molecular biology. The Bachelor of Science-ACS certified degrees meet all recommendedstandards for chemists and biochemists as mandated by the American Chemical Society. The B achelor of Ar ts degr ee allo ws students the most freedom in choosing electives, and therefore is an excellent program for pre-medical or pre-teaching students. Students with a strong interest in the liberal arts or who wish to pursue subjects outside the stan-dard science curriculum will benefit from this degree. The Bachelor of Arts degree canbe effectively combined with a pre-law or business curriculum to provide excellent prepa-ration for law or business car eers in the technology sector. Undergraduate r esearch is a critical component of our degr ees and most of our ma - jors conduct r esearch in collaboration with chemistry faculty mentors. Research in the department has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the H oward Hughes Medical Institute, the American Chemical Society Pe- troleum R esearch Fund, the D reyfus F oundation, and the R esearch Corporation. Ma- jors in chemistry, biology, and combined sciences participate in faculty research projects through CHEM 182, 183, and 184. In addition, advanced students have opportunitiesfor par t-time emplo yment assisting faculty in laborator y and related teaching activities. The chemistr y and biochemistry curricula are designed to be flexible in the sequence of upper-division coursework so as to allow students to participate in study-abroad pro-grams. Students interested in study abroad should meet with a faculty advisor to planthe junior and senior y ear courses as early as possible in their academic careers.

Heath (Department Chair) Associate Professors: Scott LaBarge, Michael McCarthy, S.J., Helen E. Moritz Senior Lecturer: John R. Dunlap Classics in the broad sense is the study of all aspects of the life and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. The Department of Classics offers courses that explore the most im-portant areas of these ancient civilizations and their Mediterranean context: language (an- cient G reek and Latin), literatur e, histor y, philosophy , mythology , religion, and art. Most courses in the department are open to any interested student. Classics courses, such as Mythology, Classical T ragedy, Ancient Greek Religion, and Women in Antiquity,requir e no kno wledge of an ancient language. Latin or Greek may be taken to satisfy the secondary language requirement. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the field, classics provides an ideal liberal arts curriculum that is an excellent background for careersin many areas. Majors and minors are available in several programs in the Department of Classics: an- cient studies, classical studies, and classical languages and literatures (Latin or Greek).There is a major , but no minor , in Latin and G reek. B ecause course offerings in any one term are limited, students wishing a classics major are encouraged to plan their curricu- lum in consultation with a faculty advisor at the earliest possible date. Students may fulfill their foreign language Core Curriculum requirement by success- fully completing a proficiency examination in Latin or Greek at the level required for their pr ogram of study . Contact the department chair to make arrangements.

Stephens (Biology) The College of Arts and Sciences offers a Bachelor of Science in Combined Sciences for students who have an interdisciplinary interest in the sciences. This degree provides breadth of basic natural science training along with meaningful exposure to analytical frameworks used in the social sciences. The combined sciences major nourishes intellec-tual flexibility, fosters awareness of the multiplicity of forces that shape our world, and en- courages students to think about interconnections among processes other disciplines may examine in isolation. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling University Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree, students majoring in combined sciences must complete the following requirements: MATH 11, 12 BIOL 21, 22, 24 BIOL 23 or 25 CHEM 11, 12, 13, 31, 32 PHYS 11, 12, 13 or PHYS 31, 32, 33 ENVS 2 or 11 or 12 or CHEM 1 POLI 1 or SOCI 1 ANTH 3 or POLI 2 PSYC 1 or PSY C 2 or PSYC 150 or SOCI 127 BIOL 187 or ANTH 172 or PSYCH 196 or SOCI 138 or ECON 101 SOCI 148, 149, 165 or 172 Five other appr oved upper-division natural or social science courses; at least two of these must be selected from the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, or physics) PREPARATION IN COMBINED SCIENCES FOR ADMISSION TO TEACHER TRAINING CREDENTIAL PR OGRAMS The State of California requires that students seeking a credential to teach science in California secondary schools must pass the California Subject Examination for Teachers(CSET), a subject area competency examination. The secondary teaching credential re-quires the completion of an approved credential program that can be completed as a fifth year of study and student teaching, or internship.

COMMUNICATION 65 64 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNICATION Professors: Don C. Dodson, Sally Lehrman (Knight Ridder/Mercury News Professor), Emile G. McAnany, Paul A. Soukup, S.J. (Department Chair) Associate Professors: Christine M. Bachen, Laura Ellingson, Stephen C. Lee, Yahia Chopra, Michael Whalen Senior Lecturer: Barbara Kelley Renewable T erm Lecturer: Gordon Young The Department of Communication offers a program of studies leading to a Bache- lor of Arts in Communication. The major prepares students for various graduate and professional studies and for careers in the communication industry. An academic minor also is available. Communication majors focus on the communication process in inter-personal, mass media, and computer-based contexts. They explore the theory, research methodologies, responsibilities, institutional structures, and effects of mass and interper- sonal communication. The department gives special consideration to new and develop-ing communication technologies. The major also integrates theor y with practice. I t allows students to apply their kno wl- edge of the communication process to the study and creation of communication prod- ucts (speeches, television programs, newspaper stories, Web sites, etc.). Particular attentionis given to dev eloping students' concerns for ethics and the common good. Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts educa- tion, students wor k closely with a depar tment faculty advisor to plan a cohesive academic program that combines courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often students complete a minor or take a number of courses in re-lated disciplines, such as marketing, theatre arts, psychology, or political science. The communication curriculum pr ovides nonmajors with the oppor tunity to acquir e a critical understanding of the communication process and contemporary media, to im- prove oral and written skills, and to heighten visual awareness. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student-run campus media. Special credit practica for such work may be included in the student's academic program.All junior and senior students ar e encouraged to complete an internship at an off-cam- pus media organization or other communication-r elated institution. The depar tment maintains a list of potential internships that may be completed for cr edit as COMM 198. The Department of Communication will accept no more than two study abroad courses (lo wer-division, upper-division, or a combination) toward completion of the com- munication course r equir ements. Courses taken abr oad will be accepted on a case-b y- case basis as completing specific communication lower-division requirements. Upper-division courses taken abroad will be accepted only as communication upper-di-vision electiv e credit. Courses taken abr oad will not be accepted as completing the re- quired List A, List B, research methods, or thesis/capstone requirements. Whenever possible the chair of the department will determine equivalency credit based upon thecourse description in the literature from the foreign university. Study abroad programs runby Santa Clara may fulfill some communication requirements subject to approval by the chair of the department.One of the oldest forensic programs in continuous operation on the West Coast, Santa Clara Debate provides a challenging and rigorous co-curricular activity designed to de-velop public speaking skills, critical thinking, and public policy analysis. The program is open to all majors and years regardless of previous speech or debate experience. The sched- ule offers national level competition in both policy team debate and in parliamentaryteam debate along with numerous on-campus activities related to competitive speech, including hosting high school invitationals. Students may receive academic credit, and policy debate participants are eligible to apply for merit scholarships.

The companion major in environmental studies is offered as a second-ary major; students majoring in environmental studies also must complete the requirements for a primary major. The environmental studies major works well with a wide variety of pri- mary majors, including anthropology, communication, political science, and economics. Aminor in environmental studies and a special version of the environmental studies minor for engineering majors also are available. Both the environmental studies and environmen- tal science programs provide students with the intellectual and ethical foundations they willneed in addressing crucial environmental challenges of the 21st century: e.g., human pop- ulation growth, urban sprawl, deforestation, global climate change, waste disposal, the need for renewable energy, air and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Environmental studies programs are enriched by colloquia, including bi-weekly seminars, featuring pr esentations on envir onmental subjects b y journalists, politicians, businesspeo - ple, scientists, and other scholars. Majors in environmental science and environmental stud- ies are expected to apply their knowledge outside the classroom by completing an approvedinternship or r esearch experience, culminating in ENVS 198 Environmental Proseminar. Environmental studies students are encouraged to study abroad in programs approved by the depar tment. Courses such as Natural History of Baja include one week of immer- sion travel during University breaks. Environmental studies faculty occasionally offer sum- mer courses in Costa Rica or in T rinidad and Tobago. In addition, many summer andacademic year courses taken through the International Programs Office readily transfer forcredit to ward envir onmental studies majors and minors. Each student works with an environmental studies faculty advisor, who helps integrate the classroom curriculum with the student's plans for future study and/or work in environ-mental fields.

Lai (Program Director) Assistant Professors: Perlita Dicochea, Robin Hayes The Ethnic Studies Program provides a critical analysis of historical and contemporary formations of race, ethnicity, class, and gender. In the pursuit of social justice, it challenges dominant views of racial and ethnic groups that lead to inequalities. Ethnic studies focuseson the roles and experiences of African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islander Americans, Lati- nas/Latinos, Native Americans, and other racialized peoples within the framework of the United States and within transnational frameworks. As an academic program, ethnic studies fosters interdisciplinary inquiry. The faculty comprise a community of scholars of critical race and ethnic studies, while serving as teach- ers, mentors, and role models for undergraduate students. Ethnic studies strives to make con-nections between University learning, racial and ethnic communities, and social change and encourages a reflective engagement with society and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. The Ethnic Studies Program serves as a resource for students,faculty, and staff across the University who are interested in issues of race and ethnicity. Theprogram offers a minor in ethnic studies. The ethnic studies minor complements a student's major by broadening the field of study to include an academic focus on race/ethnicity. It enhances a student's employmentoppor tunities in business, education, law , medicine, social work, and government. The minor provides a foundation for graduate studies for students who plan to become univer- sity pr ofessors and r esearchers with a specialization in ethnic studies. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in ethnic studies: ETHN 5 T wo courses from ETHN 10, 20, 30, 40 Three upper-division courses in an area of specialization (i.e., African American studies, Asian American studies, Chicana/Chicano studies, or comparativ e ethnic studies) ETHN 198 or 199 Departmental Courses Applicable to the Minor Note: For descriptions, see the listings of the relevant departments.

Montfort, Victor B. Vari (Harold and Edythe Toso Professor) Luc\u00eda Lucille Couplan-Cashman, Yoshiko Miyakoshi, Nina Tanti The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in French and Francophone Studies, German Studies, Italian Stud-ies, or Spanish Studies. Honors programs are available for French and German majors. Thedepar tment offers courses in Arabic, Chinese, F rench, G erman, I talian, Japanese, and Span- ish. The courses are designed to help students achieve proficiency in both the oral and writ- ten language and to provide them with an understanding of the experiences, values, andtraditions of those peoples whose languages are studied. Courses range from beginning lan- guage to linguistics, from an introduction to literary texts to advanced courses in literature and cultur e. All courses are open to any student with the requisite preparation. A few courses in literature and culture offered by the department are taught in English and are open to any student. Some of these courses may be used as credit toward a majoror minor in French and Francophone studies, a major or minor in German studies, or aminor in J apanese studies. H owever, these courses in English will not fulfill the University Core Curriculum for eign language r equirement. S tudents may fulfill their second language Core Curriculum requirement by successfully completing a proficiency examination in a modern foreign language at the level for their program of study. Students who hav e never studied the language in which they wish to enr oll, or who hav e studied that language for one year in high school, should register for Language 1. Those who wish to continue in a language that they hav e studied for two y ears in high school should enter Language 2. Students with three or more years of study in a single language, those who wish to continue language study beyond the second language requirement, or those who feelfollowing the formula would place them in a higher or lower level course than their back-ground warrants should consult a member of the appropriate language faculty for placementadvice. S tudents having the necessar y proficiency , as demonstrated by an interview with a member of the language faculty , may enr oll in higher-numbered courses than those of the placement formula. Once proficiency has been established, lower-division students may en-roll in upper-division courses with the permission of the instructor. Such courses will becounted as fulfilling major or minor requirements. 198.

Kulp, Scott LaBarge, William A. Parent, Mark Ravizza, S.J. Assistant P rofessor: Shannon Vallor Senior Lecturer: Lawrence Nelson The Department of Philosophy offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in P hilosophy . Philosophy inquir es directly into the relation of human beings to the world: what we are, how we know, what values are, how we live. Worth pursuing for its o wn sake, philosophical inquir y also pr omotes analytical thinking and pr ecise ex - pression and, thus, is excellent undergraduate preparation for a number of professional careers, such as law, government, writing, social work, and computer programming. To qualify for honors in philosophy, the major ordinarily must have a 3.5 grade point av-erage in philosophy courses and complete PHIL 197 with a grade of A- or better.

Philosophical research hones the tech-niques of careful argumentation and logically disciplined reasoning essential to the legalanalysis of cases and statutes. Also, emphasis on ethics courses will help prepare students forthe study and analysis of normative issues. The pre-law emphasis may be taken as part of aphilosophy major or minor, or the courses may be taken alone.

The ethics emphasis may be taken as part of the philoso-phy major or minor , or the courses may be taken alone. Requirements for the ethics emphasis include: One lower-division ethics class from PHIL 2 - 10 T wo ethical theory courses from PHIL 120 - 129 T wo courses from the following: PHIL 109 - 119, PHIL 154.

After all, po- litical science is the closest of all majors to the institutions and values with which law deals.The primary study of law is the state, and so too for political science. Additionally, the de-mands of political science courses (reading of complex texts, independent research, frequentclass presentations, and demanding writing assignments) strengthen the analytical and com-munications skills that the practice of law requires. The pre-law emphasis in the political sci-ence depar tment is open to all political science majors and will be reflected on the student's transcript upon completion. Requirements for the pre-law emphasis include a variety of courses from both inside and outside of the political science depar tment. At most, six courses are required: three within the political science department and three from outside the political science depart-ment, although many of these courses fulfill other Core and political science major require-ments.

Hill Senior Lecturers: Derek Duarte, Kristin Kusanovich, David Sword Renewable T erm Lecturer: Joanne Martin The Department of Theatre and Dance celebrates creativity of the human spirit, of- fering a w ell-rounded education leading to a B achelor of Ar ts degr ee in Theatre Arts with an emphasis in either theatre or dance. This study involves both academic disciplines and creative processes. These include practice and analysis of skills required in the perform-ing arts; critical evaluation of literature, history, and theory of drama and dance; collab-oration in production and public presentation of performance. The department also offersminors in theatre and dance as well as an interdisciplinary minor in musical theatre in co-operation with the Department of Music. Theatre and dance are distinct but related areas of emphasis. While each has its own set of r equir ements, students in either emphasis share common courses. Through lec- tures, studio courses, labs, and productions, students work closely with faculty and staffmentors. The theatre program offers coordinated courses in acting, design, technical production, directing, dramatic literature, and theatre history. Students within the the-atre emphasis will have a well-rounded foundation but may focus their study on any of the above areas. The dance program emphasizes modern dance and choreography, with additional training in jazz and ballet. In these areas, students have many opportunities for perform- ance and production; majors have the option of a senior recital, directing project, design assignment, or a senior thesis. Majors must fulfill the University Core Curriculum andCollege of Arts and Sciences requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree and the depart- ment requirements in their emphasis area, theatre or dance. A degree in theatre arts provides preparation for many career options. Some students continue on to graduate school, perfecting skills in acting, dance, design, directing, or his-torical studies. Graduates in theatre and dance have successfully pursued careers in pro-fessional theatre and dance companies, film, television, arts administration, and teaching.In addition, many have applied their skills in careers outside of theatre\u2014in medicine,law, management, marketing, development, and religion. A strong liberal arts education is inherent in the study of theatre and dance. Students are encouraged to work with their advisors planning a program that includes courseswithin their focus area and courses in other departments with related disciplines. Pro-grams that partner well with theatre and dance include: English, music, communication,studio art, psychology, political science, and marketing. Students may combine theatrewith various education waiver programs. Courses in theatre and dance can provide stu-dents of any major with experience in collaborativ e wor k, critical thinking, management, and communication skills. The theatre season usually includes at least four faculty-directed plays, three dance concer ts, and student-directed plays and recitals. Participation in departmental produc- tions is open to all members of the U niversity community: students, faculty , and staff . Guest pr oductions by professional dance and theatre companies occasionally form part of the season, and guest artists periodically direct, design, choreograph, or perform in shows with S anta Clara students.

The rigorous, systematic analysis that the studyof economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellentpreparation for car eers in both the priv ate and the public sectors, as w ell as for grad - uate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Economics graduates pur- sue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, government service,education, and priv ate consulting. S tudents considering graduate study in economics leading to a master's or doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor as early as possible to plan an appr opriate course of study .

Skaggs Distinguished Professor, Department Co-Chair), Alber t V. Bruno (W.T. Clear y Professor), Kirthi Kalyanam, S helby H. McIntyre (Department Co-Chair), Edward J. Michael Ling-Jing Kao, Desmond Lo, Kumar Sarangee Marketing operates at the cutting edge of a well-managed organization. Development of decision-making and managerial skills are the major objectives of the Department ofMarketing program, with special emphases in innovation, high technology, retailing, andconsumer products. Marketing is the function that links a business to its markets andcustomers. M arketing acts as the eyes and the ears for a firm, helping managers identify market opportunities and listen to customer needs and wants. It is also the firm's voice,handling communications with customers and deciding on advertising and sales mes-sages. Finally, strategic marketing addresses competitive threats and opportunities, guid-ing a firm 's effor ts to deliver superior value. Because customer analysis and competitive advantage are so crucial to business success, a degree in marketing provides a solid foun- dation for a general management career leading to executive responsibilities. It can alsoprovide the basis for a more focused career in such areas as advertising, retailing, sales,brand management, and mar ket research.

Healy (Thomas J. Bannan Professor), Samiha Mourad (William and Janice T erry Professor), Dragoslav D. Siljak (Benjamin and Mae Swig Professor), Sally L. Wood, Cary Y. Yang (Department Chair), Aleksandar Zecevic Associate Yuling Yan Assistant Professor: Sarah Kate Wilson Electrical engineering includes the design, construction, and operation of electrical components, circuits, and systems. Electrical engineers are concerned with all phases of the transmission of information such as in radio, television, telephone systems, fiber op- tics, wireless communication, satellite communication, electric power, advancing inte-grated circuit design, test, and implementation. Information processing and storage equipment, computers and networks used by business, industry, and government are in- cluded in their major area of interest. Laboratories are an important part of most under-graduate courses in the electrical engineering program. Use of appropriate laboratoryequipment, design tools, and components demonstrates fundamental concepts of thecourses and acquaints students with methods and tools they may use after graduation. Theprogram is supported by the facilities of the Engineering Design Center and the Univer-sity's Information Technology Center. The department supports 10 major teaching and research laboratories, three additional laboratories used only for teaching, and a labora- tory dedicated to the suppor t of senior design projects. The three teaching laboratories cover the fields of electric circuits, electronic circuits, and logic design. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling the University Core Curriculum for the Bachelor of Science degree, students majoring in electrical engineering must complete a minimum of 190 units and the following department requirements: English ENGL 181, 182 Mathematics and Natural Science MATH 11, 12, 13, 21 AMTH 106 (or MA TH 22) and AMTH 108 (or MATH 122) MATH 53 or CSCI 166 or AMTH 118 CHEM 11 and (CHEM 12 or BIOL 21) PHYS 31, 32, 32L, 33, 33L, 34 Engineering ENGR 1 CENG 41 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING 287 286 SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING COMBINED BACHELOR OF SCIENCE AND MASTER OF SCIENCE PROGRAM The Department of Electrical Engineering offers a combined degree program leading to the Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science open to electrical engineering majors with an approved grade point average in electrical engineering, mathematics, and physics courses. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins takingcourses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for the bache- lor's degree and typically completes the requirements for a Master of Science in Electri- cal Engineering within a year of obtaining the bachelor's degree. Undergraduate students admitted to the combined degree program are required to enroll in the program between February of their junior year and December of their sen- ior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying thestandard undergraduate degree requirements. To earn the master's degree, students mustfulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of 45 units of course-work beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree. Completion of 10 or more units of coursework in electrical engineeringtaken for the master's degree satisfies the Professional Development requirement of theundergraduate program. The program of studies for the master's degree may include upto 20 units of elective coursework from ELEN 112, 116, 117, 118, 127, 130, 133, 134,141, 143, 144, 152, 153, 156, 160, 161, 162, 164, 200, and abo ve. These undergradu- ate units can count toward a master's degree only if a grade of B or better is earned. Stu- dents who do not complete the combined degree program within six years of entering theUniversity will automatically be transferred to the regular master's degree program. Al-though six y ears is the maximal timeframe for completing the combined degr ee, full-time students enrolling in February of their junior year normally complete both degrees within five years.

Davis The School of Engineering, under the direction of the Office of the Dean, offers the Bachelor of Science degree with a major in general engineering and a minor in generalengineering. The bachelor's degree in general engineering is designed to provide students with a less specialized, technical degree with concentrations designed to meet the needs of the individual student. The general engineering degr ee allows students to pursue an en- gineering degree while preparing for work or graduate study in fields such as law, medi- cine, business, or education. The bioengineering concentration focuses on the applicationof electrical, chemical, mechanical, and other engineering principles to understand, mod-ify, or contr ol biological systems and educates students to solv e problems at the interface of engineering and the life sciences. The goal of the multidisciplinary bioengineering pro- gram is to educate students to solve problems at the interface of engineering and the lifesciences. Career paths for students with a concentration in bioengineering include themedical-device and biotechnology industries, biomedical r esearch, and graduate study in bioengineering, science, or medicine.

Godfrey Mungal, Associate Professors: Drazen Timothy (Department Chair), Christopher Kitts Assistant Professors: Mohammad Ayoubi, Wendelin Wright (Clare Booth Luce Professor) Mechanical engineering includes all aspects of design, development, control, and man- ufactur e of mechanical systems and energy conv ersion systems. M echanical engineering is essential to the proper design and manufacture of nearly every physical product in our modern world. As such, mechanical engineers ar e a fundamental r esour ce for most indus - tries, and they work in interdisciplinary environments. Mechanical engineers must have the ability to see broad perspectives across disciplines and industries and yet solve very localand specializ ed problems. The undergraduate curriculum addresses the education and training of mechanical engineering students and concentrates on two technical ar eas: (1) design and analysis of thermofluid systems for effectiv e use of energy; and (2) design, analysis, and contr ol of mechanical systems including the study of materials used in en- gineering. E ducational effor ts are channeled to expand the skills of prospective engineers not only in understanding fundamentals but also in developing competence in analyzing engineering systems.

These periods lay on the edge of modernity, when the distinctive characteristics of the contemporary world began to form and when major new connections were made be-tween Europe and Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, and the Americas. Study of these pe- riods from many different points of view affords an opportunity to gain valuable perspectives on the ways that Medieval and Renaissance persons, events, and institutions helped to shapethe modern world. Completion of the minor is noted on the student's transcript, and stu- dents receive a certificate acknowledging their accomplishment. REQ UIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in Medieval and Renais- sance studies: Seven courses selected fr om thr ee different departments with a maximum of three lower-division courses One of the upper-division courses must require an interdisciplinary research paper based on source materials and secondary works dealing with a topic rootedin the M edieval and/or Renaissance periods. The research paper requirement may be fulfilled b y enr olling in MRST 199 under the super vision of an affiliated faculty member and the program director. The study of French, German, Greek, Italian, Latin, and/or Spanish is strongly recommended but not required.

Seminar in Theatre and Dance before 1700RETAIL STUDIES Director: Kirthi Kalyanam Retailing is a dynamic and fast-paced industry and encompasses many functional areas. It demands a blend of creative and analytical skills. The minor in retail studies, of- fered through the Retail Management Institute, is an excellent immersion experience that prepares students for a diverse set of careers including buying, merchandising, planningand allocation, supply chain and information systems management. The program is open to all University undergraduates. Students entering the retail studies minor continue to major in their field of interest and receive their bachelor's degree in that field. Business majors get an opportunity to focus their studies and discover an exciting in- dustry in which to build their passions. For many business majors, broad business theo- ries will develop deeper meaning as they are applied specifically to the retail industry. Theinnovations in Internet retailing and supply chain management provide great opportu- nities for OMIS majors and students interested in computer science. Retailing is at the forefront of trends in current culture and communication patterns. This provides a fer-tile ground for arts and science students to leverage their unique background. One of the most v aluable and unique aspects of the r etail studies minor is the intern - ship that takes place the summer after the junior year. This immersion experience gives students insight into the retail industry and potential careers that are available. Studentsacquir e experience thr ough a full-time, 10-week paid internship at internationally recog- nized retailers such as the Gap, Gymboree, Williams Sonoma, DFS Stores, and Nord- strom. The institute offers a wide variety of internships to fit different student interests and needs. The minor is composed of a set of core courses and either a multi-channel or Inter- net retailing option based on the interests of the individual student. The core courses in-clude a multi-channel r etailing class in the spring quar ter of their junior y ear and a two-quarter advanced retail seminar in the fall and winter quarters of their senior year. The core classes cover topics such as branding, product development, merchandise manage-ment, negotiation, store operations, team building, information systems, supply chainmanagement, e-commerce, and pricing and promotion analysis. Nonbusiness majors are encouraged to apply for admission to the program during their fr eshman or sophomor e year to allo w time to integrate their course of study in r e- tailing with the r equir ements in their major field. Business students who have completed the lower-division requirements can enter the program as late as their junior year. The number of students admitted into the minor may be r estricted in some y ears by the num- ber of qualified internships av ailable.

MINOR IN INTERNA TIONAL STUDIES Executive Director: Dennis Gordon The minor in international studies is designed for students who wish to concentrate course work beyond their majors on selected nations, regions, or topics of international significance. S tudents can choose betw een an area studies emphasis with a focus on Africa,Europe, or Latin America or a thematic emphasis with a focus on a topic, such as poverty and development, international human rights, or peace studies. The area studies emphasis on Africa offers an introduction to the cultures, languages, politics, and global challenges facing the continent of Africa and its people spread across the planet through colonialism, slavery, and globalization. The area studies emphasis onEurope offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the cultures, languages, politics, and global challenges facing the continent. The areas studies emphasis on Latin America of- fers an interdisciplinary introduction to the cultures, languages, politics, and global chal-lenges facing the region. The thematic emphasis offers students the opportunity to examine broad interna- tional issues that transcend a single nation or geographic area. Subjects such as interna-tional organization, poverty and development, cultural interdependence, diplomacy andlaw are by their very nature international. Such subjects require systematic approaches dis-tinct from the examination of single-nation or area studies. Students develop their ownthemes and present a detailed proposal to the International Studies Committee for ap-proval usually no later than the first quarter of their junior year. Students planning an off-campus program for their junior year should obtain this approval prior to their departure.

Nomilitar y obligation is incurred. Open only to sophomor es and juniors who hav e not taken R OTC courses during the regular school year or for ROTC course alignment. Students must pass a physical examination332 INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY successful careers in both the corporate world and the military. Students who complete the ROTC program are eligible for appointment and commissioning as officers in the ArmyReserve. Reserve commissions are tendered in all basic branches of the Army. A board of officers determines the branch in which students are commissioned based on their prefer- ence, leadership potential, academic background, and the needs of the service. The military science core curriculum consists of six lower-division classes in the ROTC Basic Course and seven upper-division courses in the ROTC Advanced Course. Cadets may take a summer course (MILS 24) in lieu of the six lower-division courses. The pro-fessional military education of ROTC cadets consists of two components: a baccalaureate degree from Santa Clara University (or one of the cross-enrolled universities) and at least one undergraduate course from each of five designated fields of study. Prior to commis-sioning, cadets must take at least one course in military history and computer literacy. The curriculum is divided into ROTC Basic Course requirements and ROTC Ad- vanced Course requirements. To proceed to the ROTC Advanced Course classes, stu-dents must complete either the six required ROTC Basic Course classes or attend asummer class at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The director of the military science program mustapprove exceptions to this progression. ROTC Basic Course Requirements The ROTC Basic Course, Fundamentals of Leadership and Management, includes the first-year and second-year courses (MILS 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, and 23) designed for begin-ning students who want to qualify for entry into the ROTC Advanced Course and forthose students who may want to tr y military science without obligations. A student can also qualify for entry in the ROTC Advanced Course by completing the summer train-ing camp (MILS 24). ROTC Advanced Course Requirements The R OTC Advanced Course, Advanced Leadership and Management, consists of the third-year and fourth-year courses (MILS 131, 132, 133, 134, 141, 142, and 143) open to students who have completed or earned placement credit for the ROTC Basic Course. Students must complete all courses numbered greater than MILS 130, to include MILS 134, a six-week Leader Development and Assessment Course during the summer, in sequence, unless other wise approved by the professor of military science. The ROTC Advanced Course qualifies students for commissions as officers in the U.S. Army. Studentswho do not desire to compete for a commission as an officer in the Army may take thesecourses for academic credit with approval by the professor of military science. Leadership Laboratories Leadership laboratories, held weekly for three hours, are required of all students. Per- formance during lab periods is r eflected in the student's course grade. Labs include activ- ities such as rappelling, terrain navigation, marksmanship, drill and ceremonies, andtactical field training exercises. Labs and Field Exercises During each quarter of class work, weekly lab work is required. T wo off-campus ex- ercises involving adventure training, rappelling, rifle marksmanship, leadership training,and sur vival skills are optional for nonscholarship ROTC Basic Course students.

Musical theatre is prominent in Amer- ica as art, entertainment, social commentary, and civic engagement; it therefore plays apart in Jesuit education of the whole person for the service of others. The objectives ofthis pr ogram include: entr y-level proficiency for a car eer in performance, enhancement in teaching, or further training in graduate school; audition techniques; performance of acting, singing and theatrical dance; and kno wledge of the cultural history and various forms of musical theatre. The student may pursue one of two tracks: The American mu-sical theatr e or the lyric theatr e (opera/oper etta).REQUIREMENTS THE MINOR 1A or MUSC 7 Singing: MUSC 34 and three quarters of on-campus private voice instruction Acting: THTR 20, 123 Dance: T wo courses from DANC 40, 43, or 46 Students in American theatre option: DANC 55 or 155, THTR 165 and 80 or 180 Students in lyric theatre option: MUSC 103, 109, 50 or 150, 51 or 151 PRE-HEALTH SCIENCES Advisor: Steven L. Fedder Santa Clara University has an excellent reputation for preparing students for careers in the health sciences. M ost incoming students tend to be focused on either allopathic medicine or dentistry, but a much broader spectrum of careers can be equally or more at- tractive, including osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physi-cian assistant, nurse practitioner, and others. A Santa Clara education provides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by medical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the communi-cation, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school andin one's subsequent medical practice. Although Santa Clara does not have a pre-med major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. Most medical schools require: One year of general chemistry (CHEM 11, 12, and 13) One year of organic chemistr y (CHEM 31, 32, and 33) One year of biology (BIOL 21, 24, and 25) One year of physics (PHYS 11, 12, and 13 or PHYS 31, 32, and 33) One year of mathematics, typically calculus (MA TH 11 and 12) and a statistics course In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses in biochemistry, genetics, and human physiologythat are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test. The choice of aca-demic major is much less important than completing the coursework above; however,many pre-health students select a natural science major like biology, chemistry, or com-bined sciences. Students should maintain regular contact with the pre-health sciences advisor through- out their undergraduate years for assistance with adjustment to college academic rigorand social life; an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; assistancewith the balance betw een academics, social life, wor k, health community volunteering, and internships; and assistance with the relevant entrance examinations and applicationto health science programs. INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 337 336 INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY PRE-LAW Director of Pre-Law Advising: Susan Frisbie Santa Clara University provides a wide range of opportunities for undergraduates in- terested in attending law school to build a strong pre-law foundation. Early in their un- dergraduate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but also with one of the designated pre-law advisors to formulate a program designed fortheir specific needs and career goals. There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify for law school admission. Successful law school applicants come from majors as diverse as anthropology, philosophy, communication, political science, physics, English,history, biology, and economics. Law school admissions officers recommend undergrad- uate preparation in a major that demands discipline, analytical ability, research skills, and precision in written and oral work. The departments of Anthropology, Philosophy, andPolitical Science offer a pre-law or a law and society emphasis within the major. Elective courses also provide valuable training and breadth of academic and analytical experience. Some elective courses strengthen specific abilities, while others provide perspective onlegal issues and topics. Possible electives include, but are not limited to the following: ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES ANTH 151. Law and Society ANTH 155. Conflict Resolution COMMUNICATION COURSES COMM 20. Public Speaking COMM 170A. Communication Law and Responsibility ECONOMICS COURSES ECON 126. Economics and the Law ENGLISH C OURSES ENGL 174. N onfiction Writing ENGL 177. STUDIES COURSES ENVS 120.

Elder Law PRE-TEACHING Director: Carol Ann Gittens Santa Clara University is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Cre- dentialing to offer professional preparation for prospective elementary school, middle school, and senior high school teachers. The Department of Education in the School of Education, Counseling Psychology, and Pastoral Ministries offers graduate programs forthe multiple-subject credential for elementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades, both with a cross-cultural language and academic development em- phasis. The preliminary teaching credential can be initiated during the four-year under-graduate program through the Undergraduate Accelerated Teaching Credential Program or during a fifth year of graduate study. Students interested in teaching should consider completing a minor in urban education offered through the Liberal Studies Program. The Eastside Future Teachers Project is a program developed to attract Eastside Union High School District high school students into the teaching profession. This program was established in order to increase the number of underrepresented students who chooseteaching as a career. Six students are chosen each year to join the program, which providesspecial mentoring, course work, and practical experience r elated to teaching as w ell as scholarship assistance during their undergraduate and fifth-year credential programs. Preparation for Multiple-Subject Credential Students inter ested in a car eer in elementar y school teaching should fulfill the require- ments of the liberal studies major in the College of Arts and Sciences. Those require- ments can be found in Chapter 3, College of Arts and Sciences. Students mustdemonstrate the subject matter competency component for the multiple-subject creden-tial by passing the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET). While studentsmay sit for the examination whether or not they majored in liberal studies, both the ex-amination and the liberal studies degr ee requir ements ar e closely aligned with the state of California's elementary curriculum framework. Therefore, Santa Clara strongly recom- mends that students interested in being elementary school teachers major in liberal stud-ies. An undergraduate minor in urban education is also r ecommended. Preparation for Single-Subject Credential Students inter ested in a car eer in secondar y school teaching in a particular subject matter area should fulfill the requirements of the academic major of their intended teach- ing specialization. California teaching credentials are available in the following subjectareas: agriculture, art, business, English, health science, home economics, industrial andtechnology education, mathematics, modern languages, music, physical education, sci - ence, and social science. Those requirements can be found in each department in Chap- ter 3, College of Arts and Sciences and Chapter 4, Leavey School of Business. Studentsmust demonstrate specific subject matter competency b y passing the California Subject Matter Examination for Teachers (CSET) in the subject area they desire to teach. An un-dergraduate minor in urban education is also recommended.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 339 338 INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY Requirements for Multiple-Subject and Single-Subject Credentials The minimum requirements for multiple-subject or single-subject teaching cre- dential include: A bachelor's degree in a subject area from an accredited institution Demonstrated knowledge of the United States Constitution by completion of undergraduate coursework or passage of an approved examination Passage of the California Basic Educational Skills Test Completion of an approved program of professional education, including student teaching or internship Completion of a state-approved subject matter preparation program or passage of the California Subject Examination for Teachers, a subject-area competencyexamination, in the area one plans to teach Demonstrated knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading by completion of course work or passage of an approved examination Accelerated Teaching Credential Program The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching cr edential program can be pursued at Santa Clara in conjunction with the student's undergraduate program. Undergraduatepre-teaching students can apply to either the multiple-subject or single-subject credentialprogram in education during the winter of their junior year. Upon acceptance, studentsin the accelerated cr edential program are eligible to begin the credential coursework dur- ing the summer between their junior and senior years. Undergraduates are able to takeUniversity-based credential coursework prior to the completion of the baccalaureate de-gree, but must complete the bachelor's degree before initiating their field-based directedteaching. I n addition to the bachelor 's degree, students must pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test and demonstrate subject matter competency via the California Subject Examination for Teachers or completion of an approved subject matter prepara-tion program before beginning the directed teaching portion of the credential. Any 200or 300 upper-division lev el courses taken for the cr edential ar e not counted to ward the student's undergraduate degree unit requirement. Selected California state cr edential course work may be waiv ed by successful comple- tion of specific undergraduate courses: A course in community health education b y EDUC 70 A course in teaching childr en with ex ceptional needs in the r egular classr oom by EDUC 138 A course in educational policy, social foundations of education, and applied internship b y EDUC 198 A course in the psychological foundations of education by PSYC 134 Coursework on the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution by POLI 1 or HIST 96A341Fifth-Year Teaching Credential Program The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential program can be completed as a fifth year of study following the bachelor's degree and qualifies the student for a prelimi-nary teaching credential. This 50-quarter-unit program includes graduate coursework in educational foundations, curriculum design, teaching methods, and supervised student teaching. A field experience internship option may be completed in lieu of a regular two-quarter student teaching assignment. The selection of teacher credential candidates for in- ternships is conducted by the participating school districts in collaboration with the University. Students admitted to a credential program may choose the two-summer cre-dential option to do their primary coursework in conjunction with the field experience in- ternship option.7 Admission of Undergraduate Students Santa Clara University is a selective admission university that admits new students based on potential for academic performance and contribution to the campus commu- nity consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Applicants are ad- mitted as full-time, degree-seeking students. Santa Clara does not have a part-timeundergraduate program option and does not enroll non-degree students except under the limited conditions outlined in Chapter 8, Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations. Entering freshmen and transfer students are admitted for fall term. Students are ad- mitted for winter and spring term only by special exception with the approval of the provost. Entering freshmen are admitted to the University and to a specific school based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schoolsmay apply for a transfer at the end of their first year of attendance. ADMISSION OF ENTERING FRESHMEN Admission of applicants to S anta Clara U niversity as entering fr eshmen is based on their academic record in high school including course rigor, results on standardized tests, and other criteria outlined below. While Santa Clara University does not have a specifichigh school grade point or standar dized test score requirement, potential for successful ac- ademic performance in the rigorous undergraduate program at Santa Clara is highly cor- related with academic per formance in high school in challenging courses and the results on standardized tests. Santa Clara also bases admission on demonstrated potential for contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit traditionof the University. Applications for admission as an entering fr eshman ar e evaluated using the following criteria: Overall quality of high school courses and appropriately challenging coursework Academic per formance in high school, including the cumulative grade point average fr om the first y ear of high school thr ough the junior y ear of high school (grades from the first term of the senior year may also be included) Results of standardized tests (SAT I or ACT) Letter of recommendation Involvement in school and community activities The basic subject requirements for admission as an entering freshman include: History and Social Science: 3 years English: 4 years Mathematics: 3 years required; 4 years recommended340 INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY students is based on their academic record at other colleges and may include evaluation of high school transcript and other criteria outlined below. While Santa Clara Universitydoes not have a specific grade point requirement, potential for successful academic per- formance in the rigorous undergraduate program at Santa Clara is highly correlated with prior academic performance in challenging courses.

The r equirements for a bachelor 's degree include: Completing a minimum number of quarter units as specified below for each degree, no more than half of which may be satisfied with approved transfer credit: A minimum of 175 quar ter units for the B achelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science in the College of Arts and Sciences (a minimum of 197 quarter units for engineering physics majors) A minimum of 175 quarter units for the Bachelor of Science in Commerce in the Leavey School of Business The minimum number of quarter units specified by the major department for the Bachelor of Science in the School of Engineering Completing a minimum of 60 quarter units of upper-division courses Attaining a minimum grade point average of 2.0 for all courses completed at Santa Clara U niversity and for all courses in the academic major and any academic minor Meeting the residency requirement of a minimum of 45 units at the Santa Clara campus after achieving junior standingChange of Academic Major A change of major within the same school or college requires the approval of the rele- vant department chair or program director. Students wishing to change their academicmajor within a school must submit a Program Petition Form to the Drahmann Center. Change of School Entering freshmen are admitted to the University and to a specific school based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schoolswithin the University may not apply for such a change until the end of their first year of attendance. Changes between schools may be limited by the availability of space within the school and the specific academic major. Students wishing to change schools must meet the admit-tance criteria of the school and complete the application process specified by that school.Upon acceptance by the school, the student must submit a completed Program PetitionForm to the Drahmann Center. Repetition of Courses Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than \"C-.\" In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the cal-culation of the student's grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation onlyonce for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and performancecourses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful com-pletion. S tudents should consult the chair of the depar tment in which the course is offer ed to confirm that a given course may be repeated for credit. Independent Study Students may pursue independent study thr ough dir ected reading, directed research, in- ternships, practica, or cooperative education. To qualify, a student must have demonstrated a sufficient kno wledge of the academic discipline inv olved to make independent study both possible and beneficial. No more than 20 units of independent study may be used to sat- isfy graduation requirements, and no more than 5 units of independent study may be takenper term. Students must enroll for the term in which the independent study occurs. Directed r eading and dir ected r esearch are limited to upper-division students who un- dertake a research project or other well-defined study beyond the scope of a regular course under the supervision of a faculty member. Such work should be comparable to that re-quired for courses of equivalent unit value. Students can obtain practical learning experience through internships, cooperative ed- ucation, and practica. I nternships and cooperativ e education are approved work experi- ences in a non-classroom environment in industry, government, or other setting, generally available only to upper-division students. S tudents who enr oll in an internship or coop- erative education experience for academic credit must fulfill specified academic require- ments in addition to the responsibilities expected by the organization hosting theinternship or cooperative education experience. Practica provide practical experience ina discipline-specific field experience or an approved University program activity, such asparticipation on the school newspaper. Practica are generally available only to upper-di-vision students, but some practicum experiences are available to lower-division studentswho meet specified eligibility criteria.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 349 348 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Second Bachelor's Degree A student may earn a second bachelor's degree at Santa Clara University, but may not duplicate a degree (i.e., Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science in a natural science, Bachelorof Science in a social science, Bachelor of Science in Commerce, Bachelor of Science in En- gineering). Students whose first degree is from Santa Clara and who are interested in pur- suing a second bachelor's degree concurrently or without interruption must have anacademic record showing a strong probability of success and a proposed program of study for the second degree that fulfills the degree requirements in effect at their original date of matriculation. At least half of the units for the second degree must be completed througha Santa Clara program and be separate from those required for the first degree. Approval to pursue a second bachelor's degree must be granted by the dean of academic support serv- ices and filed with the Office of the Registrar. If a student is returning to the University after an absence, he or she must meet the cri- teria outlined above, but is subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of re-entry.Approval from the dean of academic support services is required to resume studies for a sec-ond degree after an absence. Students whose first degree is from an institution other than Santa Clara must submit formal application for admission to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Students ad-mitted for a second bachelor's degree are subject to the degree requirements in effect at thetime of admission. At least half the units required for the second bachelor's degree must beearned thr ough a S anta Clara program. Graduation with Honors Candidates for a bachelor's degree with a grade point average between 3.50 and 3.69 graduate cum laude (with honors); candidates with a grade point average between 3.70 and 3.89 graduate magna cum laude (with high honors); and candidates with a grade point av- erage of 3.90 or higher graduate summa cum laude (with highest honors). Awarding ofhonors is based on all graded undergraduate courses attempted at S anta Clara U niversity and courses taken elsewhere that are counted toward the fulfillment of a student's degree. Hon- ors will not be awarded above those merited by the student's record at Santa Clara. An in-dication of honors at graduation contained in the commencement pr ogram is unofficial. The final determination will be made after a r eview of all completed undergraduate courses counted toward the degree. Participation in Commencement To participate in commencement, candidates for a bachelor's degree must have com- pleted all degr ee requirements (or must have 10 or fewer units to complete) and a minimum overall grade point av erage of 2.0 as w ell as in all courses in their academic major(s) and any academic minor . ACADEMIC PROGRAM POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Course Numbering and Course Credits Lower-division courses are numbered 1 through 99, and upper-division courses are num- bered 100 thr ough 199. I n the College of Ar ts and Sciences and the Leav ey School of B usi- ness, most lo wer-division courses carr y 4 units of academic credit and most upper-division courses carry 5 units of academic credit. In the School of Engineering, unit values for coursesvary according to the number of hours in class per week. Students register for classes via University e-campus during the time assigned by the Office of the Registrar. Students who do not complete registration during the initial reg-istration period may do so during the published late registration period for the term. Ini- tial registration for a term or class additions are not accepted after the last day of the late registration period. During the first week of each term, students may change their original registration schedule by adding and dropping classes in accordance with the procedures established by the Office of the Registrar. During the second, third, and fourth weeks of the term, astudent may drop a class without receiving a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. From the fifth week to the end of the seventh week of the term, a student may drop a class and receive a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. Studentsmay not drop classes after the last day of the seventh week of the term. Students who donot complete a course and do not drop the class in accordance with the required proce-dures will receive an appropriate grade in the class. Students who have not earned 44 units, including transfer credit, may not enroll in upper-division courses without the written approval of the instructor and the chair ofthe department offering the course. This restriction does not apply to upper-division for-eign language courses for which a student has demonstrated sufficient proficiency or toengineering courses in the major program. Students may not sit in a class without formally enrolling in the class. Sitting in a class or obtaining an instructor's signature on an add form does not constitute enrollment. Registration must be completed in accordance with the regulations, procedures, and dates in the Schedule of Classes. Students who do not attend the first day of a class are subject to administrative cancel- lation of their enrollment in that class in order to make space available to other students.A student who must miss the first day of a class and wishes to r emain in the course should contact the instr uctor in adv ance. N o student who misses the first day of a class should as - sume that they hav e been dr opped from the course. Students are responsible for checking the status of their enrollment in all courses prior to the end of the late registration period. Unit Overload Students may enroll for no more than 19 units unless they are in the University Hon- ors Program, their cumulativ e grade point av erage at S anta Clara is at least 3.3, or they have upper-division status and obtain approval from the Drahmann Center. One 2-unit course or two 1-unit courses are not counted as overload units. Students who meet thecriteria abo ve will not be permitted to register for more than 25 units without approval of the D rahmann Center . Students may r egister for courses that r esult in o verload units only during the late r egistration period. Auditing Courses Students admitted to degr ee status at S anta Clara may audit one course in addition to their regular course load in a term. A maximum of three courses may be audited during a student's academic career. Permission to audit a course will be given only at the end ofthe late registration period and only if space is available in the class. No credit is assignedfor an audited course, but the successful completion of an audit will be indicated on a stu - dent's transcript by the notation \"AUD.\" ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 351 350 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Students wishing to enroll in an independent study course must initiate the request for independent study with the appropriate faculty member and with the Career Center for co-operative education experiences. The appropriate form, with the required materials and other approvals, must be submitted to the Drahmann Center for final approval prior to registering for the course. Challenging Courses Students may challenge certain courses to satisfy specific subject requirements for grad- uation. A student may petition to challenge any course listed in the Undergraduate Bulletinexcept those involving laboratory, studio, or specialized group work and those whose descrip-tions in the catalog are followed by the letters NCX. No more than one course may be chal-lenged each term. Although course requirements may be fulfilled by challenging a course,a successful challenge neither earns units toward the total needed for graduation nor con-tributes to the fulfillment of the residency requirements. In order to be eligible to challenge a course, a student must have completed at least one term at Santa Clara, have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3, and receive per-mission of the faculty member and the chair of the department in which the course is of-fered. Only currently enrolled students are eligible to challenge a course. To challenge a course, the student takes a special examination on the material covered by that course and meets any additional requirements specified by the department chair.Challenge examinations are arranged by the department chair after the student files a Peti-tion for Credit by Examination with the Office of the Registrar and pays the applicable fee. Course R equir ements and A ttendance Students are responsible for completing all course requirements as set forth by the instruc- tor. Class attendance expectations and consequences for absences from class are left to the discretion of individual instructors. Students are accountable for all course assignments,whether or not the assignments w ere announced during an absence. Final E xaminations A cumulative final examination, if given in a course, must be given on the date and time scheduled b y the O ffice of the Registrar. If the final examination is a take-home exam, it may not be due before the scheduled final examination time. Exceptions to this policy require approval of the department chair and dean. REGISTRATION POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Enrollment and Registration for Classes Students must be officially r egistered for all classes in accordance with the regulations, procedures, and dates in the Schedule of Classes. Registration is subject to full payment of tuition, r oom and board charges, and other fees associated with enrollment. The Univer- sity reserves the right to deny registration to any student for reasonable cause. A student'seligibility to register for classes is subject to the clearance of any holds on the student'srecord for academic, financial, student conduct, or other reasons. Santa Clara students may not be concurrently enrolled at another college or university except for extraordinaryreasons with the approval of the Drahmann Center. GRADING POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Grading Grades are assigned by the instructor to reflect the quality of a student's work. The University uses the following grades: GoodC: AdequateD: Barely PassingF: Not PassingP: PassNP: No Pass The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by (+) or (-) suffixes, except that the grade of A may not be modified by a (+) suffix. Grade point values per unit are as-signed as follows: A = 4.0 A- = 3.7B+ = 1.3D = 1.0D- = 0.7F = 0 Unit cr edit, but not grade point cr edit, is awar ded when the grade of \"P\" is as - signed. U nit cr edit is not awarded when the grade of \"NP\" is assigned. The U niversity also uses the follo wing marks for which no unit credit or grade point value is granted: I: Incomplete N: Continuing workNS: N o Show AUD: Audit W: WithdrawnACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 353 352 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment Students who enroll in a course for which they are not eligible are subject to adminis- trative cancellation of their enrollment in that course. Prior to the end of the late registra-tion period, an instructor may notify the University registrar to drop freshmen who registered in upper-division courses, to drop students who have not satisfied the prerequi- sites for the course, or to drop students lacking the instructor permission required for cer-tain courses. Withdrawal from the University Students who wish to withdraw from the University during a quarter or at the con- clusion of any quarter must complete a withdrawal form and an exit interview in theDrahmann Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student's reg-istration will be canceled without further academic penalty. Students who leave the Uni-versity during a quarter without withdrawing in accordance with the required procedureswill receive an appropriate grade in all courses in which they were registered and are not eligible for a refund of tuition or other fees. Students who withdraw from the University are responsible for any outstanding finan- cial obligations with the U niversity. Students who used deferred payment plans or student loans during their attendance at the University must clear their financial obligations with the Financial Aid Office and the Bursar's Office. Students who have unpaid bills or otherunsettled financial obligations with the University will not receive academic transcriptsor be eligible for r e-enr ollment until they hav e clear ed all such obligations. Re-enr ollment at the U niversity A student who withdrew from the University is eligible to re-enroll without special permission under the follo wing conditions: The student left the University in good academic standing. The student has no outstanding financial obligations with the University. The student plans to return to the same college or school at the University. The student is returning within five years of the date of their withdrawal. Students who do not meet the conditions above must seek permission to re-enroll from the dean of academic support services. Re-enrolling students are subject to degreeand curriculum requirements in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect at the time of re-entr y. Students wishing to re-enroll must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing of their intent to return using the Returning Student Form and should consult with a Universityadvisor in the Drahmann Center to review their academic plans. Students on leave whohave attended another college or univ ersity ar e only permitted to transfer in a maximum of 10 units of elective credit and are required to forward to the Office of the Registrar anofficial transcript of all work completed during their absence. Grade Point Average A student's grade point average is determined by multiplying each grade point value by the number of quarter units assigned to the course, adding these grade point units from allcourses taken, and dividing this sum by the total number of quarter units for which letter grades were reported. Grade reports are posted at the end of each quarter and indicate both the grade point average earned by the student during the quarter and the cumulative gradepoint average earned by the student for all courses completed to that point. Grades earned in courses in SCU-operated or -affiliated study abroad or domestic study programs are included in the calculation of a student's grade point average. Grades earnedin courses at other institutions accepted for transfer credit are not included in the calcula- tion of a student's grade point average, but will be considered when determining honors at graduation. Evaluation of Progress Grades are available at the end of the term via University e-campus. Faculty members are expected to apprise students of their course progress at reasonable intervals. Some meas- urements of progress should take place in time to enable students to make reasonable deci-sions with r espect to the four th-week and seventh-week withdrawal deadlines. Change of Grade Only the faculty member responsible for a course may assign grades. All grades become final when they have been assigned and reported to the Office of the Registrar. A facultymember may r eport a corr ection of a final grade to the O ffice of the R egistrar only if a cler - ical or procedural error was made in assigning, transmitting, or recording the original grade. A grade may not be changed as a result of re-evaluation, re-examination, or the submissionof additional wor k after the term ends. Any grade change must have the approval of the de- partment chair and the associate dean of the student's school or college. No grade may be changed after one y ear. Student Appeals of Grades Grades are not negotiable. There should be no questioning of a faculty member's aca- demic judgment on a grade. In registering for a class, students implicitly agree to allow thefaculty member to make a qualitativ e judgment of their command of the subject matter , which will be expressed as a letter grade. Any questioning or appeal of a grade should there- fore be limited to procedure, e.g., to computational errors or failures to follow grading poli-cies set for th in the syllabi. Any system of grade-appeal should protect the rights of faculty members as well as the rights of students. The r esults of any system of grade-appeal should not be binding upon the faculty member. Any decision to initiate a change of grade should remain the faculty member 's. Any pr ocedural complaint regarding a change of grade must be initiated within four weeks of the beginning of the next scheduled term, not including summer session. A student with a complaint must first discuss the matter with the faculty member. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student may then take the matter to the chairpersonof the department involved. The chairperson will discuss the case with the faculty memberand may recommend that the faculty member review the grade. Upon the request of thestudent, the dean will proceed in similar fashion. Should the student request it, the dean willpass the matter on to the provost.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 355 354 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Pass/No Pass (P/NP) A grade of \"P\" signifies that the quality of work done is equivalent to a letter grade of \"C\" or higher, while a grade of \"NP\" denotes work at the level of \"C-\" or lower. A maxi-mum of six courses taken under the pass/no pass option in which the student receives a mark of \"P\" can be used to fulfill the unit requirements for graduation. Some courses are offered only on a pass/no pass basis, and a student with junior or sen- ior standing and a declared major may choose to take an elective course on a pass/no pass basis. Students may enroll in only one course per quarter on a pass/no pass basis. Students may choose the pass/no pass option for a class through the end of the fourth week of classes,but may not change the grading option after that date. Incomplete (I) The mark of \"I\" (incomplete) may be assigned by the instructor when a student does not complete some essential portion of the assigned work in a class because of extraordinarycircumstances beyond the student's control. The unfinished work must be completed and given to the course instructor within three weeks of the beginning of classes in the next scheduled term (not the student's next term of enrollment), excluding summer session, un-less extraor dinar y circumstances require an extension. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing by the instructor and approved by the University registrar within the original three-week period. Extensions shall not be for longer than two academic quartersafter the mark of \"I\" was assigned, excluding summer session. An incomplete that has notbeen completed within the specified deadline or has not r eceived an appr oved extension will be converted to a grade of \"F .\" Continuing Work (N) The mar k of \"N\" (continuing work) may be assigned by an instructor when course re- quirements span more than one term. When the course requirements are completed, the instructor assigns a standar d grade. A student may not graduate and receive a degree with a mark of \"N\" on their academic record. No Show (NS) The mark of \"NS\" (No Show) may be assigned by an instructor when a student never attends a class and does not dr op the class. A mar k of \"NS\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark after it is assigned by the instructor. A mark of \"NS\" is included in the stu- dent's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the cal-culation of the student 's grade point average. No adjustment in tuition will result from the awarding of a mark of \"NS\" in a class. Audit (A UD) The mar k of \"AUD\" is assigned when a student enrolls in a class on an audit basis. A mark of \"AUD\" cannot be changed to any other grade. Withdrawn (W) The mark of \"W\" is assigned by the Office of the Registrar when a student completes the formal requirements dropping a class or withdrawing from the University. A mark of\"W\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark. A mark of \"W\" is included in the stu-dent's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included the cal-culation of the student 's grade point average. Completing at least 76 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing at least 115 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing at least 160 quarter units by the end of the twelfth quarter of residency Academic Disqualification Students are subject to disqualification from further registration at the University for any of the following: Remaining on academic probation for more than two consecutive quarters without improvement Failing to maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0OR Completing fewer than 30 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing fewer than 64 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 100 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 150 quarter units by the end of the twelfth quarter of residency Reinstatement to the University Reinstatement to the University after disqualification is rarely permitted and requires favorable action by the dean of academic support services in consultation with the dean ofthe student 's college or school. Requests for reinstatement are made to the dean of academic support services and must include a description of any activities during the period of dis- qualification that would indicate that an impr oved academic performance can be expected in the future. A student generally may not apply for reinstatement within a year of the date of disqualification. The request for reinstatement will be considered only if the student's ac-ademic deficiencies can be corrected within a reasonable time. ACADEMIC CREDIT EVALUATION Santa Clara awards credit based on the Advanced Placement Program, the International Baccalaureate Program, courses completed at other colleges and universities, and coursescompleted in U niversity-approved study abroad and domestic study programs using the criteria outlined herein. Students may not take a course for credit for which they have re- ceived adv anced placement, International Baccalaureate, or transfer credit. Advanced Placement Credit Santa Clara participates in the Advanced Placement Program to recognize college-level academic achievement prior to matriculation and to encourage students to pursue advancedstudies in their areas of interest. Credit or placement is determined by the appropriate de-partment based on review of the student's advanced placement scores, sometimes in thecontext of supplemental depar tmental examinations. S tudents will be notified of adv anced placement cr edit upon matriculation at the U niversity. ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 357 356 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS This process of review gives the chairperson, dean, and provost the right to discuss the matter with the faculty member, and if they think it appropriate, request that the facultymember review the grade. Any recommendations made will not be binding upon the fac- ulty member against whom the complaint is lodged. The decision to change a grade re- mains with the faculty member. ACADEMIC STANDING AND STUDENT CLASSIFICATION Student Classification The University only admits students to its undergraduate degree programs on a full- time basis. Students who have not been admitted to degree status at the University mayregister for classes in accordance with the policies and regulations outlined in the section ofthis chapter covering non-degree students. The classification of students is determined by the number of quarter units completed with passing grades. Lower-division students are considered freshmen if they have com-pleted fewer than 44 units and sophomores when they have completed at least 44 units but fewer than 88 units. Upper-division students are considered juniors when they have com- pleted at least 88 units but fe wer than 132 units and seniors when they hav e completed at least 132 units. If a student is enrolled for 12 or more units in a given term, they have full-time status for academic purposes. Students enrolled for less than 12 units have part-time status forthat term and may not qualify for all University activities and benefits, such as eligibility forfinancial aid, on-campus housing, and inter collegiate athletic competition. Continuing en- rollment at the University in part-time status requires approval by the dean of academicsupport services. Academic Standing To be in good academic standing at the U niversity, a student must normally be enr olled for 12 or more units, must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara, and must have completed at least a minimum numberof units as specified below. Failure to meet these requirements may result in academic pro-bation or disqualification from future registration at the University. Students in their last term of enrollment before completing a degree may be classified as a full-time student when enrolled for less than 12 units. Academic Probation Students who have completed at least three quarters of academic work at Santa Clara or elsewhere are subject to academic pr obation if their cumulative grade point average is lower than 2.0 based on all courses taken at S anta Clara. Students who have not yet completed three quarters of academic work at Santa Clara or elsewhere normally are not subject to ac- ademic probation as long as their cumulative grade point average is at least 1.6 based on allcourses taken at Santa Clara. Students are also subject to academic probation if they fail to make satisfactory progress toward their degree as defined below: Completing at least 36 quarter units in the previous three quarters of residency OR Completing at least 36 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency * Credit for laboratory to be determined International B accalaur eate Santa Clara University recognizes the International Baccalaureate Program for admission and advanced placement and often awards academic credit for grades of six or seven in the higher level examinations. No credit is awarded for subsidiary level examinations. Final de-cisions on adv anced placement and academic cr edit ar e made individually b y the appr opri- ate academic depar tment in consultation with the Drahmann Center and the University registrar. Units Taken at Other Institutions Credit is awarded for coursework completed at other colleges and universities subject to certain limitations. Courses fr om accr edited institutions are generally transferable if they are similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin. Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses of atrade or technical natur e do not transfer . Courses fr om colleges not accr edited, trade schools, extension programs, or correspondence programs do not transfer. Students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities prior to matriculation at S anta Clara for no more than half of the total number of quarter units r equired for the specific S anta Clara degr ee. After enr olling at S anta Clara, students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities for no more than 10 quar ter units of free electives, subject to the limitation that no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for a Santa Clara degree can be earned at anotherinstitution. T ransfer credit earned after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used tofulfill University Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or program requirements. Transfer cr edit for all coursework completed at other colleges and universities requires approval from the Drahmann Center and the chair of the department offering the equiva- lent Santa Clara course. The student must have earned a grade of \"C\" or better in a coursefor transfer cr edit to be granted.

The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files. If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the sever- ity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic in-tegrity violations. Allegations Outside a Course If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The assistant dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University JudicialProcess. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved. ADMINISTRA TIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS CLER Y ACT In accor dance with the J eanne Cler y Disclosur e of Campus Security Policy and Cam- pus Crime Statistics Act, Santa Clara University annually collects information about cam- pus crimes and other reportable incidents as defined by the law. Information presentedin compliance with this act is made av ailable to assist curr ent and potential students and employees in making informed decisions regarding their attendance or employment at the University . These reports and other information about the law are available on the Cam- pus Safety Web site. It is the policy of Santa Clara University that the campus commu- nity will be informed on a timely basis of all reports of crime and other informationaffecting the security of our campus and the personal safety of our students, faculty, staff,and guests. The dir ector of Campus S afety S ervices is responsible for gathering, record- ing, and disseminating such information and for decisions regarding the content, time, and manner of distribution. Depending on the circumstances, the director of Campus Safety Services may request the assistance of various University departments and administrators in carrying out thisresponsibility. COMMUNICATION BY THE UNIVERSITY TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS The University will communicate with undergraduate students through a variety of for- mats. Information that is sent to undergraduate students from the University via their cam-pus mail box, local address, or their Santa Clara e-mail address is considered officialcommunication and should be treated as such. Students are asked to check their campus mailbox and their Santa Clara e-mail account on a daily basis, and are responsible for read- ing and responding to the information they receive from the University. The Universityurges undergraduate students to use their Santa Clara e-mail address as their primary e-mail; students who will not be checking that address regularly should forward their emailto their pr eferred e-mail account.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 363 362 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS If the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolu- tion begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs thestudent of the suspicion. If the instructor judges on the basis of available evidence that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severityof the academic sanction (e.g., refusal to accept an assignment, \"F\" on the particular assign- ment, or \"F\" for the entire course). The instructor will report in writing to the department chair and the Office of Student Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred andwhat academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the mat- ter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University judicial process. This process is not intended to limit academic freedom. Appeal Process for Academic Sanctions If, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the student wants to challenge the instructor's decision, the student will contact the chair ofthe department in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered or his/her designate, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely re-lated department. The depar tment chair hearing the appeal has the option to conv ene an ad hoc panel if he or she believes that the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspected of committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only roleis to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time facultymembers from the department in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty mem-ber fr om a closely related department, and two students who are trained student judicial board members. Staff in the Office of Student Life will arrange for the participation of thestudent panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered andnewly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all partiesconcerned, and make a r ecommendation to the depar tment chair. The parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a partic- ular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection must be based upon abelief that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evalua-tion and ther efore will not r eview the case in an impartial manner. The objection is filed with the chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a differ ent faculty member or student. After reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidenceavailable, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of her or his recommendation regarding the alleged violation, and r eport the r ecommendation to the student and the O f- fice of S tudent Life. H owever, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the in- structor of the course. Decisions may only be appealed to one lev el abo ve the instructor. All proceedings are in- tended to be confidential. If the student wishes to withdraw from the course but the instructor's signature is required for the withdrawal pr ocess, the instr uctor may refuse to sign an approval of the withdrawal. University Judicial Process When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the assistant dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether STUDENT RECORDS AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects the confiden- tiality of the University records of Santa Clara University students. Within the provisionsof FERPA, the University recognizes the rights of an admitted student once the student registers for classes. T he University is authorized under provisions of the Act to release di- rectory information to any person on request, unless a student explicitly requests in writingthat the University not do so and keep directory information confidential. A student's directory information is designated as follows: Name Address (campus, local and/or permanent; e-mail) Telephone number Date and place of birth Photographic image Major field of study, classification, dates of attendance, expected graduation date, degrees, and honors received Most recent previous educational institution attended Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercollegiate athletics Height and weight of participants on intercollegiate athletic teams During the registration period and throughout the academic year, students may request in writing through the Office of the Registrar that directory information be kept confiden-tial. O nce filed, the request remains in effect until the beginning of the next academic year or a shor ter period if designated b y the student. G raduating students must notify the O f- fice of the R egistrar in writing to r emove the nondisclosure notation from their record. Certain records are excluded by law from inspection, specifically those created or main- tained b y a physician, psy chiatrist, or psy chologist in connection with the treatment or counseling of a student. Parents' financial information, including statements submitted with scholarship applications, is also ex cluded b y law fr om inspection. Third parties may not have access to educational records or other information pertaining to students without the written consent of the student about whom the information is sought. Former or current borrowers of funds from any Title IV student loan program should note car efully that r equests for nondisclosur e of information will not pr event the Univer- sity from releasing information pertinent to employment, enrollment status, current ad- dress, and loan account status to a school lender, subsequent holder, guarantee agency, theUnited States Department of Education, or an authorized agent.

Each year, a percentage of studentsreceiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the informationon which their awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to sub-mit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number offamily members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar in-formation for verification purposes for any student awarded aid and to verify the attendanceof other children in college. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aidaward and, in some cases, the r epayment of funds alr eady r eceived. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds. BILLING AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES STUDENT ACCOUNTS AND BILLING Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrollment at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures.

CANCELLATION OF FINANCIAL AID AND RETURN OF FUNDS Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are sub- ject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulationsassume that a student \"earns\" his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or sheremains enr olled during a term. A student is obligated to r eturn all unearned federal finan - cial aid funds governed under Title IV other than those earned under the college work- study program. Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accor dance with the federal guidelines. D uring the first 60 per cent of the term, a student \"earns\" Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student re-mains enr olled is the per centage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges o wed by the student play no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled. All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to state or University financial aid programs or to the student. The return of funds allocation will bemade in the following order for students who have received Federal Title IV assistance. Unsubsidized William D.
