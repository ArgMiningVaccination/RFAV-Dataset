The word detoxification means the process of removing toxic substances. So, when we detox we are getting rid of any waste substances in our bodies that shouldn't be there and that our body doesn't need or can't use. This could be anything from alcohol, drugs or excess medication to the additives or chemicals found in fast, processed or burnt food. Our liver is designed to deal with a certain amount of these toxins - by converting them into safer substances that the body can tolerate- however even the liver has a limit and can only deal with so much. We also have our lymphatic system which is capable of picking up waste and toxins around the body and removing them, however, again, an overload of unhealthy substances will cause the lymphatic system to slow down and not work so efficiently. When we have too many toxins in the body, we feel and look unhealthy. Here are just a few things that can occur when we have too many toxins in the body. - Our skin can look dull and sallow - We can experience spots or breakouts on the skin - Cellulite can appear on our legs and often other areas of the body - We feel tired and lethargic - We can experience swollen areas of the body - usually wrist and ankles - where fluids are not draining effectively - Our body as a whole will not work as effectively, so we may feel drained and unwell. - Due to this our body may be more at risk of illness, as the organs are not working efficiently and our immune system cannot cope with the toxins and fighting off illness. How essential oils for detox work Some of the essential oils work to actually help remove the toxins and waste from the body, by stimulating the lymphatic system to work more efficiently. This means that waste and toxins will be taken more readily to the lymph nodes where they can be destroyed. Other oils stimulate our immune system or lymphatic system, which means the body is in a better position to deal with toxins, waste or harmful substances and strengthen our immunity. The oils have 2 benefits for the immune system - they can attack bacteria that are already in the body and they can stimulate cells and organs, in a sense waking them up, so they are better equipped, more efficient, and ready to attack bacteria and deal with toxins and waste. Oils that stimulate the lymphatic system can be used preventatively to strengthen the body's own defences to treat a particular condition caused by ineffective lymphatic system, like the build-up of cellulite, [water retention](https://beautytamingthebeast.com/essential-oils-for-water-retention/) and bloating.
