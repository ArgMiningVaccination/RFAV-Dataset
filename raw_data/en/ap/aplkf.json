Where do my herbs come from? How were they grown, and who harvested them? These are important questions to ask when shopping for Ayurvedic products. If you have an herbal ally, or a formula that you depend on to stay balanced, we encourage you to learn about the environmental issues facing the herbs you rely on. If you don't have time to research the sourcing of all your herbs, find a supplier you trust to do the background check for you. Banyan's Commitment Since Banyan's humble beginnings in 1996, we have made it a priority to seek out ethical sources for all of our herbs. Unfortunately, pure, sustainable sources are not always available, and over the years we have removed items from our offering simply because we could not find sources to meet our standards. In hopes of reversing the future of endangered and irresponsibly harvested herbs, we support projects that work with local farms across India to establish cultivated sources for some of our favorite herbs. We are involved in projects that range from working with small farming cooperatives to cultivate widely used Ayurvedic herbs like pippali, tulsi, and ashwagandha in the state of Karnataka, to supporting the planting of hundreds of guggulu trees in Rajasthan, and even helping to fund one of the first cultivated sources of kutki in the Himalayan foothills. We believe the quality of an herb is not only defined by its potency, but also the fertility of the soil where it was grown, and the working conditions of the hands that harvested it. Sustainability of people, place, and culture are all considerations we make when establishing new farming partnerships, and, in sourcing the herbs, we ensure that the farmers are paid a fair and stable price. We are committed to providing opportunities to improve quality of life by assisting small farmers in achieving a stronger position in world markets and supplying a healthy link between you and the products. The farming projects we are involved with aim to incentivize local wild-crafters to stop harvesting from the scarce, over-stressed native sources, and instead work to preserve the future of Ayurvedic herbs by cultivating them in a sustainable, responsible manner. Here at Banyan, we feel strongly about the importance of plant preservation. Ayurveda has been thriving for several thousand years, and we want it to continue thriving for several thousand more. Through global, collective efforts, we can preserve Ayurvedic plant allies and ensure their availability for generations to come. As part of the Banyan community, we want to thank you for joining us in this effort. Together, we can set the herbal-product standard by committing to organic ingredients and ethical, renewable harvesting practices. In hopes of reversing the future of endangered and irresponsibly harvested herbs, we support projects that work with local farms across India to establish cultivated sources for some of our favorite herbs. Due to over-harvesting, kutki is considered endangered. Banyan proudly offers the only CITES** certified kutki in the United States. Grown in the Himalayan foothills in the northeastern part of India. **Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and FloraWhy Sustainability Matters to the Future of Ayurveda This concept is probably not new to you. Sustainability is a movement that is sweeping over our global community at a steady rate, and we all do our part in the best way we can. Maybe you have made it a habit to bring your own bags when you go grocery shopping, or you know someone who rides their bike to work or school a few days each week to cut down on fuel dependency. You probably know a master recycler who easily decodes those tricky numbered triangles on the bottom of recyclable plastics. Wherever there is a use of resources, sustainable practices can be implemented, and determining your level of engagement in these practices is quite a personal matter. We like to think of sustainability in the same way as kindness: no act is too small. Now, you may be asking yourself what this has to do with Ayurveda. To get a better understanding of the nature of this issue, let's establish some context. Ayurveda is an incredibly old system of medicine, with its origin date unknown, but estimated to be around 2,000 to 5,000 years ago. For the last several thousand years, Ayurveda has primarily lived on the Indian sub-continent, where practitioners, sages, and householders could walk through their local bio-region and freshly harvest Ayurvedic herbs from the wild. This rich tradition of wild-crafting has harmoniously brought man and nature together for thousands of years. Today, however, the demand for Ayurvedic herbs simply does not match the wild availability. In large part, this discrepancy is due to population increase, but there are other factors at play, and in many ways, this is a great problem to have! It means that more and more people are turning back to nature's pharmacopoeia to find support for their health. And while there is an established herbal tradition on nearly every continent, Ayurveda has made its way out of India and into the homes of people all around the world. With this growing exposure understandably comes an increase in demand for the traditional plant species used in Ayurveda, and naturally found across India. In the case of plant-based resources, when supply is not able to meet demand, several unfortunate things start to happen: The species becomes over-harvested and endangered or even extinct, and imitation products begin to enter the market. The history of sandalwood and jatamansi illustrate good examples of this cycle in the herbal marketplace. Both of these traditional and highly revered herbs have been severely over-harvested in recent years, slowly vanishing from their native wild landscapes. These two potent herbs have been effectively used in Ayurveda for millennia, but now the mere survival of these endangered species is under great threat. Banyan has chosen not to support the continued over-harvest of jatamansi and sandalwood by not offering these herbs until a sustainable source becomes available. Awareness is Key Luckily, more and more people are becoming interested in the story of their herbs, and herbal suppliers have taken notice. Sustainability-focused non-profit organizations around the world have begun raising awareness around the issues facing the herbal products industry, helping to establish some guidelines for sustainability. When shopping for herbal products, especially those involving international agriculture, look for the quality standards of your supplier. This information should be readily available and can help to make your decision making process easier. Here are a few sustainability guidelines to look for, and some insight into what they represent: Organic: For cultivated varieties, organic is one of the first qualities to look for when checking the sustainability of a product. This certification ensures the herbs were grown without the use of pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, GMOs, and other toxic substances. Organic agriculture promotes sustainable soil management, pollinator-friendly crops, and toxin free run-off into nearby waterways. Fairly Traded: This concept addresses the human-sustainability of a product. Fairly traded means the people involved in growing, harvesting, and processing the herbs were paid a fair, living wage. CITES: Specific to endangered plant species, this certification ensures the plant was not exploited in the way it was harvested, collected, or traded. We are proud to offer CITES certified kutki powder, some of the first available in the United States. Fair Wild: This organization ensures that wild-collected products were harvested and gathered in a sustainable, ethical manner. Banyan's Fair Wild bibhitaki fruit is harvested from an old-growth bibhitaki forest, which serves as a home and nesting ground for the great pied hornbill. Fair Wild ensures We like to think of sustainability in the same way as kindness: no act is too small.*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Defining Health The Sanskrit word for health, svastha, describes an authentically harmonious interaction of many parts within the whole\u2014such that the mind, soul, and senses are infused with an abiding sense of Self, wellness, and even bliss. Achieving this quality of life may seem a lofty ambition, especially when human beings throughout the world are riddled with stress, anxiety, and chronic disease. But Ayurveda provides us with a treasure chest of elegant and insightful tools that can be used to assess the degree of discord (no matter how slight or severe), determine its root, and ultimately, reclaim balance in our lives. To read more about the tools for finding balance and embodying optimal health, go to www.banyanbotanicals.com/optimalhealth. Have you ever longed for a straightforward map illuminating the elusive path to vibrant health, meaningful purpose, and an enduring sense of peace, contentment, and joy? Look no further. Ayurveda literally means, \"knowledge of life\" and the scope of the Ayurvedic tradition is truly no less encompassing. While it is thought to be over 5,000 years old, Ayurveda remains as relevant as ever\u2014and it is enlivened every day as individuals around the world engage its timeless wisdom in their own lives. Embracing the Individual Ayurveda is rooted in the idea that each of us is born with a completely personal blueprint for optimum health. From birth onward, it is this reference point\u2014your constitution\u2014that, in many ways, defines who you are. No two constitutions are exactly alike. Therefore, no two human beings can have precisely the same expression of ideal health. Your constitution, which is inherently unique to you, goes hand in hand with a similarly personal set of vulnerabilities. Together, they provide an invaluable context from which to consider the sum total of your life experience. In other words, the underlying framework is just as critical to understanding your current state of health as any imbalances affecting your system. A seasoned Ayurvedic practitioner uses all of this information to identify the root of any departure from one's natural state of equilibrium, and to determine how balance might be restored.

Massage done with warm herbalized oil brings lubrication and oleation to the body while also grounding the nervous system and providing the tissues with the benefits of herbs that are cooked into the oil. Daily Massage Oil is formulated to balance all three doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha. The base uses both warming and cooling oils to allow the oil to have a simultaneously penetrating and soothing effect. The traditional cooking process then brings together powerful Ayurvedic herbs like guduchi to soothe and rejuvenate; bala to strengthen; and arjuna and tulsi to invigorate, promote circulation, and support the lymphatic system. This blend not only supports the physical body but also calms and steadies the mind with brahmi/gotu kola and bhringaraj. Finally, the oil is also pleasing, soothing, and revitalizing to the senses and spirit with a light hint of lavender and lemon verbena.

Doesn't the word make you crave a relaxing treatment that will melt away your tensions and stresses? Wouldn't it be wonderful to get a massage\u2014maybe even right now? We often think of massage as a luxurious treat, an indulgence\u2014even a splurge. But in fact, massage is an important component of optimal health. It has been used for centuries in a variety of traditional cultures to strengthen well-being and vitality. Today, massage therapy is increasing exponentially, and research highlighting the many benefits of massage is growing just as dramatically. So why not make massage a valuable part of your life? How about even giving yourself a massage every day? It's easier than you might think and oh so worth it. Abhyanga, the term used to describe an Ayurvedic oil massage, is recommended for almost everybody of any age, from a newborn child to an elderly person. Whether you enjoy a warm oil massage from a massage therapist or take a little time to massage yourself, the benefits are well worth the investment. Why is warm oil an important part of massage? In Sanskrit, the word \"sneha\" can be translated as both \"oil\" and \"love\". So in Ayurveda, there is an inherent connection between enveloping the body in oil and enveloping it in love. Both oil and love provide a sense of nurturing, grounding, and nourishment. These qualities benefit the entire body, particularly the nervous system; and most importantly, they support the entire being\u2014body, mind, and spirit. Giving yourself a massage with warm oil gives you the opportunity to give love and nourishment to yourself. Ancient Ayurvedic texts describe the benefits of massage for the whole body and specifically outline the benefits of applying oil to the scalp, the ears, and the feet. Because Ayurveda considers the scalp, the ears, and the feet to be maps representing the whole body, massaging these areas can positively impact other bodily parts and systems. Ayurvedic teachings recommend a daily self-massage, which need only take about 15 minutes. The rewards include support of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems, proper circulation and lymph drainage, and regular sleep patterns, to name a few. Oil massage stimulates the scalp and promotes lustrous hair. It can also be helpful in the process of aging gracefully. And in Ayurvedic terms, it is of benefit to all three doshas\u2014vata, pitta, and kapha, but especially vata.

Guggulu has the unique ability to deliver herbs deep into the tissues while simultaneously scraping away accumulated toxins. Supporting a healthy metabolism, promoting comfortable joint movement, and maintaining balanced cholesterol levels are just a few of the benefits offered by this incredible herbal resin. While guggulu is a beloved and revered traditional herb, it also faces some ecological challenges. Almost all guggulu resin is harvested from the wild, and global demand has far out-paced the naturally available supply, making genuine guggulu increasingly difficult to come by. The resin of the guggulu tree is only ready to harvest when it reaches maturity, 8 years after the tree is planted, and it does not produce much-it takes the resin of roughly 5 mature guggulu trees to yield 1 lb. of guggulu resin! If the harvesting of the resin is not done with care and proper technique, the tree will die, which further depletes the availability of this precious resource. With the lack of sustainable harvesting practices, and the high demand, it is not surprising that this potent little tree has become threatened in its wild habitat. In an effort to preserve the guggulu species and to help ensure its future in the Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia, Banyan's partners have worked with a farming cooperative in Rajasthan, India to plant several thousand USDA certified organic guggulu trees. These trees are carefully maintained and only tapped when they are fully mature, and the harvest is carried out in a way that allows the trees to continue to live and thrive. We are proud to support this farming project which is one of the first and only organic, cultivated sources of guggulu in the world. It is our hope that many projects are to follow as more and more people become aware of the importance of sustainable sourcing.*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Shatavari has a special affinity to nourishing and supporting the female reproductive system, and ghee is an excellent vehicle for carrying herbs to the deeper tissues of the body. The combination allows for a wonderful way to utilize the full potential of this rejuvenating herb. Ingredients: 6 tablespoons (2 ounces) organic shatavari powder 32 ounces purified water 8 ounces organic ghee (see page 37) Directions: In a pan, combine the shatavari and water and boil the mixture slowly over medium/low heat until the water is reduced to \u00bc (8 ounces/1 cup). This may take an hour or two. Using cheesecloth, or a very fine strainer, strain out the herbs, reserving the liquid. Add the ghee and the shatavari decoction to a pan and cook over low heat until all the water has evaporated. This can take up to 2 hours. Cool and transfer the shatavari ghee to a glass jar with airtight lid.
