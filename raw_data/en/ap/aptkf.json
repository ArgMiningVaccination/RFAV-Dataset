The state's planning is based on guidance from the CDC and the MA COVID-19 Advisory Group. The FDA has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine with emergency use authorization. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is expected to receive emergency use authorization in the upcoming weeks. Fenway Health will follow the [strategic statewide COVID 19 vaccine strategy](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/when-can-i-get-the-covid-19-vaccine) preped by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH). MDPH will determine which vaccine(s) we receive, when we will receive them, and how much we will be given. We will share more information about this as it becomes available to us. It is important to remember that these are new vaccines that we will learn more about daily. Both vaccines are reported to be 94-95% effective in preventing serious illness from COVID-19 after receiving two doses of the same vaccine at the recommended intervals. We currently do not have data to inform us how long this protection may last. Important things to note: - The vaccine will not be mandatory in Massachusetts nor at Fenway Health. - At this time, having a history of COVID infection is not a contraindication to receiving the COVID vaccine. - It is unknown at this time if the vaccine is safe for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding and for children below the age of 16. - Those vaccinated should continue to: - Wear a face mask - Practice hand hygiene - Socially distance through a significant portion of 2021. - Those vaccinated still have the potential to contract COVID-19 - Despite the vaccine preventing serious illness, there may be a small chance that you can still transmit the virus. - The vaccines may help us reach our goal of \"herd immunity.\" This is when a large portion of the community becomes immune to COVID, whether it be via COVID infection or COVID vaccination, making person to person spread unlikely. [Click here to learn about the approach and when you can expect to get a COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.mass.gov/covid-19-vaccine-in-massachusetts). You should make sure that you and your family's vaccinations are up to date, including influenza and pneumonia vaccines to help reduce other vaccine-preventable diseases. Fenway Health provides COVID-19 testing for both symptomatic people and those people with a known COVID-19 contact at our facility located at [1340 Boylston Street in Boston](https://goo.gl/maps/vuWe9tNzFpsxVN6r6). There is no charge to you, but we will collect insurance information for everyone who is insured at the time of registration. [Click here for more information](https://fenwayhealth.org/care/medical/covid-19-testing/). Currently, testing is available from 8:00 AM to 11:20 AM Monday-Friday, weather permitting. Expect a turnaround time is 3-5 days for results. We are unable to test asymptomatic patients at this time, including testing prior to travel or for school/employment routine screening. We are currently only testing Fenway Health patients. If you would like to become a Fenway patient? You can become one by calling 617.927.6000. To diagnose a potential COVID-19 case, healthcare professionals may run tests to rule out influenza and other common infections. Not all healthcare facilities are able to test for COVID-19 at this time. The test involves swabbing the nose and throat, taking saliva and mucus samples, and possibly drawing blood. Looking for testing locations in Boston? The City of Boston has recently published a [ map of COVID-19 testing locations](https://www.boston.gov/departments/public-health-commission/map-covid-19-testing-sites). Testing is free regardless of insurance or immigration status. Additionally, Gov. Baker recently announced an expansion of free testing sites. [Click here to read more](https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-announces-expansion-of-targeted-free-covid-19-testing-sites). All sites require you to call ahead for pre-screening and to schedule an appointment. Hours vary between sites. There are also many hospitals, clinics and drive thru sites across the state that are able to complete testing and all positive results are being reported to the Department of Public Health (DPH). You can find regularly updated information about those sites on [Mass.gov.](https://www.mass.gov/doc/ma-covid-19-testing-sites/download) If you develop any of the following symptoms cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, fever, chills, body aches, diarrhea, loss of smell or taste, and have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19, stay home and call your healthcare provider. Older patients and individuals who have severe underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their healthcare provider early, even if their illness is mild. Seek care immediately if you have severe symptoms such as persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, or bluish lips or face. Your doctor will determine if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and whether you should be tested. Accurate information about COVID and how to best screen for it is rapidly changing. Although the Quest COVID IgG antibody test is available to Fenway Health, we still don't know how to best interpret the results. We don't yet have enough information to know how test results relate to a history of COVID infection, and results may not adequately indicate if you have been infected with COVID, just exposed to COVID, or if you are immune to COVID. Before we give advice on who should be tested, we need to learn more about who it is best for. As a result, we are not recommending testing for most people. If you have questions, we are happy to [schedule a telehealth visit](https://fenwayhealth.org/our-new-telehealth-services/) to discuss if this testing is right for you. Please do keep in mind that guidance regarding testing is likely to change in the upcoming weeks and months. Please check our website for updates on testing. Testing and Home Care: If you are being tested for COVID-19 (coronavirus), this information will help you take care of yourself, your family and any close contacts while you are waiting for results. If you'd like a PDF of all of the information below, you can [access it here](https://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/Testing-handout-10.27.20-002.pdf). Test Results: Results will be available 2-3 days after you are tested. If you have not been contacted, it is because your result is not yet available. If you are a primary care patient at Fenway you will be able to see your results on the Fenway Portal. Text messages are sent out to patients who have negative test results. You can also create an account with Quest Diagnostics to see your results by going to https://myquest.questdiagnstics.com/web/home and click on \"Create Account\" Taking care of yourself: There is no specific treatment for coronavirus at this time. As with other illnesses, the best thing you can do is rest and make sure you drink enough fluids. If you have fever or pain, use Tylenol (acetaminophen) first. If Tylenol is not working you can also use NSAIDS (ibuprofen, naproxen, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories) as long as your doctor has not told you to avoid NSAIDs. You can also take other prescribed medicines unless you have been told not to. Do not take any medicines unless they are prescribed to you. If you have symptoms, please stay home until your test result comes back. Until you receive your test results, or until your symptoms are completely gone, please follow the advice below: Your family and close contacts: People you live with or work with closely are at risk for Coronavirus if you have it. Your household members should stay home for 14 days from your first day of symptoms. They should not go to work or school. If you were at work or elsewhere while you had symptoms, people you were in close contact with (like sharing an office) should stay home for 14 days too. Billing Questions: You should not receive a bill for COVID-19 testing but if you do you can resolve the bill by following these steps: Additional Questions [CDC COVID-19 PRINT RESOURCES](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/print-resources.html?Sort=Date%3A%3Adesc) These materials have been developed to support COVID-19 recommendations.

A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 (an abbreviation of \"coronavirus disease 2019\" where \"CO\" stands for corona, \"VI\" for virus, and \"D\" for disease), is not the same as the [coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html) and cause mild illness, like the common cold. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis. - The CDC recommends that even those who are not sick or showing COVID-19 symptoms wear a cloth face covering to slow the spread of COVID-19. [Click here to read the CDC guidelines.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html). - Continue [excellent, frequent hand-hygiene](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/), washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. - Practice social distancing and maintain a six-foot distance between yourself and others. - Get into the practice of not touching your face. - Make sure you and your family got your [flu shots](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/general-information-about-flu)! There's still time to do this. - Avoid shaking hands\u2014even in a business setting. - If you are sick, stay at home. [Check out these tips from the CDC on what to do if you are sick.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html) - If you have to [cough or sneeze](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/etiquette/coughing_sneezing.html), cough into your elbow or a tissue/handkerchief. - Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces such as tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles, etc. using a disinfecting spray or wipes that are rated to kill viruses as well as bacteria, or a regular household detergent and water. [Check out these guidelines from the CDC.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html) - Encourage anyone who has a cough to use a [facemask](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks).

Certain coronaviruses can infect animals, which occasionally spread from animals to humans, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure: - Fever - Cough - Sore throat - Chest tightness - Shortness of breath - Headache If you are a Fenway patient, please call us if you need help; only call 911 or EMS if you have: Fevers over 102 degrees that don't respond to over the counter fever reducers AND one of the following: - Worsening chest pain despite taking over the counter pain medication OR - Cough associated with bloody sputum OR - Worsening shortness of breath If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel if you have or are being evaluated for COVID-19. If possible, put on a face mask before emergency medical services arrive. Older adults and people who have chronic medical conditions may be higher risk for more serious COVID-19 illness and death. Those potentially at increased risk include: - Older adults - People who have medical conditions like: - Heart disease - Diabetes - Lung disease - Asthma - Pregnant women - HIVPeople with chronic health conditions, including HIV/AIDS, may be at elevated risk of complications should they develop COVID-19. It is now more than ever critically important that PLWH take their HIV medications every day and take other steps to stay healthy, such as eating well, exercising, and avoiding tobacco and other substances. Flu and COVID-19 symptoms are similar and both viruses cause respiratory illness. Why it might be flu: Flu symptoms usually occur more suddenly. Most people with the flu recover in two weeks or less. Why it might be COVID-19: You are more likely to have COVID-19 if you have respiratory symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath) AND one of the following is true: - You recently traveled to a country (such as China, Iran, Italy, Japan, or South Korea) or an area in the U.S. with community spread of the COVID-19 virus - You have been in contact (or were coughed on by) someone who may have COVID-19 - COVID-19 is known to be in your community Many people may have difficulty coping with stress, anxiety, and addiction during times of stress.

We have recently begun holding public events and [have several events scheduled for the the coming months](https://fenwayhealth.org/give/fundraising-events/). As a health care organization, we want to remain vigilant in safeguarding the health of our communities. We are continuously monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and are evaluating all public events based on the current situation. Health insurance carriers are required to provide medically necessary telehealth, testing, counseling, treatment, and vaccination (once it's developed and available) services related to COVID-19 to all Massachusetts residents without charging copays, coinsurance, or deductibles. If you currently have health insurance and have specific questions regarding your health insurance, please contact your provider. We Believe That Everyone Deserves Access To High-Quality, Affordable Health Care Has your employment situation recently changed? Are you and your family currently uninsured? If you live in Massachusetts, Fenway Health can help you enroll in [Commonwealth Care](http://www.commonwealthcarealliance.org/), [MassHealth](https://www.mass.gov/topics/masshealth), and other programs. We can also talk to you about our sliding fee schedule for patients and clients Call us at 617.927.6000 and ask for an appointment with our financial assistance counselors. No one is denied care based on ability to pay. Massachusetts is preparing for the safe, equitable, and effective delivery of an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine. The state's planning is based on guidance from the CDC and the MA COVID-19 Advisory Group. The FDA has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine with emergency use authorization. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is expected to receive emergency use authorization in the upcoming weeks. Fenway Health will follow the [strategic statewide COVID 19 vaccine strategy](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/when-can-i-get-the-covid-19-vaccine) preped by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH). MDPH will determine which vaccine(s) we receive, when we will receive them, and how much we will be given. We will share more information about this as it becomes available to us. It is important to remember that these are new vaccines that we will learn more about daily. Both vaccines are reported to be 94-95% effective in preventing serious illness from COVID-19 after receiving two doses of the same vaccine at the recommended intervals. We currently do not have data to inform us how long this protection may last. Important things to note: - The vaccine will not be mandatory in Massachusetts nor at Fenway Health. - At this time, having a history of COVID infection is not a contraindication to receiving the COVID vaccine. - It is unknown at this time if the vaccine is safe for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding and for children below the age of 16. - Those vaccinated should continue to: - Wear a face mask - Practice hand hygiene - Socially distance through a significant portion of 2021. - Those vaccinated still have the potential to contract COVID-19 - Despite the vaccine preventing serious illness, there may be a small chance that you can still transmit the virus. - The vaccines may help us reach our goal of \"herd immunity.\" This is when a large portion of the community becomes immune to COVID, whether it be via COVID infection or COVID vaccination, making person to person spread unlikely. [Click here to learn about the approach and when you can expect to get a COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.mass.gov/covid-19-vaccine-in-massachusetts). You should make sure that you and your family's vaccinations are up to date, including influenza and pneumonia vaccines to help reduce other vaccine-preventable diseases. Fenway Health provides COVID-19 testing for both symptomatic people and those people with a known COVID-19 contact at our facility located at [1340 Boylston Street in Boston](https://goo.gl/maps/vuWe9tNzFpsxVN6r6). There is no charge to you, but we will collect insurance information for everyone who is insured at the time of registration. [Click here for more information](https://fenwayhealth.org/care/medical/covid-19-testing/). Currently, testing is available from 8:00 AM to 11:20 AM Monday-Friday, weather permitting. Expect a turnaround time is 3-5 days for results. We are unable to test asymptomatic patients at this time, including testing prior to travel or for school/employment routine screening. We are currently only testing Fenway Health patients. If you would like to become a Fenway patient? You can become one by calling 617.927.6000. To diagnose a potential COVID-19 case, healthcare professionals may run tests to rule out influenza and other common infections. Not all healthcare facilities are able to test for COVID-19 at this time. The test involves swabbing the nose and throat, taking saliva and mucus samples, and possibly drawing blood. Looking for testing locations in Boston? The City of Boston has recently published a [ map of COVID-19 testing locations](https://www.boston.gov/departments/public-health-commission/map-covid-19-testing-sites). Testing is free regardless of insurance or immigration status. Additionally, Gov. Baker recently announced an expansion of free testing sites. [Click here to read more](https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-announces-expansion-of-targeted-free-covid-19-testing-sites). All sites require you to call ahead for pre-screening and to schedule an appointment. Hours vary between sites. There are also many hospitals, clinics and drive thru sites across the state that are able to complete testing and all positive results are being reported to the Department of Public Health (DPH). You can find regularly updated information about those sites on [Mass.gov.](https://www.mass.gov/doc/ma-covid-19-testing-sites/download) If you develop any of the following symptoms cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, fever, chills, body aches, diarrhea, loss of smell or taste, and have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19, stay home and call your healthcare provider. Older patients and individuals who have severe underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their healthcare provider early, even if their illness is mild. Seek care immediately if you have severe symptoms such as persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, or bluish lips or face. Your doctor will determine if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and whether you should be tested. Accurate information about COVID and how to best screen for it is rapidly changing. Although the Quest COVID IgG antibody test is available to Fenway Health, we still don't know how to best interpret the results. We don't yet have enough information to know how test results relate to a history of COVID infection, and results may not adequately indicate if you have been infected with COVID, just exposed to COVID, or if you are immune to COVID. Before we give advice on who should be tested, we need to learn more about who it is best for. As a result, we are not recommending testing for most people. If you have questions, we are happy to [schedule a telehealth visit](https://fenwayhealth.org/our-new-telehealth-services/) to discuss if this testing is right for you. Please do keep in mind that guidance regarding testing is likely to change in the upcoming weeks and months. Please check our website for updates on testing. Testing and Home Care: If you are being tested for COVID-19 (coronavirus), this information will help you take care of yourself, your family and any close contacts while you are waiting for results. If you'd like a PDF of all of the information below, you can [access it here](https://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/Testing-handout-10.27.20-002.pdf). Test Results: Results will be available 2-3 days after you are tested. If you have not been contacted, it is because your result is not yet available. If you are a primary care patient at Fenway you will be able to see your results on the Fenway Portal. Text messages are sent out to patients who have negative test results. You can also create an account with Quest Diagnostics to see your results by going to https://myquest.questdiagnstics.com/web/home and click on \"Create Account\" Taking care of yourself: There is no specific treatment for coronavirus at this time. As with other illnesses, the best thing you can do is rest and make sure you drink enough fluids. If you have fever or pain, use Tylenol (acetaminophen) first. If Tylenol is not working you can also use NSAIDS (ibuprofen, naproxen, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories) as long as your doctor has not told you to avoid NSAIDs. You can also take other prescribed medicines unless you have been told not to. Do not take any medicines unless they are prescribed to you. If you have symptoms, please stay home until your test result comes back. Until you receive your test results, or until your symptoms are completely gone, please follow the advice below: Your family and close contacts: People you live with or work with closely are at risk for Coronavirus if you have it. Your household members should stay home for 14 days from your first day of symptoms. They should not go to work or school. If you were at work or elsewhere while you had symptoms, people you were in close contact with (like sharing an office) should stay home for 14 days too. Billing Questions: You should not receive a bill for COVID-19 testing but if you do you can resolve the bill by following these steps: Additional Questions [CDC COVID-19 PRINT RESOURCES](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/print-resources.html?Sort=Date%3A%3Adesc) These materials have been developed to support COVID-19 recommendations.

We appreciate your help in keeping our staff and your community safe from COVID 19. What is COVID-19? A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 (an abbreviation of \"coronavirus disease 2019\" where \"CO\" stands for corona, \"VI\" for virus, and \"D\" for disease), is not the same as the [coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html) and cause mild illness, like the common cold. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis. - The CDC recommends that even those who are not sick or showing COVID-19 symptoms wear a cloth face covering to slow the spread of COVID-19. [Click here to read the CDC guidelines.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html). - Continue [excellent, frequent hand-hygiene](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/), washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. - Practice social distancing and maintain a six-foot distance between yourself and others. - Get into the practice of not touching your face. - Make sure you and your family got your [flu shots](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/general-information-about-flu)!

Certain coronaviruses can infect animals, which occasionally spread from animals to humans, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure: - Fever - Cough - Sore throat - Chest tightness - Shortness of breath - Headache If you are a Fenway patient, please call us if you need help; only call 911 or EMS if you have: Fevers over 102 degrees that don't respond to over the counter fever reducers AND one of the following: - Worsening chest pain despite taking over the counter pain medication OR - Cough associated with bloody sputum OR - Worsening shortness of breath If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel if you have or are being evaluated for COVID-19. If possible, put on a face mask before emergency medical services arrive. Older adults and people who have chronic medical conditions may be higher risk for more serious COVID-19 illness and death. Those potentially at increased risk include: - Older adults - People who have medical conditions like: - Heart disease - Diabetes - Lung disease - Asthma - Pregnant women - HIVPeople with chronic health conditions, including HIV/AIDS, may be at elevated risk of complications should they develop COVID-19. It is now more than ever critically important that PLWH take their HIV medications every day and take other steps to stay healthy, such as eating well, exercising, and avoiding tobacco and other substances. Flu and COVID-19 symptoms are similar and both viruses cause respiratory illness. Why it might be flu: Flu symptoms usually occur more suddenly. Most people with the flu recover in two weeks or less. Why it might be COVID-19: You are more likely to have COVID-19 if you have respiratory symptoms (dry cough, shortness of breath) AND one of the following is true: - You recently traveled to a country (such as China, Iran, Italy, Japan, or South Korea) or an area in the U.S. with community spread of the COVID-19 virus - You have been in contact (or were coughed on by) someone who may have COVID-19 - COVID-19 is known to be in your community Many people may have difficulty coping with stress, anxiety, and addiction during times of stress.
