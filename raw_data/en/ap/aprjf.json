Progression Criteria: - Two weeks post-op. - No wound complications. Phase II (2-6 weeks after surgery): Physical therapy appointments begin one to two visits per week. Goals: Protection of repair and achieve active dorsiflexion (DF) to neutral Precautions: - Post-op weeks 2-3: boot at 20 degrees, sleep in boot, TTWB with crutches, no active DF. - Post-op weeks 3-4: boot at 10 degrees, sleep in boot, TTWB with crutches. - Post-op weeks 4-6: If the pt can reach neutral PF/DF comfortably, then neutral boot with small heel lifts, sleep in boot, WBAT (based on pain, swelling and wound) with crutches and boot, active DF to neutral. Therapeutic Exercises: - Ankle range of motion (ROM) respecting precautions. - Pain-free isometric ankle inversion, eversion, DF and submaximal PF. - Open chain hip and core strengthening. - Cardiovascular upper extremity circuit training. Progression Criteria: - Six weeks post-op. - Pain-free active DF to 0 degrees. - No wound complications. If you have a concern, please consult with Dr. Roe. Phase III (6-8 weeks after surgery): Physical therapy appointments are once a week. Goals: - Normalize gait on level surfaces without boot or heel lift. - Single leg stance with good control for 10 seconds. - Active ROM between 5 degrees of DF and 40 degrees of PF. Precautions: - Slowly wean from boot. Begin by using one to two-inch heel lifts in tennis shoes for short distances on level surfaces and gradually remove heel lifts during the fifth through the eighth week depending on symptoms. - Avoid overstressing the repair (avoid large movements up and down, forceful PF while in a dorsiflexed position, aggressive passive ROM, and impact activities). Therapeutic Exercises: - Frontal and sagittal plane stepping drills (side-step, crossover step, grapevine step). - Active ankle ROM. - Gentle gastroc/soleus stretching. - Static balance exercises (begin in two-foot stance, then two-foot stance on balance board and gradually progress to single-leg stance). - Two-foot standing nose touches. - Ankle strengthening with resistance bands. - Low velocity and partial ROM for functional movements (squat, step back, lunges). - Hip and core strengthening. - Pool exercises if the wound is completely healed. - Cardiovascular upper extremity circuit training. Progression Criteria: - Normal gait mechanics without the boot. - Squat to 30 degrees knee flexion without weight shift. - Single leg stance with good control for 10 seconds. - Active ROM between 5 degrees of dorsiflexion and 40 degrees of plantarflexion. Phase IV (8 weeks after surgery): Physical therapy appointments are once every one to two weeks. Goals: - Normalize gait on all surfaces without boot or heel lift. - Single leg stance with good control for 10 seconds. - Active ROM between 15 degrees of DF and 50 degrees of PF. - Good control and no pain with functional movements, including step-up/down, squats and lunges. Precautions: - Avoid forceful impact activities. - Do not perform exercises that create movement compensations. Therapeutic Exercises: - Frontal and transverse plane agility drills (progress from low velocity to high, then gradually add in sagittal plane drills). - Active ankle ROM. - Gentle gastroc/soleus stretching. - Multi-plane proprioceptive exercises - single-leg stance. - One-foot standing nose touches. - Ankle strengthening - concentric and eccentric gastroc strengthening. - Functional movements (squats, step backs, lunges). - Hip and core strengthening. - Cardiovascular: stationary bike, StairMaster, swimming. Progression Criteria: - Normal gait mechanics without the boot on all surfaces. - Squat and lunge to 70 degrees knee flexion without weight shift. - Single leg stance with good control for 10 seconds. - Active ROM between 15 degrees of dorsiflexion and 50 degrees of plantarflexion. Phase V (usually 4 months after surgery): PT appointments are once every one to two weeks. Goals: - Good control and no pain with sport/work-specific movements, including the impact. Precautions: - Post-activity soreness should resolve within 24 hours. - Limit post-activity swelling. - Avoid running with a limp. Therapeutic Exercises: - Impact control exercises beginning with two feet to two feet, progressing from one foot to the other, and then one foot to the same foot. - Movement control exercises beginning with low velocity, single plane activities and progressing to higher velocity, multi-plane activities. - Sport/work-specific balance and proprioceptive drills. - Hip and core strengthening. - Stretching for patient-specific muscle imbalances. - Cardiovascular: replicate sport/work-specific energy demands. Progression Criteria: - Dynamic neuromuscular control with multi-plane activities, without pain or swelling. "}
