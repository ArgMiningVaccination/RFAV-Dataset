Light was the first matter\u2014or energy. This means that you are essentially surrounded by\u2014and also made of\u2014light. There are actually three major types of Light in this universe: absolute, virtual and polarity. Each of these lights can be applied to produce specific and powerful effects. Join Cyndi Dale, internationally renowned author, healer and intuitive consultant on a unique adventure into cosmology, science, and subtle wisdom. After describing the scientific and subtle energy basis for the existence of three types of light, she will reveal ways to ground this information in your own and others' lives. Her engaging, fun, hands-on delivery will show you how to apply the three types of light for specific spiritual, psychological and physical transformation.
