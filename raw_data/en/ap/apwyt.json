Aromatherapy is the use of fragrances in the form of oils - known as essential oils, as they contain the essence of the plant from which they are taken. You can use oils in the bath (if [heat sensitivity](/a-z/temperature-sensitivity) is not an issue), as a steam inhalation, in an oil burner or with a compress. Aromatherapy is sometimes used with [massage](/a-z/massage) - a few drops of the required essential oils are added to a carrier massage oil. It can also be used as part of a [sleep](/information-support/wellbeing-ms/sleep) routine. There is very little research about the effects of aromatherapy on multiple sclerosis, but it can promote [relaxation](/a-z/relaxation) and wellbeing. In 2021, a small study in Iran looked at the effect of aromatherapy with lavender essential oil on the working memory of women with MS. Two drops of essential oil were placed on a cotton ball, which was placed 5cm away from the nose and inhaled for 10 minutes. This was repeated twice a day for two weeks. Distilled water was used instead of lavender oil in the placebo group. The results showed a significant improvement in working memory in the group which inhaled lavender oil. Aromatherapy oils are usually used with no problems. Some people are allergic to some fragrances and some oils may cause a rash if they are applied directly to the skin.
