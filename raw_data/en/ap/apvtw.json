IV therapy has a variety of benefits for physical and cognitive health and support of the immune system. The amino acid glutathione given through IV Vitamin Therapy in conjunction with Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) can balance oxidative stress. IV therapy delivers 100 percent of nutrients directly into your bloodstream, for superior absorption and more therapeutic results vs. oral supplementation. IV vitamin therapy enables the nutrients to be forced into cells and tissue at higher concentrations. CHAPTER 1 What Is IV Vitamin Therapy? IV vitamin therapy is a non-invasive treatment that delivers select vitamins and minerals directly into the bloodstream. This ensures fast-acting results, ranging from improved immune health to enhanced mental clarity and cognitive function and more. The Procedure Prior to starting IV vitamin therapy, there will be an initial consultation to review your health goals and health history, and even review possible bloodwork to tailor your IV treatment to your needs and goals. At this time, a medical professional will also walk you through what to expect from the procedure, explaining each step and answering any questions. For the infusion, patients will sit in a comfortable chair, with the option of watching television, or just relaxing while the treatment is administered. Treatments range from 10 minutes up to 1 hour depending on type and amount of the IV solution used. When the IV treatment is complete, there is no downtime, and you can resume all normal activities right away. Results After treatments, patients may feel more hydrated, clear minded and energized, in addition to benefiting from a boost to their immune system and cellular health. Costs The cost of IV vitamin therapy will vary based on the type of IV solutions used, and perhaps the region the office is located. At Hyperbaric Medical Solutions, the costs range between $ 125 - 275 for IV Vitamin therapy. CHAPTER 2 Hyperbaric Medical Solutions IV Therapy Offerings One of the most beneficial IV treatments to provide our patients in conjunction with HBOT is glutathione. Glutathione is they body's master antioxidant that plays a key role to many areas of our health and beneficial to administer when patients undergo HBOT to combat free radicals. Another IV treatment we offer is the \"Meyers' Cocktail\", which is a combination of select vitamins and minerals. Read more below, to learn more about these vitamins and minerals and how they benefit our health: Glutathione IV Therapy This nutrient is considered the \"master\" antioxidant, composed of amino acids glutamine, glycine and cysteine, and produced by our cells. The amount created can be impacted by a poor diet, environmental toxins, medications, radiation, stress, and age. When undergoing hyperbaric oxygen treatment, including glutathione IV treatment can ensure the body obtains oxidative balance and is beneficial to have optimal levels of this antioxidant while undergoing treatment. Glutathione has the ability to: - Reduce Oxidative Stress - Improve Insulin Resistance - Boost Circulation - Play a critical role in detoxing our bodies - Fight Infections & Autoimmune Diseases - Lessen Inflammation - Reduce recovery time and helps build more muscle - Increases mental clarity and improves energy metabolism Vitamin C IV Therapy Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) is an antioxidant that plays a key role in preventing oxidative stress and protecting the cells from damage by free radicals. Vitamin C also helps fortify cell structures such as collagen, proteins and DNA. Vitamin C also supports our adrenal glands, helps to improve energy and is critical for immune function including fighting acute or chronic viral and bacterial infections. Vitamin C is also beneficial to improve side effects from chemotherapy and radiation and improves patient experience when taken together. Typically, when taking Vitamin C orally, the body absorbs about 18-20% but when receiving from IV therapy it becomes 100% bioavailable in the body. When administered at a high dose, Vitamin C acts differently than at low dose. At HMS, we often combine HBOT with high-dose intravenous Vitamin C to augment the oxidative state for treating multiple conditions. This process has been shown to enhance the immune response, support wellness, help to neutralize toxins, and often can useful to support conventional cancer care. The National Cancer Institute of the NIH has [recently published on its website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/ras/ras-central/blog/2020/yun-cantley-vitamin-c) positive information regarding using high dose Vitamin C as a treatment for people with cancer, although the FDA has not approved the use of high-dose Vitamin C as a treatment for cancer. Meyers' Cocktail IV Therapy The \"Myers' Cocktail\" is the gold standard of delivering intravenous vitamins and minerals directly to your bloodstream. Dr. Myers, pioneered this use of intravenous vitamin therapy in the 1960's. The nutrients included in the original formula have been modified and currently include calcium, magnesium, multiple Vitamin Bs and Vitamin C, balanced in specific ratios. This solution delivers these key vitamins and minerals directly into the bloodstream, offering superior absorption over oral supplements. The Myers' Cocktail has the ability to boost your immune system against colds, flus, and sinus infections, reduce inflammation and fatigue, and support bone strength and nerve function. Vitamin C Because your body can't produce vitamin C, it's vital you find other ways to get the [recommended daily intake](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/) of 75 mg for women and 90 mg for men. Vitamin C plays an important role to: - Strengthen Immune System Function - Reduce Inflammation - Lower Blood Pressure - Reduce Risk of Heart Disease - Prevent Gout - Improve Iron Absorption - Protect Memory B Vitamins B vitamins used: thiamine (B-1), riboflavin (B-12). These nutrients provide advantages including: - Brain Function & Memory - Nerve Function Protection - Muscle Tone Enhancement - Energy levels and cellular health - Hormone & Cholesterol Production Assistance - Red Blood Cells Stimulation Calcium [Ninety-nine percent](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional/) of the body's calcium supply is stored in the teeth and bones to support its structure and function. The recommended daily intake varies with age, but adults must consume a minimum of about [1,000 mg](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional/) per day. The benefits of this mineral include: - Bone Strength Maintenance - Heart, Muscles & Nerve Function Support - Lower Blood Pressure Magnesium This mineral is integral to more than [300 enzyme](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/) reactions in our bodies and the recommended daily intake of magnesium is 420 mg for men and 320 mg for women, however certain types of food processing can lower magnesium content and many people are deficient. There are a variety of benefits from this mineral: - Supports Bone Health - Controls Glucose & InsulinMaintains Muscle Health - Reduces Risk of Cardiovascular Conditions CHAPTER 3 Safety, Side Effects & Risks IV vitamin therapy is safe and effective, with extremely low risks. Before the treatment is administered, a medical professional will check your vitals, and inquire about your health history. IV therapy may require bloodwork to ensure no contraindications.The entire process is conducted with medical supervision. There are minimal side effects or risks associated with intravenous vitamin therapy. Potential side effects are extremely rare, but can include bruising and pain at the injection site, inflammation of the vein used, potential for allergic reaction. "}
