Why drink milk after taking Lehyam: According to Ayurveda, many of the herbs used in all lehyams, including Chyavanprash are hot in potency. So, to retaliate that, One should drink milk, which, being cold, mitigates the hot potency effect. Milk need not be taken soon along with Chyawanprash. Taking milk in any other time of the day is also fine. Chyawanaprasha can also be taken along with water. Substitute for cow milk are - goat milk, water, fruit juices, amla juice, your regular beverage such as coffee, tea etc. When a teaspoon of Chyawanprash is added to a cup of milk, ideally prepared Cyavanprash should not curdle it.

But it is useful to control fever, cold, cough, sneezing and headache caused due to viral infection. Is Chyawanprash really effective in cough? Infertility treatment Is chyawanprash useful in treating male and female infertility? Chyawanprash is mentioned in the anti-aging - Rasayana chapter of Charaka Samhita. So, the primary purpose of chyawanprash is to delay and reverse the process of aging. This is best, when Panchakarma detoxification is done to the patient first, followed by the administration of Chyawanprash.In the benefits / indication list of chyawanprash, master Charaka has written below lines - - kakatn vddhn bln cgavardhana - Chyawanprash is useful in reviving of the tissues and organs of the injured, old people and children - stru prahara - Chyawanprash acts as an aphrodisiac - ukrasthn doca apyapakarati - Chyawanprash relieves the toxins or defects of the Shukra - male and female reproductive systems. These lines clearly indicate that Chyawanprash is useful in treating male and female infertility. The question is how can it be logically explained? This can be explained both by Ayurveda and modern point of views.Ayurvedic explanation: In the human body, there is a tissue called Rasa Dhatu. It is the nutritious part of food that gets absorbed by the gut and starts circulating all through the body. The menstrual cycle and factors responsible for it are explained as Arthava. Arthava is explained as a sub-tissue of Rasa Dhatu - the circulating nourishing fluid (derived from food digestion). The purpose of Rasayana is to improve the quality of Rasa Dhatu and other tissues of the Chyawanprash, the quality of Rasa dhatu gets upgraded. With it, the sub tissue of it, Arthava - the female infertility factor will also get upgraded. Chyawanprash and male infertility: We just have learnt that Chyawanprash improves the quality of Rasa etc. all body tissues. Shukra - the male and female reproductive system is also one among the Dhatus / tissues of the body. So, with good quality nutrition circulating all over the body, the blood, muscle, fat, bone etc. tissues and even the reproductive tissues also get nourishment and rejuvenation, with Chyawanprash. This is how Chyawanprash is useful in male infertility as well.Modern explanation:Animal studies have concluded that anti-aging therapy with molecules such as Dasatinib, quercetin etc. are proven to slow down and in some instances reverse the age - related fibrosis of the uterus. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7041753/ In one of the anecdotal instances, recorded by Harward genetics professor, Dr David Sinclair, resveratrol etc. products administered as anti- aging supplements in a post-menopausal woman brought her menstrual cycles back, though lab investigations ruled out any type of cancer-causing uterine bleeding. This clearly hints that anti-aging therapy can reverse the age-related changes in the female reproductive system. Resveratrol, an anti aging molecule has shown protection against reduction of fertility with reproductive aging in mice. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23293221/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23293221/) All these suggest that anti-aging therapies of Ayurveda, through Panchakarma and anti-aging medicines such as Chyawanprash definitely are helpful in treating male and female infertility. Chyavanprash variants There are many variants tablet, dabur sona chandi chyawanprash etc. Is there any special benefit in taking them? Well, Chyawanprash in itself is a completely herbal product. Its formula and dosage form has bean determined and sealed by ancient Ayurvedic scholars, many years ago. It is famous because it is ancient and is effective. If you take common chyawanprash, the process of digestion and absorption starts at the level of mouth. It is a jam and starts melting at the level of mouth, with saliva media. but if you take chocolate, the rate of disintegration at the level of mouth is lesser and so, its effectiveness is also lesser. Coming to sonachandi, or any chyawanprash variants - the formula has been sealed by the Masters, and it is the final formula that is good for use. When that is the case, what can be the extra benefit by adding extra herbs? Who has done research on the effect of additionally added ingredients with the already existing ones? So, it is better to prefer the original chyawanprash over any of its variants. Is there anything like Chyawanprash for Vata, Chyawanprash for Pitta and Chyawanprash for Kapha body types? There is no classical reference to such types. The herbal combination in chyawanprash is suitable for all the body types. Its variants based on Doshas (Vata Pitta and Kapha) is nothing more than just a business trick. Milk with Chyavanprash Why milk is preferred with Chyawanprash? During anti aging therapy with Chyawanprash, in ancient times, the person was made to consume Chyavanprash in a very high dose of 48 - 96 grams. Then throughout the day, the person was given milk and cooked rice mixed with milk. Ayurveda encourages every healthy human being, irrespective of age, to drink milk. Milk is said to have the following qualities according to Ayurveda. Jeevaneeya - improves life qualities Rasayana - rejuvenating Medhya - improves intelligence Balya - improves strength and good for patients with a chest injury, tiredness, thirst, at the last stage of fever recovery, bleeding disorder etc. In case of Chyawanprash, and especially in case of Rasayana (rejuvenation therapy), there is a special type of rejuvenation, where in a person stays at a place, and consumes anti ageing agents such as Chyawanprash, and for the rest of the day, he only consumes milk with cooked rice for a specific time period. [This is done only under Ayurvedic medical supervision]. So Ayurveda suggests milk for all. Why milk should be taken along with Chyawanaprash? - Chyawanaprash has its effect to achieve Vata and Kapha balance. - But it is not so effective in achieving Pitta balance. - Hence it is ideal to consume chyavanprash along with milk. - Milk is good for Pitta balance. - Chyawanaprash along with milk makes it a perfect combination to achieve Tridosha balance. - A few may feel a slight burning sensation after taking Chyawanprasam. Taking milk along with Chyavanprash helps to reduce the burning sensation in stomach. [Milk](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2011/06/23/cow-milk-benefits-according-to-ayurveda/)is also a good rejuvenating product, like Chyawanaprasham. Hence milk enhances the quality of chyawanaprash. [Cow Milk](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2011/06/23/cow-milk-benefits-according-to-ayurveda/)also acts as a media to absorb water and fat soluble active herbal principles of Chyawanaprash. Other Co-drinks Co drinks used along with Chyawanprash include: Water - generally good for all. Honey - for Kapha imbalance - asthma, cough, cold, depleted respiratory immunity. Especially good for weight loss. Amla juice - Amla is a coolant. Nullifies excess hot effect Gulkand - It is prepared with rose petals and is cooling in nature. It is useful if chyawanprash is causing burning sensation in the stomach or in the whole body. Milk, almond milk, Pomegranate juice - coolant.

Coffee or tea - good for those in cold climate, seeking improvement in body warmth. Ghee - for those with good digestive strength, seeking weight gain. Fruit juices - based on need and personal choices Tridosha balance Is there any concept of taking Chyawanprash based on Dosha imbalance? Dr Pitta and Kapha. These Doshas can be naturally dominant in different combinations, called Prakriti. These Doshas can also be aggravated in diseases. In both circumstances, if you are taking chyawanprash, the below co-drinks can be helpful to balance down specific Doshas. Chyawanprash for Vata Dosha - A Vata Prakriti person features include - leanness, instability of mind, changing decisions, hoarse voice, weak body, joints, bones, muscles and body tissues. [Learn how to know Prakriti with our 3 hour video course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ayurveda-prakriti-body-type-know-your-dosha-analysis-advice/?referralCode=41D7C79C97C2761C2E53) Vata imbalance disorders are - neurological disorders, joint diseases, etc. Out of all the substances, unctuous, oily liquids balance Vata Dosha effectively. In Vata disorders, a teaspoon of chyawanprash with half a cup of milk, a teaspoon of ghee or sesame oil can be useful. To consume it with ghee or sesame oil, mix Chyavanprash with ghee or oil, make a paste and swallow with lukewarm water, preferably in the evening time, just before food. Evening is the right time, as Vata Dosha is naturally dominant in the last part of the day. Chyavanaprash for Pitta Dosha - A Pitta Prakriti person has hotness in hands and legs, warm body, red-coppery tinge in eyes, palm, feet, high anger, etc. Pitta imbalance disorders are - gastritis, digestive disorders, hypertension, blood and skin related diseases etc. To counter Pitta Dosha, coolant substances are suitable. Hence, a suitable co-drink for Chyawanprash for Pitta balance can be any among these - a cup of milk, a teaspoon of ghee, a teaspoon of coconut oil or a small piece of candy sugar. Afternoon is the right time to take it, as Pitta is naturally dominant there. Another important point to keep in mind is, Some high Pitta people cannot tolerate chyawanprash. So, consult an Ayurveda doctor before taking it. Chyawanprash for Kapha: A Kapha prakriti person is the blessed one, with good immunity, energy, calm mind, slow walking, thinking etc. Kapha increase causes diseases like weak digestion, obesity, diabetes, cough, cold, asthma etc. Chyawanprash can be administered with honey. A teaspoon of honey, mixed with a teaspoon of chyawanprash with cold water. Keep in mind that chyawanprash contains honey as an ingredient and it is naturally suited for people with Kapha body type. So, taking it with a cup of lukewarm water is also good. But do not take it with honey and warm water together. Heating of honey is illegal as per Ayurveda. Now that we are approaching spring season, filled with allergies and Kapha increase, it probably is the best season to take chyawanprash. [What if two doshas are simultaneously aggravated? ](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2018/08/24/how-to-make-chyavanprash/amp/) Vata - Pitta - Migraine, hypertension, blood vessel related disorders, gout etc. Ghee balances both Vata and Pitta together, hence, ghee is ideal.

REad: [How to balance Kapha and Vata?](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2013/08/08/how-to-balance-kapha-vata-dosha-6-factors-to-consider/) Dosha effect Benefits of Chyawanprash on Vata Balance Chyawanprash benefits the body by acting as - rejuvenative and anti-ageing in nature. Chyawanprash helps to reduce the degenerative activity of the body. All these qualities of chyawanprash can be attributed to Vata balance. Hence, Chyawanprash is very good in attaining Vata balance. Chyawanprash for Pitta balance Chyawanprash does not contain many herbs targeted towards Pitta balance, except for a few like [Raisins](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2011/04/19/nutritional-health-benefits-of-grapes-total-ayurveda-details/), . But overall Chyawanprash is slightly hot in nature, hence it does not cause Pitta balance to a great extent. Benefits of Chyawanprash for Kapha balance Chyawanaprash has a lot of herbs targeted towards kapha balance like Dashamoola (group of ten roots), long pepper, cinnamon, cardamom etc. Hence it is very good to achieve Kapha balance. Chyawanprash is mainly targeted towards strengthening the respiratory and gastro-intestinal systems. These are mainly influenced by Kapha. Hence Chyawaprash is very good to achieve Kapha balance. Summary - A few fear that Chyawanprash may cause curdling of milk, because Chyawanaprasha contains Amla and Amla is sour in nature. But properly prepared Chyavanprash does not cause curdling of milk. Anti aging effect How does chyavanaprasam help to get rid of wrinkles? Wrinkles, grey hairs etc are signs of early ageing. Chyawanprash is rich in anti oxidants, and rejuvenating herbs. It is a product categorized under 'Rasayana' - rejuvenation and anti-ageing. From a physiological perspective, the mode of action of Chyawanprash can be explained as below - 1. Delays the ageing of cells. 2. Improves the nutritional levels of body tissues. 3. Improves digestive power 4. Improves oxygen supply to the deeper tissues. Can Chyawanprash be applied to skin a face pack No. It is meant for oral intake. An interesting fact about: Historically Chyawanprash was used for the first time for the rejuvenation of a sage by name Chyawana maharshi. So the name - Chyawanprash. Shelf life, side effects, research 1 - 3 years. Store in a cool dry place. Keep the container tightly closed. Avoid contact with moisture. Presentation: Jar pack of 500 gm. Side Effects Some patients may feel increased heat and burning sensation, heart burn. However, if taken along with milk, in Kapha dominant period of the day (morning), the burning sensation can be minimized, if not nullified. It can increase body heat. Some patients may complain of loose stools. Because it contains sugar, it is best to avoid in diabetic patients, with uncontrolled sugar. Some people have high Pitta naturally. They have excess body heat, sweating, oral ulcers etc. In such people , taking Chyawanprash even with milk may cause boils, excessive heat and skin rashes. Research on Chyawanprash 1. A clinical study on its effect on cognitive, autonomic and respiratory parameters was conducted on 128 individuals. One teaspoon twice a day was administered for 150 days. The study concluded that it is helpful in improving alertness, attention and concentration ( [1](https://www.ijrap.net/admin/php/uploads/1229_pdf.pdf)) 2. Quantification of immunity status was studied with special reference to Rasayana effect of Dabur Chyawanprash. L N Sastry, J & Gupta, Arun Immunity Status of Dabur Chyawanprash -A Review Part-1 (Experimental Studies). Indian Journal of Applied Research. 4. 10.15373/2249555X/FEB2014/131.

Cytogenic activity - a cytogenetic study has been done to investigate the efficacy of Cp against betel quid chewers suffering from oral precancerous lesions through satellite association (SA) assay ( [3](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/joo/2014/864230/)). 4. \"Effect of Chyawanprash and Vitamin C on Glucose Tolerance and Lipoprotein Profile.\" PubMed Abstract. Jan 2001. ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11211574)) Dosage Dose for Divya chyawanprash for kids - Please note that for kids, before giving any medicine, including Chyawanprash, you need to consult a doctor in person. The dose largely depends on their digestive strength. As per Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala - Chyawanprash is safe up to 5 gram/kg body weight. In the case of a normal adult, one jar of 500 gm will last around 1 month. The dose can be increased according to Rasayana procedure, up to 50 gm depending on health and other factors. Is it harmful to take shilajit with chyawanprash? Chyawanprash and [Shilajit ](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2017/10/27/shilajit-uses-test-purification-research/)can be consumed together if your doctor has prescribed it. But because they both are hot in nature, it is best to take Chyawanprash with milk. This will reduce the intensity of heat. How long to continue Chyawanprash? Chyavanprasham throughout the year? How long to continue? Can Chyawanprash be taken throughout the year? For how many years can it be continued? Dr JV Hebbar Chyawanprash is an anti aging medicine made with safe herbs such as amla, cinnamon etc. Technically, it can be taken throughout the year. If you wish to continue taking it for many years, here are some considerations. 1. Because you depend on the market-available Chyawanprash, we cannot be very sure of its ingredients. Hence, if you are planning to take it continuously for many years, it can be taken on alternate days. 2. It can also be taken for 2 months, then give a gap of one month and then continue again for two months and so on. 3. For many, Chyawanprash can show some heating, Pitta aggravating effects. This is not seen in everyone. If you feel heartburn, digestive issues, loose stools, increased burning sensation with chyawanprash, it is better to avoid it during summer and autumn seasons and good to take in other seasons. During summer, weather is very hot, and during autumn, Pitta Dosha is naturally high. Chyawanprash for diabetes The sugar and honey content in Chyawanprash is nullified by the bitter herbs. But it is not good to take Chyawanprash for a person with very high blood sugar levels. If the blood sugar level is under control, then the doctor would advice 3 grams per day, for general health and improving immunity and to provide the body with rich anti oxidants. Review about Sri Dhootapapeshwar Chyawanprash (Ashtavarga) Contains Sodium benzoate as a preservative. Liked by children very much, because of good taste. Effective for persuading kids to take daily, not very best in respiratory conditions. Time to take What is the best time to take Chyawanprash? The best time to take Chyawanprash is - in the morning, 15 minutes before food, a teaspoon to a tablespoonful, based on age, with a cup of milk. Chyawanprash is one of the best medicines used in anti-ageing treatment, called Rasayana therapy. Here, after Panchakarma treatment, the patient is made to take Chyawanprash for a few weeks to a few months time . In the traditional Rasayana - anti ageing therapy, the patient is made to eat chyawanprash replacing the breakfast and is asked to consume milk to quench his thirst. Just a side note here - I suggest not to follow this method on your own as it may produce excess heat. There are lots of other rules and regulations to be followed in this method and should only be done under strict medical supervision. So, taking cue from that method of intake, for a normal person, for general health maintenance purpose, it makes sense to take Chyawanprash in the morning before food with a cup of milk. Chyawanprash mainly improves respiratory immunity. So, for a person with early morning allergies, who suffers from air pollution and pollen allergies throughout the day, or who has more asthma attacks during day time, taking Chyawanprash in the morning is very helpful. Most of the respiratory disorders involve Kapha imbalance. If we divide day time into three equal parts, the morning one third is dominated by Kapha Dosha. Hence, Chyawanprash in the morning is very useful. If one takes it before food, when the digestion strength is more, a maximum amount of phyto-nutrients from Chyawanprash will be absorbed into the body, making the immunity a lot stronger. So, morning, before breakfast with milk is the best time to take Chyawanprash. However, some people, thanks to their busy schedule, may forget to take it in the morning. And a few people get respiratory symptoms during the night. They can take a teaspoon to a tablespoonful of Chyawanprash at night, preferably with a cup of milk, before dinner. So, can Chyawanprash be taken both morning and at night? Unless advised by a doctor, it is not a good idea, because once a day is more than good to take maximum advantage of it. During periods, height increase Can Chyawanprash be taken during periods by women? If the periods are normal with moderate bleeding, Chyawanprash can be continued during periods. But if the periods are heavy, then better to avoid it only during periods. Is it useful to improve height? It strengthens bones and joints. But an increase in height cannot be promised with this. Nasal drip, fungus I tend to get a post-nasal drip when I have Chyavanprash - is this due to its sweet/sour/heavy qualities, or is it due to already vitiated tarpaka kapha? Answer: The post nasal drip that you experience with Chyawanprash might be due to Kapha liquefying, a stage just before Kapha is pacified or expelled out. This can be compared to melting down of Kapha during the Spring season - Vasanta. During winter, Kapha gets Chaya - increase in its own place. It solidifies and stays in its own place. But during Spring, due to increase in temperature, it liquefies and moves to other places. Take Chyawanprash - 30 minutes before breakfast, with half a cup of milk. Another factor is, Chyawanprash, when perfectly made is slightly sour in taste. But companies moderate it to give sweet taste. Try a different brand. This should settle the issue. I tried to make chyawanprash with your steps in the rainy season. But after a week, it caught fungus. Any tips for improvisation? Please note that the end stage is very important. When you think that the chyawanprash heating is to be stopped, take a big tablespoon of chyawanprash and put it into a bucket of water. If it sinks, in one single piece, then it indicates that the chyawanprash heating is to be stopped. If it emits out its parts or it spreads or if it dissolves in water, then you have to heat it further. Another problem area would be the spice powders that are added at the end. If they contain any hidden moisture, then it will eventually catch fungus. Another point is - During the rainy season, it is best not to make any Chyawanprash. Chyavanprash for immunity Chyawanprash has Rasayana effect on all the 7 body tissues. It does not exclude any Dhatu (Tissue). Good immune system is a combination of well-nourished Dhatus, good digestive strength, good mental health. For nourishment Chyawanprash has herbs like Mudgaparni, Mashaparni, Jivaka, Rishabhaka, Amla etc. For good digestive strength - Long pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, etc. For good mental health, it has Kamala, Vidari, Jivanti, Guduchi, ghee etc. Ashtavarga in Chyawanprash As per some manufacturers, they use original Ashtavarga. But it is hard to believe. I cannot guarantee any brand using the original ashtavarga. This is the legal substitute to Ashtavarga herbs as mentioned in Bhavaprakasha - an ancient authentic Ayurvedic text book. Jivaka - acuminata bulbifera - air potato History of Chyawanprash Puloma and Sage Bhrigu were a happily married couple. Puloma conceived and was preparing herself for motherhood. But she was attacked by a Demon during her pregnancy by which, Garbha Chyuti - Premature delivery happened. This lead to the birth of a baby boy. They named the boy as Chyawana (the name is derived from the word Chyuti). Chyawana was interested in the spiritual path but was afflicted with early ageing and many disorders. He prayed and Ashwini Kumaras - Divine Twin Doctors came to his help. They administered a Prasha - herbal jam (linctus), by which Chyawana Maharshi got rid of all his diseases and early ageing. So, he became young again and continued his life successfully. The Prasha (herbal jam) that revived the health of Chyawana sage is called Chyawanprash. It is indicated in treating early ageing.

I was taught that it should not be taken in ama conditions because it needs good agni, which would be low if you are suffering from URTI. Answer: Chyawanprash is not heavy to digest. Though it contains oil, ghee etc, the hot potency of the herbs and spices like long pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, etc make it easily digestible. Herbs like Brihati - Solanum indicum, Kantakari vasica - all these are very powerful herbs for respiratory tract disorders like cough, cold etc. Master Charaka, who has explained Chyawanprash in his Rasayana (anti ageing remedies) chapter, also enlists its usage in diseases like Kasa (cough, cold etc).

Chyawanprash itself is a perfect formula, explained 2500 years ago by Charaka. There is no need to add Gold, silver, bronze, copper, aluminium, plastic, fiber etc to it to make it more potent. It is already a highly potent medicine. In spite of a natural coolant of amla, why is the net effect of Chyawanprash hot? It is due to the inclusion of long pepper, cardamom etc spices and the other Kashayam ingredients. All these are hot and negate out the cold effect of Amla in this formula. Can Chyawanaparsha be taken with milk even in Crohn's disease? Best to consult a doctor directly. Generally, yes, milk or water is fine to take. An ulcerative colitis patient may not tolerate Chyawanprash that well. He may get loose stools. He will need to consult a doctor directly. Chyawanprash as per pala - 48 g of each of the above herb is taken in coarse powder form. It is added with 500 fruits of Amalaki. All together should be boiled in 1 Drona - 12.288 Liters. of water. When it is fully boiled, the decoction and the fruits of Amalaki should be taken out. The fruits of Amalaki, after the removal of seeds, should be fried in 12 Pala - 567 g, of each of ghee and sesame oil. This should be added to the decoction. This paste along with 2.400 kg of (half Tula) sugar (Matsyandika), boiled with the decoction earlier obtained, until it takes the consistency of a linctus (semi solid). When it has cooled down, the below ingredients are added and stirred well. 6 Pala - 288 g of honey; 4 Pala - 192 g of Tugaksiri; 2 Pala - 96 g of Pippali - Long pepper 1 pala - 48 g of each of - Twak - Cinnamon Ela - Cardamom Patra - Cinnamon leaves Keshara - Nagakeshara - Mesua ferrea This is called Cyavana Prasha. Does it contain any heavy metal ingredients? No. Chyawanprash does not contain any heavy metal ingredients such as mercury, lead, arsenic etc. Different formulas Bhaishajya etc have mentioned chyawanprash. Some have mentioned only ghee, and some have mentioned both oil and ghee. Charaka's and Sharangdhara Samhita's versions are most famous. There are a few differences in herbs plus, Charaka has mentioned sesame oil and ghee as the fats. But Sharandhara has mentioned only cow's ghee. Regarding Kakoli, Ksheera Kakoli, Rishabhaka and Jeevaka, there are a lot of confusions. I have just used one such opinion to quote botanical names above. These Ashtavarga Dravyas have been substituted, even in old Ayurvedic traditional text books like Bhavaprakasha. How is BV Pundit's Chywanprash. I used once but found to be of different taste as compared to other brands. BV Pundit is one of the very authentic Ayurvedic companies. They make very good Chyawanprash, without altering the formulas. You might have felt difference in taste of their Chyawanprash, because many companies add extra sugar to make Chyawanprash taste sweet. Why does Chyawanprash contain Sugar? Chyawanprash for gall stones Chyawanprash contains many ingredients that are useful in gall stones. Dashamoola - useful in relieving the gall bladder inflammation Pippali - Long pepper - useful to liquefy gall bladder secretions Pushkaramoola - Inula racemosa - very effective in relieving colic pain Gokshura - useful to reduce the size of stones. It does not mean to say that Chyawanprash can cure all gall stones. It just means that Chyawanprash can be taken by gall bladder stone patients. Jaggery for sugar? Can the sugar of Chyawanprash be substituted with jaggery (sweet molasses)? The two main references of Chyawanprash, both in Charaka Samhita and Sharangdhara samhita explain to use sugar candy - Sita in Chyawanprash. It is unprocessed and no-chemical sugar. Some form of it is available in the market, even today. In ancient times also Sita - white sugar was present. The word sita itself refers to the colour white. It was produced by clarifying the jaggery / molasses. Exact method of preparation is unknown. Sugar candy is relatively easier to digest and is used in many cough and respiratory diseases as a soothing agent. For example, famous Ayurvedic medicines for cold, cough - Sitopaladi churna and talisadi churna contain sugar candy as ingredient. Good thing about jaggery is, it is prepared with natural methods. The problem with jaggery is it is very heavier to digest when compared to sugar candy and it can increase Kapha Dosha. [Read detailed benefits of jaggery](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2013/02/20/jaggery-health-benefits-and-usage-ayurveda-details/) It is not usually recommended when a person is having cold and cough. Out of all the benefits of Chyawanprash, its benefits on respiratory symptoms are the most important. So, jaggery is not a very good choice. But you can choose jaggery over chemical processed sugar, if the jaggery is of better quality. Ingredients change in different brands? Question: I was doing a comparison of herbs in commercially available chyavan prash formulae. I had 2 quick questions for you: 1. the two I compared with your formula (Himalaya and Banyan) have herbs like Ashwagandha (both), Shatavari (both), Guduchi,(both) Indian kudzu (Himalaya), Vetiver (Himalaya) to name a few, added to it that don't exist in the Caraka recipe you posted here. I was wondering if there are different recipes for Chyavanprash in the texts later than Caraka. In addition, Himalaya and Banyan both did not have some of the herbs listed in the caraka recipe you posted. Banyan had very few from the list while Himalaya had most, except the digitata). Now, I am not wondering if some of the names may be synonymous and I have listed them such here because I am not aware of it; or if there are different Chyavanprash recipes available. I understand that some of the Trees such as Aquillaria agallocha may be near extinction and may be replaced with something else? Answer: We really have to ask the manufacturer about the reference for their formula. The Sharangdhara Samhita reference do not contain many ingredients that were mentioned in CHaraka Samhita. My 2nd question is: You have listed 2 Kakoli as Lilium polyphylum): is this actually Ksheera kakoli???? The reference I found on the web differentiates between kakoli and Khshirakakoli Are these similar in their ayurvedic properties? Answer: Both Kakoli and Ksheera Kakoli have similar properties and often the same plant is used in the name of both these herbs. The greater question I have is whether some of the herbs in the Ayurvedic formulae been replaced with others with similar activities over time due to unavailability of the plant or other reasons, and whether this is on-going in the modern formulae as well. If that is so, is there an Ayurvedic society of experts that will validate the swapping of the herbs? Answer: Some of the herbs, especially of Ashtavarga are legally replaced, as mentioned above in the Ashtavarga section. Chyawanprash for depression, Anxiety How can Chyawanprash help in anxiety, depression and stress? Acharya Charaka, while Medha - intelligence Smriti - memory, retention power Kanti - aura, confidence etc. Chyawanprash is a rasayana - anti aging medicine. Acharya Charaka explained benefits of anti aging treatment as - has again explained that... means, anti aging treatment causes drghamyu - improvement in life expectancy smti - memory medhm.. Intelligence etc. It is very clear that Chyawanprash has positive effects on the brain and mind. In fact, a clinical study has been conducted to prove that Chyawanprash improves cognitive functions. ( [1](http://www.ijrap.net/admin/php/uploads/1229_pdf.pdf)) How does it work? Ashwagandha, Vidari and Shatavari, which are legally used as substitutes for Ashtavarga, have positive effects on the brain. Chyawanprash is largely used in the treatment of diseases with breathing difficulties. Pranavata and Udanavata are the two types of Vata Dosha that are responsible for breathing. Pranavata is associated with Chitta - intellect. Udanavata is associated with Prayatna - attempting, trying new things, Urja - energy, enthusiasm, and Smriti - memory and intelligence. Indirectly Chyawanprash promotes these mental functions. Good health with robust immunity is a great supporting factor for a healthy, happy mind. Many people fall into depression due to physical illnesses. Chyawanprash keeps the body healthy and active for a long period of time, thus keeps the health worries away. Weak digestion strength is often another causative factor for depression. Weak digestion strength implies decreased Pachaka Pitta. Decreased Pachaka Pitta can also lead to decrease of other types of Pitta. So, Sadhaka Pitta, which is related with energy, enthusiasm, intelligence, memory, emotional control etc. function is also depleted, leading to anxiety, depression, fearfulness, laziness etc. Chyawanprash contains many spices such as long pepper, cinnamon etc. which improve digestion strength. With all these explanations, it is beyond doubt that Chyawanprash decreases anxiety, depression and improves cognitive functions by improving digestion, metabolism, rate of nutrition absorption and maintaining optimum cellular health. Where to use? When to use? If one has phobia, depression or anxiety, it is not wise to just rely only on Chyawanprash as the only remedy. Like we have learnt, Chyawanprash is helpful in mental disorders that have some strong relationship with physical illnesses. Ayurvedic anti-depressant medicines along with Chyawanprash is a more appropriate combination. Chyawanprash is useful to improve mental health in - Chronic illnesses from which are making the person depressed, as in paralysis, chronic asthma etc. Weak digestion strength and when the nutrition is not properly absorbed, leading to fatigue and lethargy Depression, anxiety, Irritable bowel syndrome Hypertension associated with increased stress Obesity, heart disease, memory issues that are associated with depression and anxiety Excess stress, leading to increased risk of respiratory disorders such as viral infections, rhinitis, bronchitis. Covid-19 is linked with depression.( [2](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02143-7/fulltext)) To improve both immunity and mental strength, chyawanprash is useful.

Will it improve sluggish appetite? Chyawanprash is not the medicine usually preferred to treat constipation. It does not help much in constipation. It improves appetite due to ingredients such as long pepper, cinnamon, cardamom etc. Can it be taken by people who eat non vegetarian food? Yes. Can there be home made chyawanprash? The formula of Chyawanprash is the one which is given by our ancient masters - Charaka, Vagbhata etc. The medicine prepared with those set of ingredients in that particular manner is called Chyawanprash.

Thyroid disorders Is Chyawanprash effective in thyroid hormone imbalance? Though there is no research paper available about the efficacy of chyawanprash in thyroid disorders, the following assumptions are safe to make. a. Hyperthyroidism: An increase in thyroid levels causes symptoms such as mood swings, nervousness, irritability, restlessness, excess sweating, heat intolerance etc. Most of these symptoms suggest towards Pitta Dosha increase. Chyawanprash is naturally a stimulating medicines. It stimulates the organs. Net effect of chyawanprash is hotness. Hence, it is safe to assume that chyawanprash is not very useful in hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism: A decrease in the levels of thyroid hormones leads to symptoms such as weight gain, infertility, fatigue, lethargy, slow body growth, slow heart rate etc. In all these symptoms, the stimulating action of chyawanprash is very useful. Hence, chyawanprash can be an ideal daily supplement for people with hypothyroidism. Auto immune thyroiditis: Ayurveda recommends use of immunity modulating antiaging and anti inflammatory medicines such as chyawanprash in cases such as Auto-immune thyroid disorder. In any disease, including thyroid disorders, it is always best to perform Panchakarma detoxification procedures first and then administer Chyawanprash.
