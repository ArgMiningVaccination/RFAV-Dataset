The simple answer is yes, to a degree, some of the more hands-on work in that book will transfer to a friendly, domesticated cat. However, as every cat owner knows; cats are utterly unique and respond positively to a more gentle, spiritual, physically hands-off yet 'heartfelt' approach - especially those that have gone through trauma and are frightened or stressed. How you as an owner feel influences them greatly. A lot of the techniques benefit from you being grounded and in balance both emotionally and energetically, so I suppose a more accurate title would be 'Energy Medicine for your Cat (and you )'. I have shared my entire life with cats and I hope that sharing some of what I have learned over those many years, will help you deepen the bond with your cat, ease its pain or suffering, optimise the feline self-healing process if it is ill and provide an effective health maintenance if it is well. I hope that you enjoy the read and truly appreciate that you and your love can be your cat's very best medicine. "}
