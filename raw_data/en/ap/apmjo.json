The sessions are led by a variety of top meditation teachers handpicked by Suze for their expertise and empowering techniques. When to meditate is up to you.

Everyone can benefit from a daily meditation practice. The key to lasting success is consistency, so Suze curated a program that is easy enough for a skeptical beginner but inspirational enough for an experienced meditator. Once you experience the benefits of meditation, you'll wonder why you didn't start sooner! I'm too busy to meditate. If you're one of those Type A people who can't ever slow down, you might be surprised to learn that meditation can actually help you be MORE successful and MORE productive. That's because when you're going a thousand miles an hour, so is your brain. The need to cross things off your to-do list probably means your mind is racing from thought to thought, which makes you less productive. But meditating for just a few minutes can bring you back into the present moment so you can refocus your priorities, think before you react, and get more done with better purpose. My mind wanders all over the place. Am I doing it right? Yes! It's a common misconception that you can't meditate because you think too much. We have tens of thousands of thoughts every day. So when your mind wanders, just redirect it to your breathing and keep going. The only time you're not doing it right is if you're sleeping! What's Included in Unstress? - A 21-day guided meditation program featuring top meditation instructors from the Unplug app. - A Getting Started video to help you understand the program. - A 21-day daily meditation calendar so you know exactly which meditation to do each day.
