What Is Acupuncture Therapy? Simply put, acupuncture therapy is based on ancient Chinese theories of the flow of Qi (Energy) and Xue (Blood) through distinct meridians or pathways that cover the body, such as nerves and blood vessels. Ancient theory supports the belief that acupuncture allows energy to flow to areas that need it, and away from areas that have an excess amount of energy. By doing so, acupuncture therapy helps to regulate one's body and restore the energy levels to a harmonious balance. At Integrative Health, we offer a variety of acupuncture therapy services, including: NAET with Cold Laser And More Acupuncture therapy has been known to help with a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to: - Musculoskeletal pain - Stress and anxiety - Migraines - Stroke residuals - Digestive issues - Immune system - Fertility - And more One of the main questions we receive regarding acupuncture therapy is does it hurt? Rest assured, our practitioners use individually packaged, sterilized needles and insert them at specific depths dependent on the patient's body constitution. Generally speaking, you will likely feel some heaviness, distension, tingling, and even an electric sensation, but not pain.
