Introduction NCCIH is committed to the rigorous scientific investigation of natural products used in complementary and integrative health. This Policy establishes guidance on the information required by NCCIH for different types of products used in both mechanistic and clinical research including complex botanical products, complex animal products, probiotics, refined products, and placebos. In the context of this Policy, the term \"natural product\" refers to any substance of natural origin or its synthetic alternative. \"Product integrity,\" as used in this document, refers to the entirety and completeness of information about a product that assures it will meet NCCIH Policy requirements. This information will help provide the investigator and NCCIH with the requisite level of confidence that the research will yield definitive and reproducible results. This Policy is applicable to all Research Grants (e.g., R01, R15, R21), Competitive Renewals, Center Grants (e.g., P01, P50, and their Pilot Projects), Cooperative Agreements (U's), Contracts (N's), Fellowships (F's), Career Awards (K's), and NCCIH's intramural projects. It applies to all study agents not acquired through a competitive process or developed by NCCIH-supported research-grade product development contractors or grantees. The Policy does not apply to Institutional Training Grants (T32, T35). II. Guidance for Investigators A. Information Required in Grant Applications Sufficient product information must be included in the application to allow the peer reviewers to evaluate the significance, feasibility, and scientific strength of the project. Investigators must demonstrate that their investigative team has the appropriate product and analytical expertise to select the test and placebo agents for study and to insure the product integrity. For example, botanists trained in taxonomy may be required to identify [voucher specimens](/research/policies/naturalproduct.htm#VoucherSpecimen) accurately. Experts in natural products chemistry, microbiology, food science, botany, [pharmacognosy](/research/policies/naturalproduct.htm#Pharmacognosy), analytical chemistry, etc., may need to be consulted in order to provide the analytic rigor with which to evaluate product composition. In the Research Strategy section of the application, the following information generally should be included or referenced: - Name of the product (brand name, chemical or taxonomic nomenclature\u2014e.g., genus, species, strain, as applicable) - Ingredients of the product (both active and inactive) - Justification/rationale for the product, including supplier; justification for the chosen form of the product (refined, complex, etc.), including parts to be used (e.g., root, stem, leaf) as applicable, and the vehicle and route of administration (e.g. iv, ip, or po); - Proposed methods for product characterization and standardization - Rationale for selection and percentages of marker compounds, if applicable. The following additional information should be provided for human subject studies: - Justification for the proposed doses/concentrations and dosing schedule - Any known safety issues regarding the chosen product at this dose - Brief description of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the known components of the product and any biological or chemical marker(s) of activity (if known and if applicable) - Description of placebo or vehicle control. B. Considerations for Clinical Trials Regulation of products is strictly the jurisdiction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, NCCIH will not make any interpretations regarding the appropriate regulatory status for a product used in a human patient population. Investigators proposing clinical studies must contact the FDA to determine if an Investigational New Drug (IND) application is necessary. Additional resources for clinical researchers include the FDA Guidance for Industry: Botanical Drug Products and the 2006 CONSORT statement (Annals of Internal Medicine. 2006;144(5):364-367). [The FDA document](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM458484.pdf) (PDF) discusses regulatory policies specific to botanicals and provides information on submitting investigational new drug (IND) applications for botanical drug products. Among the recommendations of the CONSORT statement is a checklist of information that should be included about the intervention when reporting the results. Investigators are encouraged to review these recommendations when designing controlled trials of herbal interventions. III. Product Information A. Background After initial IRG review, applicants with the potential to be supported will be asked by NCCIH to submit additional detailed product information corresponding to the relevant section of this Policy. This notification is a prerequisite for funding, but not a guarantee that an award will be made. The level of detail requested varies depending on the product and its intended use. Submissions in response to this Policy should not exceed 10 pages in length. Requirements listed here may be modified depending on the information available for any particular product. The entirety of the information will be assessed by NCCIH staff in consultation with outside experts where needed. After this evaluation, investigators will be notified whether or not the information is satisfactory. There will be multiple opportunities to submit additional information, if necessary, in order to resolve all issues. Investigators proposing to use products that have been approved for use by NCCIH in earlier studies or who have obtained an IND for their product should contact NCCIH before submitting to determine what additional information, if any, is required. Note: A satisfactory designation by NCCIH does not reflect product endorsement. B. Information for Products Developed During Studies When new products are developed in the course of an award, product information may be required prior to issuance of a non-competitive renewal award. For example, if one of the specific aims of a project was to generate fractions of a plant extract for use in in vitro or in vivo testing, information on the characterization and standardization of those fractions may be required. The Notice of Grant Award may include terms requiring the reporting of product information for such projects. IV. Requested Product Information Investigators should provide the following information upon NCCIH's request. Guidance on five categories of products is provided. If the study product is not included in one of the five categories, you should contact NCCIH staff.

V. Inquiries Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact the NCCIH program director responsible for this Policy, Dr. Craig Hopp ( [hoppdc@mail.nih.gov](mailto:hoppdc@mail.nih.gov), phone: 301-496-5825), to answer questions about the Policy or if your product does not fit into these categories. Alternatively, you may contact the [program director](/grants/contact/) assigned to your grant application. VI. Definitions - Author citation: A convention used in plant taxonomy to cite the person (or people) who first identified a plant species. This appears as an abbreviation, sometimes in parentheses, after the Latin binomial. - Characterization: Procedure(s) that can be used to confirm the authenticity of a product. Techniques may include, but are not limited to, HPLC, UV, MS, IR, NMR, and should, when taken together, generate a unique profile, or \"fingerprint,\" which can be diagnostic for that substance. - Certificates of Analysis: Certificates of Analysis must be provided from reputable, qualified laboratories; preferably laboratories independent of the manufacturer, but analysis by an independent laboratory is not necessarily a requirement. The Certificate should state: (1) product name; (2) date; (3) date of manufacture; (4) lot number; (5) expiration date (time from date of manufacture); (6) fill weight; (7) specification (e.g., physical description, heavy metals, microbiological profile, chemical constituents, etc.); (8) method of analysis; (9) acceptance criteria; (10) result; (11) storage conditions; (12) authorizing signature(s) and date(s). Since product information is submitted to NCCIH prior to grant award, the Certificate of Analysis may be from a product batch produced prior to the batch from which the actual study product will be manufactured. Therefore, the manufacturer's Certificate may suffice but batch-to-batch comparability will be critical. The investigator should plan for analysis of the product at study start to assure conformance to specifications. - Contaminants/impurities: Product contaminants/impurities may be introduced accidentally or purposefully. Appropriate tests for contaminants/impurities should be conducted for the test agent and may include: pesticide, herbicide, value as markers of rancidity; degradation products; and adulterants, such as prescription drugs. - Final Product: The substance that is administered to the in vitro system, animal, or human. It consists of the \"active\" ingredient as well as any solvents, excipients, fillers, buffers, or food with which it is mixed. - Marker: A compound, biologically active or not, within a mixture that can be used to establish the potency or identity of a product. - Monograph: A monograph includes the name of the ingredient or preparation, the definition, packaging, storage, and labeling requirements; and the specification for determining the strength and purity of a substance. The specification consists of a series of tests, procedures for the tests, and acceptance criteria. - Pharmacognosy: Includes the study of the physical, chemical, biochemical, and biological properties of drugs, drug substances, or potential drugs or drug substances of natural origin, as well as the search for new drugs from natural sources. - Prebiotics: Nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth and/or activity of bacteria in the digestive system that are beneficial to the health of the body. - Specifications: Refers to a list of tests, references to analytical or biological procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria, which are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described. Specifications establish a set of criteria to which the test agent should conform in order to be considered acceptable for its intended use. - Standardization: A process intended to increase the reproducibility in the manufacture of a product. - Synbiotics: Products combining probiotics and prebiotics. - U.S. Pharmacopeia: An organization, established in 1820, that contains legally recognized standards of identity, strength, quality, purity, packaging, and labeling for drug substances, dosage forms, and other therapeutic products, including nutritional and dietary supplements. - Voucher specimen: A pressed and dried plant sample that can be stored for future reference.
