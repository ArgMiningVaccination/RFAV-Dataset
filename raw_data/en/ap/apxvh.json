If you're not on the rose quartz bandwagon yet but would like to be, finding where to get the best (and [most ethically sourced](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/man-made-natural-healing-crystals-spiritual-difference)) stones can be overwhelming. And, considering how [comforting and meaningful](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-crystals-for-sleep-help)crystals can be, it's important to get yours from a trusted shop. The problem is that the array of [online crystal retailers](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/occult-stores-nyc)is wide-ranging. Some simply list hundreds of [varieties of stones](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-crystals-for-energy)available for purchase without even providing descriptions of their energetic properties. That might not be intimidating for a seasoned crystal user, but that shopping experience is downright overwhelming for newcomer. AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT On the other hand, there are shops that truly serve and inform their customers. These sites usually feature curated selections and customizable stone sets, and have knowledgeable, mindful founders behind them. Here, we've selected eight of those standout retailers. Read on to find your new favorite store to browse. 1 of 8 [Mystery Mountain](https://www.mystery-mountain.co.uk/) Why we love it: This fourth-generation family business based in the UK came into being when founder Terry Weber took an interest in the healing properties of crystals, herbs, and more. The small brick-and-mortar shop in Dorking, Surrey, may seem humble but the selection is vast. What to buy: Your favorite stone in every plausible shape and size. Seriously, if you want a wand, worry stone, candle holder, or a [hunk of tourmaline that's over a foot high](https://www.mystery-mountain.co.uk/product/giant-black-tourmaline-mountain-piece/), you can find it at Mystery Mountain. 2 of 8 [Sage Goddess](https://www.sagegoddess.com/) Why we love it: This is a great one stop shop for spiritual items of all stripes, thanks in large part to its founder, Dr. Athena Perrakis, who writes in-depth descriptions and usage tips for all of the products on the site. If you don't know what to get when you start browsing, her insight will point you toward the right purchase. What to buy: Sure, regular old crystals are an option at Sage Goddess, but you don't have to stop there. Thanks to the site's wide selection of crystal-infused perfumes, soaps, and candles, your crystal collection doesn't have to stop with the stones themselves \u2014 they can factor into every step of your self-care routine. AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT 3 of 8 [The Hood Witch](http://www.thehoodwitch.com/store) Why we love it: What this shop lacks in a huge selection it makes up for in its curation. Each crystal, whether it's an amethyst point, an obsidian pyramid, or a smoky quartz pendulum, is stocked for a reason, not just because it was lying around. This is a great shop to browse if you're very new to crystals and want a little extra guidance on [what to choose](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/03/192833/bachelor-finale-arie-becca-breakup-paradox-of-choice). What to buy: One of the many varieties of quartz the site has to offer. Although each type has a specific set of properties associated with it, quartz in general is a highly clarifying stone \u2014 and we could all use a little less brain fog. Keep an eye out for the next time the pendulums are restocked, too. 4 of 8 [Energy Muse](https://www.energymuse.com/) love it: Co-founders Heather Askinosie and Timmi Jandro are childhood friends with a passion for crystals as spiritual tools \u2014 not just shiny doodads to brighten up your Insta feed. Even the staunchest crystal skeptic will find something that fits their lifestyle in the Energy Muse shop. What to buy: Advanced users should browse [the latest arrivals fetched](https://www.energymuse.com/tucson-treasures)at the Tucson Gem & Mineral Show, while total beginners should start with Askinosie and Jandro's guidebook, Crystal Muse. 5 of 8 [Rae Kai](https://www.raekai.com/) Why we love it: Rae Kai founder and crystal healer Twila Olson is a major advocate of the healing power of nature. By bringing a piece of outside world into your home (in the form of a crystal), you'll feel more grounded and in-tune with your surroundings. Who would mind that? What to buy: [Crystal grids](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-use-healing-crystals-grid)are easy enough to make yourself, but Rae Kai sells them preset and designed to meet a specific need, like increased focus or creativity. You can even set up a consultation with Olson for a [customized grid](https://www.raekai.com/custom-crystal-grids)made just for you. 6 of 8 [InnerVision Crystals](https://www.innervisioncrystals.net/) Why we love it: This shop's claim to fame might have been its [promotion with crystal aficionado Spencer Pratt](https://www.innervisioncrystals.net/blogs/news/ivc-spencer-pratt-metaphysical-crystal-set), but that's not the only reason it's on our list. Founder Mike Eggleston takes an extremely hands-on approach to his business, visiting the mines that source his crystals, consulting with jewelry makers, and booking in-person consultations with customers. What to buy: [Moldavite](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/matauryn/2017/07/15/moldavite/), a popular stone for its heart-opening and transformative properties, is one of InnerVision's specialties \u2014 take your pick from its vast array of shapes and sizes. 7 of 8 [Moonrise Crystals](https://moonrisecrystals.com/) Why we love it: Thanks to its [\"Earth to pocket\"](https://moonrisecrystals.com/earth-to-pocket/)mission, this shop tells you exactly where your crystals are coming from when you order. As often as possible, founder Julia Abouzelof hand-selects the stones that go up for sale on the site. What to buy: Abouzelof is a font of crystal wisdom, so you're best off reaching out for a [custom-made set of tumbled stones](https://moonrisecrystals.com/crystal-medicine-bags-landing-page/), which she'll assemble based on an email consultation. 8 of 8 [Kacha Stones](https://www.kacha-stones.com/) Why we love it: This Wales-based shop has been working with individual miners to source their stones as ethically and non-violently as possible since 1996. They go the extra mile and store their inventory based on energetic properties in protective oak drawers. What to buy: [Crystals from Namibia's Brandberg Mountain](https://www.kacha-stones.com/brandberg-crystals-c102x2287808), also \"mountain of the gods,\" aren't just rare, they're also dug and extracted by hand, leaving the mountain "}
