Detox bath after vaccines? Anyone do detox baths for baby after vaccines? If so, what do you do? [6 Similar Discussions Found](//www.whattoexpect.com/search?tab=community&q=Detox+bath+after+vaccines%3F) Just epsom salt, baking soda, and coconut oil. We do this when sick also. I mix bentonite clay with water and put uber his foot with a cling wrap to pull heavy metals/toxins. Use a plastic spoon with the clay. thanks I may try this before the bath! very cool idea! I did this to my armpits when I was detoxing them and switched over to natural deodorant I just let my baby's liver detox everything. It's free, easy, and organic! your comment seemed snarky and if it wasn't my bad I'll admit when I'm wrong. And I'm not saying any of this is to fix my liver, its a matter of detoxification or cleansing Some people feel like it helps with this , same reason people go to church or use crystals. It's a matter of belief woah there guy. This post was asking about what steps different moms were taking after vaccines. I wasn't coming after anybody who believes in holistic treatments. I just simply said that I was leaving it up to my baby's liver because that's what livers do. I'm sorry you were ill during your pregnancy. I had a cholestasis scare and had to continually be monitored for my last trimester. Very scary! But my doctor never once mentioned doing a detox bath to treat or prevent cholestasis. Sometimes organs start to malfunction, but an Epson salt bath won't fix it. my liver almost caused my baby's death in the womb because it was making so much bile so unfortunately sometimes are bodies aren't enough and it's nice to share holistic things people are doing as back ups or prevention ... no harm in that right! This is all pointless. None of this stuff has any scientific backing or research. You don't need to \"detox\" your child after they receive a vaccination.... I agree with unhealthy detox for babies or Adults for that matter!! I would never suggest ingesting anything. One poster suggested bentonite clay on feet, it is actually all natural. Probably way safer then some lotions we put on babies lol yes, still not scientifically proven to work. There's no research that says it truly does anything. It's purely anecdotal. Epsom salt isn't going to remove the minimal amount of \"toxins and crap\" from vaccines. Vaccines are fine, your baby is fine, they don't need to detox in epsom salt. have you researched the benefits of natural holistic minerals like epsom salt, I'd be inclined to agree with you if natural additives like that didn't have many benefits upon absorption by the body and, the toxins and crap that's found in vaccines!! I see your point, but baptizing your child isn't going to harm them, I've seen suggested detox ideas on these forums that are not healthy for a baby or person in general. some people might think baptizing your children is pointless ... and has no scientific research! Hey if your one of those people that strictly go by science in your life .. cool!! But let others do what they believe in... YOLO baby to which I said it's pointless... you don't need to detox your child..... nobody said there was... op was asking for advice on detox... - 1 - 1 You May Also Like [PregnancyYour Pregnancy Week-by-Week](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/week-by-week/) [GeneralLearn About What to Expect's Pregnancy 02, 2022 | by CortCort26Has anyone else tried detox baths after vaccines ?
