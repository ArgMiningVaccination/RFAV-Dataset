They have a spirit. Sit quietly near a flower or tree and you will begin to sense its energy and spirit. People who have a true empathy and rapport with the natural world regard these plants as caretakers of health and happiness because they bring healing on all levels-spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical. Plants, trees, and flowers are often seen as sacred beings with divine powers. Each plant and flower has a unique energy, its spirit essence. Flower therapy incorporates the use of specific flowers, using their inspirational beauty to restore harmony to the mind~body~spirit. I have worked with the healing spirits of plants for many years and trained formally in Flower Essence Therapy at American College of Healthcare Sciences. Flower Therapy workshops are also available as well as Bach Flower Essence Consultations. Contact me for scheduling information. \"The actions of certain flowers, shrubs, and trees that grow in the wild raise our vibrations and open our channels for the reception of the Spiritual Self to flood our natures with the particular virtue we need, and wash out from us the fault that is causing harm. They are able, like beautiful music or any glorious uplifting thing that gives us inspiration, to raise our very natures to bring us nearer to our Souls, and by that very act bring us peace and relieve our sufferings. They cure not by attacking the disease, but by flooding our bodies with the beautiful vibrations of our higher nature, in the presence of which disease melts away as snow in the sunshine. There is no true healing unless there is a change in outlook, peace of mind, and inner happiness\" ~Edward Bach Bach Flower Essences Bach flower essences are a simple and completely safe method for all ages, from children to the elderly, of addressing emotional and mental disharmonies through the use of certain wild flowers. The remedies are simply prepared, and there are no side effects or worries of interactions with other medications or health contraindications. The flower remedies are named after their discoverer, Dr. Edward Bach who realized that sickness and disease were not primarily due to physical causes but to some deeper emotional disharmony. The principle to treat the client, not the disease, the basic idea behind the flower remedies. Flower essences can also be used to support your pets wellbeing. How do flower essences work? Most people are familiar with the ways we use the healing properties within a plant to support a body system that is out of balance. When we use herbal remedies and essential oils we are for the most part making use of the physical energy of the plant and its active chemical constituents to aid its assistance in recreating balance in the body. When we use plants in this way the physiological effects they have on the body can be measured, and even though they can be effective you must be cautious that the remedy does not interfere with certain health conditions, age, or any medications that are being taken. Flower remedies make use of vibrational energy. Everything is energy, and contains a vital energy or life force. This vital energy is said to regulate a person's health and these systems are based on the concept that illness and disease result from the disruption in the flow of the vital life force. Reiki, crystals, and other forms of energy work all are based on the same principles. Flower essences can be taken alone or combined with other types of energy work and even herbal remedies. During a consultation here at the studio we would determine what would be best for your individual needs. Bach Flower Essences are also available in the healing boutique here at the studio. \"Let not the simplicity of this method deter you from its use, for you will find the further your researches advance, the greater you will realize the simplicity of all creation\" ~Dr. Edward Bach "}
