But bringing this vaccine to patients is a long, arduous and expensive process. Development and early clinical trials spanned decades and cost more than $15 million. Pelotonia and Fore Cancer Research, as well as government grants, provided dollars for that basic work. This is the sort of medical advance made possible by all those bicyclists and golfers and the volunteers and donors who supported them. Now comes the expensive phase of moving the drug from laboratory to doctor's office. To do this, OSU has partnered with MedVax Technologies Inc., an entrepreneurial biopharmaceutical company that gets an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for the vaccine. It will raise, likely from venture capitalists, about $5 million for a larger round of clinical testing on patients with breast, ovarian and gastric cancers. All have a common denominator: Their cancer is caused by a faulty HER2 gene. About 25 to 30 percent of breast cancers are traced to HER2, which also is the culprit with certain lung, colon and pancreatic cancers. If the vaccine proves effective, extensive, multi-institutional testing would follow, likely requiring the investment of a big pharmaceutical company. If approved for treatment, OSU could reap enormous royalties. \"What we've shown (in the early trials) is that the vaccine is safe, and several metastatic-cancer patients have obtained clinical benefit with little toxicity,\" said Pravin T.P. Kaumaya, who led the development of the vaccine and the trials. He is a professor of obstetrics and gynecology, molecular and cellular biochemistry and microbiology at Ohio State's College of Medicine. Of the first group of 12 patients, eight improved and one has been in remission for 18 months. Those patients, however, were sick to start with. Their cancer had already spread despite chemotherapy, radiation and surgeries. The vaccine had success with people whose immune systems were already badly battered. Imagine how it might work for those whose cancer is just starting to grow \u2014 or could grow someday. \"That is the beauty of what we're doing,\" Kaumaya said. \"A mother who has an over-expression of the HER2 gene ... what we could do is vaccinate the daughter or the sibling who doesn't have the cancer. \"It would be preventative, as well as therapeutic.\" And unlike current drugs, such as Herceptin, the vaccine doesn't require chemotherapy or produce toxic side effects, such as heart damage. It also avoids the problem of drug resistance and expense. Instead of $140,000 for a course of treatment, the vaccine could cost an estimated $200 to $300. \"Stimulating the body's immune system to fight cancer is the Holy Grail of cancer research,\" said Dr. Michael A. Caligiuri, director of the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center and CEO of the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital & Richard J. Solove Research Institute, where the research is being done. \"Our hope is that this partnership with MedVax Technologies will complete this effort and successfully bring these anticancer vaccines into the clinic.\" That's everyone's hope.
