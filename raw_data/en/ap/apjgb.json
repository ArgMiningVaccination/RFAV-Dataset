How We Selected the Best Cholesterol Test Kit To determine which cholesterol test kits to feature, we consulted with experts about the most important factors to consider when choosing cholesterol test kits. Then, we researched dozens of the top recommended cholesterol test kits and evaluated them for reviews, FDA approval, test types, result speeds, types of cholesterol measured, accuracy, and price. The professionals we talked to included: J.D. Zipkin, MD, Chief Medical Officer at GoHealth Urgent Care in New York, New York Spencer Kroll, M.D., Ph.D. FNLA, Board Certified Internal Medicine Specialist and Director of the Northeast Lipid Association based in Marlboro, New Jersey Chun Tang, M.D., from Pall Mall Medical, a private healthcare provider in the UK What to Look for in a Cholesterol Test Kit FDA Approval Only a handful of over-the-counter home cholesterol test kits have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration. These tests are considered almost as accurate as the tests conducted at a doctor's office and sent to a laboratory for evaluation when users follow the instructions correctly. Our experts recommend looking for the \"FDA-approved\" label to ensure that your home results are truly informative and worth the expense. Test Type There are three types of at-home cholesterol test kits. You can use an electronic monitor similar to a glucometer to analyze your blood sample. You can use test strips to read visually by comparing them with a color change chart. You can send your blood sample to a lab and wait to receive your results via mail or email. As Spencer Kroll, M.D., PhD, FNLA explains, \"Home cholesterol testing kits can be an important addition and for some, a replacement to regular cholesterol testing done at a laboratory or in the clinicians' office. At-home cholesterol testing kits are readily available and come in many varieties. At-home testing typically consists of a method for a person to collect a drop of your own blood and various forms of technology for testing the cholesterol levels in that blood on your own. In some cases, there are home testing kits that allow a person to collect their own blood and send it in the mail for the laboratory to do the testing.\" Decide which type of test best suits your needs to narrow down your options easily and effectively. Type of Cholesterol Measured All at-home cholesterol test kits measure total cholesterol, and the more advanced options provide HDL and triglycerides readings as well. Only one of the FDA-approved cholesterol test kits also measures LDL. Pay close attention to what each test measures if you're in need of a more comprehensive analysis, and expect higher price tags on the tests that provide more measurements. Frequently Asked Questions Are cholesterol test kits accurate? Accuracy and reliability vary from test kit to test kit, but there are good at-home testing kits available with reliable and reproducible results. \"Home testing kits rely on a variety of technologies to determine cholesterol levels,\" says Spencer Kroll, M.D., PhD FNLA, Board Certified Internal Medicine Specialist and Director of the Northeast Lipid Association. \"As a result, some are more reliable than others. Traditional commercial laboratory testing of cholesterol requires centrifuging your collected blood and extracting the cholesterol containing proteins from the resulting blood serum. This blood centrifuging can't be done at home. But alternative methods for measuring whole blood, although less reliable, can provide a good estimate of the blood cholesterol components.\"He adds that for more accurate results, cholesterol testing requires 12 hour fasting that must also be done for an at-home test. How often do you need to check your cholesterol? How often you need to check your cholesterol depends on your risk for heart disease. \"The normal recommendation is for low risk people to check their cholesterol for screening purposes every five years,\" says Dr. Kroll. \"But heart disease is the number one killer of Americans and therefore there are lots of people with increased risk as well as millions of Americans with familial heart disease patterns. In the case of someone with increased risk, testing, which could be done by at-home cholesterol tests should be done every year.\"Dr. Kroll says that if there are significant weight changes, significant dietary changes or the introduction of new medications, at-home testing could be done every three months. Any significant change in at home cholesterol levels should be confirmed by a commercial laboratory, he adds.
