Hers is the first face many see when they arrive at Yale New Haven Health pediatric emergency departments in New Haven and Greenwich. She also has been a leading administrator at the School of Medicine and the health system. Karen Santucci A career of treating young patients and seeing that emergency rooms run well Karen Santucci, MD, professor of pediat - rics (emergency medicine) and of emer - gency medicine, usually has two things in her purse: dollar store items, and snacks. Both carry important significance to her work in the pediatric department at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital, where she performs several roles including section chief of emergency medicine and interim section chief of pediatric oncology and hematology. She also is vice chair for clinical affairs in the Department of Pedi - atrics at the School of Medicine. The snacks she keeps with her are for meetings or shifts in the emergency department, to keep everyone energized. The dollar store items she uses as props and prizes during her Friday rounds, which she calls TGIIFF\u2014Team Gathering Innova - tion, Information, Facts, and Fun. Providing for her team and her patients is a corner - stone of Santucci's professional career. Born near New York City, Santucci was the first in her family to go to college and the first to pursue medicine. She credits watching her firefighter father as early exposure to the world of emergency care. Santucci received her BS in biology from the College of Mount Saint Vincent. But she almost did not go to medical school\u2014her college advisor urged her not to apply, saying that she wouldn't get in. She accepted a teaching fellowship at New York University instead. Halfway through the year she realized that medicine still called to her, and decided to apply to New York-based medical schools. She was accepted to the State Univer - sity of New York Downstate College of Medicine, where she also completed her residency before moving to Providence, Rhode Island, to complete a fellowship at Hasbro Children's Hospital.Santucci always had an interest in pediatrics, but ultimately chose pediatric emergency medicine because she knew that was the only way she could leave some of her work \"at the office.\" \"I knew I had to control when I had patient exposure because I get very invested in them,\" she says. \"Having trusted colleagues to whom I can pass the baton at the end of a shift was a way to have everything in the hospital, but have a family too.\" Santucci came to Yale in 1999. That same year she helped design and launch a pediatric emergency medicine fellowship program, which now receives more than 100 applicants a year for two available positions. And that was just the beginning of her influence in the department. Santucci has been section chief of pediatric emergency medicine since 2010, and until recently served as medical director of emergency pediatrics, before transitioning to vice chair of clinical affairs. Two and a half years ago she was also asked to start a pediatric emergency medicine program at Greenwich Hos - pital, which is part of Yale New Haven Health. It went live in November 2018. Santucci is supported by 12 pediatric emergency physicians from Yale New Haven Children's Hospital, and says the program is performing extremely well. \"Watching other community hospi - tals, we recognized over the years that strength in recruiting and retention cor - relates with having the academic affili - ation with Yale,\" she says. \"It's really a landmark event to have 13 of us from Yale working at Greenwich and representing Yale School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Children's Hospital.\" Santucci's efforts in Greenwich were recognized this past May, when she was honored at Greenwich Hospital's annual Under the Stars event. But in keeping with her low-key style, she credits most of her success\u2014and the emergency department's achievements\u2014 to her col - leagues. \"I work with absolute giants,\" she says. \"They're amazing people, and I would do just about anything for them.\" The same goes for her patients. Pedi - atric emergency medicine presents its own special sets of challenges, she says, due to how young incoming patients are and, oftentimes, their fear of doctors. The right knee of Santucci's scrubs is often worn thin from the amount of time she spends kneeling next to beds, com - forting both patients and their families. But she also finds treating children to be a more hopeful endeavor than treating some adults. \"One of the beautiful things about pedi - atric emergency medicine is that we're getting to these children early enough that we might actually be able to change a trajectory,\" she says. \"There's a very dif - ferent illness set on the adult side.\" When she is not in the emergency department, Santucci is running between her offices, juggling her administra - tive roles. It has been a little tricky, she admits, since she now spends half her time in Greenwich. She is putting in 80-90 hour weeks. Luckily her family, including her husband and two children aged 23 and 18, are very understanding. \"My kids are very supportive of the fact that when I'm not able to be at home, it's because I'm off taking care of someone else's child who needs help,\" she says. So far, her two hospital schedules have rarely conflicted, save one evening when Santucci was called by the emergency department at Greenwich when she was on shift at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital. When she finally arrived in Greenwich, a bit flustered but only a few minutes late, she says the staff there had only one question for her: \"Does this mean you didn't bring snacks?\" Care when a child has a sudden need Kevin G.

The aim is to enroll more than 100,000 patients in and near Connecticut, whose DNA will then be analyzed by Yale scientists to develop useful data for predicting, prevent - ing, and treating what may eventually be hundreds of gene- related conditions. Its architects envision Generations as a benefit to both the clinic and the laboratory. Its most immediate application may be for the actual volunteers who donate blood samples for analysis. If their genetic information suggests elevated risk for specific conditions related to cardiac disease or cancer\u2014condi - tions that are considered \"actionable\" by the medical commu - nity\u2014health professionals at Generations will inform them. \"What we can do right now is we can give back to 2% to 3% of people information that they wouldn't otherwise know about serious life-threatening risks that they can do something about. That's revolutionary,\" says Michael F. Murray, MD, professor of genetics and director of clinical operations for Yale's Center for Genomic Health, who is in charge of Generations. Murray was recruited to Yale after building a similar program at Geisinger Health System in Danville, Pennsylva - nia. He says genomic information collected there indicating elevated breast cancer risk was revealing. \"We have very clear examples of some patients who had cancer detected at a very early stage, and cured, and will never have to suffer with the disease. That's life changing for them.\" Changing the lives of people with conditions unrelated to cancer or heart disease will take longer. For instance, since effective therapies do not yet exist for Alzheimer's, volunteer donors will get no information on their risk for that. \"We can't currently intervene on Alzheimer's,\" says Murray. \"There is no treatment or prevention for it.\" Generations will only inform volunteer donors of their genetic risk when research makes a condition treatable. For this year's donors, that could mean being notified years from now. \"There are 20,000 genes,\" says Murray. We're giving back information on between 10 and 100 genes. That leaves more than 99% that we're not attending to because we don't know what to do yet about conditions they might cause.\" Murray says Yale's location will produce a scientifically meaningful cohort of participants. \"Connecticut is the fourth closest match to the U.S. population in the census data for eth - nicity and race,\" he notes. \"This is a great place to pilot genomic medicine.\" That, he says, will allow Generations to make great strides in a field where existing data tend to be skewed. \"The datasets are very biased toward Europeans. We know that could mean missed opportunities when you try to apply that information to somebody from a different part of the world.\" As patterns related to specific diseases and demographic groups are found, Yale practitioners will then put their find - ings into practice for patients of Yale Medicine and the Yale New Haven Health System. \"We learn from every patient whom we treat within the health center,\" says Brian R. Smith, MD, professor and chair of laboratory medicine, deputy dean for scientific affairs, co-director of the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation, and co-principal investigator of the Yale Clini - cal and Translational Science Award Program. \"As a conse - quence of that, we do a better job with the next patient we treat, and on and on.\" One exciting thing to learn will be why certain people who carry a disease-causing gene mutation do not become ill. \"I think a big question is why some people with the same mu - tation get a disease and others don't,\" says Antonio Giraldez, PhD, chair and Fergus F. Wallace Professor of Genetics, who says evaluating healthy people will be as important as analyz - ing those who have symptoms. \"If you only study the people who have the disease, you cannot discover what protects you.\" Clinical trials and other patient studies will also be more efficient to construct because potential participants are al - ready in the database.

Jacoby, Ed - ward J. Miller, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine and radiology, and Nikolaus Papoutsidakis MD, PhD, instructor of medicine (cardiology), are also investigating how the con - dition progresses. They anticipate that data from Generations will be a foundation for that work. Jacoby notes that the condition, which disproportion - ately affects African Americans, is often misdiagnosed as hypertensive heart disease and treated as such. \"The usual medications that are used to treat heart failure don't actually work in cardiac amyloidosis,\" he says. \"Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors can make things worse.\" Jacoby expects the Generations information to be life- enhancing, by minimizing misdiagnoses and symptoms that go untreated while steering treatment in the right direction. \"If you're 25 years old and you go into the Generations Project and you find out you have the associated mutation, a couple of things are going to happen. One is you're going to know, and we'll keep close tabs. If something starts to come up, we can begin treatment right away. Second, there's a fair chance that one of your parents will have the gene, and, in fact, have some clinical problems related to it that they may not previously have been aware of. And they'll be able to get treatment.\" \"I think genetic discovery within the next five to 10 years will become as routine as a blood test at birth\" Giraldez says. He predicts that childhood maladies could also become a prime focus. \"That might be ADHD, autism, or other genetic conditions, which present more suddenly and can have ir - reversible effects if not treated promptly. It is hard for a family to learn that, but it's also hard when you have to jump from doctor to doctor for a diagnosis or when some kids might not be easily diagnosed.\" Genomic analysis may also help clinicians customize medication Pulk, PharmD, clinical coordi - nator for pharmacogenomics at Yale New Haven Health, looks forward to providing actionable results that can improve care. \"Genes linked to metabolic and transporter pathways have known population based variations that affect medications,\" she explains. \"An example finding would be the DPYD gene which codes for the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydro - genase. Fluorouracil, a chemotherapy used in GI and breast malignancies, relies entirely on this enzyme for clearance. Patients receiving fluorouracil who genetically do not produce functional versions of this enzyme are at risk of life-threatening bone marrow toxicity. Through identification of those at risk for toxicity, lower doses or alternative treatments can be used.\" Generations builds on a heritage of genetics-related firsts at Yale School of Medicine. Robert J. Alpern, MD, dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine, notes that \"Yale actually had the foresight decades and decades ago to form the first de - partment of genetics in the country.\" Now, he says, \"we have the ability to tie it all together, and really participate in what is going to be a revolution in health care, and we're really look - ing forward to being a part of it.\" In the words of Antonio Giraldez, who led the recruit - ment of Michael Murray to Yale, \"When we look back at this in 10 or 20 years, it will have been transformative.\"advances Health & Science News Headway is made on averting renal cysts Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), in which the heart muscle grows too thick and contracts too hard, is often caused by mutations in the cardiac form of the muscle protein myosin. But Stuart Campbell, PhD, associate professor of biomedical engineering and of cellular and molecular physiology, suspected that changes to the extracellular matrix (ECM), the scaffolding that supports cells, might contribute to HCM. To test that hypothesis, Campbell and his team took diseased heart muscle from pigs that serve as animal models of HCM, chemically removed the cells, and seeded the decellular - ized and diseased matrix\u2014as well as a control matrix from healthy pigs\u2014with healthy human heart cells generated in cell culture. As Campbell and his team reported July 24 in JACC: Basic to Translational Science , the diseased matrix was stiffer than its healthy counterpart, and the tissue that resulted from the seeding of healthy cells onto diseased matrix ex - hibited the contractile defects of HCM. The stiff diseased matrix may have triggered the hypercontractility in the healthy heart cells, the authors suggest. Future work will investigate how the ECM affects contractility, Campbell says.New clues to heart muscle thickeningYale researchers have discovered how the polycystin 2 (PC2) gene alters the energy status of cells when PC2 is mutated to cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), an inherited condition with no cure. Barbara Ehrlich, PhD, professor of pharmacology and of cellular and molecular physiology, and colleagues used high resolution microscopy as well as animal models to study the impact of PC2 mutations on mitochon - dria, which generate cellular energy. They discovered that PC2 normally acts to limit the physical interac - tions between the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2014another cellular organelle where proteins are produced and modified. When PC2 is mutated, the team reported May 7 in Science Signaling , interactions between the ER and mitochondria increase. This leads to more signaling on the surface of the mitochondria, more energy production, more mitochon - dria, and\u2014in response to the increased energy\u2014proliferation of kidney cells to form harmful cysts. Blocking the excess energy production in mito - chondria, Ehrlich and her colleagues found, stopped the production of new cells in cysts. 4www.medicineatyale.org May 6 At a launch event for Elevate , a new policy labora - tory housed in the Yale Child Study Center in collaboration with Women's Health Research at Yale, Chelsea Clinton , vice chair of the Clinton Foundation, participated in a panel discus - sion with Megan Smith , DrPH, (left), associate professor of psychiatry and in the Yale Child Study Center; and Kelvin Chan , PhD, (right), director of the Robin Hood Foundation's Fund for Early Learning.

Medicine @YaleNovember/December 20195their opening. In studies of guinea pigs, Fikrig's lab has already found that the animals can resist tick bites based on immunity to proteins that the tick produces in the first 24 hours of attachment. Such immunity not only prevents the tick from feeding, but also impairs infection with Borrelia . That discovery lines up with another line of evidence from people living in areas endemic to Lyme disease: Those who have been bitten often by ticks that don't carry Borrelia seem to acquire some protection from the parasites over time. \"Many will tell you ticks don't bite them as well as they used to,\" Fikrig says. These people's bodies may be creating anti - bodies to the ticks' salivary proteins. Fikrig's lab is currently examining thousands of tick-saliva proteins to find the most promising targets. Once they have cloned 15 to 20, the team will begin testing them in animal models. \"This is an innovative approach to stopping Lyme infection, which remains very difficult both to diagnose accurately and to treat effectively,\" says Alexandra Cohen, who launched the Cohen Lyme & Tickborne Disease Initiative in 2015. \"Lyme is one of the fastest-growing diseases in the United States and is terribly debilitating for far too many people who are infected.\" Instead of targeting the Lyme bacterium, the goal is to block the mechanism of infection The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foun - dation has pledged $1.8 million over three years to fund Lyme and tickborne disease research by Erol Fikrig, MD, Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor of Medicine (Infectious Diseases) and professor of epidemiology (microbial diseases) and of microbial pathogen - esis. The gift will fund Fikrig's novel approach to developing an anti-tick vaccine. Instead of trying to target the Lyme disease-causing bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, as other approaches have, Fikrig plans to target the Ixodes tick that spreads disease, essentially by stymieing the tick's ability to take a blood meal. \"The Steven & Alexandra Co - hen Foundation has provided good resources, so we can go at it full steam ahead,\" says Fikrig, an expert in dis - eases spread by insects and ticks who also is chief of the Infectious Diseases Section of the Department of Inter- nal Medicine and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. \"Let's say you're drinking a drink out of a straw, and the straw gets clogged,\" Fikrig explains. \"That's what we're trying to work on\u2014blocking [the tick] from feeding.\" When ticks first bite, they inject proteins that prepare a favorable environment for a meal\u2014the event during which various pathogens can be transmitted to the host. These proteins block blood clotting, inflammation, and immune responses. Fikrig's vaccine would prevent them from functioning, encouraging the tick to give up, drop off, and look for another mammal to bite. Unlike with a mosquito, which can inject pathogens immediately after bit - ing, it takes a tick up to 48 hours after biting before introducing Borrelia into the host. That delay gives researchers A gift funds innovative Lyme research Approximately 300,000 people contract Lyme disease in the U.S. each year, and the numbers are thought to be increasing. Most live in the North - east and upper Midwest, a distribution likely to expand with climate change. The disease can cause short-term flulike symptoms and rash; over the long term, it can cause facial paralysis; arthritis; inflammation of the heart, brain, or spinal cord; and fatigue, among other problems. Symptoms can persist long after antibiotic treatment. A previous human Lyme vaccine called LYMERix that targeted Borrelia burgdorferi sold poorly and was with - drawn from the market in 2002. Since its inception in 2001, the Stamford, Connecticut-based Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation has funded projects in multiple areas, in - cluding Lyme and tickborne disease, underserved communities, children's health and education, the arts, and sustainability. Inspired by Alexan - dra Cohen's personal struggle with Lyme disease, the foundation has committed over $60 million to more than two dozen projects addressing prevention, diagnosis, treatment, education, and ecology. With support from the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation, Erol Fikrig is taking a novel approach to preventing ticks from spreading Lyme disease. harold shapiroadvances Health & Science News A new approach to insulin regulation In a recent clinical trial, combining the rarely used cancer drug cediranib with the more mainstream drug ol - apraib treated recurrent ovarian cancer better than olaparib alone\u2014a surpris - ing finding. Now, Yale researchers have discovered exactly how cediranib works and why it might be useful in combination with other treatments. The team, led by Peter M. Glazer, MD, PhD, chair and Robert E. Hunter Professor of Therapeutic Radiology, and professor of genetics, studied the drug using isolated human cancer cells as well as human tumors in mice. They found that cediranib, in addition to its known role in blocking blood vessel formation, also stops a cellular program called homology-directed DNA repair. Tumor cells rely on this program to repair their DNA when it is damaged by such treatments as radiation or chemotherapy. While other drugs block molecules involved in homology-directed DNA repair, cediranib works at an earlier stage, affecting the expression of genes involved in the process, the re - searchers reported May 15 in Science Translational Medicine . Combining cediranib with DNA- damaging agents could deliver a double blow to cancer cells, the new results suggest.Drug may have an ovarian cancer roleWhen blood sugar rises, beta cells in the pancreas release insulin, causing cells to take in more glucose and keep - ing blood sugar levels steady. Problems with this feedback mechanism can result in such metabolic disorders as diabetes and hypoglycemia. Scientists already knew that ATP, cellular fuel produced through glucose breakdown, triggers insulin release, and since the oxidative phosphorylation step (OxPhos) in glucose metabolism produces significant ATP, OxPhos was thought to regulate insulin secretion. However, research led by Richard G. Kibbey, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine, indicates that another product of glucose metabolism, mito - chondrial GTP (mtGTP), does the same thing\u2014independent of OxPhos. As reported July 16 in Cell Reports , when Kibbey's team overexpressed the protein that makes mtGTP in beta cells, insulin levels increased in vitro. In mice overexpressing the mtGTP progenitor protein, insulin levels also rose, and blood sugar levels dropped. mtGTP also appeared to protect beta cells from metabolic stress. Kibbey says these results point to the mtGTP pathway as a promising new target for diabetes drugs.

In his role as chair at Yale, he will succeed Jon S. Morrow, PhD, MD, chair and Ray - mond Yesner Professor of Pathology. Liu is motivated by a desire to bring the most innovative research to medicine. He says he chose to special - ize in pathology \"because it's really a bridge department. You can do trans - formational research, bringing discov - ery to the bedside, and the bedside to discovery. That's the part that really excited me.\" As a well-recognized gastrointes - tinal and liver pathologist, he provides expert consultations for physicians and patients. He has several patents and pending applications for his research, which focuses on the epigenetic driv - ers that cause liver cancer in a virally infected or alcohol-exposed liver. This work has contributed to the understand - ing of liver cancer carcinogenesis and biomarker discovery for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets. He also is using immunotherapy to treat liver cancer, specifically engineering T cells and nat - ural killer (NK) cells to boost their anti- cancer activity, which will soon be tested in a clinical trial. His research programs have been continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies since 2003. At Rutgers, Liu led the integration of pathology and dermatology programs, expanded dermatology clinics, and increased the size of the dermatology residency program. He also established the Immunology Division, the Center // Chair (page 1) for Medical Microbiology, and the Center for the Studies of Stillbirth and Early Infant Death. During the past four years, the department doubled the number of faculty, and significantly in - creased clinical revenue, NIH funding, and academic productivity. Liu is a lifetime fellow of the Col - lege of American Pathologists and a two-time recipient of the Technology Innovator Award from the University of Florida. He has received awards for teaching and mentoring from the University of Florida, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and NIH. At Yale, he plans to continue to pur - sue innovative research while educating the next generation of investigators and physicians. His goal is to provide ex - ceptional patient-centered care and cap - ture new opportunities in the changing health care landscape. \"Yale's Depart - ment of Pathology has a great reputa - tion and a group of very distinguished world-class faculty and staff,\" Liu says. \"With that foundation, I think we can further elevate its distinction nationally and internationally.\"6www.medicineatyale.orgGrants and contracts awarded to Yale School of Medicine July 2018-March 2019 Federal Clara Abraham , NIH, Functional Outcomes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Associated Vari - ants , 4 years, $2,294,633 Fuad Abujarad , NIH, Feasibility of Virtual cOaching in making Informed Choices on Elder Mistreatment Self- Disclosure (VOICES ), 3.6 years, $1,494,862 Molecular Tsetse and Trypanosome Transmission , 5 years, $4,103,771 Christopher Anderson, NIH, Human Tissue Engineered Pulsatile Con - duits Using Engineered Heart Tissue of Defined Composition and Fiber Orientation , 3 years, $133,572 Amy Arnsten , NIH, Preclini - cal Assessment of GCPII Inhibitors for Cogni - tion and Tau Pathology , 4.8 years, $3,755,936 Paul Aronson, DHHS, Development and Pilot Trial of a Web-Based Tool to Facilitate Shared Decision-Making with Parents of Febrile Infants , 3 years, $460,170 Aronson, Stefan Somlo, Francis Wilson , NIH, George M.

The building's work areas, 53,000 square feet total, are more than triple the combined space of CSC's three prior facilities, which were on York and Temple Streets and on South Frontage Road. Linda C. Mayes, MD, Arnold Gesell Professor of Child Psychiatry, Pediatrics, and Psychology, and chair of the CSC, says the larger size is just one of its advantages. \"Before, our families had to come to different sites. A family might go to one building, and then they would have to come all the way to another building,\" she explains. We also have room for growth. And we bring programs together that heretofore did not have the opportu - nity to collaborate.\" At the official ribbon-cutting on October 4, Robert J. Alpern, MD, dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine, said the building is a space transformed. He recalled first seeing it a few years ago, \"when it was a building that the telephone company used for phone lines and it had no windows and it looked like a bunker.\" Now there are large windows on all sides, along with original artwork, books donated by Scholastic Pub - lishing, plus well-placed lighting and other architectural touches by the firm of Svigals + Partners that enhance the quality of the care being delivered. \"This will really be the home that the Child Study Center has always deserved,\" Alpern proclaimed. Marna Borgstrom, CEO of Yale New Haven Health, celebrated the opening as one more example of the seamlessness of care between the hospital system and the School of Medicine. \"Our patients see us as one organization, and Linda [Mayes] has been key to helping to lead this transformation for the entire medical center,\" Borgstrom said. \"We owe her incredible gratitude because I don't think we would be here without her.\" The children of New Haven and nearby communities will be very well served, said New Haven Mayor Toni Harp. \"The children who come here deserve space that lets them know that you respect them, that you have high expectations, and that they're going to be better because they came here.\" \"You stood up for the principle long before it became fashionable, that given the chance every child The Yale Child Study Center has consolidated its clinical and community-based operations, formerly divided among several New Haven locations, into a single building at 350 George Street. With modern lighting and other innovative design features, the new facility has been praised as especially welcom - ing for young patients and their families. Dean Robert Alpern praises it as \"the home that the Child Study Center has always deserved.\"Child Study Center brings clinical care under one roof robert a. lisak \"Clinicians and scholars in those dif - ferent sites had fewer opportunities to interact with and learn from one another. Bringing everyone together in one space allows them to work together more effectively. It's giving patients one door to come through. in America can learn and succeed,\" added U.S. Representative Rosa DeLauro. \"That is what you will continue to do at this facility.\" Mayes says it is great to see the excited look on children's faces as they walk through the doors of the new space. \"That's why we did it. I feel that's what makes it worthwhile,\" she says. \"I think it's the respect they feel by the beauty of it. It doesn't feel traditionally medical. It feels welcom - ing and caring.\" Erin Warnick, PhD, associate research scientist and CSC's lead of clinical operations, organized the planning effort for what was a massive project. \"We imagined, how could we build a space that really supports the work that we're doing for our community?\" Warnick said at the ribbon-cutting. \"Thank you across the board to all the members of our community who contributed big ideas, little ideas. As you walk through the space, you can see that all of these ideas were incorporated into the plans because each of them made a difference and each of those contributions serves to create what this space really is today.\" Approximately 225 people will work in the new facility, includ - ing physicians, psychologists, social workers, pediatricians, and staff. The building will also be home to the Center for Emotional Intelligence, which previously occupied space on Edwards Street, as well as all of the Child Study Center's in-home programs, the MOMS Partnership, and Elevate, a policy lab. The Yale Child Study Center receives approxi - mately 60,000 patient visits each year. CSC's research operations and administration remain at 230 South Frontage Road. and technol - ogy to alleviate autoimmune dis - orders, improving lives of patients and families. \"Finding the keys to autoim - mune disease is one of the most vexing challenges in science,\" say the Coltons. \"It would do so much for humankind to uncover its causes, and ultimately to develop effective treatments. We think that Joe Craft and his Yale colleagues are uniquely equipped to do this work, and that the Colton Center will be a perfect vehicle through which to succeed.\" The new center's mission is to identify and support innovative, high-impact research projects with the potential for translation into therapies. To nurture the advance - ment of early-stage discoveries, the center will support the proof-of-con - cept and validation studies that are crucial in transforming novel ideas into treatments, devices, and cures. Craft will work closely with an advisory committee composed of experts in autoimmunity research from Yale as well as other aca - demic institutions and members of the pharmaceutical industry and venture capital firms, to evaluate proposals from Yale's many schools and academic disciplines. Craft and the committee will select and monitor unique, well- defined projects that show the most promise, making awards in two cat - egories: pilot grants for exploratory and proof-of-concept activities; and development grants for more firmly grounded projects. Development grants may be extensions of success - ful pilot grants, or other new projects with great potential. To ensure an appropriate breadth of proposals for these awards, the center will also evaluate and poten - tially support ideas that are submit - ted to other funding sources at Yale that are dedicated to promoting biomedical innovation. A yearly sym - posium will bring together investiga - tors, donors, philanthropic advisors, advisory committee members, and Yale leadership to review the progress of funded projects. Craft is well positioned to lead the center. Autoimmune disease has been the focus of his work, both clinically and in the lab. He trained in rheumatology and immunology at Yale and joined the faculty in 1985, where he runs a laboratory devoted to the study of immuno - logical diseases, with particular attention to SLE. He also served as section chief of rheumatology until 2018, when he stepped down to focus on his research. He has been captivated by the complexities of autoimmune disease since medical school. \"As a first-year student, the first patient I ever saw had lupus,\" he says. \"I've thought about that for years\u2014how we could have understood more about her dis - ease and provided better treatment.\" As international leaders in immunology and autoimmunity research, Yale scientists have made many important discoveries that advance understanding of immune system dysfunction. The new center will encourage cross-disciplinary, investigator-initiated research, active - ly bridging the gaps between research and application. It will provide strate - gic resources to ensure that research with commercial relevance does not stall due to lack of funding. \"We're looking for really novel ideas, and sometimes novel ideas // Autoimmune (page 1) beg for support,\" says Craft. \"The Coltons' vision and generous gift will enable us to provide that sup - port to move forward ideas that show real promise.\" \"The new center will have a substantial, broad impact on the Department of Immunobiology, en - abling exciting new ideas to be tested and accelerating the development of potential new therapeutics for autoimmune diseases,\" adds David Schatz, PhD, chair and Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor of Immuno - biology, and professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry. \"We are particularly excited by the opportu - nity to merge basic and translational research to benefit patients.\" \"Throughout the School of Medicine, there has long been an emphasis on understanding im - munological diseases and thinking creatively about autoimmune dis - ease to find new treatments,\" says Robert J. Alpern, MD, dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine. \"This center will accelerate our efforts, with the promise of improving the quality of life for millions who suf - fer from autoimmune diseases.\"Medicine @YaleNovember/December 201911gave her Kapo's number, and Vlock was brought back to New Haven, where Kapo cared for him until his death on September 29, 2017. \"Anyone who knew Michael knew he was an individual person and had his own way of doing things,\" Pritzker said. \"Jen met him where he was and helped us navigate that phase.\" Inspired by the impact of palliative medicine on her husband's final weeks of life, Pritzker decided in June 2018 to expand her initial gift and endow the professorship. On a warm- winded June 25, 2019, some 150 people from across the Yale com - munity, including the families and friends of Kapo, Nuland, and Vlock, gathered under the dark timber beams of the Harvey Cush - ing/John Hay Whitney Yale Medical Historical Library to celebrate the establishment of the Sherwin B. Nu - land and Michael K. Vlock Professor- ship of Palliative Medicine. Robert J. Alpern, MD, dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine, warm - ly remembered the two men, recalling Nuland's strong-willed commitment to medicine and Vlock's dedication to the New Haven community. He also commended Kapo for expanding and strengthening Yale's palliative care program. \"It is Jen's clinical excel - lence that really helped to inspire the gift today,\" he said. It was within the cancer program at Yale New Haven Hospital that the Palliative Care Program began in 2007. Charles S. Fuchs, MD, MPH, Richard Sackler and Jonathan Sackler Professor of Medicine (Medical On - cology), director of Yale Cancer Cen - ter, and physician-in-chief of Smilow Cancer Hospital, said, \"Today's cel - ebration recognizes the fundamental fighting death. During the last year of his life as he battled prostate cancer, Nuland received palliative care from Kapo and her team. \"Having been with Shep in all that was going on, I was used to being in the clinic, and it's one of the most dehumanizing places in the world,\" says Sarah Nuland, his wid - ow. \"Jen Kapo came into the room, and the temperature changed. She was warm, kind, thoughtful. And she didn't look at the computer. She looked into the eyes of my husband.\" As he wished, Nuland died in his home in Hamden on March 3, 2014. Inspired by Kapo and seeking a way to commemorate her husband, Sarah Nuland decided to start the Nuland Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing palliative care's role in health care and to educating underserved communities about it. Emblazoned as the organization's motto are words she had found scribbled into an advance print edition of How We Die , tucked away beside her husband's chipped pine writing desk: \"The purpose of the art of medicine is not primarily to cure disease or to fight death, but to relieve human suffering.\" One of Sarah Nuland's chief goals for the foundation was to establish an endowed professorship of pallia - tive medicine at Yale. She approached many of her close friends for fund - ing. One was Karen Pritzker, a local philanthropist and investor. Pritzker and her husband Michael Vlock had previously supported Yale New Haven Hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, as well as other organizations including Teach for America and the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. Pritzker and Vlock discussed Nuland's request, and agreed they should contribute. Nuland's cause soon became personal to them. In early 2017, Vlock was diagnosed with mesothelioma and began a treatment plan at a hospi - tal in New York. Seeing her husband's vitality fading from the brutal inten - sity of the treatment, Pritzker sought out Sarah Nuland for advice. Nuland Kapo's work highlights the importance of easing pain and discomfort of illness When Jennifer Kapo, MD, arrived at Yale in 2012, palliative care was widely considered an afterthought, a therapy reserved for terminally ill pa - tients who had exhausted both options and hope. After she became inaugural chief of the Yale Palliative Care Pro - gram and the Yale New Haven Hospi - tal Palliative Care Service, Kapo built the program from a four-person unit that received roughly 300 consults per year into a service that has received national renown. Her interprofes - sional team now consists of 30 people, including two social workers and two chaplains, and other professionals including an art therapist. All deliver the essence of what palliative care is\u2014a specialized form of medical care focused on relieving the symptoms and stress of a serious ill - ness. It is appropriate at any age and at any stage, and one can receive it along with curative treatment. The goal is to improve the patient's quality of life. Today, Kapo's program treats more than 3,000 new patients per year at 13 sites across Connecticut. Among the patients Kapo cared for at Yale were Sherwin B. Nuland, MD '55, and Michael K. Vlock. These men would serve as the inspiration for Yale's first endowed professorship for palliative medicine, a position to which Kapo was appointed in April of this year. Nuland, known as Shep by those who were closest to him, was a professor of surgery at Yale School of Medicine and also was a best-selling author and bioethicist. In addition to mentoring medical students, he taught a freshman history of medicine semi - nar at Yale College.

It is as important as the management of hypertension or diabetes.\" For Kapo, the professorship is a mark of legitimacy for palliative care at Yale. \"We will be able to think about palliative care as woven into the fabric of the standard of care that we provide for all patients,\" she said. \"It's not just a specialty to which we refer patients when there's nothing left to do, but rather one that's truly integrated throughout the courses of all serious illness.\" \"There is a lot of work to do to meet that goal,\" she cautioned. \"But with this endowed chair, we'll be able to work toward that.\"principle of patient-centered care as a foundation of medicine. I would sug - gest to you that few fields exemplify patient-centered care better than pal - liative medicine.\" The event's keynote speaker, Diane E. Meier, MD, a geriatrician at Mount Sinai Health System in New York and founder/director of the nationally recognized Center to Advance Palliative Care, stressed the 13 academic divi - sions, thrived. In addition to increas - ing the number of faculty by almost 30% during her tenure as chair, she recruited eight division directors, including four women, and increased the proportion of trainees and faculty from groups traditionally underrep - resented in medicine. She expanded mentorship resources for trainees and faculty immersed in research and estab - lished a career development program for faculty focused on clinical care. Research funding overall in the department increased by 56% and funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) went up by 47%. Clinical activities also experienced an upswing, with outpatient visits grow - ing by 59% and admissions by 25%. An interest in how things work sparked Brown's desire to study medicine during her undergraduate days at Yale. \"You follow your ques - tions where they take you,\" she says of her decision to specialize in clinical pharmacology. Her curiosity about the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which regulates blood pressure, led to discoveries on how that system affects glucose homeostasis as well as fibrino - lysis (the breakdown of fibrin clots that result from coagulation); the cardiovas - cular and renal effects of ACE inhibi - tors and other drugs used to control blood pressure; and the mechanisms of angioedema (a swelling under the skin or mucous membranes). Her research program has been continuously funded by the NIH since 1993. On the clinical side, she has had a long career treating patients with resistant hypertension, including those with such second - ary causes of the condition as adrenal tumors and renal vascular disease. Brown's appointment followed an extensive search initiated by President Peter Salovey, PhD '86, that was undertaken by a committee chaired by Lynn Cooley, PhD, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, C.N.H. Long Professor of Genetics, and professor of cell biology and of molecular, cellular, and devel - opmental biology; and composed of diverse faculty and representatives from across the School of Medicine, the university, and Yale New Haven Health. \"It was clear to me from the search committee that the members are passionate about making Yale a better place,\" Brown says. As to why she set her sights on becoming dean, Brown says: \"Many people have given to me in my career. Medicine faces a number of challenges that I would like to help address.\" As a physician-scientist, // Dean (page 1) Brown is well aware of the pressures of pursuing increasingly competi - tive grant funding and the growing demands and financial pressure of providing clinical care, which she believes have affected the way medi - cal students and residents are trained. Her vision is to \"return joy to the work of academic medicine.\" Although still in what she terms the \"early stages of the diagnostics\" at Yale, she would like to explore oppor - tunities to develop physician-scientists who bridge discovery and patient care, grow the medical school's research portfolio in support of the university's strategic plan for science, and focus on improving the work climate at YSM, which will be an early prior - ity. \"I think we need to stick to some fundamental values and goals,\" she says, \"and that requires creativity to do within the current constraints.\"12www.medicineatyale.orgArthur L. Horwich, MD, and colleague F. Ulrich Hartl, MD, from the Max Planck Institute, will share a $3 mil - lion Breakthrough Prize, the richest prize in the sciences. Horwich, Sterling Professor of Genetics at Yale School of Medicine and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Hartl, director of the Max Planck Institute of Biochemis - try, are honored for their work describ - ing the molecular machinery that folds proteins into proper shapes within cells. Proteins must be folded into proper three-dimensional structure to carry out their functions, which are crucial to all life. The scientists have shown this folding inside cells does not occur spontaneously, as previously believed, but depends upon molecular \"assis - tants\" called chaperones. The misfold - ing of proteins has been implicated in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Horwich and Hartl have won numerous awards for describing the molecular basis of protein folding, including the prestigious Albert Lasker Basic Research Award. The Breakthrough Prize annually recognizes achievements in the life sciences, fundamental physics, and mathematics, disciplines that \"ask the biggest questions and seek the deepest explanations.\"Horwich is 2020 Co-recipient of Breakthrough Prize Arthur Horwich of more than 30 proteins to infect and replicate within host cells. Akiko Iwasaki , PhD, Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Professor of Immunobiol - ogy, professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology, professor of dermatology, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. Iwasaki's research focuses on the mechanisms of immune defense against viruses at the mucosal surfaces. Her laboratory is interested in how innate recognition of viral infections leads to the genera - tion of adaptive immunity, and how adaptive immunity protects against subsequent viral challenge. She recently showed that a new vaccine strategy can provide preventive and therapeutic protection against viral infections. Rafael P\u00e9rez-Escamilla , PhD, pro - fessor of public health (social and be - havioral sciences), director of the Office of Public Health Practice, and director of the Global Health Concentration at the Yale School of Public Health. P\u00e9rez- Escamilla has launched public health nutrition and food security research programs around the world, which have been credited with the improve - ment of many measurements of health including breastfeeding outcomes and iron-deficiency anemia in infants. His health disparities research has focused on the impact of community health workers in improving behavioral and grateful to President Salovey for the trust he places in me to help shape and shepherd Yale's ambitious agen - da. This university is on sure footing thanks to him and to Ben Polak, who has been a remarkable example of integrity, discipline, commitment, and strategic acumen. I've benefitted from his example, and I'm honored to succeed him. \"Yale has long epitomized intel - lectual teamwork,\" he continued. \"The academic priorities we're pursuing together are as interde - pendent as they are distinct, and that's by design: The world calls for people and approaches that break boundaries to improve the world. I look forward to supporting our amazing faculty in the full expres - sion of that work.\" Basic science, clinical care, and public health are all represented by the honorees Six School of Medicine faculty mem - bers have been elected to the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), the organization announced Oct. 21 at its annual meeting. They are among 100 new members elected by NAM to receive the honor, which recognizes individuals who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service in the fields of health and medicine. At a ceremony on Oct. 22 to cel - ebrate the winners, Robert J. Alpern, MD, dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine, said those who receive this honor are the best of the best. \"For every one person that gets in, there are 10 outstanding people who don't get elected that year. So, the competition is incredible, and I think it is a real honor when somebody gets elected to the National Academy of Medicine.\" Established originally as the Institute of Medicine in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences, NAM addresses important issues in health, science, medicine, and related policy and inspires positive actions across sectors.
