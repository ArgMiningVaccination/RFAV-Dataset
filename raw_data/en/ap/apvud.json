Once all the Christmas cookies and eggnog have been consumed, you may be looking for a natural, healthy way to rid your body of all the toxins and poisons that have built up. A cleansing detox is certainly a good way to do that, but only if done safely. When we think of a holistic detox or body cleanse, there are many different things that come to mind. This could mean anything from a harsh (and potentially dangerous) fast and herbal treatment to simply eating foods that will clean out your body. A liver detox is one of the most popular and effective types of cleanses if you are looking to get the toxins out in a holistic way. There are numerous foods that work to rid your body of toxins caused by alcohol, caffeine, medications, pesticides, smog, artificial sweeteners and other substances added to food, sugar and impure water. Additionally, a holistic detox and body cleanse is a great natural cure for fatigue that will also give your body a natural energy boost. A liver detox refers to how your body rids itself of waste, or the process of enhancing the liver's enzyme system. The detoxification process will convert toxic substances into non-toxic, water-soluble compounds that are then extracted from the body via sweat, urine and stool. Performing a body cleanse is a great way to recharge your body and give you a fresh start and healthy boost of energy. However, there are many body cleanses out there that are not good for your body and can be detrimental to your overall health. Choosing to eat specific foods that will naturally rid your body of toxins and poisons is the healthiest and safest option when looking for a holistic detox. The Goals of Liver Detox to Bear in Mind The goal of a liver detox is to increase the intake of specific nutrients, minimize ingested allergens and toxins, increase bowel movements for quicker elimination of waste and toxins and to optimize alkalinity by upping the intake of fruits and veggies. It should be noted that many body cleanses can be dangerous because they are very restrictive, meaning you will not be able to maintain them for very long. However, if you incorporate certain foods and steer clear of foods and drinks that contain toxins and unnatural elements, you will be able to safely cleanse your liver and body. Foods that Cleanse Your Liver Naturally The best way to cleanse your liver and keep it healthy and functioning is to incorporate the following foods into your daily diet. - Garlic - Grapefruit - Beets and carrots - Green tea - Leafy green veggies - Avocados - Apples - Olive oil - Whole grains - Broccoli and cauliflower - Lemons and limes - Walnuts - Cabbage - Turmeric - Brussels sprouts Using herbal bitters to stimulate the digestive process and St. Mary's thistle to protect the liver cells from damage caused by toxins are other great diet additions. There are also specific supplements that can be taken in conjunction with the above listed foods, and it is imperative to drink at least 8 glasses of purified water or tea each day. You must also steer clear of alcohol and caffeine while detoxing, and many experts also say to stay away from plastics and unnatural products. Incorporating foods, grains, and herbs that are good for your liver and body on a daily basis is perhaps the best way to maintain a healthy body and keep the liver functioning to its highest potential.
