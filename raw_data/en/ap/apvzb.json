Long-Term Effects of Hepatitis B Immunization at Birth in Preventing Liver Cancer in an Area with High Dietary Exposure to Aflatoxins: A Geographical Epidemiological Study 30 Pages Posted: 3 Aug 2019 [More...](javascript:void(0);) Abstract Background: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and dietary exposure to aflatoxins are the major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Guangxi. In 1989, LongAn, Guangxi became the first county in China to integrate hepatitis B vaccine into the expanded programme on immunization. However, its preventive effect against HCC remains unclear. Methods: Information on HCC deaths for LongAn, BinYang and LingYun counties of Guangxi were obtained from the national mortality surveillance system. The data were analysed using Poisson regression and X2 tests. Findings: In LongAn, the mortality of HCC in adults 20 to 32 years of age declined significantly from 17.6/100,000 in 2004 to 5.0/100,000 in 2017-2018 (X2=10.0605, P<0.05). Among those vaccinated at birth, the mortality in mountainous areas, where dietary exposure to aflatoxins is more common, is higher (9.0/100,000) than that of low-lying areas (6.5/100,000). The age-adjusted mortality of the whole populations LongAn, and LingYun during 2017-2018 are 53.3/100,000, 45.4/100,000 and 39.0/100,000, respectively. However, the mortality of males aged 20-29 years in LongAn during 2017-2018 was lower than that of BinYang and LingYun, although the difference is not significant. Interpretation: Immunization of infants against HBV has reduced their risk of developing HCC as children and young adults. These findings highlight the importance of avoiding dietary exposure to aflatoxins for the elimination of HCC in regions where both HBV and aflatoxins are the major risk factors of HCC.
