AFP is defined by acute onset of focal weakness or paralysis, without other obvious cause (e.g., trauma). - Prior to widespread vaccination, the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis was poliovirus infection - Laboratory testing is required to rule out and/or determine the pathogens responsible for AFP |Introduction| | | Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is a rare clinical syndrome defined as the sudden onset of muscle weakness or paralysis, which may include respiratory and bulbar weakness. AFP has many causes, both infectious and non-infectious. Prior to widespread vaccination, the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis was poliovirus infection. As a result of vaccination, wildtype polio cases have decreased dramatically, but polio cases do occur in Surveillance for AFP is a required to maintain Canada's polio-free certification status. AFP surveillance is important for demonstrating (through the capacity to identify non-polio AFP cases) that detecting polio cases is possible, should they arise. AFP has been reportable in Ontario since 2013. |Local Epidemiology| | | AFP surveillance is conducted as part of global polio eradication to rule out the possibility of poliovirus infection and document the absence of polio virus. Canada monitors for cases of AFP in children less than 15 years old as a part the World Health Organization (WHO) surveillance efforts. From 1996 to 2017, there were between 27-63 cases of AFP reported annually in Canada, averaging 44 cases per year ( AFP syndromic surveillance in Canada and Ontario on AFP is currently done by: |Signs and symptoms| | | AFP is defined as acute onset of focal weakness or flaccid paralysis reduced tone or sudden onset of muscle weakness with no alternate cause (e.g., trauma). Regardless of underlying etiology, weakness in AFP can affect any muscle group, including limbs, face, respiratory muscles, or bladder and bowel muscles. Transient weakness (weakness that lasts for a short period of time, such as post-ictal weakness), should not be considered when diagnosing AFP. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), which generally begins with weakness in the hands and feet then quickly becomes widespread throughout the body, is an immune condition which is currently the most common cause of AFP in Canada. AFP due to GBS often presents as symmetrical paralysis and may progress for up to 10 days. Patterns of paralysis and other symptoms such a pain or fever at onset depend on the underlying diagnosis. Potential for person-to-person transmission depends on the underlying cause. |Diagnosis \\ Laboratory testing| | | Laboratory testing is needed to rule out or determine pathogens causing AFP. AFP can be caused by several infectious and non-infectious agents, some of which can lead to GBS. Causes include enteroviruses, echoviruses, adenoviruses, West Nile Virus, neuropathy, acute tick paralysis, myasthenia gravis, porphyria, botulism, and heavy metal toxicity. Patients of any age with acute neurological presentations consistent with AFP should have Physicians can fill out Public Health Ontario Laboratories' (PHOL) When submitting specimens from patients with neurological presentation to PHOL, it is important to document the neurological symptoms on the laboratory requisition form, so the appropriate testing can be ordered. Specimen collection should include: For complete information and instructions on specimen collection, please see Public Health Ontario Lab's (PHOL) Test Information Sheets on |Reporting requirements| | | Please report suspected or confirmed cases of AFP by the next business day. If polio is suspected in under/un-immunized persons with travel-related exposure risks, please contact PHOL for consultation and notify Ottawa Public Health immediately.
