When I started to go to Grainne, I was angry, judgmental, sad and in turmoil with life..... Basically, very much lost in the great hurt I was experiencing. I brought many issues to the table, boxed away, from a childhood of gross neglect, alcoholism, three father figures, eight house moves, various forms of abuse, etc., etc., etc. Over time I opened up the boxes and Grainne adapted the remedies to support me along the way. She listened and guided me gently, sometimes firmly. Gave me tools to change my thinking, my language and simply showed me a different way to be. Grainne is a very kind lady who is extremely generous with her support. I will forever be grateful to Grainne for the journey of healing I am on now and genuinely feel that she put me on this path, sometimes counting the steps with me and sometimes watching me run. We have been going to Grainne for about six years and she has treated us for all sorts of ailments, chronic and acute. Some of these include the common cold, scar tissue, low appetite, vomiting bugs and muscle aches after sport. On another level she has supported us through grief, traumas and teenage milestones. One specific example I remember was when my daughter had a very bad flu and Grainne reviewed her over the phone, every day, for ten days! When I became familiar with homeopathy, I bought a little home kit and now I ring or text Grainne with the issue and she advises me what remedy to use. I am so glad to be able to treat my family and I in this holistic way. They have never had an antibiotic in the time that Grainne has treated them! Grainne has a lovely, natural way about her, especially with children, showing great patience and kindness. Homeopathy is a system of medicine that has been practised all over the world for almost 250 years. Homeopathic remedies work at an energetic level, stimulating the body's own healing abilities to help mental, emotional, and physical ailments. The word homeopathy is derived from Greek meaning 'similar suffering.' This is the basis of homeopathic philosophy. The main philosophy of homeopathy teaches that a substance that can produce symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms in a sick person e.g. A remedy made from a red onion is often prescribed for somebody suffering with red, itchy eyes that water constantly, similar to the condition hay fever. Our bodies are always trying to maintain balance but sometimes our immune system is weakened. This can be due to various stresses that we encounter in our everyday lives or due to the stress that our lifestyle puts on our bodies. Whenever we are out of balance we can be guaranteed that our immune system will be trying to restore the balance to help us to regain health. Homeopathic remedies are in such minute, dilute doses that they are safe for everybody to use from infants, pregnant women to elderly people. Homeopathic remedies act as a catalyst to stimulate the body's own immune system to heal. As the remedy will match the symptoms of the person it's as if it points the immune system in exactly the right direction to speed the healing process and to restore health and wellbeing to the body.
