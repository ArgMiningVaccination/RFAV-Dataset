This was the case inSouthern Africa where drought, combined with thecrippling effects of AIDS and inappropriate foodpolicies, raised the spectre of widespread famine.Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia were particularlyaffected. ECHO, recognising the need to act quicklyto prevent an already difficult situation turning intoa major catastrophe, mobilised substantialhumanitarian assistance as part of a widerCommission effort that included essential food aid.ECHO also boosted its assistance to Ethiopia inresponse to serious drought-related food shortagesand helped victims of the conflict that erupted inC\u00f4te d'Ivoire. In Angola, it was not so much newneeds as existing ones that came to light followingthe peace agreement. Again, the Commissionreacted speedily when the terrible plight of peopleliving in previously inaccessible parts of the countrybecame known.Elsewhere, the suffering caused by internal conflictremained depressingly and unacceptably high. Inplaces as diverse as Colombia, Sudan, the GreatLakes region of Africa, the Palestinian Territories andChechnya, ongoing violence meant continuingmisery for many people, which ECHO helped toalleviate. Global figures for the numbers of refugeesand internally displaced people illustrate the scale ofthe problem. In 2002, the world had an estimated 12million refugees while a further 25 million weredisplaced inside their own countries. In some places,entire generations of uprooted people have only experienced war and exile. We have a duty to helpthem survive but the international community alsoneeds to give more attention to finding durablelong-term solutions. On the other hand, there weresome positive developments during 2002 whichsuggest that even apparently intractable crises canbe solved. I have already mentioned Angola. In SriLanka, the peace process also revealed major post-crisis needs but encouragingly, in a context where itwas possible to identify the light at the end of thetunnel. In Afghanistan, where ECHO was still heavilyengaged, the fact that so many people returnedhome was a good sign although a sustainedinternational effort, especially on longer term re-construction, will be needed for some time beforewe can say that this crisis is finally over. In theBalkans, the post-crisis consolidation continued,allowing ECHO to make further progress in phasingout its operations, in favour of longer termdevelopment instruments put in place by theEuropean Union, as well as by other donors.In 2002, ECHO again paid close attention to\"forgotten crises\" with significant funding for peoplewhose plight rarely hits the headlines, includingWestern Saharan, Burmese and Bhutanese refugees,and conflict victims in Nepal, Somalia and NorthernUganda. As the year drew to a close, and the firstdisquieting signals started to appear, ECHO preparedfor the possibility of a major new crisis in Iraq. Asalways, the Commission is ready to respondpromptly and generously, in accordance with thebasic humanitarian principle that those who aresuffering should be assisted, irrespective of theirethnic origin, religion or politics.It is appropriate in this context to stress thathumanitarian principles are enshrined ininternational treaties, and that warring parties areobliged to respect them. Recently, there have beensome disturbing developments that undermine thetimely and effective delivery of relief. These includethe denial of access to crisis victims and a failure todifferentiate between combatants and civilianscaught up in the fighting. It is bad enough whenthe rules are not respected by internal factions. It iseven more worrying when democratic signatories tothe treaties ignore their provisions and jeopardise,in particular, the work of organisations that havebeen mandated by the international community topursue globally shared objectives such as theprotection of victims.I am also deeply concerned about the blurring of thedistinction between military and humanitarianoperations. Soldiers may be ordered to fight one dayand deliver aid the next. Occasionally, this approachis justified as the only way of reaching people indistress but it should be used very sparingly. Itshould certainly not be central to the strategy ofnations that are committed both to waging war anddelivering humanitarian support in the same crisis.When military and humanitarian operations getmixed up, the impartiality of the latter iscompromised, jeopardising the lives of non-combatant aid workers and the people they aretrying to help. It is essential to provide the space forthe humanitarian agencies to get on with the job -which is already dangerous enough.

Including aid provided by EU Member Statesseparately, this makes the European Union the mostgenerous source of humanitarian aid in the world.Helping the victims of humanitarian crises is notsimply a matter of financial solidarity. The qualityand efficiency of the aid provided is equallyimportant. Throughout the year, ECHO strived tomaintain the highest professional standards in all ofits activities as well as those of its operationalpartners. We maintained a permanent dialogue withthe latter as this is one of the fundamentaltechniques in evaluating and monitoring theimplementation of programmes.The emergence of new needs in many parts of theworld is cause for great concern. It is true that insome countries, this was due to positivedevelopments. For example, the historic ceasefireagreements in Angola and Sri Lanka gavehumanitarian agencies access to vulnerable peoplewho were previously out of reach. The opening up ofareas that used to be inaccessible presents a bigchallenge to aid workers and donors, especially in amine-ridden country such as Angola, but for thebeneficiaries it is relief long overdue. In otherregions already facing crises, such as the Middle Eastand Northern Caucasus, ECHO responded to growingneeds prompted by a deterioration in thehumanitarian situation.The year was also characterised by new crises inplaces where humanitarian aid had not previouslybeen required. The most significant example wasSouthern Africa, where ECHO began fundingsubstantial operations.ECHO continued to pay special attention to'forgotten crises' overlooked by other donors and theinternational media such as the plight of theSahrawi refugees in Algeria and the Burmeserefugees in Thailand. As part of our effort to ensurean impartial distribution of aid according to needs,we further refined our methodology for defining andidentifying forgotten crises.Each year, the Humanitarian Aid Office establishesan aid strategy to guide the implementation of itsmandate, which is to preserve lives and reduce orprevent the suffering of crisis victims outside theEuropean Union. The overriding priority is to ensure that vital aid reaches the people that need it most, regardless of their race, religion or political beliefs.This needs-based approach also underpinned ECHO'sefforts to assist those who are least able to helpthemselves in crisis situations. Particular attentionwas therefore paid to vulnerable groups. More than11 million children received life-saving aid includingvaccinations, nutrition, and therapeutic andsupplementary feeding. Other groups benefitingfrom specific support included women, handicappedpeople and the elderly.We are deeply concerned about the increasing perilsfaced by aid workers and the people they are tryingto help. In 2002, ECHO focused on achieving thehighest possible security standards for beneficiaries,staff and partners in situations which are ofteninherently dangerous. This will remain a highpriority for us in the future.Finally, I want to stress the notion of partnership asfundamental to ECHO's achievements. ECHO'sworking relationship with its operational partners,be it NGOs, United Nations agencies, ororganisations in the Red Cross 'family' has beenconstantly evolving through a strategic dialoguelaunched in 2001 and continued through regularmeetings in 2002. These meetings addressed thewide-ranging challenges confronting humanitarianactors with an emphasis on identifying ways ofimproving the quality of our assistance.In a similar vein, we have been working on afundamental revision of the Framework PartnershipAgreement (FPA) which governs our relations withmost of our partners. A key objective of the revisionis to boost the impact of our aid by focusing less oninputs and more on achieving (and measuring)concrete results. Our drive for quality is enhancedthrough our partnership with the agencies thatdeliver the aid on the ground. Strengthenedcoordination and the exchange of best practice,including information on innovative projects, helpus to respond ever more effectively to the plight ofthe world's most vulnerable populations, in thename of European solidarity.The growing humanitarianchallenge Costanza Adinolfi being briefed camp forinternally displacedpeople in Burundi.

Yvan Hildebrand, ECHO6FEATURE New challenges for European humanitarian aid The 20th century was the humanitarian century The very first Nobel peace prize went to the Swiss philanthropist Jean Henri Dunant. His shockedreaction to the horrors of war (in his book A Memory of Solferino ) eventually led to the founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).The last Nobel peace prize of the 20th century wasawarded to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. This new formof citizens' revolt against the unacceptable placesthe rights of victims before the rights of the stateand puts testimony on suffering before silence.Since the days of Henri Dunant, while humanitarianconcepts and actions have evolved considerably, thebasic tenet has remained the same: an unshakeablecommitment to saving lives, alleviating sufferingand restoring the dignity of victims of crises. AlbertCamus described it as \"op\u00e9rations de protection descorps\".Both in its concepts and on the ground,humanitarian aid must today adapt to anincreasingly precarious world and address a numberof challenges: A legal challenge: within what framework of principles, laws and mandates should humanitarianaction take place? A political challenge: what is the role of the state and politics in tackling crises to come, under way orin the process of being settled? An operational challenge: how do we ensure the safety of humanitarian workers when civilianpopulations are under threat and access to victims isroutinely denied? An ethical challenge: how do we assume this dual responsibility, on the one hand to victims and onthe other to the taxpayers who contribute directlyor indirectly to humanitarian action? An intellectual challenge: how do we bring crisis prevention and preparedness, rapid reaction, andthe link between emergency and development underone roof?ECHO must be involved in meeting these variouschallenges. In this connection, it has, over the lastfew years, adopted and implemented new methodsand procedures to make its operations moreeffective.Thanks to ECHO, humanitarian action occupies a key position in the EU's external action. ECHOis the world's main player in this field.Through ECHO funding, some 18 million people arehelped each year in more than 60 countries through200 partners (NGOs, ICRC, and UN agencies like theUNHCR and the WFP). The Humanitarian Aid Officespends more than \u20ac500 million a year on financing humanitarian projects.Since ECHO was set up, the European Parliamenthas given solid political support to EU humanitarianaction. Parliament confirmed this support when itadopted my report on 12 December 2002.The report calls for strengthened EU solidarity forvictims of humanitarian crises and frames proposalsfor operational action. The sole aim of the report'svarious recommendations, which are by no meansexhaustive, is to support ECHO's approach tomeeting new needs in a new context. New needs, new means? The nature of crises has changed: they are alwayscomplex, often long-lasting and sometimes\"forgotten\".Amid the euphoria at the end of the Cold War, theinternational community seriously underestimatedthe forces that were to be unleashed once East-Westrivalry dissipated. Ideological wars have beenreplaced by conflicts for control of territory ornatural resources (oil, water, etc.). These conflictsendure when they are fuelled by trafficking indiamonds, small arms or drugs which warlords,predatory states or multinationals seek to prolong inpursuit of their own interests.Everywhere, civilian populations are the mainvictims of this new world disorder.Europe's financial resources are no longer able tocope with these challenges. ECHO's budget is notkeeping pace with the deteriorating worldhumanitarian situation. ECHO has seen its fundingeroded and has to ask for top-ups to be able tofinance its operations at the end of the year. This isunconscionable when you consider that each euromeans lives saved or protected!ECHO's budget needs to be increased by around 20%(from \u20ac460 million to \u20ac550 million) to meet global humanitarian challenges in the years ahead.by Marie-Arlette Carlotti Member of the European Parliament*7FEATURE Clarifying ECHO's responsibilities and its scopefor action in the \"grey zone\"of crisis management The players in the humanitarian field need a new mandate. We have to work out a legal framework forintervention and create suitable financialinstruments.The distinction between relief and developmentworkers has become blurred. Crises are morecomplex than they used to be: they are long-drawn-out, conflicts become deadlocked, there is neitherwar nor peace. There has to be a pooling ofexperience and know-how. In addition to thetraditional types of emergency aid we now have newkinds of intervention designed to underpinstrategies for survival and to support civil society.Against that background, ECHO is going back tobasics and focusing anew on its essential brief:supplying emergency aid to save lives. It is fulfillingthat brief more effectively by fine-tuning itsintervention mechanisms, notably its primaryemergency procedure (relief dispatched within 72hours anywhere around the globe). Coping with \"forgotten\" crises As the term suggests, forgotten crises are no longerin the news, so the international community doeslittle or nothing to meet the needs of thoseaffected. ECHO's methodology now makes specificprovision for the concept of \"forgotten\" crises,putting the emphasis on a counter-cyclical approachwhich entails redirecting a proportion of its fundingspecifically to such crises. While the work hasalready begun on this approach, it will be some timebefore its impact can be fully measured. Continuing to improve the quality of operations When, on the other hand, a crisis is \"covered\", the main question is whether the aid is effective. Aflood of unsuitable aid, competition between a growing number of organisations for limitedresources and donors' monitoring needs have madequality, efficiency and responsibility key issues inthe humanitarian debate.ECHO should therefore be supported in its attemptsto improve its diagnosic capacity and the evaluationof operations carried out under its aegis. Emphasising prevention, preparedness and riskreduction Humanitarian aid has changed in scope but also in nature. Humanitarian workers are no longer thebattlefield stretcher-bearers popularised by the RedCross. They have to do more than simply dresswounds. They must also prevent people getting hurtin the first place, in other words become involved inmanaging and preventing crises and conflicts.The notion of \"resilience\" is part and parcel of thisapproach. This means bolstering capacity to resistand absorb shocks during a crisis by combiningemergency aid, support for survival strategies andlong-term development strategies. This approach canfocus on the resilience of individuals, through a mixof limited food aid and support for agriculturalrecovery, the resilience of the family or thecommunity or the resilience of programmes, whichshould be based on strengthened local resources andcapacities in order to adapt rapidly.This overall approach should be a priority objectivefor all the EU's development players.ECHO's disaster-preparedness programmes (DIPECHO)have proved effective in terms of lives saved and interms of cost. These efforts should be continued andstepped up. I have proposed a significant increase infunding for disaster preparedness by earmarking 5%of ECHO's expenditure for this purpose by 2005 (asagainst 1.5% in 2001). Maria Olsen, ECHODistribution of changed: they arealways complex, oftenenduring and sometimesforgotten\".Security on the ground and protection of civilianpopulations We regularly hear reports of humanitarian workers wounded, killed or taken hostage while participatingin relief operations (murder of ICRC workers inChechnya and Burundi, M\u00e9decins du Monde andUNHCR workers in Rwanda, hostage-taking in theCaucasus, etc.). In some countries such as Sudan,humanitarian workers are more at risk thanpeacekeeping forces! Protection of civilians andsecurity for humanitarian workers is becoming a keyconcern. In the long run, the most promisingsolution is to incorporate security issues into thevery design of programmes. Greater acceptance ofoperations and projects is more important thanpassive protection (\"bunkerisation\" of aid) or activedissuasion strategies (militarisation of aid). ECHOhas already embarked on this path.In the short term, to cope with the most dangerous situations, I would encourage ECHO to provide support for practical measures to protecthumanitarian personnel more easily such as:- extending to ECHO partners' administrative andtechnical humanitarian personnel the protectionprovided under Article 37.2 of the Vienna Conventionon the protection of refugees.- granting diplomatic status in certain cases toECHO experts in the field. An evolving legal framework: towards a \"responsibility toprotect\" On paper, since the adoption in 1977 of the two additional protocols to the Geneva Conventions,international humanitarian law has been aneffective instrument for protecting victims ofinternational and domestic conflicts. But on theground, what matters is the political will of statesand armed groups to apply those rules. The notion ofstate sovereignty must evolve, insofar as it relatesto the power of life and death (\"distribuer la mortou ... laisser vivre\" according to French philosopherMichel Foucault).Geostrategic interests rarely coincide with victims'interests. Contrast the din surrounding theintervention in Kosovo with the deafening silence inthe face of the Chechnya drama.In June 2002, an event of great significance wentalmost unnoticed when the UN Security Councildebated a text adopted by the InternationalCommission on Intervention and State Sovereignty(ICISS). This advocated \"the responsibility toprotect\" and the \"right of humanitarianintervention\", phrases which, although euphemistic,signalled the initiation of a high level debate onintervention. The utopian dreams of the millenniumare from from being realised. The 21st century is not yet the century of respect for human life and, if we are not careful, it could even become the mostbloodthirsty of all time.For humanitarian players, this is not the time forcomplacency or withdrawal. The peoples of Europeare increasingly committed to taking up thechallenge. This awakening of a European\"conscience\" makes ECHO an essential tool formobilising European citizens. Let us make use of it! * Member of the European Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation. Rapporteur on ECHOactivities. Odile Minichetti, ECHO9FEATURE ECHO's departure from the Western Balkans Mission accomplished The break up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s led to a series of interconnected conflicts resulting inenormous human suffering. ECHO's intervention inthe region was one of its longest in terms ofduration (from 1991 to 2003) and largest in terms ofexpenditure (almost \u20ac2.4 billion). A great many people received vital assistance through ECHO-funded operations. To mention just a few examples,in Kosovo, more than 200 schools with some160,000 students were rehabilitated. In Albania,improvements to water supply systems benefitedalmost 400,000 people while 100 medical facilitiesserving a catchment population of one million wereupgraded. Throughout the region, people who hadbeen forced to flee from their homes were assisted,notably in Serbia which hosted up to 700,000refugees and displaced people. Bosnia-Herzegovina,Montenegro and the former Republic of Macedoniaalso received substantial humanitarian support.The humanitarian crisis in the Western Balkans hasnow ended and the situation has progressed beyondthe so-called \"post-crisis\" phase when reliefassistance often continues to be required. Peoplecan look forward to a more self-sufficient and stablefuture and ECHO's departure should seen be againstthis positive backdrop.There are still problems to be overcome, some ofwhich may be partially due to the conflicts of the1990s, but the main challenges are now those thatconfront any country in transition from controlledto free-market economics. The involvement in theWestern Balkans of numerous development andinternational financing institutions illustrates theextent to which the emphasis has moved away fromshort-term humanitarian concerns towards longer term actions. The European Commission alone,through the CARDS programme (CommunityAssistance for Reconstruction, Development andStabilisation) is providing \u20ac4.65 billion between 2000 and 2006.ECHO's main aim, at the height of the successivecrises that struck the Western Balkans during the1990s, was to help meet the basic needs of threetarget groups: refugees, internally displaced people(IDPs) and vulnerable local populations. As itprogressively scaled down its operations once thefighting had ended (a process that occurred atdifferent times in different countries and provinces)ECHO shifted its focus towards reducing dependencyon humanitarian aid - for example through projectspromoting self reliance - and handing overoperations it had funded to national authorities,other Commission instruments or other donors.The Commission has paid particular attention tolinking relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD)in the Western Balkans having recognised that thisenables resources to be used more effectively,maximising the benefits for the target populations.In practical terms, ECHO has coordinated closelywith Commission departments responsible for longerterm assistance programmes, as well as with otherdevelopment actors and government agencies in theregion, to ensure a smooth and well-coordinatedtransition from humanitarian to developmentactivities. ECHO concluded its operations in Bosniaand Croatia in 2000, Kosovo in 2001 andMontenegro and Albania in 2002. Phasing out fromthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)and Serbia, was scheduled for 2003. Summary of ECHO assistance to the Balkans, 1991-2003 (in \u20acm) 1991-1998 post-crisis phase,ECHO funded projects tosupport self-reliance. (InterSOS)10ECHO AT WORK In brief Policy aspects On the external front, there were a number of developments during 2002 in the field of crisismanagement under the EU's Common Foreign andSecurity Policy that required the involvement of theHumanitarian Aid Office. ECHO accordinglyparticipated in various EU meetings to explain thespecificity of the 'humanitarian space' and ensurethat all actors were made aware of the neutral,impartial and independent nature of humanitarianassistance. ECHO was also represented on theReview Committee of the Group drawing up the newUN Guidelines for the Use of Military and CivilDefence Assets in UN Humanitarian Operationsunder the auspices of UN/OCHA. It stressed theundesirability of using military assets inhumanitarian operations, except as a last resort.These arguments were also advanced in the contextof the discussions on the new Constitutional Treatyfor Europe (the 'Convention').ECHO began preparing contingency plans to dealwith the humanitarian consequences of a possiblewar in Iraq, as is usual in such situations. Thisinvolved close co-ordination with major partners,especially UN agencies and the Red Crossmovement, as well as with other major donors.2002 also saw the continuing implementation ofinternal reforms within ECHO. The Office'sprogramming cycle was further developed in linewith activity-based management principles, whileoperational and policy priorities were drawn up forthe coming year following a comprehensiveidentification and analysis of humanitarian crisesthroughout the world.Planning instruments developed in the past wereupdated and fine-tuned. ECHO's global needsassessment, a statistical analysis offering a rankingof 130 countries in terms of humanitarian needs,was refined to include data on donor contributions.The methodology was improved by introducinginformation on countries' GNP per capita, to give amore accurate picture of their relative prosperity.This is important for ECHO, given its commitmentto ensure that the operations it finances are focusedon areas of greatest need.In addition, ECHO drew up an internal 'entrystrategy' paper involving the definition of objectivecriteria ('damage thresholds') for when it shouldintervene in the event of a natural disaster.The work started in 2001 on developing a newintegrated information system called HOLIS(Humanitarian Office Local Information System)and 2002 saw the first applications become operational. This new, integrated tool willimprove the quality of data on humanitarianfunding provided by ECHO and by EU MemberStates.Important progress was made in implementingthe Commission's strategy of linking relief,rehabilitation and development (LRRD). Thisissue is now a basic element in the 'countrystrategy papers' drawn up by the Commission.ECHO also developed a methodology to identifypractical situations where attention to LRRD isappropriate, and to measure progress in movingfrom humanitarian to development aid.Finally, ECHO consolidated its emergencymanagement procedures, enabling it to respondto new crises even more speedily and to mobiliseresources within a very short timescale. Partnership In 2002, ECHO deepened its relationships withits major partners through the 'StrategicProgramming Dialogues'. This was the third yearin which dialogues were held with the main UNagencies (UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, OCHA andWHO). Similar sessions were organised with theICRC, IFRC and the NGOs. The aim is to ensurethat coherent policies are pursued that benefitall actors and meet the most pressinghumanitarian needs. Additionally, ECHO boostedits participation at meetings of the executivebodies of the UN agencies in order to consolidatethe relationship further.During the year, a number of ECHO partners(ICRC, IFRC and UNICEF) deliveredpresentations to ECHO staff on their coremandates and current initiatives, thus ensuringa deeper understanding between the respectivestaff of all organisations.ECHO continued to consult widely withsignatory organisations of the FrameworkPartnership Agreement (FPA) with a view toachieving an in-depth revision of the Agreementin 2003.The review of the FPA is based on two keyelements. The first is to comply fully with theCommission's new financial regulation andimplementing rules that entered into force on 1January 2003. The second, based on the idea of'quality in humanitarian aid', is a fundamentalshift of emphasis away from the control ofresources (inputs) towards planning ofobjectives, indicators and the control of results.Quality in humanitarian aid was a centraltheme at the ECHO partners annual conferenceheld in Brussels on 14 and 15 October. In workinggroups and plenary sessions, the conferenceparticipants discussed: quality management tools in thehumanitarian sector and their application bythe NGOs; human resource management systemsapplicable to NGOs in the humanitariansector, and;11ECHO AT WORK humanitarian information technology (IT) platforms and their possible use ascoordination instruments. The annual conference is an importantcomponent of ECHO's ongoing dialogue with itspartners.At the end of 2002, more than 210 humanitarianorganisations, including European NGOs andRed Cross organisations, were FPA signatories. Finance and audit ECHO's response to humanitarian crises in 2002was channelled through 115 funding decisionstotalling \u20ac537.8 million. The aftermath of theevents of 11 September 2001, together with theoutbreak of new crises, in particular the foodcrisis in Southern Africa and the worsening ofthe situation in the Middle East, required ECHOto reinforce the humanitarian aid budget bycalling on the emergency aid reserve for anadditional \u20ac80 million. 761 contracts forhumanitarian aid were signed in 2002. The rateof budget implementation, in terms ofcommitment appropriations, was 100%.As part of the overall process of administrativeand financial management reform, the newFinancial Regulation was adopted in 2002(coming into force on 1 January 2003). In respectof humanitarian aid, new features include: the move towards measuring the impact ofhumanitarian actions (outputs) vis-\u00e0-vis theobjectives set, as opposed to the previousinput-oriented approach; comprehensive rules on the award andmanagement of contracts that take account ofthe specific operational features ofhumanitarian and emergency assistance, and; moving towards a system of joint managementwith international organisations. Within ECHO, this has led to a reorientation ofinternal control systems to further strengthenthe assessment of the risks relating to projects,and to monitor their progress and effectivenessby concentrating on outputs.ECHO-funded activities implemented by externalparties (partners and contractors) are subject tofinancial audit. Overall, the aim is to have atwo-year audit cycle involving an examinationof partners' systems and their use of ECHOfunds. ECHO's audit processes andmethodologies are continuously under reviewand, in 2002, significant revisions were made tothe procedures. From 2002, ECHO Offices werealso subject to systematic audit.Fourteen audits were completed during the yearincluding six field audits, reporting on projectsactually under way.To increase its activity in this area, ECHOcontracted a firm of professional auditors toscrutinise ECHO projects, beginning in thesecond half of 2002. This led to a significantincrease in the number of ongoing audits (50) bythe end of the year and the number of finalisedaudits will therefore increase substantially in 2003and in future years.Audit results are important for the successfulfunctioning of the Framework PartnershipAgreement which governs ECHO's relations with themajority of its partners responsible forimplementing humanitarian projects. They alsoinclude useful recommendations on ways ofimproving the financial and administrativecontrols employed by the partners in managingECHO funds. In 2002, ECHO undertook a systematicfinancial review of its partners in order to identifyin advance, weaknesses which have to be addressedin order to maintain the inherent risks ofhumanitarian operations at an acceptable level. Information and communication In the field of information and communication,ECHO sought to maximise the use of newtechnologies to promote its humanitarian message.The priorities reflected the demand for informationabout concrete projects and results, and about theworkings of the EU's humanitarian aid system. Toachieve this, existing information products werereoriented to include a greater focus on eyewitnessaccounts and retrospective human-interest stories.A redesigned ECHO website was launched inNovember. This reflected the priorities for 2002,with more emphasis on first-hand stories, as well asa user-friendly interactive approach and a strongervisual identity. By the end of the year, the numberof pages viewed daily exceeded 3,000 and thefigures were on an upward trend.More attention was devoted to mass media outlets,with a view to appealing to a broader public. A newvideo presentation of ECHO was producedhighlighting its support for the victims of crises inall parts of the world.Funding and material assistance was given forvarious television programmes on humanitarian aidand forgotten crises. With support from ECHO'sawareness-raising grant facility, a television spothighlighting the work of ECHO and an NGO partnerwas broadcast 97 times on Eurosport, targetingyounger audiences. A further TV spot coveringECHO and NGO support for the Western Saharanrefugees was shown 86 times on two major Italianchannels. Funds were also provided for a 30-minutedocumentary on the humanitarian situation inAfghanistan, broadcast on Danish nationaltelevision in December.Additionally, ECHO was specifically covered in twoEuronews features each broadcast 20 times as wellas in two documentary programmes aired on France2 and Arte.Youth-oriented information activities developedduring the year included funding for an extensive12ECHO AT WORK information campaign by an NGO in Spanish schools and universities reaching up to four millionyoung people. A major World FoodProgramme/ECHO awareness-raising campaign,targeting 8,000 Italian schools, was also successfullyconcluded. The theme for this action was 'hunger inthe world'.Other projects supported under the grant facilityincluded conferences in Madrid and Copenhagenfeaturing gender issues and forgotten crisesrespectively and a high profile event involving there-creation of emergency feeding centres by an NGOpartner in Paris and Marseilles to highlightnutritional issues. This exercise attractedsignificant media coverage.Publications in 2002 included the ECHO AnnualReview, ECHO News, brochures on ECHO and itsNGO partners in Spain and Denmark (the EUPresidency countries) and leaflets on Angola andthe Northern Caucasus. Evaluation The main evaluations in the 2002 programmecovered ECHO-financed actions in favour of thevictims of the 2001 earthquakes in India and ElSalvador and operations it funded in Cambodia.Three studies were ongoing at the end of 2002.These concern the World Food Programme (WFP),DIPECHO in South Asia and ECHO's response toserious drought conditions.As regards the evaluation of WFP activities, a draftevaluation report was available for the ECHO-WFPstrategic dialogue in November 2002. The WFP'spositive reception of the evaluators, and the use towhich their work has been put, are good examplesof cooperation between the two partners. Theevaluation of the first DIPECHO programme insouth Asia also resulted in positive findings. Thisstudy will contribute to a further overall evaluationof disaster preparedness activities to be undertakenin 2003.Three further studies not initially foreseen wereundertaken. These concerned human resources, ITplatforms and quality issues for NGOs. Their resultswere presented and discussed at the annualconference with ECHO partners held on 14-15October 2002 in Brussels.The planned global evaluations of ECHO's disasterpreparedness activities, the operations it financesin Sudan and its response to the needs of specificvulnerable groups in emergency situations havebeen carried over from 2002 to 2003.An updated edition of the ECHO Manual for theevaluation of humanitarian aid was also distributedin 2002. Disaster prevention andpreparedness As well as responding to disasters of all kinds, ECHO is helping vulnerable communities preparethemselves for natural disasters with its DisasterPreparedness Programme (DIPECHO). ECHO's budgetfor disaster prevention and preparedness operationswas \u20ac8 million in 2002.The programme is focused on the main disaster-prone regions of the developing world:Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Caribbean,Central America and the Andean Community.Examples of specific activities funded throughDIPECHO include strengthening localmanagement and institutions, training,awareness-campaigns, information networks,early warning systems, relief mechanisms andhazard mapping.2002 saw the continuing implementation of thethree DIPECHO Action Plans approved in 2001for the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia,Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela), South Asia(India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan)and the Caribbean region. The \u20ac1.8 millionAndean Action Plan was boosted with a further\u20ac1.64 million in 2002. The overall objective ofthis decision was to help prepare localcommunities and institutions, to enhance theircapacity to cope with disasters and to financesmall-scale disaster mitigation works.The Commission also approved a \u20ac6.36 milliondecision in December 2002, to help vulnerablecommunities living in South East Asia andCentral America prepare for natural disasters.Projects include the establishment of earlywarning systems, training courses for local staffand volunteers, and awareness raising. In SouthEast Asia, DIPECHO funds are targeted atVietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Philippines, Indonesiaand Thailand all of which are prone to cyclones,floods, forest fires and drought. The CentralAmerican countries covered by this decision -Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemalaand Costa Rica - can be affected by drought,hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,flooding and landslides. Training and studies Thirty-nine applications were received in 2002for funding under ECHO's grant facility fortraining, studies and networks in thehumanitarian field. The budget for this actionwas \u20ac1.8 million.In the training sector, projects selected forsupport included courses on professionalcapacity building. Studies on management ofthe security of international humanitarianactivities and guidelines on support for refugeesand displaced persons were among the researchprojects to receive financing.ECHO also continued to support the Network onHumanitarian Assistance (NOHA), which offersa one-year multi-disciplinary post-graduatediploma through seven participatinguniversities. Students follow a curriculumwhich offers a comprehensive overview of thehumanitarian aid environment. Their studiesare complemented by an internship either in ahumanitarian organisation or in ECHO.13ECHO AT WORK Humanitarian funding by country/region Afghanistan and Pakistan Funding - \u20ac72.754 million In 2002, Afghanistan had to cope with one of the largestrefugee influxes in living memory. Defying all predictions,between 1.5 million and two million people returned fromPakistan and Iran, together with 500,000 who went backto their home areas from elsewhere in the country. Theyreturned to a situation devastated by more than 20 yearsof war: homes destroyed or uninhabitable, fieldsuncultivated and an absence of even basic infrastructures.Two-thirds of those returning settled in Kabul or the areabetween there and the Pakistan border, thus placingenormous strains on these locations. In the south, theyfaced the added burden of five years of continuousdrought, one of the worst in living memory. Meanwhile,substantial numbers of people continued to be displacedeither inside Afghanistan or as refugees in neighbouringstates, in particular as old scores were settled and ethnicminorities forced out.ECHO maintained its ongoing humanitarian commitmentto the victims of the Afghan crisis providing substantialfunding for a wide range of actions. The overall aim hasbeen to maintain the sustainability of the return and thusprevent further displacements and to enable people to stayalive and not have to move from the drought-affectedareas. For returnees, support included the construction ofshelters, latrines and water supply networks, healthinterventions, the distribution of seeds, fertilisers andbasic non-food supplies such as blankets and fuel, andincome-generating schemes. Victims of drought wereprovided with drinking water, irrigation, primary healthcare and nutritional support. For IDPs and refugees in neighbouring countries, measures were taken to provide water/sanitation facilities and healthcare. ECHO alsosupported projects to boost awareness of the dangers ofunexploded mines and bombs.In December, additional funds were provided to help nearly700,000 vulnerable people through the winter, whentemperatures in Afghanistan can reach -20\u00b0C.The overall funding of almost \u20ac73 million included \u20ac2 million allocated to help victims of the earthquake whichstruck the Baghlan region on 25 March. Angola Funding - \u20ac12 million After 30 years of war, the possibility of real peace came toAngola with the signature of a ceasefire between thegovernment and UNITA forces. With the fighting ended,enormous needs were identified among displaced peopleliving in previously inaccessible areas. Angola has anestimated four million IDPs.Significant humanitarian support is required for theforeseeable future together with rehabilitation and longerterm development assistance, to help the most vulnerablesections of the population and consolidate the peaceprocess.The \u20ac12 million channelled through ECHO was part of a \u20ac129 million action plan drawn up by the European Commission for a wide range of actions including de-mining and mine awareness, child protection and familytracing, return and resettlement support and the provisionof medicines.ECHO's assistance was used for nutrition, health projects,co-ordination and logistics, as well as emergency relief.In addition, some \u20ac2 million was provided for Angola in a humanitarian aid decision for Southern Africa taken by theCommission in September (see the \"Southern Africa\" rubricin this Global Reach section). Angola benefited under this Global reach Reducing the risk of returning home After nineteen years of conflict, a death toll of 65,000 including many civilians and the displacement of more than 800,000people, a truce was signed in February between the Sri Lankangovernment and the Tamil Tigers. The agreement has raised hopesof peace for the uprooted people scattered throughout Sri Lanka,and already 200,000 have returned to their home areas. The greatest danger they face is unexploded ordnance (UXOs), and inparticular, the thousands of anti-personnel mines laid along the changingbattle lines of almost two decades of fighting in the north and north-eastof the country.Following an assessment mission in early 2002, ECHO allocated \u20ac770,000 for the demining programmes of two specialist European NGOs: HALOTrust working in the Jaffna peninsula and the Mine Advisory Group(MAG) operating in the Vanni area. The work included minefield surveysand demarcation, training for deminers and the bulk destruction ofUXOs. The scale of the problem revealed by the initial findings promptedECHO to allocate further funding for humanitarian de-mining operationsby the two NGOs and to support a third partner working in this area,Norwegian People's Aid. The direct aid for demining was completed bymine awareness activities and psychosocial support to mine victims,implemented through UNICEF. ECHO's overall financing for theseoperations in 2002 amounted to \u20ac3,050,000. In many post-conflict situations, the large-scale return of displacedpeople to their homes is accompanied by a big increase in mine accidents.The fact that no such increase was recorded in Sri Lanka shows thepositive impact of the mine clearance and awareness-raising worksupported by ECHO and other agencies.A Sri inJaffna receivestraining on - SRI LANKA Antoine Lemasson - ECHO 14ECHO AT WORK regional programme through resettlement support and health-related actions. Brazil Funding -\u20ac0.350 million Relief assistance was provided to the victims of landslidesand floods which struck Brazil in December 2001 andcontinued during January and February 2002. Burkina Faso Funding -\u20ac0.175 million ECHO supported a meningitis treatment programme,following a serious outbreak of the disease in Burkina Fasoin 2001. Burundi Funding -\u20ac17.5 million Since 1993 Burundi has been in the grip of a civil warinvolving opposing Tutsi and Hutu armed groups. Despitethe peace agreement signed in August 2000 and theinauguration of a transitional government in November2001, sporadic fighting continues to force many peoplefrom their homes, and the situation was furtherexacerbated in 2001 by severe food shortages. At thebeginning of 2002, it was estimated that a million people(15% of the population) relied on humanitarian assistance.ECHO continued its relief programme for vulnerablegroups in Burundi including displaced people, women,children and the elderly. Its \"global plan\" of \u20ac17.5 million focused particularly on expanding the provision of primaryhealth care. Cambodia Funding - \u20ac5.5 million Although Cambodia has been relatively peaceful for thepast decade, some areas of the country have only recentlybecome fully accessible and there are still significantneeds, especially in the north. Vulnerable groups includereturnees and populations of remote areas lacking accessto basic services such as healthcare and clean water. Ruralcommunities still face a serious threat from anti-personnelmines scattered during past fighting.ECHO supported a range of projects including watersupply works, the provision of essential items (tools,seeds, drugs and medical equipment), training for healthpersonnel and other public service workers, small-scalerehabilitation and mine clearance. \u20ac700,000 was also allocated to help prevent a threatened epidemic of Denguehaemorrhagic fever. China/Tibet Funding - \u20ac4.45 million In June, landslides and floods provoked by torrential rainaffected some 80 million people in China. More than 900deaths were reported, up to three million housing unitswere destroyed or damaged and four million hectares offarmland were inundated. Untreated effluentcontaminated surface and groundwater reserves, leadingto a dramatic increase in cases of diarrhoea, fever and skininfection.Funds were allocated for a range of actionsincluding the distribution of rice and wheat to subsistencefarmers and their families (up to 100,000 people), thesupply of medicines, quilts, clothing and mosquito nets,and the construction of 14,000 hygienic toilets, 500water tanks and two primary schools.ECHO also supported the victims of heavy snowfalls in the Ngari prefecture of Tibet. Many nomadic people lost theirlivestock and thus their only means of subsistence. The aidwas used to buy food for 25,000 people, to purchasealmost 8,000 sheep and to supply essential drugs. Colombia Funding - \u20ac9.2 million ECHO maintained its support for IDPs forced to flee fromtheir homes because of the continuing conflict. Itsstrategy is to provide emergency relief during andimmediately after displacement and to offer post-emergency assistance including shelter, healthcare,sanitation and psycho-social support in the main receptionareas. It is estimated that up to 200,000 IDPs wereassisted under ECHO's programme for 2002 located mainlyin rural areas, including some 125,000 immediately aftertheir displacement. Congo (Democratic Republic) Funding - \u20ac38.1 million The long-running crisis in the DRC has caused suffering onan almost unimaginable scale. The number of displacedpeople has doubled since 1999 and now stands at morethan three million, including some 360,000 refugees fromneighbouring countries. Many areas face severe foodshortages and malnutrition is widespread. The collapse ofhealth and water delivery systems has resulted in the re-emergence of many diseases.In ECHO's \"global plan\" for the DRC in 2002 ( \u20ac32 million), the focus was on health, nutrition and food security. ECHOconcentrated on delivering relief to the least accessibleareas of the country, where there are enormous unmetneeds. Funding was used for medicines and vaccines,medical supplies and training, targeting 2.7 million people.Despite the scale of the humanitarian crisis, there arestable areas in Congo where ECHO is looking to hand overestablished programmes to other, longer term aidinstruments.On 17 January, Mount Nyiragongo, an active volcano closeto Goma in eastern DRC, erupted. In a single day, most ofthe town's 300,000 inhabitants left on foot as lava flowsadvanced, destroying everything in their path. ECHOresponded rapidly to the crisis, providing air transport tothe stricken zone (through ECHO Flight) as well as \u20ac5 million for water/sanitation, shelter, food and medicines.ECHO's support covered the immediate needs of 100,000people.In a separate decision, \u20ac1.1 million was allocated to support Angolan refugees in the provinces of Bas Congoand Bandundu. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Funding - \u20ac1.5 million Funding has been provided to assist victims of the internalconflict that broke out in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in September. Inareas affected by the fighting, access to food and healthservices has become increasingly difficult. ECHO supportedthe running of primary and secondary health facilities andsupplied supplementary food rations for the most seriouslyaffected sections of the population. Cuba Funding \u20ac0.6 million In September and October, Hurricanes Isidore and Liliswept through western Cuba, causing floods and 15ECHO AT WORK widespread destruction. ECHO financed emergency rehabilitation and the provision of essential relief,including drinking water, for 28,000 victims of thestorms. Ecuador Funding - \u20ac1.248 million Heavy rains in February, March and April causedwidespread flooding in Ecuador, washing away roads andbridges in coastal areas and destroying more than 7,000homes as well as crops of rice, coffee, maize, bananas andcocoa.ECHO allocated \u20ac800,000 to repair water supply systems and purify polluted water, providing 10,000 families withaccess to clean drinking water.In November, the volcano \"El Reventador\" eruptedscattering ash across a large area and causing widespreaddamage to homes, crops and infrastructures. ECHOprovided immediate relief assistance worth \u20ac448,000 under its fast-track \"primary emergency procedure\". Eritrea Funding - \u20ac1.75 million ECHO continued supporting humanitarian operations infavour of vulnerable people in the aftermath of Eritrea'sborder war with Ethiopia. Once the UN-monitoredTemporary Security Zone was established along thefrontier in May 2001, most of the estimated 300,000internally displaced Eritreans returned to their villages.However, up to 60,000 people remained in camps,dependent on international assistance for their survival.These included Eritreans unable to return home because ofthe threat of unexploded mines, and refugees fromEthiopia and Sudan.ECHO funded essential relief items for both camp residentsand returnees, as well as mine-awareness education forpeople returning home. It also supported the protectionprogramme of the International Committee of the RedCross, and the UNHCR for the return of Eritrean refugees. Ethiopia Funding - \u20ac7.75 million In addition to funding for specific emergencies, such as inresponse to a major outbreak of meningitis, ECHOfinanced a \"Pastoral Early Warning\" programme for thevictims of drought and conflict.In response to the new and very widespread drought at the end of 2002, ECHO provided further assistance, incoordination with the Commission's ongoing and large-scale food aid response. This new funding was focused ontackling life-threatening malnutrition and other drought-related acute illnesses. It included health care,supplementary and therapeutic feeding, livestock supportand the provision of safe drinking water and sanitation toprevent the spread of waterborne diseases.Additionally, 30,000 Somali refugees living in five campsin south-east Ethiopia were assisted in their return home.The voluntary repatriation package covered food,transport, and small cash-grants. ECHO also financed theshort-term provision of water and sanitation in Somalilandfor the returnees. Gabon Funding - \u20ac0.3 million In December 2001, Gabon was struck by the deadly Ebolavirus for the fourth time in ten years. This latest outbreakwas thankfully rapidly contained by the promptintervention of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and the WorldHealth Organisation. Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador Funding -\u20ac5.028 million Over the last three years, Central America has experienceddisruption to its usual rainfall pattern, with severedrought in some areas and heavy flooding in others. Theunusual weather has reduced crop yields. Coupled with theregion's economic problems, this has led to increased foodinsecurity. In Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, ECHOfunds were used mainly to tackle malnutrition, but alsocovered food and seed distribution and improvements todrinking water and sanitation systems.ECHO also provided follow-up assistance during 2002 fortraining in rebuilding of homes in rural areas of El Salvadorfollowing the two powerful earthquakes that broughtdeath and destruction to the country in early 2001. Thiswas in addition to \u20ac10 million provided in the immediate aftermath of the earthquakes and reported in last year'sECHO Annual Review. A place to forget about the war More than three years after the beginning of the second Chechen conflict, the population of the republic continues to endureterrible suffering. Artillery bombardments and mines havewrought widespread destruction, while many people have beenphysically abused or have simply disappeared. No family isuntouched by this tragedy and almost everyone has lost relativesor friends. In this atmosphere of daily terror, children areparticularly affected, and many suffer from severe psychologicaltrauma.It is important to protect the children, as much and as early aspossible, from the horrors of the war and provide them with asecure environment where they can go every day and experiencesome kind of normal life. This is why UNICEF, with financialsupport from ECHO, has opened seven child-friendly spaces in theChechen capital, Grozny. These provide a safe haven for childrenof pre-school age, and a relaxed atmosphere where they canbenefit from recreational and educational activities. PROJECT FOCUS - CHECHNYAA safe haven for children living in a traumatic environment.UNICEF16ECHO AT WORK Haiti Funding - \u20ac0.4 million Urgent aid was provided to victims of floods in Haiti,following torrential rains in May. The funds were used topurchase emergency supplies and medicines, to constructwater supply systems and to restore health services. India Funding - \u20ac5 million Rahjastan, India's second largest state and one of itspoorest, suffered a prolonged drought during the springand summer causing water and food shortages. 80% ofcrops were lost.ECHO intervened to provide clean water for more than100,000 beneficiaries and food supplies for some 350,000people. Other projects were set up to mitigate the effectsof future droughts. A total of more than seven millionpeople benefited directly or indirectly from theprogrammes funded under this decision.Assistance was also provided for victims of conflict inKashmir and communal violence in Gujarat, as well as forSri Lankan refugees in the camps of Tamil Nadu. The aidincluded nutritional support, sanitation measures,psychosocial support and education for children affectedby the conflicts. Indonesia and East Timor Funding -\u20ac5.475 million Now that East Timor is independent and stability has beenrestored, the focus of the European Commission's work inthe country is shifting from relief operations towardsrehabilitation and development. During 2002, while in theprocess of concluding its operations in East Timor, ECHOcontinued to support up to 70,000 East Timorese refugeesstill living in camps in West Timor (Indonesia). It providednutritional support, water supplies and health educationto camp residents, with a particular emphasis on pregnantand breastfeeding women, and children. The aid packageincluded support for the voluntary return of displaced EastTimorese families.In Indonesia, ECHO assisted victims of natural disastersand civil unrest which have resulted in the displacementof more than 1.3 million people within the country. ManyIDPs faced severe hardship including malnourishment anddisease. In Jakarta, flooding caused serious sanitationproblems in slum areas. ECHO helped to improve the livingconditions of highly vulnerable groups through theprovision of clean water and sanitation, health items,food and other basic essentials. Iran Funding -\u20ac0.5 million 237 people were killed, 1,300 injured and 25,000 madehomeless by an earthquake that struck north-western Iranon 22 June. In response to this disaster, ECHO funded theprovision of basic water and sanitation infrastructures inthe affected area. Iraq Funding -\u20ac13 million Since 1980, the humanitarian situation in Iraq hasprogressively deteriorated as a result of two majorconflicts (the Iran-Iraq war and the Gulf war) followed byten years of strict international sanctions. Basicinfrastructures have crumbled with health servicesparticularly affected. The education and water/sanitationsystems are also in a very poor state due to a lack of investment.ECHO's humanitarian effort in Iraq has been designed tocomplement the UN's 'Oil for Food' programme allowingthe Iraqi government to sell oil in return for food andother basic supplies. ECHO's main emphasis has accordinglybeen on providing health care, clean water and sanitationin the centre and south of the country where the greatestneeds have been identified. In 2002, ECHO was the largestsingle donor of external assistance to Iraq. Kenya Funding - \u20ac2.5 million In north and north-east Kenya, poor rains during 2001prevented a recovery in agricultural production after thedevastating drought of 1999-2000. ECHO's assistance wastargeted at 70,000 pastoralists with support for health,nutrition, livestock and water/sanitation actions. Laos Funding - \u20ac1.13 million In Laos, ECHO provided humanitarian aid for vulnerabledisplaced people and possible victims of resettlementpolicies. Actions funded included improvements to waterand sanitation systems, the construction of an accessroad, the distribution of hygiene kits and education inmine-awareness. An underlying aim was to boost ethnicminorities' access to a sustainable livelihood as analternative to resettlement. There was also financing formine clearance and health training for IDPs. Madagascar Funding - \u20ac1 million The Commission provided assistance to tackle a majorlocust infestation which threatened crops in the southernprovinces of Madagascar. The funds were used to purchaseinsecticides and for the spraying of locust breedinggrounds using helicopters. Mexico Funding - \u20ac1 million ECHO support was directed towards vulnerable people inthe Chiapas region of Mexico, where the after-effects ofthe 1994 uprising continued to be felt. A large number ofpeople were still displaced and many of those who hadreturned home had urgent nutritional and health needs.The funding was used to provide food rations and medicalservices to around 30,000 people, and to train farmers insustainable farming methods. Middle East Funding -\u20ac35 million ECHO continued to provide substantial support to ease theplight of people living in the occupied Palestinianterritories, and of the most vulnerable Palestinian refugeesand non-refugee populations in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.After many months of violence, the economic and socialsituation of the Palestinians worsened significantly. Joblosses resulting from closures and movement restrictionscontributed to the suffering and big increases wererecorded both in the numbers of malnourished childrenand in the incidence of preventable diseases.Part of the funding from ECHO was used for nutritionalsupport, psychosocial treatment for children andadolescents, training for medical staff and healtheducation.17ECHO AT WORK Other funds went to help meet the needs of vulnerable Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza through thedistribution of food, medicines, medical supplies, hygienekits, cooking fuel and other basic essentials. ECHO alsohelped to restore clean water supplies and boostprofessional medical coverage. Specific areas of operation include Jenin, which suffered widespread destructionfollowing incursions by the Israeli army and Ramallah,where the hospital faced a serious shortage of medicines. Myanmar (Burma) and Thailand Funding - \u20ac8.965 million ECHO continued to offer vital assistance to Burmeserefugees living in the border regions of Thailand. Inaddition to providing basic food supplies, ECHO fundedimprovements to health infrastructures, health andhygiene training, immunisation and the provision ofdrinking water.Within Myanmar, ECHO was involved in the effort tocombat malaria through the supply of medications andimprovements to water and sanitation systems. Nepal/Bhutan Funding - \u20ac3.675 million The plight of more than 100,000 Bhutanese refugeesliving in camps in south-east Nepal is one of the world's\"forgotten crises\". The refugees rely almost entirely onrations channelled through the World Food Programme, asthey are not permitted to seek work or cultivate landoutside the camps. During the last two years, WFP hasexperienced increasing difficulties in supplying adequatefood to the camps. ECHO therefore allocated \u20ac2 million for the purchase of food on the local market.The remaining funds went to help the people of Nepalaffected by the internal conflict between governmentforces and Maoist rebels. Since November 2001, 5,000people have been killed in the fighting and the economyhas been badly affected. In the far west, the health systemis under enormous strain due to the mass displacement ofconflict-affected populations. ECHO supported protectionactivities for harrassed and intimidated populations, withan emphasis on re-establishing family contacts andpromoting international humanitarian law. Primary healthcare was also targeted.North Korea Funding -\u20ac21.025 million Since the early 1990s, there has been a steady decline ineconomic and social conditions in the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea (DPRK). Supplies of food, water andmedicines have diminished drastically leading to a bigincrease in malnutrition and preventable diseases, especially among children. Droughts and floods since themid-1990s have exacerbated the situation.ECHO funding has been used to finance the procurementand distribution of 39,000 tons of cereals targeted mainlyat children and mothers of new-born babies. The aid isbeing channelled through the WFP , which has outlets atcommunity level.Support was also provided for initiatives to improve basichealth and nutrition while around 250,000 peoplebenefited from ECHO-funded improvements to water andsewerage systems.Floods during the summer caused substantial damage inthe west of the country and ECHO responded with\u20ac300,000 in emergency aid to meet the immediate needs of some 22,500 people. Paraguay Funding - \u20ac0.92 million A two-year long drought in western Paraguay threatenedthe lives of 200,000 people, including indigenouscommunities who live on subsistence crops, forestry andhunting.ECHO supplied food and clean drinking water for 32,000vulnerable people living in rural areas, as well as basicmedicines to treat respiratory infections, tuberculosis andparasitic diseases. Peru and Bolivia Funding - \u20ac1.3 million Southern Peru and the department of Potosi in Boliviawere affected by snowstorms and extremely lowtemperatures in July. ECHO provided emergency assistanceto rehabilitate 500 homes, protect 50,000 livestock andtrain local people on how to respond to natural disasters. Vital support for hospitals After more than a decade of conflict in Somalia, most of the country's health facilities and other social services havecrumbled. Yet the ongoing violence generates a steady stream ofcasualties who need medical assistance. In Mogadishu alone,some 5,000 people suffer gunshot or stab wounds every year.ECHO supports an ICRC programme for three hospitals that carryout emergency war surgery. Other urgent cases such as roadaccident victims are also treated. Since 1999, about 11,000people have had surgery or other treatment under thisprogramme - possibly the ICRC's largest caseload of war injuriesin the world.Another hospital (SOS-Kinderdorf) provides maternity andpaediatric services, with support from ECHO. This includes anextensive nutritional programme for children and expectantmothers. About 75,000 benefited from these services in 2001-2002. PROJECT FOCUS - SOMALIAInfants' ward in a Mogadishu hospital.18ECHO AT WORK Russian Federation/Northern Caucasus Funding - \u20ac28 million The second armed conflict in Chechnya, which began in1999, has led to the displacement of large numbers ofChechen people in the Northern Caucasus. There are some140,000 IDPs within Chechnya itself and around 120,000in Ingushetia and 5,000 in Daghestan. A complete lack ofsecurity was the main impediment to return to normal lifein the Chechen Republic. IDPs continued to depend on humanitarian assistance. Since there was an upsurge inviolence throughout 2002, it was clear that most of theIDPs would not be able to return home under acceptableconditions. Humanitarian agencies operating in the regioncontinued to face access problems, particularly withinChechnya itself, making it impossible to deliver assistancein accordance with basic humanitarian principles.The bulk of ECHO's funding was allocated to cover theprimary needs of vulnerable people affected by theconflict within Chechnya or displaced in neighbouringrepublics. ECHO financed the supply of food, shelter andnon-food items (bedding, tents, clothes etc), water andsanitation and medicines, as well as protection,psychosocial support and legal advice.ECHO is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance insupport of victims of the conflict in Chechnya. Senegal Funding - \u20ac0.75 million ECHO supported a mass emergency vaccination campaignagainst yellow fever, covering 1.6 million people, followinga serious outbreak of the disease in September. Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia Funding - \u20ac19 million These three coastal West African countries haveexperienced conflict of varying intensity over the lasttwelve years resulting in widespread destruction, hugepopulation displacements and an overall deterioration ofbasic services.In 2002, the main focus of instability was Liberia. InSierra Leone and Guinea, the situation continued tostabilise although the after-effects of Sierra Leone's longcivil war continued to be felt. The country still had some550,000 uprooted people while almost 200,000 SierraLeoneans and Liberians were registered as refugees inGuinea. Many of the estimated 75,000 people who havereturned to Sierra Leone since August 2001 also requirehumanitarian assistance and further needs have beenidentified in previously inaccessible areas of Sierra Leone.ECHO funded primary health care as well as measures totackle malnutrition. Given the large number of displacedpeople in the region, there was a focus on providingshelter materials and basic non-food items such asblankets and cooking utensils. Another priority sector waswater and sanitation, with targeted actions aimed atboosting the availability of clean water, improvingsanitation systems and promoting hygiene througheducation and training at community level. Somalia Funding - \u20ac4.5 million (excluding ECHO Flight) Somalia continues to face some of the most difficulthumanitarian conditions in the world. Basicinfrastructures have been destroyed and cycles of drought and flooding have added to the already huge needs generated by the country's decade-long internal crisis.ECHO funded a range of humanitarian activities includingimprovements to primary health care, measures to reduceacute malnutrition and the rehabilitation of water andsanitation systems. In the centre and south of the country,there was a particular emphasis on meeting the health andnutritional needs of the most vulnerable sections of thepopulation, through the distribution of emergency seedsand tools, veterinary support and treatment for choleravictims. Southern Africa (Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia andZimbabwe) Funding - \u20ac36.5 million In 2002, large areas of Southern Africa were confrontedwith a complex and developing humanitarian crisis due toa variety of factors. A combination of drought, badgovernance and inappropriate food security policies left upto 13 million people facing serious food shortages. Much ofthe region's population was already highly vulnerable, dueto poor economic conditions in general and the terribletoll exacted by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.The bulk of ECHO's funding was allocated in a regionaldecision for \u20ac30 million to support food aid operations including nutritional surveillance and logistics, projects inthe water, sanitation and medical sectors and agriculturalrehabilitation. Most of this funding was directed toZimbabwe and Zambia.In Malawi, ECHO supported the national network ofnutritional rehabilitation units as well as improvements tothe nutritional monitoring and surveillance system. Afterthe previous year's devastating cholera epidemic, it alsomounted a cholera preparedness operation throughout thecountry.Special attention was paid to Zambia's growing refugeepopulation with assistance for new arrivals and vulnerablegroups in the refugee camps as well as local hostcommunities. Actions funded included food aid, healthscreening, vaccinations, and water/sanitation projects.The decision for \u20ac30 million included some \u20ac2 million funding for Angola which mainly involves repatriationassistance for refugees (see also the Angola rubric on page 13). Southern Caucasus (Armenia and Georgia) Funding - \u20ac2.5 million Humanitarian assistance was provided to finalise supportto farmers in Southern Armenia affected by droughts in2000 and 2001. ECHO's support was used for training andthe installation of irrigation systems. Funds also wenttowards promoting diversification and sustainable farmingactivities.In Georgia, the effects of the internal conflict that brokeout in 1992 are still being felt in particular in and aroundthe autonomous republic of Abkhazia. This conflict led tothe displacement of 250,000 people and caused seriouseconomic disruption. Abkhazia itself suffered enormousdamage and tens of thousands of the republic's formerinhabitants are still displaced within Georgia, mainly inthe west. ECHO funds were used to distribute dryfoodstuffs, maintain food canteens and support an 19ECHO AT WORK income-generation programme for people living on either side of the border line between Abkhazia and Georgiaproper. Projects were targeted particularly at the elderlyand destitute. Sri Lanka Funding - \u20ac8.3 million After 19 years of fighting, the ceasefire signed in Februarybetween the government and Tamil separatists broughtnew hope for peace. It was also the catalyst for a large-scale movement of IDPs back to their home areas. Almost200,000 displaced people returned home in 2002.ECHO continued to support an ICRC project to maintain avital sea transport link with the Jaffna peninsula. The shipwas used to deliver medical and other supplies to the area,where 900,000 people were effectively cut off from therest of the country until the re-opening of the main north-south road.Following the truce, further funding was allocated to helpreturnees re-establish themselves in their home areas,where houses and infrastructures had been destroyed ordamaged during the war. Sri Lanka has an estimated600,000 unexploded mines scattered around the formerconflict zones, posing a serious threat to returnees andlocal residents. ECHO therefore also supported mineclearance work and mine-awareness training. Sudan Funding - \u20ac18 million As the civil war between the Sudanese government andarmed groups controlling much of the south of thecountry entered its 19th year, the suffering of thepopulation continued. The situation has been aggravatedby humanitarian access denials affecting large parts of thecountry, as well as recurring droughts and floods thatimpair food security and contribute to the high incidenceof serious diseases. An estimated four million people (13%of the population) are internally displaced.ECHO's 2002 funding was aimed mainly at preventing afurther deterioration in the conditions of the mostvulnerable sections of the population, with a special focuson IDPs. Priority areas were health/nutrition, benefiting660,000 people, water/sanitation, benefiting a further355,000, food security, emergency preparedness andlogistical support for humanitarian operations and specialmandates.Tajikistan Funding - \u20ac10 million Continued humanitarian support was provided to help thevictims of the worst drought Tajikistan has experienced for75 years. The drought further stretched the copingmechanisms of the 6.5 million population, 85% of whomlive below the poverty line, in a country recovering fromcivil war.A key component of ECHO's programme for the victims ofthis largely forgotten crisis was the funding of basic foodaid for 55,000 people, including 15,000 children sufferingfrom acute malnutrition. It also concentrated on improvingaccess to safe drinking water and primary health care withthe aim of reducing the mortality rate caused by epidemicsof infectious diseases. Tanzania Funding - \u20ac27 million ECHO continued to support the running of the refugeecamps in Tanzania, which host around half a million peoplewho have fled from conflict in neighbouring countries.This is the largest refugee caseload in Africa and one ofthe biggest in the world. Most of the people living in thecamps come from Burundi and the Democratic Republic ofCongo. The funds were spent on a wide range of activitiesincluding food aid, logistics, water/sanitation, health,nutrition, shelter and protection.ECHO is the largest single donor to the UNHCR's refugeeprogramme in Tanzania. It has channelled more than \u20ac90 million in humanitarian assistance to the camps since1999. Uganda Funding - \u20ac2.12 million The northern and eastern districts of Uganda have anestimated one million displaced people due to localinstability, violence by armed groups and civil war inneighbouring Sudan and DRC. The general insecurity hasled to the concentration of thousands of people incompounded areas where basic services are eitherinadequate or non-existent. The situation has been madeworse by recent droughts.ECHO supported vulnerable people including IDPs and hostcommunities providing primary health care, clean waterand sanitation. Funds were also used to help reintegratechild soldiers into society. Disaster preparation pays dividends Over the last two decades, Nicaragua has been hit by floods, drought, volcanic eruptions, a tidal wave, an earthquake, andfour hurricanes, including \"Mitch\" - one of the most devastatingstorms in the history of Central America. As a developing country,it struggles to provide the resources needed to be ready fordisasters and to cope with their effects when they occur.A pilot action financed by the DIPECHO programme in theChinandega and Le\u00f3n regions of Nicaragua shows that disaster prevention can be effective. The motto of the project, run by Italian NGOMovimondo, was 'prevention is better than cure'. It involved supportingthe Nicaraguan authorities in implementing an existing law on theprevention, mitigation and management of natural catastrophes.Scientific surveillance of earthquake and volcanic risks was improved,and a system of broadcast warnings to the population was established.Water tanks were built to boost storage capacity in an area prone todrought. Efforts were also made to establish a disaster prevention'culture' through mass distribution of information packs, theestablishment of an information centre on natural risks in the area,teaching in schools, and training courses for adults.Local people proved ready and able to prepare for disasters effectivelyonce equipped with the necessary skills. \"I used to be afraid ofearthquakes, but now I know why they happen and what I should dowhen one occurs\", said Mercedes, a pupil at one of the local schools.Another participant, Juan, explained: \"For a long time the people ofTololar did not understand these natural phenomena or what we shoulddo to prepare for them. Now we have a local emergency plan, whichmeans we are better prepared to act before and when we are faced withany kind of emergency.\" In 1998, Tololar was badly damaged in a mudslidefollowing the passage of Hurricane Mitch, and 24 of the town'sinhabitants were killed. Teaching disasterpreparation tolocal people.Vital trainingwhich couldhelp save lives. PROJECT FOCUS - NICARAGUA Movimondo 20ECHO AT WORK Vietnam Funding - \u20ac1.195 million ECHO provided aid for victims of tropical storms,landslides and flooding which struck Vietnam in July.Support included improvements to water and sanitationfacilities, and education on personal hygiene and nutritionwith the aim of reducing epidemics.Funding was also provided to cover a serious shortfall instocks of the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine. Western Sahara Funding - \u20ac14.34 million ECHO continued to support the 155,000 Western Saharanrefugees living in the Tindouf region of Algeria whoseplight attracts little international media coverage. Therefugees, in exile for 27 years, live in four large camps insouth-western Algeria, and they depend largely oninternational assistance for their survival.The main emphasis of ECHO's programme was to diversifythe refugees' diet by providing complementary food itemssuch as tuna, grilled maize and powdered milk. Inaddition, to assist the WFP , which is responsible for basicfoodstuffs, ECHO financed the supply of barley, rice,pulses and wheat flour. It also supported local productionof eggs and livestock and provided gluten-free wheatflower for children suffering from coeliac disease.As regards \"non-food items\" ECHO funds most of themedicines supplied to the refugees as well as the purchaseof tents, blankets and clothing kits. Western Balkans (Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia) Funding - \u20ac43 million The recovery of the Western Balkans from the 1999Kosovo crisis continued in 2002. This was reflected in theongoing process of phasing out humanitarian assistance infavour of longer term development instruments.The majority of ECHO funds were spent in Serbia wherethere were still significant humanitarian needs among thelarge refugee and IDP populations. Operations were alsofunded in Kosovo, Albania and the former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia (FYROM).ECHO assisted half a million people who were eitherrefugees, IDPs or members of other vulnerable groups,providing food, non-food items, healthcare and housing.In addition it supported repatriation and social integrationschemes, facilitated access to healthcare and funded legaland psychological support projects.In Kosovo, ECHO also helped to finance specific protectionactions implemented by UNHCR in favour of minoritygroups living in enclaves and isolated areas. Yemen Funding - \u20ac1.59 million Yemen is a mainly rural society many of whose people donot have access to basic services and who are vulnerableto extreme weather conditions. The country is stillsuffering the after-effects of the civil war which ended in1994, and there are significant humanitarian needs,particularly in isolated regions.Since 1998, ECHO's strategy has been to target theseisolated areas. In 2002, support was provided to upgradeprimary health care institutions and supply medicines,benefiting around 110,000 people. ECHO also fundedimproved access to clean water for around 24,500 people.Other financing decisions Disaster preparedness and prevention (DIPECHO) Funding - \u20ac8 million The DIPECHO programme was launched by ECHO in 1997to help prepare populations in areas at risk from naturalcatastrophe and to support practical measures to reducethe risk. Funds are allocated for training, capacity-building, awareness-raising and early-warning projects aswell the organisation of relief services. During 2002, theCommission took two decisions amounting to a total of\u20ac8 million for projects in South America, Central America and South-East Asia (for details, see page 12). ECHO Flight Funding - \u20ac8.4 million From its base in Nairobi, and satellite hubs in Mogadishuand Hargeisa (Somalia), Mandera (Kenya) and Goma (DRC),ECHO Flight continued to provide free air transportcapacity to aid agencies operating relief and developmentprogrammes in Somalia, north-eastern Kenya, and theDemocratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Personnel and cargowere flown aboard scheduled services using a fleet of fivelight aircraft.Since its launch in May 1994, ECHO Flight has clocked upover 50,000 missions and carried more than 200,000 aidworkers and 6,000 tonnes of food and medical supplies tosome of the world's most vulnerable populations. Theservice has also carried out more than 200 emergencymedical or security evacuations. UNHCR Funding - \u20ac11 million ECHO provided financial support for UNHCR programmesin the fields of protection, registration and staff securityin refugee hosting countries, with a focus on Africa.Over the last ten years, UNHCR has been ECHO's mostimportant partner in the United Nations system. Refugeesseeking international protection are increasinglyencountering problems, such as closed borders, lengthyasylum applications and being sent back to states wherethey face persecution and danger. UNHCR is developing astandardised global registration system for refugees.21ECHO AT WORK Facts & figures COUNTRY/SUB-REGION DECISIONS IN \u20acM AFRICA, CARIBBEAN, PACIFIC 211.250 Angola and Central America 6.360 OTHER FUNDING 13.595 ECHO field experts 8.000Grants for training and studies 1.800Information 1.350Evaluation 1.000Other 1.445 TOTAL 537.790Financial decisions for humanitarian aid in 2002 Asia 26%Latin America 4%Balkans 8%NIS 8%Global 3% ACP countries 39% Middle East, North Africa 12%22ECHO AT WORK Facts & figures AUSTRIA: AUSTRIAN HELP PROGRAM, CARE \u00d6STERREICH, CARITAS AUSTRIA, MALTESER HOSPITAL SECOURS ACTION D'URGENCE INTERNATIONALE, AGENCE D'AIDE A LA COOPERATIONTECHNIQUE ET DEVELOPPEMENT VISIONDEUTSCHLAND.

Like many of her fellow Sahrawiworkers who provide essential services to155,000 Western Saharans in the camps of south-west Algeria, she is an unpaid volunteer.The refugees from the Western Sahara arevictims of one of the world's most forgottencrises. They fled to the barren region around theAlgerian town of Tindouf in the mid-1970s, asthe fighters of the Polisario independencemovement battled with Moroccan andMauritanian forces for control of Spain's formercolony. Despite a decade-long ceasefire betweenMorocco and the Polisario (Mauritania havingabandoned its claim to the southern part of theterritory), a permanent UN-brokered solutionhas proved elusive and the refugees are stillunable to return home.Life is hard for all those displaced in this remotepart of the Sahara desert, where temperaturescan reach 60\u00b0 C in summer, but those living inthe isolated wilaya (administrative district) of Dahkla face particular challenges. The otherthree main settlements, Layoun, Smara andAuserd, are all relatively close to Rabouni, theSahrawis' administrative centre which itself isonly a short drive from Tindouf. Dahkla,however, is 170 kilometres away and gettingthere in a four-wheel drive vehicle involves abumpy five-hour journey across empty andseemingly lifeless desert. The lorries whichdeliver vital supplies to the 30,000 or soinhabitants take a lot longer.In Dahkla, the NGO Terre des Hommes (Italy) , with financial support from ECHO, recentlyimplemented a project at the local hospitaldealing with mother and child health, trainingfor nurses and the provision of essential medicalequipment. Malluma Bukari was one of those tobe trained in nursing and midwifery,complementing her traditional skills acquiredduring 25 years of medical work.She explained to us how Sahrawi womennormally preferred to have their babies at home.Conditions in the camp were hardly ideal,however, and one in eight mothers died duringchildbirth or shortly afterwards. \"Nowadays\", she said, \"the women increasingly recognise theuseful role of the hospital, especially if there arecomplications in pregnancy.\"\"The project has given us a global understandingof what is involved,\" she told us, referring tothe training that she had received. \"We havelearned how to monitor the development of theunborn baby, the problems that might arise if itisn't in the right position and the importance ofpost-natal care. We explain all this to thewomen in their homes, or at the districtclinics.\" Early indications are that the schemehas had a positive impact. Maternal mortalityhas fallen to 8% and the hope is that this can bereduced further. In addition to maternity care,The Western Saharan refugees Labour of love Delivery room in the Dahkla hospital. ECHO -funded tents ready for distribution toSahrawi refugees, BBuukkaarrii,, a hospital25PEOPLE the hospital provides a range of other vital medical services for people of Dahkla.For ECHO, supporting the Sahrawi healthsystem is a key humanitarian objective andthis is reflected in the funding it allocates tohealth-related actions. In addition to specificNGO projects, it finances most of the medicinessupplied to the camp residents and distributesfamily hygiene kitsMaintaining the health of the refugees is alsoan underlying objective of ECHO's mainactivity in support of the refugees - theprovision of \"complementary\" food items suchas gofi (grilled maize) and powdered milk. Theaim is to add nutritional diversity to therefugees' diet. The World Food Programme isresponsible for coordinating the supply of\"basic food items\" which include cereals,pulses, oil and sugar. ECHO has helped out hereas well with the delivery of basic food productsand by funding a food buffer stock to ensurethat essential foodstuffs are distributedregularly to the refugees, even when there are fluctuations in the supply pipeline.ECHO's long record of support for the Sahrawirefugees is a reflection of European solidaritywith the world's most vulnerable populations.In implementing its mandate to provide aidimpartially to those who need it most, ECHOrecognises that it must pay particularattention to the victims of such \"forgotten\"humanitarian crises whose plight so rarelyattracts international media attention.Malluma Bukari was clearly grateful for thetraining she had received, enabling her tobecome a fully certified nurse. She views herunpaid work in the health sector over the pastquarter of a century as a \"humanitarian duty\"but, understandably, would like at last to havean opportunity to earn some money andimprove her situation. In this, she reflects alonging among all of the refugees to return toa normal life after so many years in exile. Malluma Bukari \"We have learned howto monitor thedevelopment that mightarise and theimportance of post-natal care\".26PEOPLE Eruption of El 'Reventador' in Ecuador Suddenly, the sky turned black northern Ecuador on 3 November 2002 resulted in very few direct casualties but it did give riseto serious humanitarian needs in the affectedarea, causing a great deal of material damageand further impoverishing local people alreadyin a highly vulnerable situation. The thick layerof ash that landed on the surrounding regiondamaged the homes of some of the country'spoorest people and caused many roofs tocollapse. ECHO immediately took a primaryemergency decision for \u20ac448,000 to support aid operations reaching 7,000 families.Maria Juana O\u00f1a (30) has lived inPambamarquito, in the district of Pichincha, forthe last 18 years .\"I had just gone out to get the cattle when suddenly the sky turned black. Itlooked as if there would be a rainstorm but thenthe thick cloud came right down on top of us,\"she told Spanish Red Cross workers who went toher village. \"My husband told me that it wasash. I tried to cover myself with a plastic sheetbut I was soon covered in the stuff. It kept onfalling for two days and nights.\"Pambamarquito was blanketed with a layer ofash ten centimetres thick. Several thousandpeople had to be evacuated from their homesand many suffered respiratory and sightproblems as a result of the gases and rubbleemitted from the volcano. All five of MariaJanua's children fell ill: \"They had spots, redeyes and flu-like symptoms. Even two months onwe are still sick. We have sore throats becausethere is still a lot of wind and ash.\"Maria Juana obtained ECHO-funded Red Crosskits for her children containing hygieneproducts and protection materials as well asfresh water - necessary because many drinkingwater sources had been polluted in the eruption.The most important thing, however, was food.\"We were given items such as rice, tuna, pastaand oil, which meant we had something to eat.But we need grass, green bananas and fodder forour animals.\"Animals are key assets for the people of theSierra, especially the women, who spend most oftheir time cultivating and raising livestock while the men more often work in construction.Maria Juana lost all her animals during theeruption .\"I had three cows, ten goats and 20 guinea pigs. They all died as they had nothing toeat. We didn't know what to do becauseeverything was covered in ash, and we weredesperate. I washed the grass before I gave it tothem, but they died all the same.\"The Red Cross distribution has made life easierfor Maria Juana, who expressed her gratitude toEurope for its demonstration of solidarity: \"Wehaven't always had enough to eat, so the aid isreally a great help to us.

ECHOplaying alongside the other children of Savda, beside thestream which runs about two kilometres fromher village in south-west Tajikistan.The stream comes from a natural spring anduntil recently was the only way for the 500villagers of Savda to obtain fresh water. It isn'talways easy to negotiate the steep, rocky paththat runs from the village to the stream,particularly in winter when it is covered withsnow and ice. Sometimes, it took up to half aday to make the round-trip, carrying bulkywater containers. So the temptation was todrink from stagnant pools of water, closer athand. Sadly, Nigora died of hepatitis last year,having drunk dirty water. She was just sevenyears old.Recently, things have changed for the better forthe inhabitants of this isolated community.Drinking water is now piped from the spring toa large tank in the middle of Savda and thewater is then distributed through four handpumps. Each household has access to enoughwater to meet its basic needs.\"Life has been very different for us since thewater began being piped directly to the village\",said Amir, who is the headmaster of school inSavda. \"Before, women and children used towalk for hours to fetch the water from thestream. It was tiring and dangerous, and therewas a limit to how much they could carry. Wenever had enough in reserve and people wouldsometimes draw water from closer but unsafesources.\"So informing the villagers about the risks posedby unsafe water sources is as important asproviding clean water. Amir explained: \"Sincethe installation work began, we have beenworking with volunteers to explain to thepeople of Savda, including the children, how touse the system and what to do to avoidinfection. This year, no-one in the village hasfallen ill.\"The project was financed by ECHO andimplemented by one of its NGO partners, ACTED(Agence pour la coop\u00e9ration technique et led\u00e9veloppement). Local people laid the pipes andbuilt the installations under a \"food for work\"scheme run by the World Food Programme(WFP). The local authorities provided the watertank.Too many Tajik children like Nigora are victimsof water-related diseases, their resistanceweakened by extreme poverty and lack ofadequate nutrition in a country struggling torecover from drought and civil war. ACTED andother ECHO partners have helped improve accessto safe drinking water for hundreds ofthousands of people throughout Tajikistan. IIn summer time, Nigora used to enjoy28PEOPLE Zimbabwe. Her home is situated on the leeward side of a low rocky hill where the soil is poorand rainfall is intermittent and unreliable allyear round. She lives on her family's one-acreplot where they have constructed their houses.From her home, she can view the attractivelandscape as the sunlight highlights thedifferent colours of rock and grass, set against abackdrop of clear blue sky. It sounds idyllic, butZale would much prefer a view of dark rain-filled clouds.This year, Zimbabwe faces what is called a 'greendrought'. In other words, the amount of rainthat has fallen - approximately 160mm in 4months - has been just enough to turn thevegetation green but well short of what isneeded for food crops to mature. Nor is thereenough to replenish the rivers and dams whoselevels drop fast when midday temperatures canreach as high as 45C. And when this \"rainy\"season comes to an end, the country has anotherseven or eight months to wait before there isany prospect of more significant rainfall.Beside Zale's thatched hut is a small gardenwhere she grows some food. But last year, andagain this year, the crops failed. There is abiting drought. She is a subsistence farmer whohas no other source of income or sustenance.Adjacent to her garden is what used to be achicken-run now turned into a goat-pen. Thechickens had to be moved to a relative's homewhen Zale fell ill, as she could no longer takecare of them. Only a few goats remain in thepen and because of the drought, there is little tofeed them.Zale's illness is serious. She contractedtuberculosis last year and now the disease istaking its toll. She has a constant cough andfever, and has lost a lot of weight. She also hasno appetite and is continually weak. Shedepends on her relatives to help her preparefood for her three children and take care ofother domestic chores.In the last fifteen years, the incidence of TB inZimbabwe has increased by more than 750%making it the leading cause of hospital stays. 60-80% of all cases are HIV/AIDS related. Zale'ssituation, like that of so many others sufferingfrom TB, is exacerbated by the country's foodshortage and the grim predictions for thecoming harvests. Poverty has increased sharplyin recent times leading to declining access toresources.Meanwhile, the amount of food aid arriving inthe country falls well short of what is needed,and there are real concerns that the governmentwill not be able to fill the gap. The vulnerabilityof Zimbabweans has increased over the lastdecade and a half.ECHO provides vital humanitarian support forpeople like Zale. She is benefiting from aninnovative project involving the supply ofemergency food relief to reduce thevulnerability of families affected by illnessessuch as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Zale receivesmaize, beans, corn/soya blend and vegetable oilevery month. She is also getting health carethrough a community-based rehabilitationprogramme run by ECHO's partner, theInternational Federation of Red Cross and RedCrescent Societies (IFRC) and the local Red Crosschapter. Medicine to treat her illness is availableat the local health centre and she receiveshome-based nursing care visits to monitor herprogress.Overall, this ECHO-funded scheme involvesproviding essential health care and food for upto 10,000 people infected by AIDS throughoutZimbabwe. Its components include contributingto the food security of HIV-affected households,providing cooked food to orphans andstrengthening the Red Cross home-based careprogramme.For Zale, the assistance has made a bigdifference. \"I am getting better thanks to thesupport from ECHO and the Red Cross,\" she toldus. \"They help me to attend the health centreand always visit me to see if I am gettingbetter.\"Isaya and his son, who is suffering from AIDS,are also being helped by the project.

These carry water to his banana andmango trees, and his plots of maize and animalfodder. Unfortunately, due to the hightemperatures, the water in the damsevaporates quickly and not enough is nowreaching his food crops. This means that thefamily may have very little to harvest this year. Without food aid from externalhumanitarian agencies, the future looks grim.In spite of the tragedies Isaya has had toendure, he greets us cheerfully, regaling uswith many stories about his life. He is hopefulthat the rains will soon come to fill up hiswater dams and ensure that the survivingmembers of his family have enough food.

At least half amillion people have been displaced from theirhomes inside Burundi while another half millionhave taken refuge in Tanzania. There are hugeneeds within this vulnerable population.In November 2001, the establishment of atransitional government, involving power-sharing between Tutsis and Hutus, briefly raisedhopes for a more lasting peace.

Maria Jose Pallares Paredes, ECHO There was no improvement in the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian Territories during2002. Since the beginning of the 'Intifada' inSeptember 2000, the economy has all butcollapsed. Large numbers of Palestinians, whoused to commute to work in Israel, lost theirjobs following restrictions on movement andborder closures imposed by the Israeliauthorities. Unemployment rates have doubledto 50% and family incomes have fallendrastically. As a result, almost half of the threemillion people living in the West Bank and GazaStrip now rely on food assistance fromhumanitarian agencies.
