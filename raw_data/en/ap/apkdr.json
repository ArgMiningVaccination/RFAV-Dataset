Covaxin Products side effects Common Side Effects of Covaxin are Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness), Headache, Fever, Feeling of discomfort, Nausea, Vomiting, Rash. How Covaxin Products work Whole Virion, Inactivated Corona Virus vaccine contains an inactivated form of the virus itself (made up of killed coronaviruses, making it safe to be injected into the body). When administered, the dead virus acts as an antigen and provokes an immune response that can block or kill the virus, without actually causing the disease. Thus, Whole Virion, Inactivated Corona Virus vaccine is incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to promote a defensive reaction if a person becomes infected just like the natural body immune mechanism in case of other infections (such as common cold or flu). Patient Concerns about Covaxin Products Frequently asked questions about Covaxin Products Frequently asked questions about Whole Virion, Inactivated Corona Virus vaccine Q. Can Covaxin Vaccine be given to children? COVID-19 vaccine trials for children are still underway. So, enough evidence is not available to recommend its use in children yet. This is because the morbidity and mortality rate is higher in the older population, particularly those older than 50 years of age. Both the available vaccines have not been studied for safety and effectiveness in the children/pediatric population so far. Therefore, it is advised not to give any COVID-19 vaccine to children till we have enough data available. Q. I am a COVID-19 frontline worker and I got vaccinated already. When will my family members get vaccinated? As per government of India guidelines, all the COVID-19 frontline workers will get vaccinated on priority. However, the other family members of these people will be vaccinated according to the age-specific prioritization by the Government of India. Q. I already got infected with COVID-19 once. Do I still need to get vaccinated? Yes. People who have already been infected with COVID-19 should still get vaccinated unless told otherwise by their healthcare provider. Even if you've had a previous infection, the vaccine acts as a booster that strengthens the immune response. There have also been some cases of people getting re-infected with COVID-19, which makes getting vaccinated even more important. Q. What is the dosing schedule of Covaxin Vaccine? As per the permission granted by the Drug Controller General (India), Covaxin Vaccine is to be administered in two doses, the second dose given on day 28, after the first dose. Additionally, studies are being conducted around a proposed booster dose, to be administered six months after the second dose. The protocol of giving a booster dose still needs a finalization as the study is being done on a small group of individuals only, as part of a Government of India clinical trial. Q. Does vaccination with Covaxin Vaccine protect me against newer strains/mutated versions of COVID-19 virus? Yes. All vaccines are expected to provide a reasonable amount of protection against the newer strains/mutated versions of the COVID-19 virus also. The body responds to vaccination by making more than one type of antibodies, that effectively destroy the virus. Based on the currently available data, the mutations as reported, are unlikely to make the vaccine ineffective and protect an individual against COVID-19 effectively. Q. Which vaccine is better, Covaxin Vaccine or Covishield? There is no comparison done between the two vaccines, Covishield or Covaxin Vaccine, being used in India so one cannot say which is better. Both the vaccines are effective in preventing the COVID-19 infection in all who take it, particularly, elderly people or those who have comorbidities such as diabetes or hypertension (high blood pressure). Q. In how many days will Covaxin Vaccine create an adequate amount of antibodies to protect me against COVID-19? It usually takes 2-3 weeks after completion of the entire vaccination schedule, i.e., after the second dose of Covaxin Vaccine. Q. What are the expected side effects of Covaxin Vaccine? Covaxin Vaccine may show some mild side effects like injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, redness, and itching), headache, fever, malaise/body ache, nausea, vomiting, and rashes. However, these are usually mild and temporary and may resolve after some time. If they do not, please consult your doctor. No other serious side effects have been reported with Covaxin Vaccine. Q. Who should not take Covaxin Vaccine? Covaxin Vaccine should not be given to people with a history of anaphylactic or allergic reaction to a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine or any injectable therapies, pharmaceutical products, food items, etc. Additionally, pregnant and lactating women have not been part of any COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial so far. Therefore, women who are pregnant or not sure of their pregnancy and lactating (breastfeeding) women should not receive the COVID-19 vaccine at this time. However, You must consult your doctor if you are not sure. Q.
