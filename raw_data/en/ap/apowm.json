organization of m eetings focused on a regional basis at the Brussels Meeting in May 2007, regional ICH public meetings have been held in each ICH region; first in Tokyo on November 2, 2007, then the following year in the US and Europe. The meeting entitled \"ICH Japan Symposium 2009\" is the second regional ICH public meeting held in Japan which t ook place at the Tower Hall Funabori in Tokyo on June 12, 2009, the following day of the ICH Yokohama Meeting (June 6 - 11, 2009). The Symposium aimed to provide an opportunity to update to the public on the progress made during the ICH meeting in Yokohama and on the status of the various ICH guidelines under development. It also aimed to provide an opportunity for participants and the ICH experts/rapporteurs to have a Q&A on a face-to -face basis on all the topi cs discussed at the Yokohama Meeting. In addition, the Sympos ium also had a special session on the implementation of ICH guidelines in Asian count ries, with regulatory speakers mainly from Asian countries of the ICH Global Coope ration Group presenting on the use of ICH guidelines and on the value of training in helping to facilita te implementation. The Symposium was well attended with approxima tely 600 participants of the pharmaceutical industry, the regulatory authori ties, etc. from the following 18 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America; Botswana, Mozambique, China, Chinese Taipei, India, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, Canada, USA and Japan. The participants had the opportun ity to receive an update on the progress, to enhance the mutual understanding and to meet with regulators and industry experts from both ICH and non-ICH regions. The Symposium was jointly organized by Japa n Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA) and the Society of Ja panese Pharmacopoeia (SJP, non-profit organization), and supported by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), the Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association of Japan, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association of Tokyo, the Osaka Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and the Japan Pharmaceutical Association. August 24, 2009 1 ICH Japan Symposium 2009 2WELCOMING ADDRESS Kohei Wada, JPMA Member of the Steering Committee Welcome to the ICH Japan Symposium. I am Kohei Wada from Daiichi Sankyo Company. As the chair of JPMA ICH Project Committee, I would like to thank you all for coming to the ICH Japan symposium 2009. I am so happy to see so many faces today. On behalf of the organizer, I would like to say a few words of welcome. Up until yesterday, we had been having the IC H meetings in Yokohama with the participation of more than 350 people. Among the meetings during the week, on Sunday and Monday we had the Regulators Meeting and the Regulators Forum. On Monday, there was the Industry Coordination Group meeting a nd on Tuesday, we had the GCG meeting. Wednesday and Thursday, we had the Steering Committee meeting. In parallel, there were many expert meetings, more than 70 meetings in 16 topics. We had major progress and achievements in most of the topics. Today, we would like to take a day to share about what was achieved during the meetings. Every time, I feel that ICH meeting is existi ng on the hard work of the experts all over the world and I am always impressed by their effo rts and commitment. With their dedication, we had been able to make major progress of IC H activities. Until recently , we had a major ICH event once in a while. However, we decided to have more frequent ICH meetings to include the general public for the sharing of ICH info rmation on regional basis. This is the second Japan symposium following the first one in November of 2007. This slide shows today's aim of the symposium. We have three aims. Up until yesterday, we had very intensive meetings, so we would like to share the hot topics discussed during the meetings. In other words, the presentations today will be the latest information. Also, we would like to share with you, information on t opics not only from the Yokohama meeting, but covering the other ICH topics, so that you can unde rstand the situation of ICH. We also have a special session focused on the Asian region in the afternoon. As I mentioned earlier, the organizer and the sp eakers had to rush into this venue from the Yokohama meeting. Therefore, we may have some short comings in the meeting, but I hope you would understand. 3 Furthermore, in realizing today's symposium, we had support from many people. They are the ones who are working outside of this venue as well as those who are s itting inside of this venue today. With their support, this symp osium was made possible. So taking this opportunity, I would like to extend my gratitude to all those who had been working behind the scenes. Finally, I hope this symposium will be a fru itful one for all of you. Thank you very much.

Ms. Akagi is the Group Manager of the Safety Information Department at Novartis Pharma K.K. as well as the current Topic Leader of the E2F topic at the ICH meetings. Questions and Answers Question : Concerning the DSUR, how can we utilize the past data? Akagi : Data following the Development Internationa l Birth Date (DIBD) should be listed in the DSUR. Question : For example, during the clinical development, there are different data coming from different time points. How can we come up with this? Akagi : All the data should be listed in accordance to the guideline. At Step 5, detail instruction may be released at the time of implementation in each region. If the DIBD is very old, the data may not be av ailable. In the guideline there is no description with respect to data missing, but the detail will be clarified at the time of implementation in each region. 29ICH Japan Symposium 2009 1The Development Safety Update Report ICH Japan Symposium 2009 2Outline 1.

Major topics discussed at the meeting Relationship of DSUR to PSUR Combination products Example DSURs Differences in local requirements Summary of Important Risks 5. Remaining points to be discussed ICH Japan Symposium 2009 31. Background and Objectives of the DSUR Guideline Background: Current regulations on periodic repor ting for investigational products vary by region, which leads to dup lication of effort for sponsors, and inconsistency in the information each regulatory authority receives. Objectives : To standardize the format, content and timing of a periodic report for drugs in development so that sponsor can avoid duplicative work and focus on assessment of risk. Regul atory authorities can receive the same information at the same time, and eventually subjects in clinical trials can be protected from adverse reactions more effectively.

Outcome of Yokohama meeting Topics addressed: Integration of a number of sections Table for combination products Clearer definitions of DIBD, DLP Relationship to eCTD (Discussion with M2) Greater use of graphics Extensive revisions to improve clarity and reduce redundancy, taking comments into account Many enhancements Presently, ~80% through the Guideline Major Problems/Issues: None foreseen ICH Japan Symposium 2009 64. Major topics discussed at the meeting Relation of the DSUR to the PSUR Why DSUR and PSUR should be prepared in parallel? Current regulations do not provide consistent content and format for periodic reports for investigational and approved drugs Period covered by PSUR and DSUR may be different DSUR and PSUR may be reviewed by different department Why is overlap necessary?

Dr. Sekino is the Reviewer of Office of New Drug III at the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency as well as the current Topic Lead er of the E7 (R1) topic at the ICH meetings. Questions and Answers There were no questions. Session Chair's Comments Uyama: Since this is a valuable opportunity, I w ould like to make a comment about the E7 topic. As Dr. Sekino mentioned, although the detail s were not possibly ex plained due to time limitations, the discussion was that it is no longer about simply secu ring 100 elderly patients that are over 65 years old. The most important factor is th e age-distribution in a disease. For example, with Alzheimer's disease, we have a larger percentage of el derly population compared to those of asthma. Therefore, the study in Alzheimer's disease should include larger numbers of geriatric patients. We also discussed about how much data should be collected before and after drug approval. In general, data should be collected as much as possible before approval. However, in some situations, geriatric data cannot be collected before approval due to co-morbidity and concomitant medication which refrains the incl usion of geriatric patients from particular studies. In this case, reasons a nd justifications must be submitted to the regulatory authorities and if those are acceptable, we will identify what would be the data to be collected during the post-marketing period. The benefit risk assessmen t will be continued after the launch of the products. ICH Japan Symposium 2009 32Also, we have made progress with PK methods since the or iginal guideline and several guidelines such as drug interaction and PPK met hods have been released in different regions. So, we will look at the up-to-date information and recent techniques which could be utilized. That was a part of the discussion th at we had at the Yokohama meeting. 331 Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, JapanICH E7(R1)ICH E7(R1)ICH Japan Symposium 2009 Kazuishi Sekino Reviewer Office of New Drug IIIPharmaceuticals & Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), JapanE7 (R1): Revision of Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics 2 Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, JapanICH E7(R1)ICH E7(R1)ICH Japan Symposium 2009 Outline of Presentation 1.1.Members of E7(R1) Implementation Working GroupMembers of E7(R1) Implementation Working Group 2.2.BackgroundBackground 3.3.ObjectiveObjective 4.4.Issues to be discussed at the Yokohama meetingIssues to be discussed at the Yokohama meeting 5.5.Outcomes of the Yokohama meetingOutcomes of the Yokohama meeting 3 Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, JapanICH E7(R1)ICH E7(R1)ICH Japan Symposium 2009 MHLW/PMDA (3 persons), E7(R1) Implementation Working Rapporteur (EU): Dunder (Medical Products Agency, Sweden) EU/EMEA (4 persons), EFPIA (2 person) FDA (2 persons), PhRMA (1 person)ICH Parties: Observer: EFTA (1 person), Canada (1 person) Interested Party: WSMI (1 person) EFTA : European Free Trade Association WSMI : World Self-Medication I ndustry MHLW/PMDA Topic Leader : Deputy Expert : Kazuishi Topic Leader : Yasuhiko Imai KK, Japan) Deputy Topic Leader : Toshinobu Iwasaki (Shionogi & Co Ltd, Japan) Expert : Maki Ito (Shionogi & Co Ltd, Japan) Expert : Akiyuki Suzuki (Pfizer Japan Inc, Japan) Expert : Noriko Adachi (Bristol-Myers KK, Japan) Expert : Kazuhiro Kanmuri (Pfizer Japan Inc, Japan) 4 Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, JapanICH E7(R1)ICH E7(R1)ICH Japan Symposium 2009 Background - The essential elements for inclusion of elderly patients in clinical studies are outlined in the current ICH E7 guidance document (June 1993). - ICH E7 notes that for drugs with significant use in the elderly, the inclusion in clinical trials of a minimum of 100 patients aged 65 years or older \"would usually allow detection of clinically important differences\" in drug responses compared with younger patients. 5 Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, JapanICH E7(R1)ICH E7(R1)ICH Japan Symposium 2009 Background - With the increasing prevalence of elderly and very elderly in the society and in view of the recent advances in clinical scien ce and clinical trials experience build over the last 15 years, we need to review the current ICH E7 guidance document for better assessment of the risks and benefits of the drug in geriatrics . 6 Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, JapanICH E7(R1)ICH E7(R1)ICH Japan Symposium 2009 Objective -A Questions & Answers document will be developed to provide further guidan ce on the E7 Guideline. http://www.ich.org/LOB/media/MEDIA4930.pdf ICH Japan Symposium 2009 347 Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, JapanICH E7(R1)ICH E7(R1)ICH Japan Symposium 2009 Issues to be discussed at the Yokohama meeting - To discuss the number and age distribution of expected elderly participants in a given indication development and the criteria on which these figures are based. (Priority 1) \u00beAge distribution should generally reflect that of the target disease (e.g. in Parkinson's disease meaningful strata over 75 and over 85 years should be enrolled). \u00beEfforts to include the \"very elderly\" should be specifically addressed .

Dr. Ito is the Head of Medical Affairs of Medical Affairs Office in the Drug Safety Management Department at Shionogi & Co., Ltd. as well as the current Topic Leader of the E14 topic at the ICH meetings. Questions and Answers Question : As you mentioned, I understand that from a non-clinical point of view, S7B is closely related to the E14 guideline. Is it possible that S7B`s e xperimental approach would be utilized so that we can redu ce testing or studies required fo r E14? Have you discussed about that within the expert working group? Ito: We know that non-clinical data under the control of S7B is very important for our group. In the future, we would like to scrutinize what kind of S7B data is avai lable and what we are looking at, and then have furthe r discussions in an informal discussion group that has been proposed. Uyama : That was one of the major issues at the Yokohama m eeting. That is, how we can predict the QT risk for human fr om non-clinical study re sults. At the time of Step 4 agreement, E14 group concluded that the pred ictability of non-clinical study re sults is currently very low. But, now, the US and EU have four to five years of implementation experience of E14 and more than 100 thorough QT studies have been conducted in those regions. Safety pharmacology studies under the S7B guideline could be looked at so that we can identify the issues of current activities at E14 EWG. More accurate QT risk assessment could be identified within E14 EWG by doing so. In Yokohama, th e steering committee decided to establish a discussion group which consists of non-clinical members of S7B and clinical members of E14. Within this discussion group, along with S7 B members, we will figure that out. ICH Japan Symposium 2009 36 Comment from the floor: I hope fruitful results will come out from your discussion. 37ICH Japan Symposium E14 guideline Q & A June 12th, 2009 ICH E14 JPMA Topic leader Maki Ito, MD, PhDE14 milestones Guideline \"The Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-antiarrhythmic Drugs\"reached step 4 in May 2005 - FDA: Implemented in October 2005 - EU: Implemented in November 2005- Japan: To be notified Questions and Answers were approved in June 2008 - EU: Implemented in June 2008- FDA: Implemented in November 2008- Japan: To be notified Questions and Answers 1.

Dr. Hayashi is the Director General at the Bios afety Research Center as well as the current Rapporteur of the S2 (R1) topic at the ICH meetings. Questions and Answers Question : I suppose that, within the FDA, there was not enough level of consultation and so the opposition came from the departments other th an the CDER. I assume that department is the Food Section... Do you have any information that the FDA has appropriate authorities other than the CDER to make comments on pharmaceutical related matters? Hayashi : I do not know. Please ask the FDA people. We have not received any information about who objected to this idea. Uyama : Regarding the same issue, let me tell you what was discussed at the Steering Committee. So, the department is not the CDER , but another department. The FDA feels that the S2 guideline itself is very important, so they truly wish to implement it. However, they want to discuss it more thoroughly among different centers within the FDA before the implementation. Because S2 is so important, they want to have more discussion within the FDA before going to Step 4. After Yokohama, the FDA will have active discussion so that hopefully it will go in a mo re positive direction.

In this group, there is concern that the new testing paradigms will weaken safety testing standards for pharmaceuticals. \u0084The EWG reconsidered these concerns and concluded that these concerns are not justified. \u0084To resolve the controversy a formal scientific dispute resolution will be conducted at the FDA. \u0084Depending on the results of this dispute resolution we will continue the I CH process or finalize the existing draft step 4 document. ICH Japan Symposium 2009 46Safety Topics M3 (R2): Revision of Non-Clinic al Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials for Pharmaceuticals Abigail Jacobs, FDA Rapporteur Abstract Dr. Abigail Jacobs will present the overview summa ry of the series of M3 (R2) meetings held in Yokohama. Dr. Jacobs is the ODE Associate Director fo r Pharmacology and Toxicology Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Dr ug Administration as well as the current Rapporteur of the M3 (R2) topic at the ICH meetings. Questions and Answers Question : You mentioned about the limit dose of animal studies, 1000mg/kg/day. If human dose does not exceed 1000mg, in that case, 1 000mg/kg/day are allowa ble. This is not a clinical effective dose, but so metimes doses of higher than 1000 mg are loaded to human. If that is the case, are 1000mg/kg/da y for animal studies allowable? Jacobs: The human upper dose limit for use of the limit dose in animals is 1000mg per day. Animal exposure has to be ten-fold the human exposure. So, 1000mg/ kg/day would not be a limit dose if the exposure in the animals had not reached ten times the human exposure. It is not an absolute limit. It depends on the human exposure. Question : So, the human exposure is the basis. That is understandable. If th at is the case, is the administration at high doses in Phase 1 also the subject to this limitation? Jacobs : It applies to all animal studies. This limit dose for animal studies is actually in the OECD guidelines. We added to it that it was not sufficient if the human exposure was not exceeded by ten-fold. It applies to all studies. Question : In your presentation, non-human primat e reproductive study was mentioned. I would like to confirm whether this study should be performed before the submission for the 47drug approval. Jacobs : It says that this a pplies to monoclonal anti-bodies that do not cross the placenta in the first two trimesters of pregnancy. It does say th at the study does not have to be submitted until the marketing application. This is brand new, so we will see how it works out.

In the main body, it is written that the principl es outlined in this guidance may be applicable to plasma-derived products . Some preclinical studies could be omitted for plasma-derived proteins. Does not the ad dendum deal with the \"points-to-consider\" on preclinical studies with plasma-derived proteins? Nakazawa: No, as the scope is not revised. Question : There may be slightly different opinions even for proteins among the three regions. Were there any different opinions in the EWG meeting? Nakazawa : No, I learned that experts of EWG have very similar interpretation of the S6 guideline although there may be slightly differen t implementation in some practical cases. 55Japan Symposium in Tokyo on June 12, 20091ICH S6(R1) Takahiro Nakazawa, Ph.D. S6(R1) Topic Leader, JPMA Japan Symposium in Tokyo on June 12, 20092Agenda for This Presentation Objective Background - Five topics to be addressed by S6(R1) Issues to be discussed at the Yokohama meeting Outcomes of the Yokohama meeting Potential conclusion Japan Symposium in Tokyo on June 12, 20093Objective Add clarification and amplification to the original S6 document for effective and efficient development of biopharmaceuticals and improvement of 3R's - \"Case-by-case\" concept of S6 will not be changed - Format of revision: Addendum S6Addendum Japan Symposium in Tokyo on June 12, 20094Background 1997 July (Brussels) - S6 step 4 2006-2008 Regional discussions on revision 2008 June (Portland) - SC Approval for EWG formation for revision (S6(R1)) - Identification of 5 topics to be updated 2008 Nov (Brussels) - Kick-off of EWG- Brainstorming- Draft of immunogenicity addendum 2009 Feb to May - Teleconferences or e-mail discussions Japan Symposium in Tokyo on June 12, 20095Species Selection How to justify the choice of a species - Receptor binding, functional st udy, tissue cross reactivity When to use a second species - Two species, where 2 relevant species, rodent and non-rodent, exist (S6 default position) Does not mean NHP with clinical candidate AND rodent studies with surrogate product - When only one relevant species be considered sufficient?

Dr. Nakae is the Senior Principal Research Scientist at the Tokyo Metr opolitan Institute of Public Health as well as the current Topic E xpert of the S9 topic at the ICH meetings. Questions and Answers There were no questions. ICH Japan Symposium 2009 58S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals Dai Nakae Senior Principle Research Scientist of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health (Representing MHLW in S9 EWG as an Expert) Japan Objectives are to \u00c1Provide recommendations on the design and conduct of nonclinical studies to support the development of anticancer pharmaceuticals in patients with advanced disease and limited therapeutic options, and \u00c1Facilitate and accele rate the development of anticancer pharmaceuticals and to protect patients from unnecessary adverse effects, while avoidin g unnecessary use of animals and other resources. Background For these reasons, a separate guideline with flexibility is needed for nonclinical studies for anticancer pharmaceuticals. Timeline \u00c1The business plan and concept paper were proposed by PhRMA during year 2006. \u00c1They were endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee in Brussels in May, 2007. \u00c1The S9 Expert Working Group (EWG) started its actions in Yokohama in October, 2007. At that moment, a relatively old specific guideline was present in EU, while such guidelines were still being developed in the US and Japan. \u00c1Development of the S9 guideline reached the step 2 agreement in Brussels in November, 2008, and public comments for the draft guideline were collected in early 2009. \u00c1The ICH Steering Committee and the S9 EWG expect that the development of the S9 guideline will reach the step 4 agreement hopefully in late 2009 , not later than the original deadline of early 2010. Scope \u00c1Pharmaceuticals that are intended to treat cancer in patients with late stage or advanced disease, including both small molecule and biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals, are to be covered. \u00c1Excluded pharmaceutica ls are those for zpatient with long life expectancy, zcancer prevention, ztreatment of symptoms or side effects of chemotherapeutics, zvaccines, and zcellular or gene therapy \u00c1Radiopharmaceuticals are not covered, but some of the principles could be adapted. Assumption \u00c1Recommendations on type and timing of nonclinical studies are to be provided. \u00c1Descriptions are to be restricted for issues specific to anticancer pharmaceuticals. For this, and in order to reduce future maintenance, references to other guidelines are to be encouraged as appropriate. \u00c1In any case, the 3 R's are to be kept in mind. 59Accomplishments be fore Yokohama, 2009 \u00c0No need for NOAEL/NOEL to support clinical trials \u00c0No need for 6/9 month studies \u00c0Recovery only to a single species prior to phase I \u00c0Inclusion of safety pharmacology and immunotoxicology assessments within general toxicology studies \u00c0No need for fertility or pre/postnatal studies \u00c0Embryofetal study only to a single species, if positive \u00c0No need for non-rodent studies for the initiation of clinical trials with cytotoxic drugs \u00c0Genotoxicity studies by a marketing application \u00c0No need for carcinogenicity studies or metabolite assessments \u00c0Generally no need for combination or juvenile assessments Issues to be discus sed in Yokohama, 2009 \u00c0Examination of public comments for the step 2 document of the S9 guideline obtained in each region \u00c0Improving the guideline, including appropriate reaction to and reflection of the public comments \u00c0Search for other problems in order to prepare the step 4 document, and if possible their resolution \u00c0Start of the preparation of the step 4 document \u00c0Setting of a future plan \u00c0Harmonization with ot her safety EWGs for potential conflicts, overlaps and etc Accomplishments in Yokohama, 2009 \u00bfResolution of all public comments, a total of 219, and other problems raised by experts \u00c0Interaction with S6 and M3 EWGs for the consistency with their guidance documents; such as scope, reproductive assessment and reversibility \u00bfUse of S6 for biopharmaceuticals testing \u00bfReference to M3 for healthy volunteers and patient populations other than advanced cancer as appropriate \u00bfImproving the guideline to become ready for the preparation of step 4 document Accomplishments in Yokohama, 2009 Concrete accomplishments that also lead to a reduction of animal use \u00bf3 month studies sufficient for registration \u00bfEliminated the need for fertility and pre- and postnatal development studies \u00bfRequired only 1 embryofetal develop ment study if a positive is observed \u00bfSafety pharmacology assessments could be conducted within the general toxicology studies \u00bfEliminated the need for the non-rodent for initiation of clinical trials with cytotoxic drugs \u00beReduced to 1 rodent study \u00bfReduced recovery requirement to a single species prior to phase I \u00beNeed for recovery period based on scientific justification \u00bfNo need for photosafety testing Issues to be discussed up to St. Louis, 2009 \u00c0Examination of the Yokohama-version document of the S9 guideline among colleagues/parties of each region \u00c0Improving the guideline, including appropriate reaction to and reflection of regional concerns/comments \u00c0Start of the preparation of the step 4 document ICH Japan Symposium 2009 60Safety Topics GTDG: Gene Therapy Discussion Group Klaus Cichutek, EU Co-Rapporteur Abstract Professor Klaus Cichutek will present the overv iew summary of the series of GTDG meetings held in Yokohama.

Questions and Answers Question: The last page of your presentation mentioned that the Q&A and training slides are going to be created. What are the objectives of creating those slides? Would you elaborate on that? Igoshi: The Q4B guideline as for the structure is somewhat different from other quality guidelines. Especially structure is different. The reference of pharmacopeia is there. How to use pharmacopeia as a reference is mentioned. Wh at kind of format is used for the submission of dossier and how to corporat e this into the dossier, are mentioned. Dr. Hiyama mentioned about the field inspection. So far, we have not identified what kind of questions will be raised in the field. So, the support will be provided. That is the agreement we have reached so far.

King, Sr. (FDA) - 1st Rapporteur J.M. Morris (EU) - Current Rapporteur 69Quality Topics Q11: Manuf acture of Brian Withers, EFPIA Rapporteur Abstract Mr. Brian Withers will present the overview summa ry of the series of Q11 meetings held in Yokohama. Mr. Withers is the Director CMC of GPRA at Abbott Laboratories as well as the current Rapporteur of the Q11 topi c at the ICH meetings. Questions and Answers Question : I think the speed of the harmonization proce ss is very slow. Of course, I know it is very difficult. But, if we could divide the guideline into chemical compounds and biotechnological products, it is easier to develop such a guideline. What is the merit of combining the biotech products and chemicals? Withers : I think that is a very good question. The question that you asked is one that impacted on the time it took to get agreement to prepare the guideline in the first place. However, within the expert working group, we have members who have an interest in biotechnological products and others with an interest in ch emical compounds. What we discovered in our discussion is that we have more in common than there are differen ces. We found that the principals apply to all molecules and there are some things where there is more emphasis on one molecular type than another molecular type. We are finding more agreements than differences. Question : You showed us the Priority Harmonization Subject List in which five items from the starting material to the process validation are listed. Among the five items on the list, which one do you think is the eas iest to harmonize, or has th e least gap within the three regions? Withers : I can probably tell you which one is the ha rdest. Currently, the hardest one might be starting materials because at the moment it is a difficult subject since there are different views ICH Japan Symposium 2009 70between the regions, so I think that might be the hardest. The easiest one might be guidance for process validation. Principals are already generally accepted across the three regions. Question : Two years ago, I attended the Quality of Bi otech Products meeting. At that time, the SC asked us to incorporate the idea the \"Quality by Design\" into the guidance. I am surprised with your lecture because the word of the Qual ity by Design is no wher e. So, I would like to know what has happened. Withers : For Q11, there is definite interest in expr essing the principals outlined in Q8R and to give examples of how different approaches to the development could be followed and that will include the Quality by Design. One of the cha llenges is that we must make a balance so that the guideline can be applicable to a co mpany whichever approach they choose for the development. So, it has to cover a wide spectrum of approaches to the development. Certainly, a lot of the discussion within the expert work ing group has been done about the principals of the Quality by Design and how they apply to the development of the molecule irrespective of the complexity. So, it is certainly vey much on our agenda. Okuda: In my opinion, the idea of the Quality by Design is reflected in drafting the Q11 guideline, but there are also different approa ches.

Dr. Hiyama is the Section Chief of the 3 rd Section in the Division of Drugs at the National Institute of Health Sciences as well as the current Deputy Topi c Leader of the Q-IWG topic at the ICH meetings. Questions and Answers Question : When the idea of the Quality by Design is implemented, we will have more flexibility than before in changing methods of manufacturing. Inspectors or reviewers will be able to reduce the resource for inspection, and they will be able to put more resources in the areas that are necessary. The FDA announced a Quality by Design pilot program last year. Regarding the Quality by Design, the industry side will have an opportunity to have discussions with the regulatory authorities. But, in EU and Japan, how are the regulatory authorities trying to communicate with the industries? In EU and Japan we have no information on that. Hiyama : First, we have issues about the Quality by Design. You also mentioned about how to write the submission dossier. I w ould like you to read the ICH Q& A that is already published. A Quality by Design approach is a development method, and the Q8R explains about the method. It does not say whether you have to set up the design space or the real time release testing. Whether it applie s to design space or not and how ex tensively the design space is used are based on the decision of the company. In my understanding, in ICH regions, there is no expectation that submission should have a la bel of the Quality by Design. In the US, the regulatory authority has conducted a pilot program to communicate with the companies directly. In EU, the PAT group was designed for the same purpose. In Japan, Dr. Okuda led the MHLW-sponsored group on the Quality by De sign. The points studied were the changes expected and the impact of real time release testing when the Quality by Design approach is 75applied. What extent is in the de scription in the CTD, if the real time release testing is applied, has already been published as was mentioned elsewhere in our presentations. Before submission, if the sponsor would like to utilize the design space or real time release testing, the company has an opportunity to have preap proval consultation with the PMDA, Japan. I had been involved as the regulatory side. Okuda: I think Dr. Hiyama covered them all. The industry and government joint study has already been published on the website of NIHS. Withers : European regulators have an EMEA PAT team which will discuss elements of the Quality by Design and approaches you have. You can contact them, and ask to go and discuss your Quality by Design development pa rticularly if it incl udes elements of PA T, or you can go to a formal scientific advice process. From an industry point of view, th e biggest advantage in discussing with companies who have started to use the Quality by Design is that they have a better assurance of the quality of the product. Th e regulatory flexibility or the ability to make changes is proving to be a secondary effect. It is not the prime benefit of following the Quality by Design approach. ICH Japan Symposium 2009 76Implementation Working Group on ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10 ICH Tokyo Symposium 2009 Yukio Hiyama National Institute of Health SciencesObjectives Globally consistent implementation of Q8, Q9 and Q10 Maximum benefit from the interaction between the guidelines Final Concept Paper , ICH IWG on Q8, Q9 and Q10, November1, 2007 http://www.ich.org/LOB/media/MEDIA4457.pdf Background In Brussels 2003 a new quality vision was agreed on. emphasising a risk and science-based approaches to pharmaceuticals in an adequately implemented quality system. As a consequence, Pharma ceutical Development (Q8),Quality Risk Management(Q9)and Pharmaceutical Quality System(Q10) were drafted. Because concepts and principles are rather new, it is important to provide clarity/further explanation and to remove ambiguities and uncertainties.History Quality Strategy Meeting, Fall 2006 Chicago Quality Strategy Meeting, Spring 2007 Brussels Quality Satellite Roundtable, Fall 2007 Rockville Informal Q-IWG, October 2007 Yokohama Final Concept Paper endorsed by Steering Committee First Q-IWG Meeting, June 2008 Portland Three breakout sessions on Knowledge Management, Quality by Design, Pharmaceutical Quality System/Inspection.

Quality by Design 2.2 Real Time Release Testing Q01: How is batch release affect ed by employing real time release testing? Batch release is the final decisi on to release the product to the market regardless whether RTR te sting or end product testing is employed. End product testing involves performance of specific analytical procedures on a defined sample size of the final product after completion of all processing for a given batch of that product. Results of real ti me release testing are handled in the same manner as end product te sting results in the batch release decision. Batch release involves an independent review of batch conformance to predefi ned criteria through review of testing results and manufactu ring records together with appropriate GMP compliance and quality system, regardless of which approach is used. Examples Q-IWG on ICH Q8/Q9/Q10 Questions and Answers adopted by Q-IWG at telecon March 11 2009 2) 3 Pharmaceutical Quality System Q01: What are the benefits of implementing a Pharmaceutical Quality System (in accordance with ICH Q10)? The benefits are: \u00bb Facilitated robustn ess of the manufacturing process, through facilitation of continual improvement through science and risk- based post approval change processes. \u00bb Consistency in the global pharmaceutical environment across regions \u00bb Enable transparency of systems, processes, organisational and management responsibility. \u00bb Clearer understanding of the application of a Quality System throughout product lifecycle. \u00bb Further reducing risk of product failure and incidence of complaints and recalls thereby providing greater assurance of pharmaceutical product consistency and availability (supply) to the patient. \u00bb Better process performance. \u00bb Opportunity to increase understanding between industry and regulators and more optimal use of industry and regulatory resources. Enhance manufacturer's and regulators' confidence in product quality. \u00bb Increased compliance with GMPs, which builds confidence in the regulators and may result in shorter inspections. Examples: Q-IWG on ICH Q8/Q9/Q10 Questions and Answers adopted by Q-IWG at telecon March 11 2009 4 ICH new quality guidelines' impact on GMP inspection practices Q01: How will product-related inspections differ in an ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10 environment? In the case of product-relat ed inspection (in particular pre- authorisation) depending on the complexity of the product and/or process, there could be a need for greater collaboration between inspectors and assessors for example for the assessment of development data. The inspection would normally occur at the proposed commercial manufacturing site and there is likely to be greater focus on enhanced process understanding and understanding relati onships e.g. Critical Quality Attribute (CQAs), Critic al Process Parameters (CPPs). It will also extend into the application and implementation of quality risk management principl es, as supported by the Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS).Examples: Q-IWG on ICH Q8/Q9/Q10 Questions and Answers adopted by Q-IWG at telecon March 11 2009 4 5 Knowledge ManagementQ01: How has the implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 changed the significance and use of knowledge management? Q10 defines knowledge management as: 'Systematic approach to acquiring, analyzing, storing, and disseminati ng information related to products, manufacturing processes and components'. Knowledge management is not a system; it enables the implementation of the concepts described in ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10. Knowledge Management is not a new concept. It is always important regardless of th e development approach. Q10 highlights knowledge management because it is expected that more complex information generated by appropriate approaches (e.g. QbD, PAT, real-time data generation and control monitoring systems) will need to be better captured, managed and shared during product life-cycle. .In conjunction with Quality Risk Management, Knowledge Management can facilitate the use of concepts such as prior knowledge (including from other similar products), development of design space, control strategy, technology transfer, and continual improvement across the product life cycle. ICH Japan Symposium 2009 78Agenda for Yokohama Additional Q&As *10 additional Q&As adopted Collaboration with external association on scientific articles Training issues / workshops Next stepsExample: Q-IWG on ICH Q8/Q9/Q10 Questions and Answers adopted by Q-IWG in Yokohama, June 10, 2009 2. Pharmaceutical Quality System Qxx: What information and documentation of the development studies should be available at a manufacturing site? Pharmaceutical development information (e.g. supporting information on design spac e, chemometric model, risk management,...) is available at the development site. Pharmaceutical development information which is useful to ensure the understanding of the basis for the manufacturing process and control strategy, in cluding the rationale for selection of critical process parameters and critical quality attributes should be available at the manufacturing site. Scientific collaboration and knowledge sharing between pharmaceutical development and manufacturing is essential to ensure the successful transfer to production. Case Studies (Articles / Position Papers) Q-IWG findings - Many publications, workshops etc. available - Q-IWG will not endorse existing articles Resource intensive: reviewing, decision, maintenance etc. Potential regulatory concerns - Q-IWG will initiate, encourage and collaborate on paper development consistent with Q8, Q9, Q10 guidelines and Q&ACase Studies (Articles / Position Papers) How can this be achieved? - Task force within Q-IWG Identification of topics and potential collaborators Establish process for outside contribution Recommend the topic and potential collaborators to Q-IWG - Q-IWG to assign topic cordinator(s) among its members - Final review and approval by entire Q-IWG (e.g. by telecon) Training / Workshops Goals and objectives Enhanced harmonised implementation training to industry and regulators at the three ICH regions Conducted by ICH experts, who developed the guidelines and members of the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Q-IWG) The only workshops endorsed by the ICH Q-IWG and conducted by the same faculty in all three ICH regions.

I am Toyoshima from PMDA. ICH Japan sym posium 2009 is coming to a close. At the occasion of the closing of this symposium, I w ould like to say a few words on behalf of the organizer. ICH has been working in three areas, so that we can secure the Safety, Quality and Efficacy of the pharmaceutical products. At each ICH meeting, we held a symposium to report the current status of ICH harmonization. Today, there are more than 18 countries participating in the meeting, and the number of participants exceeds 600. We are very grateful that we could have this successful meeting today. With your enthusiasm and interests, im portance in ICH activity is recognized once again. At the ICH Yokohama meeting, the experts of each topic as well as the participants from non-ICH regions came together and had a very en thusiastic discussion for four days. Good results had been brought about. For example, M3 guideline was revised and agreed as Step 4. We could revise the timing of nonc linical studies. We also have revision of the pharmacopoeia. E16 guideline on biomarkers reached Step 2. Th ere are many other topics which are still on going. Topic leaders and Rapporteurs made th eir presentations today and through the discussion, I believe that you have obtained the most recent and current information in the implementation of ICH guidelines. I believe that you would bring the ICH harmonizatio n efforts back to your places so that you can work out and have very good activities. With this, I woul d like to conclude my short speech. Thank you very much once again, for a long day today. 111 "}
