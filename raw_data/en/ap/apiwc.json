Chiropractic Defined A Chiropractor is a licensed health care professional that focuses on disorders of the nerves, muscles and bones and the effects of these disorders on general health. Chiropractic care is used most often to treat neuromusculoskeletal (nerve, muscle, and bone), complaints, including but not limited to pain of the neck and/or back, including pain in the joints of the arms and/or legs. We also address many other health complaints such as: - Headaches, migraines: hormonal, classical, tension, cluster, ocular - Arm numbness - Sciatica - Back pain due to pregnancy - GERD, Acid Reflux - Colic, chronic constipation - Frozen shoulder - Joint pains and osteoarthritis - Brain/Central Nervous System dysfunction - Insomnia/trouble sleeping - TMJ disorder - Injuries and disorders of the musculoskeletal system, involving the muscles, ligaments and joints - Injuries due to accidents or trauma - This list is a sample of conditions we treat. Let us know of your specific health complaints. The most common therapeutic procedure performed by doctors of chiropractic is known as \"spinal manipulation,\" also called \"chiropractic adjustment.\" The purpose of manipulation is to restore joint mobility by manually applying a controlled force into the joints of the spine that have become hypomobile - or restricted in their movement - as a result of trauma, repetitive motion, sprains, strains, poor postural habits and the aging process. Consequently, the surrounding tissues undergo physical and chemical changes that can cause inflammation, pain that can contribute to nerve impingement and diminished function for the sufferer. Manipulation, or adjustment of the affected joint and tissues restores mobility, relieve nerve impingement therefore, relieve pain, muscle tightness and allowing tissues to heal. With Chiropractic adjustments, we first locate and then correct the cause of nerve interference, restoring the communication between the brain and the body. It is safe, effective, feels great, and works for everyone from newborns to the elderly. Choose Achieve Health Maumee and get the Maumee Chiropractic services you need! Vertebral subluxations (pinched nerves) have three basic causes: Physical Physical causes include muscle tension, slips and falls, accidents, repetitive motion, and improper lifting, especially lifting and twisting. Emotional Emotional causes can encompass grief, anger, fear and anxiety. These emotions can contribute to muscles tension leading to vertebral subluxations thus creating nerve pressure. Chemical Chemical causes can include alcohol, drugs, pollution, and poor diet. Toxins have the ability to upset the body's delicate chemistry, once again contributing to muscle tension and pulling on the vertebra causing nerve a pinched nerve. A thorough examination is done on the patient to assess their condition along with a detailed review of history, traumas, and medication list and system dysfunctions. A Doctor of Chiropractic may assess the patient through clinical examination, laboratory testing and diagnostic x-rays to determine when chiropractic treatment is appropriate or when it is not appropriate. The patient will be readily referred to the appropriate health care provider when chiropractic care is not suitable for the patient's condition, or the condition warrants co-management in conjunction with other members of the health care team.
