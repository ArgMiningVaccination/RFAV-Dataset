Our Immune System The immune system is made up of organs and cells whose primary purpose is to fight off infection aka microbes. It is essential for our survival and if we did not have one or if our immune system is weak, pathogens, like bacteria, will take over. Not what we want! Sometimes our immune systems will release something called [cytokines ](https://www.healthline.com/health/cytokine-storm)which promote inflammation, NOT good. As we age, our immune system will steadily decline causing us to be more prone to illness and infections. If only we were teenagers again with strong immune systems!

What Does Your Immune System Do? First, let's talk about what the immune system does and why it is essential to your everyday life. The immune system is essential to helping us live a healthy and thriving life. It is the organ that consists of cells and tissues that help protect against foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria. The skin, mucous membranes, saliva, tears, white blood cells (WBCs), antibodies, inflammatory proteins, lymphoid organs (thymus, spleen), and bone marrow are all parts of this organ system. Your immune system defends your body from outside elements by destroying them before they have a chance to make you sick or cause other problems within your body. If there are already harmful agents in your body- think cancer cells- the immune system will do its best to attack and remove those cells from your body so they don't grow and overtake healthy cells. In order for the immune system to stay healthy, it needs essential nutrients from the food we eat as well as essential oils that can be ingested or absorbed through aromatherapy. For instance, Vitamin C is essential for a strong immune system because it helps white blood cells absorb iron which increases their ability to fight bacteria and creates a stronger response against viruses. Zinc is also essential for helping lower illness rates by increasing production of infection-fighting WBCs, increasing immunity via macrophages (cells that literally eat foreign matter), and supporting T lymphocyte production (cells that destroy cancer cells and foreign invaders).
