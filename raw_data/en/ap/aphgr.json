Outdoor Eating & Entertaining Summer is time for firing up the barbie and enjoying outdoor living. Single use dinnerware, aka paper plates, are not so great for the environment and can actually be coated with PFAS chemicals. Melamine plates may not be breakable, but they are not a material that I recommend.

[Crow Canyon](https://amzn.to/3OB2y4a) is a great brand that makes porcelain enamel coated stainless steel dinnerware, and it's really hard to break. You can also use [Cherry Wood Plates](https://tidd.ly/43qoWFr) and [Cherry Wood Bowls](https://tidd.ly/45RzVcJ) for a non-toxic and non-breakable option.
