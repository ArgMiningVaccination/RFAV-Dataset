First, it's important to clarify what \"spiritual\" and \"spirituality\" mean. This is one of those terms that has many different meanings.

In ordinary, everyday terms, spirituality is about your relationship with the divine, universal, and all that there is. Maybe that's a higher power to you, and maybe it isn't. When you turn toward your higher self or guides for orientation or answers, that's a spiritual journey.
