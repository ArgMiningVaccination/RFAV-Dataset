Here are some ideas. Make a menu strategy. Plan your meals for the week. A good meal plan includes all meals in addition to any treats you plan to have during a day. Take one day a week to create a month's worth of meals. Go out your cookbooks and online dishes to put together your favorite meals. Once you've done this for a month or two, it'll get simpler. You can simply interchange the menus you've currently created with a couple of variations. Add some protein, healthy carbohydrate and fat at every meal. Protein is an essential muscle builder that helps curb your appetite. Next, you'll have to equip your kitchen and refrigerator. Clean eating implies including lots of \"fresh\" vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. Keep additional frozen fruits and vegetables that are 100% natural, suggesting they haven't been crammed in added sugar or salt on hand. It's a smart idea to have clean eating foods on hand in your freezer for those extra busy times when you don't have time to run to the shop for fresh foods. Make the most of a local butcher shop. A local butcher has fresh meats on display and can cite their suppliers, so you know exactly what you're getting.
