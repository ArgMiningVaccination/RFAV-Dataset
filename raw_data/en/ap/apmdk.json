Methods : Definition of key concepts; review of health personalisa- tion, emergent health information and communication technologiesand knowledge sources available to citizens and social media; andidentification of unresolved issues threatening optimal use of each. Results : A structured review supported by citations and examples. Conclusions : Several new aspects of consumer health informatics are emerging, including new knowledge sources, feedback on treat-ments and care providers, on-line videos, and a new generation ofpatient experience sites including those which are for profit and seekto influence treatment paradigms. Not just the information usage,but also the potential social challenges and malicious abuses, areglobal issues, and also transcend the traditional health communityand thus should be addressed in partnership with other globalagencies.

Rigby Keele University, School of Public Policy and Professional Practice, Keele, United Kingdom(also Nordic School of Public Health, Gothenburg, Sweden Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland) Introduction The remit of this paper is to consider how Consumer Health Informatics sup-ports and has a role within the domainof Personal Health Informatics. The ini-tial result is the identification of a set ofchallenges, not least caused by the tak-ing of familiar words and terms and im-buing them with a new specific mean-ing within a new focus of health carescience, but thereby leaving confusionthrough duality of old and new mean-ing. In this process, it is essential to en-sure that the new and progressive mean-ing does not detract from the core valuesof the generic meaning, and that con-sumers and non-specialist practitionersdo not lose understanding of appropri-ate health care and reliable health infor-mation through confusion of meaningsand thus of care delivery. Y et at the sametime, it is important for the new scienceand its related professional practice andconsumer information (which should betwo facets of the same body of knowl-edge) to be effectively supported by in-formation science and informatics, andthe challenges arising be appropriatelyaddressed. What do the Words Mean and How are they Used? 'Personal' is a clearly understood word in common use, and the Oxford Eng-lish Dictionary definitions emphasise the attribution to an individual, and theclose link with privacy [1]. Thus thepublic, patients and consumers couldwell expect all health care and healthrecords to be 'personal' to the indi-vidual, and treated with the appropri-ate sanctity and confidentiality, unlessexceptionally they relate to populationhealth activities. Further, the publiccould therefore expect a degree of tai-loring the individual characteristics. Personal Health and Personal Health Informatics Grouping the words 'Personal Health' to- gether creates a composite concept whichfurther deepens this. Health is itself apersonal state, as defined both by dic-tionary and by the World Health Organi-sation [2]. Thus 'personal health' mustrelate to matters pertaining to the healthof an individual, with due regard to theirbiological and familial personalisation,privacy, and circumstances. (As ex-plained below, in the healthcare commu-nity a specific facet of this is currently afast-growing area with the advent of 'per-sonalised medicine' as the applicationoutput of deeper understanding of ge-netics and genomics, but this is threaten-ing to take swamp the broader establishedconcept of personalisation.) The further composite, 'Personal Health Informatics', brings the appli-cation of information and communica IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2012Rigby tions technologies (ICTs) to the sup- port core concept of personalstate. 'Personal Health Informatics' isthe applied science of collection,processing, storing and retrieving datarelated to the health and health care ofan individual, but with the furtherweight on the 'personal' component toemphasise the personalisation, either bybeing tailored to the individual or be-ing selected and operated by the indi-vidual. This dual-compartment defini-tion thus accommodates ubiquitous andpervasive applications to monitor thevital physiological signs and daily liv-ing, and on the other hand commercialdevices and Internet applications whichthe individual uses to find out abouttheir health, healthcare, and relatedtreatment and lifestyle choices. A search of PubMed, considered the principal scientific source of verifiedpeer-reviewed health science publications,in February 2012 showed no publicationswith the term \"personal health infor-matics\" in the title, though there werefour (very disparate) publications inwhich the three words individually ap-peared in the title of an entry. Further,there were no entries in which the term\"personal health informatics\" appearedin the abstract, and only 96 in which allthree individual words appeared in anyorder or construct in the abstract. Thusin considering 'personal health infor-matics' we are considering a conceptwhich has never been written about sci-entifically in this specific way. Theslightly more eclectic Google Scholarshowed globally three papers with \"per-sonal health informatics\" in the title, and100 where the phrase appeared anywherein the text (abstract search not beingavailable). Thus this Y earbook is stakingout new ground by focussing on this newformal concept, and this is defined else-where [3]. Person-centred Health and Informatics Person-centred (or patient-centric)health care and delivery, and infor-matics applications tailored to this end,are further developments to the logical theme of long-standing aspirations totreat patients as individuals in everysense, in what is often commented oth-erwise to be 'production line medicine'where the patient fits the system ratherthan the other way round. Unfortunatelythis aspiration has often fallen short forlogistic reasons as well as provider andprofessional convenience. For many years there has been a con- cept of patient-focussed care , the sci- entific literature effectively starting inthe early 1990s, and indeed it is prima-rily a phenomenon of that decade, of-ten hospital based and concerned withprocess re-engineering with efficiencygains as much as on improving the atti-tude to patients. Patient-centred care seems to be part a deepening, and parta focus on primary and communitycare, or integrated care linking hospi-tal and home care. In either form patient focussed or cen- tred care is a relatively modest scientificinterest - a search on PubMed for \"pa-tient-focussed care\" in any context, notspecific to informatics, yielded 166 re-sults with the term in the title, increas-ing to 291 with it in the title or abstract,while \"patient-centred care\" yielded 100with the term in the title and 381 if ab-stracts were searched too; \"patient-cen-tric care\" added a further 8 and 18 re-spectively. An overview of this literatureshows that 'person-focussed' care had afrequent emphasis on changing the or-ganisation of processes of care, while'person-centred care' was more likely tohave an information or informatics ele-ment, partly because of the primary care,community care, or cross-provider inte-grated care element of the published stud-ies requiring a strong information shar-ing component, and partly because it isa more recent literature. However, in it-self this has no direct link with consumerhealth informatics. In the last few years the concept of harmonising the delivery of health careand other forms of personal supportwhich affect and determine health, suchas social care and housing support, inorder to address health holistically, hasarisen. These are recognised as raising new ideas and issues, and are develop-ments on the future agenda for healthcare development supported by healthinformatics in an integrated way [4]. Personalised Medicine 'Personalised medicine' is another termof recent origins, which too carries aspecific meaning greater than the sumof its parts. By using the term 'personal'it has strong resonance with 'personalhealth informatics' and might be ex-pected to share territory; and as it alsoexpects patient understanding and ac-tion it has an overlap of intention andmethods with consumer health infor-matics. 'Personalised medicine' tends tobe reasonably well understood withinthe technical arenas of medicine anddiagnostics, as being based on geneticsand genomics (which confusingly donot appear in its title), but is the causeof considerable misrecognition andchallenges when used more widely. However, when using automated knowledge management systems such asbibliographic searches the trans-Atlan-tic variants of the English language are acompounding confusion, given the al-ternate spellings 'personalised' and search yields inthe title and a further 709 with \"person-alized medicine\", while on searchingboth title and abstract the figures are 137and 1 904 respectively, giving a com-bined total for \"personalised/personalizedmedicine\" of 767 titles and 2 041 titlesand abstracts. Of course, the term 'per-sonalised medicine' is not unique in usefor genetically-linked care (a confusioncaused by its arguably inappropriateadoption as the term for this specific caremodality, possibly as a means of seekingto enhance its attractiveness and impor-tance), but certainly from 1999 the ge-netic-based focus was the focus of pub-lications - giving a more than twenty-foldgreater volume of PubMed publicationsthan for 'consumer health informatics' as discussed next. IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 20129 Personal Health, Person-centred Health and Personalised Medicine - Concepts, Consumers, Confusion and Challenges in the Informa tics World The reasons for raising personalised medicine here are three-fold - first, asit becomes more publicised it will hitthe public interest and thus lead to anew and different activity within con-sumer health informatics, bringing itsown challenges. Second, it puts fur-ther (and at times confused) emphasison the 'personal' element. And thirdly,it raises significant issues of ethics, andconflicts between privacy and rightsbased on linkages between autonomousindividuals, which may spill over into'personal health' activities and also compara-tively new terms, and also well es-tablished in a short time. Decon-struction of the term down to theindividual words is not helpful,given the wide and all-encompass-ing meanings of 'consumer', while'health' has already been referred to.However, PubMed showed 36 resultson searches for the string \"consumerhealth informatics\" being in the ti-tle, and 70 when searching title orabstract. The wider tolerance GoogleScholar returned 111 publications with\"consumer health informatics\" in thetitle, and 1 900 with it anywhere inthe article. Though relatively modestin size and mainly very recent, this lit-erature includes significant analyticand definitional items from more thana decade ago, including considerationof the issues of consumer healthinformatics by the United States Gen-eral Accounting Office in 1996 [5] andthe US Agency for Health Policy andResearch in 1997 [6], and an early de-finitive review in the British MedicalJournal by Eysenbach in 2000 [7].Moreover, by contrast with the analy-ses above on person-centred care andon personalised medicine, this publi-cations count is specifically papers.What is Consumer Health Informatics Considered to Be? IMIA has a definition of consumer health informatics available from theobjectives of its own Consumer HealthInformatics Working Group [8]. Thisstates that the Working Group is \"con-cerned with electronic information re-lated to health care available to the pub-lic (e.g. Internet, wireless, standaloneelectronic media).\" For its purposes, itadopts the definition of ConsumerHealth Informatics put forward by theUS General Accounting Office in 1996[5] as \"the use of modern computersand telecommunications to support con-sumers in obtaining information,analyzing unique health care needs and helping them make decisions abouttheir own health\". Important in this isthe concept that \"the consumer inter-acts with the applications directly withor without the presence of health careprofessionals\", since this is far morethan visiting Internet sites for infor-mation, and in the modern world ofmobile health (mHealth) and of con-sumer (patient) entries into healthrecords the boundary between con-sumer health informatics and main-stream health professional informaticsbecomes blurred. Eysenbach' s early review of the sub- ject [7] took the definition as \"Con-sumer health informatics branchof medical informatics that analysesconsumers' needs for information; stud-ies and implements methods of mak-ing information accessible to consum-ers; and models and integratesconsumers' preferences into medicalinformation systems. Consumer infor-matics stands at the crossroads of otherdisciplines, such as nursing informatics,public health, health promotion, healtheducation, library science, and commu-nication science, and is perhaps themost challenging and rapidly expand-ing field in medical informatics; it ispaving the way for health care in theinformation age.\" So Eysenbach too,in emphasising the interaction betweenthe consumer and health information and health systems in all forms (and in2000 less options were available),makes this a challenging and dynamicarea, far greater than informational websites alone. So in the new era of Personal Health and Personalised Medicine, the all-en-compassing Consumer Health Infor-matics becomes central and highly sig-nificant, because it covers any healthinformatics system by which consum-ers interact with health systems or ob-tain information which may influencetheir health decisions. Thus not just thetopic coverage, but issues of accuracy,understanding, ethics, and implicationsbeyond treatments or health lifestyle ofthe individual are now raised by the factthat the compass of consumer healthinformatics is changing, and in a sig-nificant way. For instance, Alpey et alraise the important issue that consumerunderstanding is not the same as con-sumer access, and they consider in de-tail, in the context of understandinginformation supplied through web sites,the cognitive and other issues raised [9].And McDaniel and colleagues fromIndiana University School of Nursingwere among the first, in 2008, to rec-ognise that the rise in what they referto as genomic health, more familiarlynow called personalised medicine, willradically change consumer healthinformatics as it interfaces new andcomplex information sources, and facesnew ethical challenges [10]. Thus though the generic definition of consumer health informatics, asshown from its early days, is simple tounder stand, the implications have also increased radically as health care andtechnology have got more complexat a time when consumer empower- ment and information access havegrown significantly. It is now difficultto think of consumer health infor-matics as a single entity, as the differ-ent technical and content manifesta-tions lead to many very differentsources and types of information, andin turn raise their own issues of un-derstanding, safety, and ethics. 10 IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2012Rigby Manifestations of Consumer Health Informatics The nature, content, and available com- munications vehicles of consumerhealth informatics have changed sig-nificantly in the last two decades. Ini-tially the focus was very largely onAdvice, Choice and Information . The purpose was to enable citizens to knowmore about health and its determinants,in order to be able to make better life-style choices, and to be able to under-stand specific conditions and theirmanagement. This was very Internet focussed, as citizens became familiarwith the rapidly expanding world wide web, and was part of the drive for citi- zens to take more responsibility formanaging their own health. In turn, this progressed in two di- rections, one being to focus on treat-ments as much as on diseases, and thesearch for the best treatment - or thenewest treatment claims. In parallel,consumer health informatics moved toproviding information about care pro-viders of many kinds including hospi-tals, and raised issues of how to iden-tify quality not least for complexconditions or linked to comorbidity. With the wider advent of web logs (blogs) and chat rooms came the de- velopment of self-help groups - on line communities which share expe-riences, advice, and ideas. These haveprovided valuable guidance and sup-port to many people. This has now fur-ther dev eloped into dedicated active initiatives such as Patientslikeme[11] - a now widespread consumerhealth initiative which is open andexplicit on three paradigm-changingaspects - in being led by citizens whoare technologists not health practi-tioners; in seeking to improve healthsystems t hemselves; and is for profit. This is a significant move on fromhealth organisations making con-sumer information available on theirinstitutional sit es, and voluntary pa- tient groups having a web site as their'shop window'.Retail 'Productisation' A second more recent development isthat of production of products for con-sumers to monitor their health. Herethe threshold of consumer healthinformatics is even more difficult todefine. Some tools, such as blood pres-sure monitors, blood glucose monitors,and devices to identify women's fertileperiods are well established and mightbe considered 'pre-informatics' as thereis no communication or computing el-ement involved other than electroniccalculation of a simple reading basedon an internal algorithm. The new situation will arise as these retail devices become more complex intheir calculations, depend on referencedata sets which are not identified, orcontain an element of personalisationin their calculations based on individualmedical history. If they are stand-alonethen they are likely to be consideredretail medical devices, but if theyinterlink through electronic communi-cations with personal records or vitalsign monitoring subsets, health careproviders, reference databases, or ad-vice-providing sites they must be con-sidered a part of consumer healthinformatics in that they will be infor-matics devices used by consumers oftheir own autonomous instigation. Record Access A further new dimension affectingconsumer health informatics is accessto personal health records. This con-cept enables patients to access theirown electronic health records, usuallythrough their primary care provider.Initially a result of campaigns to em-power patients, this concept has re-cently gained momentum. It is nowpolicy of the European Commission,with Action 75 of the Digital Agendafor Europe being to give European citi-zens secure online access to their medi-cal health data and achieve widespreadtelemedicine deployment [12]. It isnow a policy intention in the UK, buthas already been achieved in Denmark[13]. This brings consumer health informatics into interface with themainstream of health care and its de-livery, in that the consumer functionis a portal to the main provider record- no longer is consumer use of healthinformatics a separate arena, but in thisfunctionality is an aspect of mainstreaminformatics. Information Seeking; Information Providing This transition in consumer health informatics activities, from being solelyinformation receiving, to in many casesbeing information providing, moves thecitizen user of health informatics fa-cilities from external non-involvedviewer who simply acts on the infor-mation they view, to that of co-creator- whether this is through contributionto patient experience sites or to com-menting on their own provider record.However, within consumer health infor-matics this co-creating is of system orlifestyle knowledge, outside the treat-ment dialogue. The consumer may nowbe not just simply reading and acting,but feeding back, though this is explic-itly not within the patient-clinician re-lationship and the health record. For the purpose of this review a clear divide has been identified - to excludefrom consumer health informatics anyactivities which are related to a specificepisode of treatment, whether the con-sumer or patient involvement is by pas-sive or active monitoring, telemedicine,or structured planned data entry. Suchactivities are part of a clinician-led orclinician-partnered activity, and thus falloutside consumer health informatics.Specifically, consumer health infor-matics is taken as being consumer ini-tiated and not as a specific therapeutic course of treatment or support (specificclinical conditions may be involved, butconsumer health activities are outside theclinical treatment programme). There may be apparent borderline areas, such as consumer feedback on acare provider, but not involving the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 201211 Personal Health, Person-centred Health and Personalised Medicine - Concepts, Consumers, Confusion and Challenges in the Informa tics World treatment dynamic. In summary, the participant in consumer health infor- matics is acting in a citizen role;when participating in a treatment ormonitoring transaction led by a pro-fessional care provider they are act- ing in a patient role. The Consumer and Personalisation of Care The issue that has not been well identi- fied by the various pressures that havepromoted 'personalised health' as ge-netically based is that there has been a long drive to seek to personalise healthcare and its delivery, in line with corehuman values, but this has not beenseen as a major priority until now, bywhich time all the terms and labels havebeen appropriated. In general terms thispersonalisation has applied from thetime of Hippocrates and even earlierwithin professional healthinformatics, the personal privacythrough 'isolation' of individualrecords by means of data protectionand confidentiality has been a coreprinciple, but much less so the 'per-sonalisation' through recording of per-sonal aspects and values (as being dis-tinct from biometric values). Oneexception is that the Medical Infor-matics Europe (MIE) conference in1994 took as its theme 'Human Valuesin Medical Informatics', which enabledintegrational papers on human valuesof patients and staff in electronicrecords, and resultant person-sensitivecare, such as [14]. Fierz writing in Switzerland in 2004 summed this up well - scientific medi-cine has in its enthusiasm for objectiv-ity partly neglected the long-establishedaim of personalising all medicine, eventhough it is known that 'one fits all' doesnot work well in medicine; however,the time for change is ripe in the postgenomic era, and with modern infor-mation and communications technologyin support - \"the goal is magnificent: per- sonal health planning, early diagnosis,the right drug for the right patient, andpredictable side effects\" [15]. Though therefore the very nature of health care and its record keeping ispersonalised - the personal history, andthe personal and very confidentialrecord are cornerstones - too often thecare delivery itself is formulaic in itsconstruct, and only personalised in thesense of fitting a treatment protocol tothe diagnostically-defined problem,rather than the problem as manifest inthe person's life and lifestyle. Indeed,this mechanical element, and the stand-ardised delivery within an efficiencyframework, has been a trigger for ele-ments of consumer health mobilisation,as patients seek to express themselvesand their aspirations as people [11]. Personalised Care Planning Care planning is a well-establishedmeans within nursing and many otherhealth professions other than medicinefor ensuring that the delivery of caremeets the individual personal needs andcircumstances of patients, and has astrong literature in this context, suchas [16]. The result is that care deliv-ered is as personalised as possible, andhealth informatics should ensure this,such as reported in [14]. The same personalisation can be seen as an objective of electronic healthrecords (EHR), especially in specificdomains such as mental health, mak-ing the EHR the vehicle for ensuringpersonal and personalised care [17].Indeed, a literature analysis from thissame care domain of mental healthshows that the illness itself is the sub-ject of personalisation to the individual[18], yet this is only a deepening of therecognition in care planning that theeffect of morbidity on the individual ispersonal to their pattern of daily livingand activities, and treatments and theirdelivery should similarly be personal-ised. The same applies to other healthand morbidity domains.Personalised Medicines It is not just overall care which shouldbe personalised in its planning, but alsomedicines specifically. The current pat-tern of administering standard doses iscrude. The benefits of personalisingmedicines themselves are demonstrable[19]. A further form of personalisationis bio-identical hormone therapy [20];here the composition of the pharma-ceutical product rather than the dose oradministration is personalised. Personalising E-Health With not only an increasing number ofways in which health care can andshould be personalised, and increasingconsumer knowledge and expectations,it is natural and appropriate that e-health should be used to achieve a dataand process dependent activity of somecomplexity. Apart from the use of elec-tronic records as exemplified in [14]and [17], from Greece comes recogni-tion of the social utility of personal-ised e-health in delivering personalisedcare [21]. These are examples of recognition of the inter-linkage between personal-ised health records and personalisedcare; the health record architecture isgeneric and the data are the means ofpersonalisation. However, in the preced-ing issue of this Y earbook Kalra hasraised the next stage of personalisation,that of the personalised functions of Web3 and thus Health Informatics 3 [22]. So Where Does that Leave Consumer Health Informatics? Consumer health informatics became a significant field with the advent oflarge-scale public access to the Internet.This itself was an important step inempowering citizens with health infor-mation, enabling them to better man-age their own health (both in healthylifestyles and in response to disease), 12 IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2012Rigby and to start to even up the power im- balance between health professionaland patient. Apart from the Internet, two new technical developments have added tothe scene, enriching it yet raising theirown new issues and blurred boundaries.One of these, access (including fromhome) to individual health records, andrelated to that remote monitoring for aspecific condition, provided by ahealthcare or similar agency, is alreadyexplained as being excluded from thedefinition of consumer health infor-matics adopted here, as it is a morepatient-friendly interface with the careprocess, rather than seeking of genericinformation - though to paraphrase theAmazon approach to on-line consum-ers, 'if you liked record access, you maylike information access'. Consumer Initiated e-Health The process of crossing the line frominteracting with a personal EHR, toinitiating self-management using e-health, leads to a new field for con-sumer health informatics. An Austral-ian group has identified the potentialvalue for consumers of engaging in e-health for their own self-management,but also that this area is significantlyunder-researched [23], while simulta-neously a Dutch group sees this ap-proach as an empowerment means, butalso identifies the lack of research [24].So clearly this is a potentially impor-tant area for future development need-ing further scientific study. Social Media A second new phenomenon that is apotential major methodology forconsumer health informatics is so-cial media. Blogs and chat roomsgive a whole new dynamic to support- ive groups such as disease-specificgroups, and enable feedback and dis-cussion with formal healthcare provid-ers. And as indicated earlier, new siteshave built up based on the new social media [11]. Sites such as Facebook,meanwhile, though not health-specific,are a valuable communications conduitfor health interests as well as sites onwhich individuals share details andseek support. YouTube One particularly interesting, and onreflection challenging, social mediumbeing used in health is Y ouTube.Though usually thought of as a meansof exchanging lighter short videos,such as amusing or candid cameraclips, music or family scenes, it is nowbeing u sed formally within health, not least because it provides a goodway of streaming video into anyhouse where a citizen may need toacquire skills or dynamic knowl-edge, and is now being consideredas a health professional aid whenadvising citizens [25, 26]. However, there is a big difference, probably not appreciated by the aver-age consumer, between following aposted link and general searching. Forinstance, at the time of preparing thispaper, searching on the Y ouTube siteon \"infantile spasms\" yielded 704 videoclips ranging from explanatory onesto those from parents effectively ask-ing for a diagnosis, or at least whethertheir child was 'normal'. Searching\"suicide\" yielded 291 000 results,ranging from offers to help regain a healthy state of mind to clips (among thefirst results) of the act allegedly takingplace - clearly largely inappropriatepostings though with some of potentialvalue. By contrast \"condom use\" yielded8 450 results, of which the great major-ity of the first hits were responsible ad-vice which it could be difficult for youngpeople to gain by any other means. One of the challenges when view- ing or using Y ou Tube is the linkedoffers which are made adjacent to theviewing screen, the advertisementswhich scroll across the screen or pre-cede running of clips, and the sug-gested further viewing. Unless controls are placed to protect direct hypertext-linked clips from this intrusion, the useof this medium becomes dangerous -particularly for health topics. This is lessof a challenge when a hypertext link issupplied by a recognised agency, but is aserious challenge and restriction on ef-fectiveness in a healthcare or behaviouralsetting when using the free search facil-ity - in other words, by serious-mindedthinking consumers. Consumer Health Informatics in the Personal Health andPersonalised Medicine Era So as health informatics and personal- ised medicine both expand and becomemore citizen-friendly and accessible,what are the issues for consumer healthinformatics? The main effects arelikely to be increased demand and ex-pectation, coinciding with the avail-ability of new media. And conversely,expectations and ideas gained thoughconsumer health informatics may in-crease pressure for personalised medi-cine services, as well as for personali-sation of care delivery. It will be important to see what phe- nomena and sites emerge in the per-sonalised medicine area of the con-sumer health informatics media.Certainly there is a risk of exploita-tion of anxious people, and of sale ofservices of doubtful validity, as somecitizens seek to allay anxieties whichmay or may not be well-founded abouttheir personal risk. It cannot be as-sumed that all those active in thehealthcare market are ethical - if it isnow necessary to remove rhinoceroshorns from museums across Europe asthey are sought by thieves to meet ademand for spurious medicinal value[27], what other false claim based prod-ucts will be placed in front of gullibleworried individuals? A further issue which is likely to increase with the popularisation of per- IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 201213 Personal Health, Person-centred Health and Personalised Medicine - Concepts, Consumers, Confusion and Challenges in the Informa tics World sonalised medicine is that of the call- ing into question of assumed parent-age. The obtaining, quite legitimately,of a genetic profile, linked to accessingInternet information on conditions, in-heritance, and relative risks, can easilybe seen to have the potential to lead tovery damaging situations, if genomicprofiles of close family members andconsequent recommended clinical actionare seen to be incompatible with believedconsanguinity relationships. There arelikely to be cases of stable family situa-tions where parenthood is not as has beensupposed - either because of an early re-marriage which has not been revealed toa child, an undisclosed adoption, egg orsperm donorship from which the com-missioning couple has always consideredthe child in every sense as 'theirs', a genu-ine lack of knowledge of parentage (asmade light of in 'Mama Mia'), or an in-fidelity by a wife many years ago andhitherto not suspected by any other party.There is no easy answer, as loving andtrusting relationships may be severelychallenged, yet at the same time any in-dividual has the right to ascertain theirown genetic history, and the Internet doesnot have the same sensitivity of approachin revealing facts or knowledge as atrained individual. As for the more generic personali- sation of health, consumer healthinformatics should be an enablingforce. Whether by providing adviceabout what types and choices of careshould be offered, or giving informa-tion about providers, web-based infor-mation should be helpful and em- powering. The key issue will beensuring that each citizen involvedfinds the right, accurate and intelligi-ble, information. Challenges and Issues So as consumer health informaticsmoves forward into a new era of per-sonal health and personalised medi-cine, some old challenges remain andnew ones arise.Authenticity and Accuracy The challenge of ensuring the authentic-ity and accuracy of Internet sites has longbeen a concern. Authenticity relates towhether the organisation is what it seemsto be - for instance, when the names offormal organisations are parodied withonly a small variant, leading a user tobelieve they are reading an official sitewhen they are not. A number of organi-sations have problems with unofficial'shadows'; the citizen may or may notspot the difference. Accuracy refers to the content. There has for a long time been a concern aboutthe lack of verification of site content,leaving the consumer to differentiaterobust from less authentic or validatedmaterial. The Health on the Net Founda-tion has established a long-recognisedCode, but this is voluntary, and for aconsiderable period was a set of princi-ples based on self-regulation though withno enforcement mechanism. In 1997 aworkshop was organised in Turku, Fin-land, to consider the risks of lack of cer-tification of e-health services or internetsites, and largely as a result in 1999 theEuropean Commission funded the projectTowards European Accreditation andCertification of Health Informatics serv-ices (TEAC Health). This recommendedamong other actions a voluntary systemof third party validated verification sealsfor Internet sites [28, 29, 30], and sub-sequently the Commission adopted apolicy of sponsoring such a system, butfailures of the funding mechanism forprojects resulted in this policy not beingfulfilled. This concept has now been de-veloped by the Health on the Net Foun-dation, and their HON Code seal is nowprovided as a certified web seal [31], andthis has been studied [32, 33]. Equity of Access The more that consumer healthinformatics becomes acknowledged, par-ticularly by health care providers, thegreater will be the expectation that citi-zens will be expected to use it as part ofmanaging their health. This is commend- able, but does raise the serious risk ofthe creation of a 'digital divide', wherebythe more affluent and educated sectorsof the population have good access,while the poorer and marginalised sec-tion, and the older elderly, have less ac-cess - and these are the sectors of thepopulation most likely to have healthproblems. Effectiveness and Safety of Use Similar to equity of access, the issues ofeffectiveness and safety of use are likelyto create a population gradient, and oneskewed in the opposite way to need.Many older or less formally educatedmembers of society will not be digitallyfluent. And a proportion of those whouse the internet in straightforward ways,such as for on line purchases, chatting,or social media, will not be skilled whenit comes to structured searching, and fil-tering of the reliable from the less reli-able, especially as the most significantscientific material may be in less acces-sible language; furthermore, such usersmay not realise their own vulnerabilitydue to their successful use of the Internetfor simpler activities. There are a numberof attempts to increase digital literacy andhealth literacy, but they are currently small when matched against the sizeof the need for increasing health-spe-cific digital literacy across all sectorsof society globally. Enablement Structured enablement is one way toencourage wider and more fluent useof consumer health informatics. Thiswould involve trusted centres or indi-viduals offering facilities and advice toindividuals wishing to use the Internetfor health purposes. It could be throughhealth facilities, such as primary carecentres, or through public librarieswhere supported Internet access is pro-vided. However, so far this is a needwhich has not been identified or ad- 14 IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2012Rigby dressed, valuable though it could be in a more consumer-orientated and infor-mation-based society. Impersonation, Grooming and Fraud Probably because health workers arepositively motivated, little thoughtseems to have been given to anticipat-ing and tackling malevolent exploitation of consumer health informatics and itsusers. In wider Internet usage attemptsto obtain banking details though boguse-mails, or obtain personal details suchas by claiming an e-mail account is fullor in conjunction with a spurious invest-ment or lottery win, are commonplace.On line retail sales of products withmythical powers of cure are known about,as are sales of low efficacy substitutesfor effective medications. And in nor-mal society, attempts to skim bank cards,or to gain entry to older people' s housesby posing as utility engineers or public officials, and not unusual. Chat rooms are vulnerable to individuals who willproject false persona so as to befriend atype of person of their choice. So logi-cally, consumer health informatics is aripe field for that tiny but determinedminority of society who will go to greatlengths to defraud or exploit - within itsuser community there will be less digit-ally experienced persons who are veryworried about a health condition, whomay be vulnerable to being easily talkedinto pointless expensive purchases, tojoining exploitative self-help groups, oreven to meeting one-to-one to share ex-periences or get help. So far there is lit-tle evidence of this happening, but as consumer health informatics expands,and more people seek on line support,it is surely inevitable that the roguecommunity anticipate this and start tobecome active. The health informaticscommunity must anticipate this, andstart to advise both standards, and con-sumer education and best practicewarnings. Anticipation and preventionare important approaches to health;they should apply in this domain asmuch as any other.Retail Medical Devices Finally, as product types and marketsexpand, so will retail products. Thecross-over from being a consumer prod-uct to being a consumer healthinformatics retail device, such as whenthe product communicates with an ana-lytic centre or reference database, is notwell defined. This debate links also tothe issue of when software orinformatics products become medicaldevices, and in both the United Statesand Europe this is currently a discus-sion and development area [34]. Thistoo needs to be an area of proactivedebate and initiatives. The Need for Action Consumer health informatics has forover a decade had a clear definition androle. However, the welcome extensionof consumer orientated approaches tohealth and healthcare, aided and stimu-lated by other new concepts such aspersonalisation of care, 'smartening' ofcare [35], social media and other par-ticipatory phenomena, new retail prod-ucts, and personalisation of medicine,will lead to a new era. This will be morecomplex because of the greater personalinteraction with sites, and that this is by definition a personal and privatearea of activity. Involvement willspread from the more able and edu-cated sections of society to a widercross-section including more vulner-able people. At the same time, thiswidening will raise challenges both ofwidening of issues and risks such assimple misinterpretation, to the open-ing up of interest by the malevolentlyexploitational. And as e-health is glo-bal this ceases to be a local or nationalissue but becomes global, as with hack-ing and phishing. The consumer health informatics community should also initiate a moreactive programme of enablement aspart of facilitating deeper and betteruse, and acting against the digital di-vide as well as traditional health in- equalities. This would include facili-tating consumer understanding andawareness through educational and pro-motional programmes, and stimulat-ing and promoting models of sup-ported access and use. Overall, the global health infor- matics community needs to give thearea of consumer health informaticsdeeper attention. The potential ben-efits, and the potential risks, are go-ing to multiply, and no longer shouldinstitutional health provider infor-matics be seen as the sole area of ma-jor importance. At the same time thisis not an area where health informaticsshould feel forced to work alone. Othercompetent organisations already activein aspects of or related to healthinformatics include the World HealthOrganisation, the International Tel-ecommunications Union, the WorldTrade Organisation, and crime preven-tion and detection networks. IMIAshould establish a role in seeking tobring these organisations together toaddress proactively the issues of pro-moting consumer health informatics ina positive yet protected way. Includedin innovations which should be devel-oped jointly, with a high profile theworld citizen should recognise andtrust, are third party verified seals forsites and services (as already appliesin site security and financial transac-tions), and simple education and ad-vice programmes on how to find anduse consumer health sites. Conclusion As information and communicationtechnologies continue to expand infunctionality, coverage and uptake, sothis coincides with and facilitates themove to greater consumer orientationand personalisation of health care, andemphasis on personal responsibility forhealth. Consumer health informaticscan and should play an important rolein this; and it should enable the citizen IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 201215 Personal Health, Person-centred Health and Personalised Medicine - Concepts, Consumers, Confusion and Challenges in the Informa tics World to benefit from such facilities in an in- formed, effective and safe way. Rec-ognition of the growing importance ofthe sector must also lead to reluctantacceptance that the greater its value anduse, the greater the attraction for ma-levolent exploitation of its users, witha concomitant need to take socially re-sponsible preventive action. Unlike many other areas of health informatics, consumer health infor-matics is not an organised sector, andhas no corporate organisation or affin-ity. IMIA is the lead informatics body,but does not act solely for health, com-munications, nor citizen safety. Thepersonalisation of other aspects of careshould be a trigger for recognition ofthe need for concerted action to pro-tect safe personalisation of healththrough consumer health informatics.
