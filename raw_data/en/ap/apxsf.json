Ahead of next week's Special Session focused on vaccine mandates, members of the Florida Chiropractic Society thanked Gov. Ron DeSantis, Senate President Wilton Simpson and House Speaker Chris Sprowls for taking action. FCS isn't opposed to the use of vaccines or the science behind them, but the organization says individuals should make their own choice on whether to receive or refuse a vaccine. \"Governor DeSantis has consistently been on the side of individual freedom. We thank him for his tireless efforts to ensure that governments don't impose unnecessary COVID-19 vaccine requirements, and for calling for a Special Session of the Florida Legislature to protect health care freedom,\" said FCS President Dr. Eddie Martinez. \"As health care professionals, we are keenly aware that health care should be a matter of informed consent, not government mandates.

They would also allow workers who are willing to submit to testing or wear personal protective equipment to opt out of vaccines. Other bills filed for the Special Session would lay the groundwork for the state to withdraw from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( [HB 5](https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021B/5B)/ [SB 6](https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021B/6B)), and delete a provision from Florida law that enables the state health officer to mandate vaccinations during a public "}
