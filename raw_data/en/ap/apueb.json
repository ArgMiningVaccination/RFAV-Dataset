Our Western medical system treats individual symptoms and diseases as they arise, most often with the use of pharmaceutical drugs. Though this model can suppress symptoms quickly and is vital in the case of life threatening infections, it often masks the deeper cause of underlying illness. Alternatively, Naturopathic Medicine views the body as a complex, interrelated whole. All aspects of health including structural, functional, psychological and spiritual are considered in every patient case. All symptoms are traced back to their origin in order to identify the root cause of illness. Obstacles to cure are then removed and imbalances adjusted to prepare the body for repair. Once achieved, the body's innate healing ability is stimulated through a variety of therapies to achieve true and lasting healing. The modern Naturopathic profession originated in 1902, though many of its therapies have deep roots in ancient principles of healing. Since the 1950s the profession shifted in response to mounting pressure the from mainstream medical community and is now grounded in Western medical science and overseen by a national governing body. Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) attend 4-year medical programs at one of 7 accredited school in North America. They receive rigorous training in all the medical sciences including anatomy, physiology and biochemistry. In addition to a scientific foundation, NDs are trained in the numerous modalities of the profession including Chinese Medicine and acupuncture, Botanical Medicine, Clinical Nutrition, counseling, massage, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, and orthopedic adjustment. Every prescription plan is a unique combination of treatments and lifestyle modifications based on the individual patient case. Though a vast number of conditions are treated by NDs, areas with notable clinical success are mood and mental health, sleep, digestive concerns, cardiovascular disease, infertility, low energy and fatigue, autoimmune conditions and musculoskeletal pain.
