Our most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India only........ Mark TwainXII National Health Profile 2019The Republic of India (Bhrat Gaarjya) is one of the oldest civilizations with more than 1.2 billion people and most populous Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic with a Parliamentary system of Government in the world. India is the seventh-largest country by area as well as world's seventh-largest economy and it has achieved socio economic progress during the last 70 years of its independence. The country has become self sufficient in agricultural production and is one of the top industrialised country in the world and emerged as an important regional power. Over the seven decades since independence, life expectancy of the country has increased , literacy rates have quadrupled and health conditions have improved to a great extent . Location: India covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km (1,269,346 sq mi), extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. Lying entirely in the northern hemisphere, the mainland extends between latitudes 8\u00b0 4' and 37\u00b0 6' north, longitudes 25' east and measures about 3,214 km from north to south between the extreme latitudes and about 2,933 km from east to west between the extreme longitudes. Boundaries: Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the south-west, and the Bay of Bengal on the south-east, India shares land borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan to the north-west; China, Bhutan and Nepal to the north; Myanmar to the east; and Bangladesh to the east of West Bengal. Sri Lanka is separated from India by a narrow channel of sea, formed by Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. Physical Diversity - The main land comprises of four regions, namely, the great mountain zone, plains of the Ganga and the Indus, the desert region and the southern peninsula. The Himalayas comprise three almost parallel ranges interspersed with large plateaus and valleys, which extends over a distance of about 2,400 km with a varying depth of 240 to 320 km in the northernmost part of the country. The plains of the Ganga and the Indus, about 2,400 km long and 240 to 320 km broad, are formed by basins of three distinct river systems - the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. They are one of the world's greatest stretches of flat alluvium and also one of the most densely populated areas on the earth. The desert region in the western part comprise of the great desert extending from the edge of the Rann of kuchh beyond the Luni River northward including the whole of the Rajasthan-Sindh frontier. While the little desert extends from the luni between Jaisalmer and Jodhpur up to the northern-west. Between the great and the little deserts lies a zone of absolutely sterile country, consisting of rocky land cut up by limestone ridges. The peninsular plateau is marked by a mass of mountain and hill. Prominent among these are the Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Maikala and Ajanta, flanked by the Eastern Ghats with average elevation is about 610 meters, and the Western Ghats where it is generally from 915 to 1,220 meters, rising in places to over 2,440 meters. India is rich in flora and fauna. Available data place India in the Tenth position in the world and 4th in Asia in plant diversity. It has the second position in Horticulture in world and has world's is greatest sundari tree (Mangrove in Sunderban Delta). Climate: The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and mountain climate. https://www.weforum.org /agenda/2018/04/the-worlds-biggest-economies-in-2018/ SELECTED SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATISTICS INDIA -2002 , CSO, Ministry of Statistics & PI http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/reports_and_publication/statistical_publication/social_statistics/Chapter_3.pdfXIII National Health Profile 2019EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Better health is central to human happiness and well-being. It also makes an important contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more. Healthy Citizens are the greatest asset any country can have. Many factors influence health status and a country's ability to provide quality health services for its people. A healthy India is no longer a dream. India has had notable achievements since independence in 1947.Infent mortality and crude death rate has been reduced considerably. Life expectancy at birth has increased, infant mortality and crude death rates have been greatly reduced, diseases such as small pox, polio and guinea worm have been eradicated, and leprosy is at the verge of getting eliminated. Updated, sound and reliable health information is the foundation of decision making across all health systems building blocks. It is essential for health system policy development and implementation, governance and regulation. A good health information system brings together all relevant partners to ensure that users of health information have access to reliable, authoritative, useable, understandable and comparative data. Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI) tries to bring together all health related information in a single platform by publishing National Health Profile (NHP), annually since 2005. It has six chapters covering Demographic, Socio-Economic, Health Status and Health Finance Indicators, Human Resources in Health Sector and Health Infrastructure. Importantly, it is a major source of information on various communicable and non-communicable diseases that are not covered under any other major programmes. This information is essential for health system policy development, governance, health research, human resource development, health education and training, service delivery and financing. India is a vast south Asian country with diverse terrain - from Himalyayan peaks to Indian Ocean coastline. Between 2001 and 2011 census India grew by 181 million people. As per Census 2011, the total population of India is 1210.8 million with a decadal growth rate of 17.7 per cent, Where 31.14 per cent of the population lives in urban areas, the rest lives in rural areas. Sex Ratio (number of females per 1000 males) in the country has improved from 933 in 2001 to 943 in 2011. In rural areas the sex ratio has increased from 946 to 949. The corresponding increase in urban areas has been of 29 points from 900 to 929. Kerala has recorded the highest sex ratio in respect of total population (1084), rural population (1078) and urban (1091). The lowest sex ratio in rural areas has been recorded in Chandigarh (690). As per Census 2011, While 28.5% population of India lies between 0-14 age group, only 8.3% are above the age of 60 years in the country Estimated birth rate, death rate and natural growth rate are showing a declining trend. Estimated birth rate declined from 25.8 in 2000 to 20.4 in 2016 while the death rate declined from 8.5 to 6.4 per 1000 population over the same period. The natural growth rate declined from 17.3 in 2000 to 14 in 2016 as per the latest available information. The SRS (2016) shows that the Total Fertility Rate (average number of children that will be born to a woman during her lifetime) in 12 States has fallen below two children per woman and 9 States have reached replacements levels of 2.1 and above. Delhi, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have lowest fertility among other countries. The literacy rate of the country has shown an increase of 8.2% during the decade 2001-2011. Overall literacy rate of India is 73.0% whereas for males it is 80.9% and for females it is 64.6%. Rural literacy rate is 67.8% and urban literacy rate is 84.1%. It has been observed that the non-communicable diseases dominate over communicable in the total disease burden of the country. In a recent report of India Council of Medical Research (ICMR), titled India: Health of the Nation's States: The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative(2017), it is observed that the disease burden due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases, as measured using Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), dropped from 61 per cent to 33 per cent between 1990 and 2016. In the same period, disease burden from non-communicable diseases increased from 30 per cent to 55 per cent. The epidemiological transition, however, varies widely among Indian states: 48% to 75% for non-communicable diseases, 14% to 43% for infectious and associated diseases, and 9% to 14% for injuries. In recent years India has made ground-breaking progress in reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by 77% from 556 per 100000 live births in 1990 to 130 per 100000 live births in 2016. The Urban-Rural divide traditionally seen in institutional births has been largely closed. Overall 75% of rural births are now supervised as compared to 89% in urban areas.XIV National Health Profile 2019India has attained significant progress in achieving immunization coverage through Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) which provides prevention against six vaccine preventable diseases. In 2013, India along with South East Asia Region, declared commitment towards measles elimination and rubella/ congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) control by 2020. MR vaccine campaign is targeted towards 410 million children across the country. 'Mission Indra dhanush' aimed to fully immunize more than 90% of newborns by 2020 through innovative and planned approaches. A total of 528 districts were covered during the various phases of this Mission. India has come a long way in immunisation but has to traverse far before achieving its targets. National health programmes, launched by the Government of India, have been playing crucial roles in tackling several serious health concerns. Malaria has been a problem in India for centuries, at one time a rural disease, diversified under the pressure of developments into various ecotypes. Both the cases reported and deaths due to malaria have come down over the years. The malarial death rate in India declined to 0.02 deaths per lakh population in 2018 from 0.10 deaths per lakh population in 2001. To achieve malaria-free country by 2027 and elimination by 2030, National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2017-22 for Malaria Elimination has been developed by National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. For effective implementation of various elimination strategies, the focus of the programme is laid on district-level rather than State-level. Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) is another programme implemented under National Health Mission. It has achieved millennium development goals in 2015 by halting and reversing the incidence of TB. The programme was initiated with the objective of ensuring access to quality diagnosis and care for all TB patients. Several notable activities such as notification of TB; case-based, web-based recording and reporting system (NIKSHAY); standards of TB care in India; Composite indicator for monitoring programme performance; scaling up of the programmatic management of drug resistant TB services etc. were implemented in the past. NIKSHAY, the web based reporting for TB programme has enabled to capture and transfer of individual patient data from the remotest health centres of the country. In 2017, National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2017-25 for TB Elimination framework has been adopted, which provides goals and strategies for eliminating TB in India by 2030. The National Programme for prevention and control of cancers, diabetics, cardiovascular diseases and stroke under National Health Mission was initiated to tackle the raising burden of NCDs. The main focus of the Programme is on health promotion and prevention, strengthening of infrastructure including human resource, early diagnosis, treatment and referral and integration with primary health care systems through NCD cells in the entire the country. The cost of treatment has been on rise in India and it has led to inequity in access to health care services. India spends only 1.28% of its GDP (2017-18 BE) as public expenditure on health. Per capita public expenditure on health in nominal terms has gone up from Rs 621 in 2009-10 to Rs 1657 in 2017-18. The Centre : State share in total public expenditure on health was 37:63 in 2017-18. Health insurance in India is a growing segment. Yet, it hasn't taken off fully and several measures are needed to improve and expand insurance coverage. The advent of private insurers in India saw the introduction of many innovative products like family floater plans, top-up plans, critical illness plans, hospital cash and top up policies. Ayushman Bharat Mission- National Health Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) world's largest health scheme announced in the Union Budget 2018-19 is the latest initiative in expanding the health insurance net and targets 10 crore poor and deprived rural population. The Mission aims to provide a cover of Rs.5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care procedures. Manpower for health services has been described as the \"heart of the health system in any country\". It is one of the most important aspect and critical component of health policies. A health information system with a strong human resource component can help build the evidence base in order to plan for availability and accessibility of needed health workers in right place, at right time and in desired quality. NHP has compiled detailed health manpower availability in public sector. The total number of registered Allopathic Doctors (up to 2018) is 11, 54,686. Number of Dental Surgeons registered with Central/State Dental Councils of India up to 31.12.2018 was 2,54,283.There is an increasing trend in number of Dental Surgeons registered with Central/State Dental Council of India from 2007 to 2018.Total number of registered AYUSH Doctors in India as on 01.01.2018 was 7,9 9,879.XV National Health Profile 2019Health infrastructure is an important indicator for understanding the health care policy and welfare mechanism in a country. It signifies the investment priority with regards to the creation of health care facilities. Infrastructure has been described as the basic support for the delivery of public health activities. Effective public health actions rely upon a well-trained public health workforce and good and sufficient health infrastructure. Indian healthcare delivery system is categorised into two major components- public and private. The public healthcare system comprises limited secondary and tertiary care institutions in key cities and focuses on providing basic healthcare facilities in the form of primary healthcare centres (PHCs) in rural areas. The private sector provides majority of secondary tertiary and quaternary care institutions with a major concentrations in metros. Universal access to health care is a well-articulated goal for both global institutions and national governments. Under health related Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No. 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), a commitment towards global effort to eradicate disease, strengthen treatment and healthcare, and address new and emerging health issues has been pronounced. Access to good health and well-being is a human right and that is why SDG offers a new chance to ensure the highest standard of heath and healthcare for all the citizens. India's National Health Policy, 2017 envisions the goal of attaining highest possible level of health and well-being for all and for all ages through a preventive and promotive health care orientation in all developmental policies and universal access to good quality health care services without financial hardship to the citizens. The gains of India in many health related indicators helped the country to make progress in achieving MDGs. More efforts, however, are required to reach the goals of Universal Health Coverage and those envisioned in SDG. ***Demographic inDicators chapter one an overview of popula tion statistics and Vital statistics of the country.1.

Population Statistics deals with size and growth of population, sex ratio, density of population etc. while Vital Statistics deals with birth rate, death rate, and natural growth rate, life expectancy at birth, mortality and fertility rates. State/UT wise performance of these indicators helps us to identify areas that need policy and programme interventions, setting near and far-term goals, and deciding priorities, besides understanding them in an integrated structure. Data in this section has been taken mainly from the \"Census of India\". l India's population, as per census 2011 at 12108.5 lakhs (6232.7 lakhs males and 5875.8 lakhs females). Out of the entire census till date, the Average Annual Exponential Growth Rate has been negative only for the decade 1911-21. During this interval, population declined marginally due to great influenza epidemic and two successive bad harvests in West Bengal. [Table No. 1.1.1] l The sex ratio of India during 1901 was 972 females per 1000 males. Since then, it has continued to decline decade over decade to 926 females against 1000 male in 1991 (except in 1981). The sex ratio has further improved from 1991 it was 933 and 943 female against 1000 female in 2001 and 2011 respectively in the country as per the information available at Table No. 1.1.1 and graphic presentation given at Figure No. 1.1.2. According to Figure No. 1.1.1, the sex ratios of 18 States/UTs were above national average while 17 States/UTs have registered below national average. l The highest sex ratio of 1084 females per 1000 males was reported by State of lowest sex ratio of 618 females per 1000 males was reported by the UT of Daman & Diu followed by Chandigarh [Refer Table No. 1.1.2] l The graphic representation of the population density of the country is given at Figure No. 1.1.3. The highest population density of 11320 populations per square kilometre was reported by NCT of Delhi whereas Arunachal Pradesh has reported the lowest population density of 17. [Refer Table No. 1.1.2] l Age group-wise distribution of population of the country projected for 2015 and 2016 are given at Table No. 1.1.4(a) and Table No. 1.1.4(b) respectively. Accordingly to Table No. 1.1.4 (b), 27% of the total estimated population of 2016 were below the age of 14 years and majority (64.7%) of the population were in the age group of 15-59 years i.e. economically active population and 8.5% population were in the age group of 60 to 85+ years. l The estimated Birth Rate, Death Rate and Natural Growth Rate in India during 1991 to 2017 are given in Table No. 1.2.1. There has been consistent decrease in the Birth Rate, Death Rate and Natural Growth Rate in India since 1991 to 2017. As on 2017 India has registered Birth Rate of 20.2 per 1000 populations and Death Rate of 6.3 per 1000 populations while the Natural Growth Rate was 13.9 per 1000 population in India. The Birth Rate in Rural was higher than in the Urban. Similarly, the Death Rate and Natural Growth Rate were also higher in rural as compared to the Urban.5 National Health Profile 2019l The population, however, continues to grow, as the decline in the birth rate is not as rapid as the decline in the death rate. l The Life Expectancy of Life at Birth has increased from 49.7 years in 1970-75 to 68.7 years in 2012-16. For the same period, the Life Expectancy for Females is 70.2 years and 67.4 years for Males. [Table No. 1.2.6 (b)] l Infant Mortality Rate has declined considerably (33 i.e. Per 1000 Live Births in 2016), however differentials of rural (37) & urban (23) are still high. [Table No. 1.2.7] l As per the latest data available, Maternal Mortality Ratio is highest in Assam & lowest in Kerala. [Table No- 1.2.9] l The Age-specific death rate is declining over the years; the rural-urban differentials are still high. [Table No. 1.2.11(b)] l The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country was 2.3 whereas in rural areas it has been 2.5 and it has been 1.8 in urba n areas during 2016 as per the latest available information.

For working out density of India and the State of Jammu & Kashmir, the entire area and population of those portions of Jammu & Kashmir which are under illegal occupation of Pakistan and China have not been taken into account. 3. For Census 2011, the population of \"Others\" has been clubbed with the \"Males\" for working out population, 0-6 population, literates and relates rates and ratios. 4. In working out 'decadal variation' and percentage decal variation' for 1941-1951 & 1951-1961 of India and Nagaland State, the population of Tuensang District for 1951(7.025) & the population of Tuensang (83,501) & Mon (50,774) districts for 1961 Census have not been taken into account as the area was censused for the first time in 1951 and the same are not comparable. 5. The 1981 Census could not be held owing to disturbed conditions prevailing in Assam. Hence the population figures for 1981 of Assam have been worked out by 'Interpolation'. 6. The 1991 Census was not held in Jammu & Kashmir. Hence the population figures for 1991 of Jammu & Kashmir have been worked out by 'Interpolation'. 7. The distribution of population of Pondicherry (Puducherry) by sex for 1901 (246,354), and 1931 (258,628) and 1941 (285,011) is not available. The figures of India for these years are, therefore, exclusive of these population figures so far as distribution by sex is concerned. 8. Arunachal Pr adesh was censused for the first time in 1961. 9. In 1951, Tuensang was censused for the first time in 129.5 sq.kms of areas only. In 1961 censused areas of Tuensang District of Nagaland was increased to 5356.1 sq.kms. 10. Due to non-availability of census data the figures for the decades, from 1901 to 1951 have been estimated for the districts of Kohima, Phek, Wokha, Zunheboto and Mokokchung of Nagaland. Estimation however could not be done for Tuensang and Mon as they were not fully censused prior to 1961. 11. As the sex break-up is not available for the year 1901. Figures for males and females have been estimated for the year 1901 for Madhya Pradesh. 12.

Socio-Economic Indicators Highlights S ocio-economic indicators provide a background for understanding the health scenario of a country. This section provides data on education, gender, poverty, housing, amenities, employment and other economic indicators. These indicators for the country and for the States will help in identifying the linkages between socio-economic indicators and achievement of health goals. l According to 2011 Census, the overall literacy rate of India is 73%. At the time of Independence the country's literacy rate was abysmally low, 14%. Over the years literacy rate has been increasing but with varied rates in different states with some states like Kerala (94%) and Mizoram (91.3%) are well above the national average while states like Bihar has a dismal rate of 61.8%. There is also a concern for female literacy rate (64.6%) which is much below the male literacy rate (80.9%). There is a strong need to improve the overall literacy rate as improved literacy rate has an impact on increasing a country's economic growth rate and decreasing population growth rate. Also as India has a very young population, literacy will play a very important role in turning the young population into potential human capital. (Table 2.1.1). l A t the national level, the mean age at effective marriage for female in the year 2016 is 22.2 years and varies from 21.7 years in rural areas to 23.1 years in urban areas. Among the bigger States/UTs, the mean age varies from 21.2 years in West Bengal to 24.7 years in Jammu & Kashmir. Table (2.2.1). l B efore 2005, the official measure of poverty line was based primarily on food security. It was defined as the per capita expenditure needed for a person to consume enough calories and be able to pay for associated essentials to survive. Since 2005, the Government adopted Tendulkar methodology which moved away from calorie anchor to a basket of goods. Using the Tendulkar methodology, NITI Aayog estimates that during the year 2011-12, 25.7% of population in rural areas and 13.7% in urban areas live below the poverty line. (Table 2.2.2). l T he second advance estimates for Per Capita Net National Income for the year 2017-18, at current prices is Rs. 112764 crore and Rs. 86689 crore at constant price (base year 2011-12). (Table 2.3.2). l Safe drinking water is essential for good health. As on 01.04.2018, 13,65,722 habitations were provided with safe drinking water under National Rural Drinking Water programme (Table 2.5.3). l A s on 01.04.2018, the habitations identified as affected from fluoride and arsenic were 10,379 and 16,278 respectively in the country.

Each indicator is like a piece of a puzzle contributing to an overall picture. When indicators are tracked over time, they allow us to see how the health of population is changing. This chapter provides a broad overview on the incidence and prevalence of common communicable and non-communicable diseases, morbidity & associated mortality, health risks and performance of related national health programmes in the country. It also provides an overview of reproductive and child health in the country as well as information about National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS). Communicable Diseases l Ma laria has been a problem in India for centuries. At one time a rural disease, diversified under the pressure of developments into various ecotypes. These ecotypes have been identified as forest malaria, urban malaria, rural malaria, industrial malaria, border malaria and migration malaria; the latter cutting across boundaries of various epidemiological types. In 2018, maximum number of cases and deaths due to Malaria have been reported in Chattisgarh (77,140 cases and 26 deaths). The overall prevalence of the disease has diminished in 2012 and 2013 however there is a slight increase in 2014 & 2015 and again started decreasing from 2016. [Table No. 3.1.1] l Kala-azar is the second largest parasitic killer in the world. In India Leishmania donovani is the only parasite that causes this disease. Bihar accounts for most of the cases by Kala-azar. In 2018, out of the overall reported cases of 4380 in India, 3423 cases have been reported from Bihar. [Table No. 3.1.3] l Dengue and Chikungunya transmitted by Aedes Mosquitoes are a cause of great concern to public health in India. Every year, thousands of individuals are affected and contribute to the burden of health care. Dengue outbreaks have continued since the 1950s but severity of disease has increased in the last two decades. However, the reported cases of Chikungunya in the country has shown a slight decrease from 67769 to 57813 in 2018 as compared to 2017.[Table 3.1.2] l There has been considerable decrease in the number of swine flu cases/deaths in the year 2014 as compared with 2012 & 2013. However, the number of cases and deaths has been drastically increased in the year 2015. The numbers decreased in 2016 but again increased significantly in 2017 & 2018[Table No. 3.1.28]. l The reported number of cases and deaths due to Chicken Pox in the country show a decrease from 2017 to 2018. Kerala has accounted for maximum number of cases (34785) and West Bengal has accounted for maximum number of Deaths (31) due to Chicken Pox in 2018. [Table No.3.1.29 (A) & (B)]. l Total number of Cases and Deaths due to Encephalitis were 10045 and 530 respectively in India during 2018. Assam has reported maximum numbers of Cases (5109) and maximum number of deaths (147). [Table No. 3.1.30(B)]. l Total number of Cases and Deaths due to Viral Meningitis were 13110 and 138 respectively in 2018. Uttar Pradesh accounted for maximum number of Cases (6051) and maximum number of Deaths (30) was reported in Andhra Pradesh. [Table No. 3.1.31 (B)] Since the reported Data is by and large from Government health facilities, it may have limitations in terms of its completeness as Private Medical & Health Care Institution still need to strengthen their reporting to their respective Government Health units.74 National Health Profile 2019(i) A mong the various communicable diseases reported by the States/UTs during the year 2018, the following communicable diseases accounted for the maximum percentage of cases reported :- Morbidity Reported on Major Communicable Diseases Acute Respiratory Infection, distribution of Morbidity Reported in Communicable Diseases -2018 (ii) A mong the various Communicable diseases reported by the States/UTs during the year 2018, the following communicable diseases accounted for the maximum percentage of deaths reported:- Mortality Reported on Major Communicable Diseases Pneumonia, 30.65% 7.92%Percentage distribution of Mortality Reported Communicable Diseases -201875 National Health Profile 2019(iii) C ommunicable Diseases with High Case Fatality Rate (About 1% and above) during 2018, as reported by the States/UTs.

The annual Cases and deaths due to Cholera in 1991 were 7,088 and 150, respectively which has now reduced to 651 and 6 respectively during the year 2018. (Table No. 3.1.6 (B)). (v) According to National AIDS Control Organization, 1273323 patients from 544 ART centers have ever started ART in the country till December, 2018. [Table No. 3.1.23] Non- Communicable Diseases A fter completion of 71 years of independence, our country has witnessed remarkable progress in the health status of its population. However, over the past few decades, there has been major transitions in the country that have serious impact on health. Changes have been seen in economic development, nutritional status, fertility and mortality rates and consequently, the disease profile has changed considerably. Though there have been substantial achievements in controlling communicable diseases, still they contribute significantly to disease burden of the country. Decline in morbidity and mortality from communicable diseases 76 National Health Profile 2019have been accompanied by a gradual shift to, and accelerated rise in the prevalence of, chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancers, mental health disorders and injuries. Based on available evidence from NPCDCS, out of 65194599 patients attended NCD clinics, 4.75% people are diagnosed with Diabetes, 6.19% are diagnosed with Hypertension, 0.30% are diagnosed with Cardiovascular diseases, 0.10% are diagnosed with Stroke and 0.26% are diagnosed with Common Cancers (Table 3.2.1). During the year 2015, 4,13,457 people lost their life due to accidental injuries and 1,33,623 people died because of Suicide . There were reported cases of non-fatal injuries, which resulted in lifelong disabilities for many people. [Table No. 3.2.4] Suicide rates are increasing significantly among young adults. Maximum number of Suicide Cases (44,593) is reported between the age group 30-45 Years. [Table No. 3.2.6(A),(B),(C)] Total number of disabled persons in India is 26,814,994 as per the Census 2011. [Table No. 3.2.8] Total number of cases and deaths due to snake bite are 164031 and 885 respectively in 2018. [Table No. 3.2.9 (B)]77 National Health Profile 20193.

Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are: At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to become pregnant. Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy. Postpartum amenorrheic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception. Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are: At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children. Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy. Postpartum amenorrheic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception. Women who are classified as in fecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.162 National Health Profile 20193.3.7 A naemia among Children and Women* S.

Health financing levers to move closer to universal health coverage lie in three interrelated areas: raising funds for health; reducing financial barriers to access through prepayment and subsequent pooling of funds in preference to direct out-of-pocket payments; and Allocating or using funds in a way that promotes efficiency and equity. Developments in these key health financing areas will determine whether health services exist and are available for everyone and whether people can afford to use health services when they need them. Health Finance indicators provide an understanding of patterns of investments, expenditure, sources of funding and proportion of allocation vis-\u00e0-vis other total allocations. It also provides an important tool to understand health outcomes in relation to the expenditure. l Total public expenditure on health for the year 2015-16 stood at Rs 1.4 lakh crores. (Table 4.1.1) l Per capita public expenditure on health in nominal terms has gone up from Rs 621 in 2009-10 to Rs 1112 in 2015-16. (Table 4.1.2) l Public expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP was 1.02% in 2015-16. There is no significant change in expenditure since 2009-10. (Table 4.1.2) l The Centre-State share in total public expenditure on health was 31:69 in 2015-16. (Figure 4.1.1) l Total public expenditure on health (excluding other Central Ministries) in 2015-16 was Rs 140,054 crores, with Medical and Public Health comprising the major share (78.7%). The share of Family Welfare was 12.6%. (Figure 4.1.2) l Urban and rural health services constituted 71% of the public expenditure on medical and public health in 2015-16. (Figure 4.1.3) l The North-Eastern states had the highest and EAG states (including Assam) had the lowest average per capita public expenditure on health in 2015-16 (excluding UTs). (Table 4.1.5) l The North Eastern states had the highest public health expenditure as a percentage of GSDP in 2015-16 (2.76%). The value was 1.36% for EAG Assam) and 0.76% for major non-EAG states. (Table 4.1.5) l Based on Health Survey (71st round) conducted by NSSO, Average medical expenditure incurred during stay at hospital from Jan 2013 - Jun 2014 was Rs. 14,935 for rural and Rs. 24,436 for urban in India. (Table 4.2.2(a) and Table 4.2.2(b)) l Average total medical expenditure per child birth as in patient over last 365 days (survey conducted from Jan to Jun 2014) in a public hospital in rural area is Rs. 1,587 and in urban area is Rs. 2,117. (Table 4.2.3) l Around 48 crore individuals were covered under any health insurance in the year 2017-18. This amounts to 37.2% of the total population of India. 78% of them were covered by public insurance companies. (Table 4.3.5) l Overall, 80% of all persons covered with insurance fall under Government sponsored schemes. (Table 4.3.5) l Public insurance companies had a higher share of coverage and premium for all types of health insurance policies, except family floater policies including individual policies. (Table 4.3.5) l Compared to countries that have either Universal Health Coverage or moving towards it, India's per capita public spending on health is low. (Figure 4.4.3 and Table 4.4.1)169 National Health Profile 2019Explanatory Notes on Health Data Budget Estimates (BE): The 'Budget Estimate' for any ministry or scheme is the amount allocated to it in the budget papers for the following year. For instance, in the budget speech in February 2018, the Finance Minister presented budget estimates for expenditures under various heads for the 2018-19 financial year which runs from April 2018 to March 2019. Revised Estimates (RE): Once the financial year gets underway, some ministries may need more funds than was actually allocated to them under the budget estimates. The government approaches parliament with such supplementary requests for funds during the course of the financial year (in the monsoon or winter session). These supplementary demands are reflected in the revised estimates for the current year (2016-17). Thus, along with budget estimates for 2017-18, the Finance Minister presents the revised estimates for 2016-17. Actuals: Actual expenditures are the final amounts spent under different heads and may exceed (or fall short of) the Revised Estimates. Since the actual expenditure can only be assessed once the financial year is over and final accounts have been prepared, the Actual expenditures presented in the budget papers are for the earlier financial year i.e. for the year 2015-16. 1.

Availability of adequate number of human resources with suitable skill mix and their appropriate deployment at different levels of health care set-up are essential for providing an effective health care services for the population. In many developing countries, such as India, information on human resources in the health sector is incomplete and unreliable. This prevents effective workforce planning and management. National Health Profile aims to address this deficit by producing a more complete picture of India's health workforce. Human Resource indicators provide an overview of availability of trained and specialized medical, nursing and paramedical personnel in the country. These also give an idea regarding regional distribution and disparities. Human Resource indicators cover the details of allopathic doctors, dental surgeons, Ayush doctors, nursing personnel and various paramedical health man- power in the country. l Number of Registered allopathic doctors possessing recognized medical qualifications (under MCI Act) and registered with state medical council for the years 2017 and 2018 were 43,581 and 41,371 respectively. At present average population served by Government Allopathic Doctor is 10,926 number of persons served per allopathic doctor.

Best known as the AYUSH, its main focus is on holistic health and well-being of humans. Over the years with gaining popularity, there is a steady rise in total number of registered AYUSH Doctors in India from 7,73,668 in 2017 to 7,99,879 in 2018.

Situation becomes more complex by the fact that around 70% of Indian population lives in rural areas known for limited access to healthcare. The primary providers of healthcare in these areas are private clinics and hospitals, though there is a presence of Government funded public health services. While government has undertaken multiple initiatives to address the concern for service delivery and access to healthcare, there are still substantial gaps to be addressed for better healthcare infrastructure, access and its equity based distribution. At this outset, government realizes that effective health resource management, allocation and monitoring based on evidence for timely achievements of goals. There is need of comprehensive picture of Indian healthcare sector to address aforesaid challenges and provide accessible, acceptable, affordable, equity based and patient centered quality healthcare services for the community. There are constraints on public health resources therefore, it is essential to allocate resources based on real world data and do regular monitoring and impact assessment of the allocated resources. Recognizing the role of private health sector in Indian settings and its potential to supplement government initiatives and planning for public health resources, it has been felt to obtain reliable information on private sector healthcare resource deployment. This will also underpin government strategies to hitherto unreached segments of the population, where public health resources are constrained, potential to tie up with private sector can be explored for better service delivery. For resource constraint country such as India, having comprehensive information on both public and private health sector is prerequisite for planning resource allocation. Generation and adoption of such evidence will help in driving judicious health resource planning and allocation to reduce the disparities and inequities in all three dimensions to achieve the Universal Health Coverage. CBHI is committed to build an integrated health informatics platform which can provide reliable, accurate and relevant national health information and enable evidence based policy formulation and decision making. In line with the core strategies of generating evidence to facilitate rational planning and resource allocation, CBHI has embarked on an ambitious project to exhaustively map the healthcare establishments from both public and private sector, as one of its key initiatives. CBHI now envisages setting up of consolidated platform of healthcare resource information named National Health Resource Repository (NHRR) to fulfill its core objective & intends to develop a single source of healthcare resource information that contains information on healthcare resources of both public and private sector in the country. Acknowledging the relevance of evidence based health resource planning, CBHI in consultation with DGHS conducted a pilot study of the concept in 2014 to test the feasibility of the concept called NHRR. A street-by-street census was conducted to collect and comprehensively map 2098 public and private health facilities across four districts on 22nd September, 2015, recognizing the relevance of data as 296 National Health Profile 2019a navigating module for planning public health services, Shri.J P Nadda, Hon'ble Union Minister of Health & FW, announced the nation wise roll out of National Health Resource Repository. Vision Creating a robust, standardized and secured information technology enabled repository of country's healthcare resources befitting as a building block into country's long term strategy of digitalizing healthcare to strengthen evidence based decision making. Goal NHRR envisages creating a single gateway of authentic, standardized, updated public and private healthcare resource intelligence and develop user friendly system with utility to serve as a decision making tool for varied categories of health system stakeholders. Objectives It has been mandated to achieve the following objectives Promote evidence based planning and decision making in healthcare sector through provision of comprehensive data on healthcare resources (both public and private sector) in the country. Provide visibility of private sector healthcare resources to facilitate public private partnership initiatives for improve access and availability of health services Provide technology based solutions to improve efficiency of health systems by improving planning, provisioning of healthcare resources Improve informed decision making and community awareness by allowing access to holistic information on healthcare resources. Promote meaningful use of data collection and exchange services for better healthcare management by providing a common platform for sharing information. Promote convergence between similar programmes by providing interoperability Enhance effectiveness of programme planning and implementation at centre, state and district level by providing updated healthcare resource status. Provide a platform for managing emergencies effectively by providing information on all the healthcare resources (public & private) in the designated geography. Furnish standardized data, distribution of resources and trends on the global platform, using regularly updated health status indicators. Rationale from NHRR Stakeholders and users perspectives Decision making in the healthcare sector is highly complex and have different levels ranges from single patient to country's policy makers at large. Stakeholders in health system range from single patient, community, providers, professional bodies, health Councils, various professional bodies, State, Central government and various development agencies etc It was comprehended that envisaged NHRR should be able to cater the requirements of all stakeholders. Considering relevance and classification of data to be captured under NHRR, all stakeholders can be divided into four categories- Policy Makers, National & State Programme Managers, community and Private Providers. NHRR aims to support decision making of all these stakeholders by providing reliable information, thereby, catering to the unmet needs of these stakeholders. Needs of Policy Makers: It is important that larger policy decisions are taken based on latest and reliable information on the available healthcare resources, their deployment and trends that can address entrenched problem of health system with real time solutions. To aid this, health policy 297 National Health Profile 2019and system planning must be demand-driven, and satisfy the needs of modern healthcare systems utilizing up-do-date information on country's healthcare resources. Needs of National and State Programme Managers Program planning involves identifying and projecting most critical needs of the different programme and community and by analyzing their existing ability to address those requirements. National and State Programme Managers draw their implementation plan keeping in consideration the gap analysis and priorities, presenting the case to higher -ups, executing the plan and evaluating the outcome of the efforts, and reporting that outcome back to partners, stakeholders, and to policy makers. Needs of Community: Community is a major stakeholder in the healthcare system where all the planning, decisions, services and provisions get concentrated, and eventually are the beneficiary of healthcare services and related interventions. In the current scenario, it is widely advocated that role of the community should not only be limited to recipient of services but it should also have community participation in decision making. Community decision making primarily involves decision making at two level; individual level and community at large. Information on availability, and affordability of health services influence access to health services. Needs of Private Providers: Private providers constitute a significant part of the health system in India which ranges from single providers to corporate hospitals. Private provider behavior is influenced by the interplay of policy-makers who set policy, enact legislation and enforce regulations. Similarly, it is also affected by purchasing power of populations and providers' experience, skills and motivations to deal with patient, government and their competitor. However, focusing on coverage, quality, cost, along with policy-makers, providers and people, serves as a helpful aide-memoire for private providers to organize their service better and eventually leading to service improvement. Data Variables A Census at national level for health resource enumeration is going on to obtain data from all public and private health facilities (with geo- coordinates) of 29 States and 7 Union Territories, all the districts across the country. All the public health facilities including District Hospitals, Sub-Divisional Hospital, Taluka-Community Health Centre, Primary Health Centre, Sub Centre, other government hospitals and private hospitals, private doctors, diagnostic labs and chemists present nationwide shall be covered in the Census.298 National Health Profile 2019(E) 2018 Health SDG Profile : India 299 National Health Profile 2019 300 National Health Profile 2019 301 National Health Profile 2019 302 National Health Profile 2019(F) National Health Policy The primary aim of the National Health Policy, 2017, is to inform, clarify, strengthen and prioritize the role of the Government in shaping health systems in all its dimensions- investments in health, organization of healthcare services, prevention of diseases and promotion of good health through cross sectoral actions, access to technologies, developing human resources, encouraging medical pluralism, building knowledge base, developing better financial protection strategies, strengthening regulation and health assurance. Goal The policy envisages as its goal the attainment of the highest possible level of health and wellbeing for all at all ages, through a preventive and promotive health care orientation in all developmental policies, and universal access to good quality health care services without anyone having to face financial hardship as a consequence. This would be achieved through increasing access, improving quality and lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.

Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, launched PMSMA on 04-November-2016. PMSMA guarantees a minimum package of antenatal care services to women in their 2nd / 3rd trimesters of pregnancy at designated government health facilities. PMSMA is based on the promise \u2014 that if every pregnant woman in India is examined by a physician and appropriately investigated at least once during the PMSMA and then appropriately followed up \u2014 the process can result in reduction in the number of maternal and neonatal deaths in our country. 3. National Health Mission The National Health Mission (NHM) encompasses its two Sub-Missions, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the newly launched National Urban Health Mission (NUHM). The main programmatic components include Health System Strengthening in rural and urban areas- Reproductive-Maternal- Neonatal-Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A), and Communicable and Non-Communicable Diseases. The NHM envisages achievement of universal access to equitable, affordable & quality health care services that are accountable and responsive to people's needs. 3.1 National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) (2005) National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in April 2005 and it morphed into National Health Mission (NHM) with launch of National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) during 2013. Thereafter, NRHM and NUHM became two sub-missions under the overarching NHM. NRHM seeks to provide equitable, affordable and quality health care to the rural population, especially the vulnerable groups. Under the NRHM, the Empowered Action Group (EAG) States as well as North Eastern States, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh have been given special focus. The thrust of the mission is on establishing a fully functional, community owned, decentralized health delivery system with inter-sectoral convergence at all levels, to ensure simultaneous action on a wide range of determinants of health such as water, sanitation, education, nutrition, social and gender equality. Institutional integration within the fragmented health sector was expected to provide a focus on outcomes, measured against Indian Public Health Standards for all health facilities. 3.2 National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) (2013) The National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) as a sub-mission of National Health Mission (NHM) was approved by the Cabinet on 1st May 2013. NUHM envisages to meet health care needs of the urban population with the focus on urban poor, by making available to them essential primary health care services and reducing their out of pocket expenses for treatment. NUHM would endeavour to achieve its goal through:- i) Need based city specific urban health care system to meet the diverse health care needs of the urban poor and other vulnerable sections. ii) Institutional mechanism and management systems to meet the health-related challenges of a rapidly growing urban population. iii) Partnership with community and local bodies for a more proactive involvement in planning, implementation, and monitoring of health activities. iv) Availability of resources for providing essential primary health care to urban poor. v) Partnerships with NGOs, for profit and not for profit health service providers and other stakeholders. It would primarily focus on slum dwellers and other marginalized groups like rickshaw pullers, street vendors,railway and bus station coolies, homeless people, street children, construction site workers. 4.
