It includes background information as well as a range of questions regarding the identified policy options for cooperation on HTA on EU level and possible impacts. As a member of the expert group established for the duration of this project we kindly invite you to respond to these questions to support us in ensuring the quality, feasibility and relevance of the policy options on HTA cooperation. The document is structured in 4 parts: 1. Backgro und information to this study 2. Description on baseline scenario and related questions 3. Information on policy options and related questions 4. Questions regarding impacts for assessing the policy options Background information The European Commission (EC) is e xploring options for a new, sustainable mechanism for HTA in Europe after 2020. Consequently, the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) of the European Commission started an impact assessment process and launched a public consultation o n 21 October 2016 (1). In the framework of this process, the EC commissioned the consortium of Sogeti, the Austrian Public Health Institute (G\u00d6 FP) and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE Health) to conduct an impact analysis of pol icy options for strengthened EU cooperation on HTA in order to support the Impact Assessment process of the EC with data and evidence . Possible policy options for cooperation on HTA on EU level have been identified within the Inception Impact Assessment published by the EC (2). These are further developed by the Commission in the course of the study and expert input is required to ensure th eir validity and reliability. In the course of the study a systematic literature review as well as a desk research of HTA and its use in EU Member States will be performed. A detailed case study covering 40 health technologies including pharmaceuticals, m edical devices and other technologies (such as screening programs) will be conducted to assess the status quo. Data for this case study will be retrieved by literature review and an additional survey process to complement information retrieved. Moreover, data will be collected to assess the impacts that the different possible implementation mechanisms for the five policy options in question (so called business models) will have on all relevant stakeholder groups. Data collection will be performed by a thor ough literature research as well as a survey addressing all stakeholder groups. We like to emphasize that the data collection will be from a public health perspective focusing on facts and figures to underpin the different policy options, not on opinions of any stakeholder group.

This status quo is characterized by - a heterogeneous situation regarding the relevance of HTA in the national decision making processes; - strictly voluntary cooperation between the European Commission and the EU Member States through (1) Joint Actions (Scientific and t echnical - developing methodologies and tool and performing joint assessments) and (2) HTA Network (providing strategic guidance). - No guarantees that any joint output is taken up in national HTA activities. Planned Work until 2020 - expected outcomes The general objective of the EUnetHTA Joint Action 3 (2016 - 2020) is to support voluntary cooperation at scientific and technical level between Health Technology Assessment Bodies to validate the model for joint work to be continued after EU funding under the Health Programme. The cooperation between national and regional HTA Bodies is to meet the provisions set out by Article 15 of Directive 2011/24/EU1 on patient's right in cross -border healthcare and to create synergy with the strategic HTA Network set up under this Directive. The Joint Action 3 is aiming to establish an inventory on the available methodological documents and tools and, consequently, identifying gaps and adjusting or maintaining existing guidelines and tools. Moreover, all tools should be integrated in an Online Handbook for HTA -Doers, early dialogue communication should be provided and a tool for post -launch evidence generation and a prioritisation process for the topics of Joint Assessments should be developed. In EUnetHTA Joint Actio n 3 a higher number of joint production work, than in the last Joint Actions; namely 51 Joint Assessments (3) (33 on pharmaceuticals and 18 on other technologies) and 29 so called \"Collaborative Assessments \"(4) (4 on pharmaceuticals and 25 on other technolo gies) are planned. Until 2020 the Joint Action is financed by the 3rd Health Programme and Member States' contributions in kind. A new Joint Action is not foreseen, as it is a mechanism that should pilot new cooperation mechanisms, but not fund them on a long term. Therefore, it is anticipated that after expiration, and without further EU action, Member States would depend solely on their national/regional HTA procedures and budgets. Although Member States will be free to cooperate regarding HTA it is not sure on what scale joint work might continue. Questions addressing the Baseline Scenario: (3) A Joint Assessment is defined as a prioritized topic, submission -based (using the submission templates as were developed in EUnetHTA JA2), an authorin g team of 2 -3 agencies and at least 5 dedicated reviewers, English as working language, use of HTA Core Model and Guidelines, EUnetHTA procedures on stakeholder involvement (scoping meeting with manufacturer etc.), internal and external quality assurance. A Joint Assessment can be a REA or a Full HTA. (4) A collaborative assessment is defined by a lower level of centralized work organization, but equal criteria in quality assura nce: the collaborative assessments shall include at least 3 -5 partners, howeve r in justified cases two partners would be acceptable. Such constitutes a less centralised topic selection/priority selection process. English as working language, use of HTA Core Model and Guidelines, not necessarily submission based, internal QA by revie w by at least 2 other EUnetHTA partners (support by WP 4) + QA by external peer review, stakeholder involvement at 1 point in time (further criteria to be agreed upon). Study on impact analysis of Policy Options for strengthened EU cooperation on Health Technology Assessment (HTA) 4 1) Are you missing important aspects in the description of the Baseline Scenario? If yes, please state them shortly: 2) If there is no further financing by the EU a fter 2020, do you expect that the EU cooperation work will continue? 3) If yes, on what scale? Do you expect the following outputs to be produced through a MS-driven cooperation? Outputs Yes Partly (please elaborate) No Maintenance of common tools and procedures Performing joint Early Dialogues Performing joint Relative Effectiveness Assessments (5) Performing joint Full Health Technology Assessments (6) (5) REA can take place at time of market access, or later (re -assessment) (6) Full HT A can take place at time of market access, or later (re -assessment) Study on impact analysis of Policy Options for strengthened EU cooperation on Health Technology Assessment (HTA) 5 Key characteristics of policy options for cooperation on HTA after 2020 The diff erent policy options for cooperation on HTA after 2020 are defined along several key characteristics focusing on 1. HTA output, 2. participation and uptake organizational aspects, 3. organizational aspects, 4. funding aspects as well as 5. timelines. These are described in the following. 1) The scope of the cooperation is defined by several outputs (7) produced in joint collaboration, comprising: Maintenance of common tools and procedures, incl. common submission templates, an IT system with planned and ong oing assessments, common methodologies (e.g EUnetHTA Core Model), a joint prioritization process, and cooperation regarding data requirements and Horizon Scanning Performing joint Early Dialogues Performing joint Relative Effectiveness Assessments ( REA ca n take place at time of market access, or later (re -assessment) Performing joint Full Health Technology Assessments ( Full HTA can take place at time of market access, or later (re -assessment)) 2) The engagement in participation and uptake (8) of jointly pr oduced outputs can be either voluntary or mandatory : voluntary participation/ voluntary uptake (V/V) : both participating in the production of outputs and uptake of the respective output is entirely voluntary voluntary participation/mandatory uptake (V/M) : the participation in the production of joint work is voluntary, meaning that Member States can decide to opt -in(9) to the joint cooperation. However, once a Member State has opted -in the uptake of the joint work into the national setting is mandatory mandatory participation/mandatory uptake (M/M) : both participation in the production of outputs and the uptake of these into the national setting are mandatory For each of the policy options different combinations of voluntary or mandatory participation and uptake per output are possible. (7) The scope of the activities may differ for pharmaceuticals, medical devices and other technologies. (8) Please note that Up -take concerns the using or considering of the results and fi ndings of the HTA cooperation, reaching from jointly developed submission templates to outcomes in full HTA. The subsequent pricing and reimbursement decision remains purely on national level. Also providers / developers need to adhere to this process. (9) Opt-in by MS is by output, not by individual products e.g. once a MS has opted in for joint REA, they take part in all joint REAs - but not necessarily as an author. Study on impact analysis of Policy Options for strengthened EU cooperation on Health Technology Assessment (HTA) 6 3) For organizing the production of these joint HTA outputs a number of different implementation mechanism are conceivable: Project based cooperation : there is voluntary cooperation, but no permanent coordination mechanism (i.e. Secretariat). MS secretariat (rotating): a permanent Secretariat is established, which will be rotating between the Member States. Existing EU agency : a permanent Secretariat is integrated in in an already existing EU agency. This Secretariat will c oordinate the work of national experts in HTA bodies, to carry out the assessments. New EU agency: a permanent Secretariat is integrated in a NEW EU agency. This Secretariat will coordinate the work of national experts in HTA bodies, to carry out the asse ssments. 4) For financing the joint cooperation several funding mechanisms are conceivable: EU funding, either through Public Health program or another financial instrument Funding by Member States joining the collaboration Funding through industry fees 5) Timelines : Timelines for implementation of the proposed policy options post 2020 reach from immediately, without delay, for option 1 (i.e. 2021) to appropriate transitional periods for implementing options 4 or 5 in a new legal framework). Table 1 provides an overview of each policy option and th e envisaged implementation funding mechanism. A short summary for each policy option can be found afterwards. Please note that the final policy option does not have to be exactly one that was presented but it c an combine elements. (E.g. It is possible to have option X, but combine it with the implementation model of option Y.) So at this point it needs to be ensured that 5 policy options cover all elements (e.g. all feasible implementation models should be cover ed), in a combination that is logical.

Consequently, the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) of the European Commission started an impact assessment process. In the framework of this process, the EC commissioned the consortium of Sogeti, the Austrian Public Health Institute (G\u00d6 FP) and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE Health) to provide data and evidence to identify the impact of policy options for strengthened EU cooperation on HTA in order to support the Impact Assessment process of the EC . This survey is part of the data collection process, which focuses on the insights of key stakeholders (HTA bodies, healthcare providers, public healthcare payers and competen t authorities as well as patients/consumers). There is an additional version of the survey for completion by industry stakeholders. Aim We would like you to assess, from your perspective, the potential impacts of different policy options for strengthened EU cooperation on HTA after 2020. Outline of the questionnaire The survey is split into four parts: Part 1 : General questions on your institution. Part 2: Questions regarding the costs incurred as a result of the HTA process Part 3: Information about t he preliminary policy options. Assessment of possible impacts of 5 policy options (scenarios) for strengthened EU cooperation on HTA after 2020 Part 4: Indicating your option with regard to the relevance of defined impacts and scope How we will process th e information you provide The results will be gathered and clustered and will finally feed into a Multi -Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model. The MCDA is a method, based on mathematical algorithms, for evaluating individual, often conflicting, criteria. The criteria are then combined into one matrix for general assessment to help decision -makers consider multiple conflicting factors, or \"impacts\", in a rational and consistent manner. The objective of the MCDA is to identify policy options which take into account the preferences of the involved stakeholders as well as account for the conflicting nature of related impacts. Confidentiality clause We would like to assure you that the European Commission's statuary obligation of confidentiality is in place. The final report will only present aggregated or anonymized data. If you include confidential information/business secrets, please clearly identify/mark the section; non -marked sections are assumed to be not confidential.

Please read carefully through the short description of each policy option in order to understand the scope of the questions asked in part 3. Key characteristics The diff erent policy options for cooperation on HTA after 2020 are defined along several key characteristics focusing on 1. HTA output, 2. Participation and uptake from Member States' perspectives, 3. Organizational aspects, 4. Funding aspects as well as 5. Timeli nes. These are explained in the following: 1) The scope of the cooperation is defined by several outputs (14) created by a joint collaboration, comprising of: Common tools and procedures, including common submission templates, an IT system with planned an d ongoing assessments, common methodologies (e.g EUnetHTA Core Model), a joint prioritization process, and cooperation on data requirements, including Horizon Scanning Performing joint Early Dialogues Performing joint Relative Effectiveness Assessments ( REA can take place at time of market launch, or later (re -assessment)) Performing joint Full Health Technology Assessments ( Full HTA can take place at time of market launch, or later (re -assessment)) 2) The engagement in participation and uptake (15) of joi ntly produced outputs can be either voluntary or mandatory : (14) The scope of the activities may differ between pharmaceuticals, medical devices and other technologies. Please note : For assessing the impacts of the various options and the various implementation mechanisms /business models, fine-tuned options were created within the course of the study. These combine the options with the implementation mechanisms (f or details see below). The fine -tuned options in this section are provisional. They are merely examples of the possible combinations of the IIA options with the IIA implementation mechanisms that were developed in order to facilitate the analysis. In any event, they do not represent the preferred combinations of the European Commission nor the contractor and other combinations are possible. Furthermore, the policy options may need to be revised following the input of Member States and stakeholders through public consultation and discussions. The final policy option does not have to be exactly in line with one that was analysed, but it can combine elements. (E.g. it is possible to have option X, but combine it with the implementation mechanism of option Y.) Study on impact analysis of Policy Options for strengthened EU cooperation on Health Technology Assessment (HTA) 28 Voluntary participation/ voluntary uptake (V/V) : Member States can decide if they wish to participate in the production of outputs and take up the respective output; cooperation is entirely volun tary. Voluntary participation/mandatory uptake (V/M) : The participation in the creation of joint work is voluntary, meaning that Member States can decide to opt -in(16) to the joint cooperation. However, once a Member State has opted -in the uptake of the jo int work into the national setting is mandatory. Mandatory participation/mandatory uptake (M/M) : Both participation in the production of outputs and the uptake of these into the national setting are mandatory. For each of the policy options, different com binations of voluntary or mandatory participation and uptake per Output are possible. 3) For organizing the creation of these joint HTA outputs a number of different organizational mechanisms are conceivable: Project based cooperation : The secretariat is set up by the Member States that participate (similar to EUnetHTA). EU/MS secretariat: A permanent Secretariat is established. Existing EU agency : A permanent Secretariat is integrated in an already existing EU agency. This Secretariat will coordinate the work of national experts in HTA bodies in carrying out the assessments. New EU agency: A permanent Secretariat is integrated in a NEW EU agency. This Secretariat will coordinate the work of national experts in HTA bodies in carrying out the assessments. 4) For financing the joint cooperation several funding mechanisms are conceivable: EU funding, either through a Public Health program or another financial instrument Funding by Member States joining the collaboration Funding through industry fees 5) Timelines : Timelines for implementation of the proposed policy options after 2020 range from immediately, without delay, for option 1 (i.e. 2021) to transitional periods for implementing options 4 or 5 in a new legal framework). Table 4 provides an overview of each policy option and the envisaged implementation/funding mechanism. A short summary for each policy option can be found afterwards. (15) Please note that Up -take concerns using or considering the results and findings of the HTA cooperation, reaching from jointly developed submission templates to outcomes in full HTA. The subsequent pricing and reimbursement decision would remain purely on national level. Also providers / developers need to adhere to this process. (16) Opt-in by MS is by output, not by individual products e.g. once a MS has opted in for joint REA, they take part in all joint REAs - but not necessarily as an author.

Please be sure you want to submit the questionnaire, once submitted answers cannot be altered! Thank you very much for participating and filling in the questionnaire! 42 Annex 4: Industry Questionnaire Introduction to the survey Purpose of the survey The European Commission (EC) is exploring and assessing options for a new and sustainable mechanism for Health Technology Assessment (HTA) in Europe after 20 20. Consequently, the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) of the European Commission started an impact assessment process. In the framework of this process, the EC commissioned the consortium of Sogeti, the Austrian Public Health Institute (G\u00d6 FP) and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE Health) to provide data and evidence to identify the impact of policy options for strengthened EU cooperation on HTA in order to support the Impact Assessment process of the EC . This survey is part of the data collection process, which focuses on the insights of key stakeholders, and is to be completed by industry stakeholders. There is an additional version of the survey for completion by non -industry stakeholders, in particul ar public bodies. Aim We would like you to assess, from your perspective, the potential impacts of different policy options for strengthened EU cooperation on HTA after 2020. Outline of the questionnaire The survey is split into four parts: Part 1 : General questions. Part 2: Questions regarding the costs incurred as a result of the HTA process. Part 3: Information about the (preliminary) policy options. Assessment of possible impacts of 5 policy options (scenarios) for strengthened EU cooperation on H TA after 2020. Part 4: Your assessment on how relevant the defined impacts and scope are. How we will process the information you provide The results will be gathered and clustered and will finally feed into a Multi -Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) mode l. The MCDA is a method, based on mathematical algorithms, for evaluating individual, often conflicting, criteria. The criteria are then combined into one matrix for general assessment to help decision -makers consider multiple conflicting factors, or \"impa cts\", in a rational and consistent manner. The objective of the MCDA is to identify policy options which take into account the preferences of the involved stakeholders as well as account for the conflicting nature of related impacts. General instructions If your company is a subsidiary of another company, we recommend that the questionnaire is transferred to the ultimate parent company for completion of the questionnaire for all subsidiaries. 43 Confidentiality clause We would like to assure you that the E uropean Commission's statuary obligation of confidentiality is in place. The final report will only present aggregated or anonymized data. If you include confidential information/business secrets, please clearly identify/mark the section; non -marked secti ons are assumed not to be confidential. A non -confidential version is also welcome. According to the framework contract with the consortium, the European Commission may request the data gathered by the contractor.

Supplement to randomised controlled trial: C. Practical clinical trials: D. Registry data: E. Electronic health recor ds/medical chart review: F. Administrative data: G. Other please specify: For the purpose of this survey additional evidence generation is defined as follows : Generation of additional clinical evidence refers to all studies and provision of data in additi on to clinical studies performed for marketing authorization within the course of an HTA process For the purpose of this survey h ealth survey is defined as follows : Health surveys are designed to collect descriptions of health status and well -being, health -care utilization, treatment patterns, and health -care expenditures from patients, providers, or individuals in the general population, which are representative of the target population. Health surveys are methodologically rigorous, for example, relying on complex sample survey designs. 49 For the purpose of this survey s upplement to randomised controlled trial is defined as follows: To provide additional data alongside standard clinically focused randomized controlled trials, researchers often gather informa tion on variables such as patient reported outcomes, medical resource use, and costs. Such efforts can add valuable evidence on treatment patterns for common events, e.g., such as the doses of drugs used to treat rejection in kidney transplantation For the purpose of this survey practical clinical trials is defined as follows : practical or pragmatic clinical trials (also called large simple trials) involve prospective, randomized assignment but are aimed at larger, more diverse real world populations. Pract ical or pragmatic clinical trials have the important strength of randomization, which minimizes bias in the estimation of treatment effects. These trials are by design larger than conventional randomized controlled trials. For this reason, they are more li kely to have sufficient power to capture significant differences in key outcomes of interest, such as hospitalizations. For the purpose of this survey registry data is defined as follows : Registries are prospective, observational cohort studies of patient s who have a particular disease and/or are receiving a particular treatment or intervention. They can be used for understanding natural history, assessing or monitoring real world safety and effectiveness, assessing quality of care and provider performance , and assessing cost - effectiveness For the purpose of this survey administrative data is defined as follows : administrative data (typically retrospective or real -time, if possible) are collected primarily for reimbursement, but contain some clinical diagno sis and procedure use with detailed information on charges. Claims databases lend themselves to retrospective longitudinal and cross -sectional analyses of clinical and economic outcomes at patient, group, or population level. For the purpose of this survey electronic health records/medical chart reviews is defined as follows : electronic health records/medical chart reviews , such as the UK General Practice Research Database, contain more detailed, longitudinal information including disease -specific symptoms at the personal level and should greatly expand the use of this type of information. Q.9. What are the costs (on average) for generating additional evidence on non -clinical domains? Definition Non -clinial domains ( Please see EUnetHTA core model ): Costs and economic evaluation; Ethical analysis; Organizational aspects; Patients and Social aspects; Legal aspects) Q10: Please give us an example where additional evidence was required over the past five years and state the associated costs: A. Health Technology for which additional evidence was required: B. Indication for which this Health technology is used: C. Type of additional evidence requested: D. Costs for this additional evidence: 50 Q11: Which countries were more likely to request additional evidence? Please refer to your experience over the past five years Q12: Did the additional evidence requested by the country, result in: A. Supplementary submission a. Yes b. No B. Re-submission a. Yes b. No C. Withdrawal of submission a. Yes b. No D. What was the impact on costs? a. Staff b. HTA related costs c. Real word evidence generation E. What was the impact on the time until the final HTA report was available? Q13: Have any of your products undergone a re -assessment? If yes, please indicate how much extra costs it incurred (in Euros). a. Yes b. No 51 Part 3: Information about the preliminary policy options on HTA cooperation after 2020 In this section, we provide you with key information to assess the impact of the different preliminary policy options. Please read carefully through the short description of each policy option in order to understand the scope of the questions asked in Section 3. Key characteristics The different policy options for cooperation on HTA after 2020 are defined along several key characteristics focusing on 1. HTA output, 2. Participation and uptake from Member States' perspectives, 3. Organizational aspects, 4. Funding aspects as well as 5. Timelines. These are explained i n the following: 1) The scope of the cooperation is defined by several outputs (22) created by a joint collaboration, comprising of: Common tools and procedures, including common submission templates, an IT system with planned and ongoing assessments, com mon methodologies (e.g EUnetHTA Core Model), a joint prioritization process, and cooperation on data requirements, including Horizon Scanning Performing joint Early Dialogues Performing joint Relative Effectiveness Assessments ( REA can take place at time of market launch, or later (re -assessment)) Performing joint Full Health Technology Assessments ( Full HTA can take place at time of market launch, or later (re -assessment)) 2) The engagement in participation and uptake (23) of jointly produced outputs can be either voluntary or mandatory : (22) The scope of the activities may diffe r between pharmaceuticals, medical devices and other technologies. Please note : For the purpose of assessing the impacts of the various options and the various implementation mechanisms /business models, fine -tuned options were created within the course of the study. These combine the options with the implementation mec hanisms (for details see below). The fine -tuned options in this section are provisional. They are merely examples of the possible combinations of the IIA options with the IIA implementation mechanisms that were developed in order to facilitate the analysi s. In any event, they do not represent the preferred combinations of the European Commission nor the contractor and other combinations are possible. Furthermore, the policy options may need to be revised following the input of Member States and stakeholder s through public consultation and discussions. The final policy option does not have to be exactly in line with one that was analysed, but it can combine elements. (E.g. it is possible to have option X, but combine it with the implementation mechanism of o ption Y.) 52 Voluntary participation/ voluntary uptake (V/V) : Member States can decide if they wish to participate in the production of outputs and take up the respective output; cooperation is entirely voluntary. Voluntary particip ation/mandatory uptake (V/M) : The participation in the creation of joint work is voluntary, meaning that Member States can decide to opt -in24 to the joint cooperation. However, once a Member State has opted -in the uptake of the joint work into the national setting is mandatory. Mandatory participation/mandatory uptake (M/M) : Both participation in the production of outputs and the uptake of these into the national setting are mandatory. For each of the policy options, different combinations of voluntary or mandatory participation and uptake per Output are possible. 3) For organizing the creation of these joint HTA outputs a number of different organizational mechanisms are conceivable: Project based cooperation : The secretariat is set up by the Member States that participate (similar to EUnetHTA). EU/MS secretariat: A permanent Secretariat is established. Existing EU agency : A permanent Secretariat is integrated in an already existing EU agency. This Secretariat will coordinate the work of national experts i n HTA bodies in carrying out the assessments. New EU agency: A permanent Secretariat is integrated in a NEW EU agency. This Secretariat will coordinate the work of national experts in HTA bodies in carrying out the assessments. 4) For financing the join t cooperation several funding mechanisms are conceivable: EU funding, either through a Public Health program or another financial instrument Funding by Member States joining the collaboration Funding through industry fees 5) Timelines : Timelines for imple mentation of the proposed policy options after 2020 range from immediately, without delay, for option 1 (i.e. 2021) to transitional periods for implementing options 4 or 5 in a new legal framework). Table 1 provides an overview of each policy option and t he envisaged implementation/funding mechanism. A short summary for each policy option can be found afterwards. (23) Please note that Up -take concerns using or considering the results and findings of the HTA cooperation, reaching from jointly developed submission templates to outcomes in full HTA. The subsequent pricing and reimbursement decision would remain purely on national level. Also providers / developers need to adhere to this process. (24) Opt-in by MS is by output, not by individual products e.g. once a MS has opted in for joint REA, they take part in all joint REAs - but not necessarily as an author. 53 Table 5: Overview of Policy Options (25) Assuming that 50% of the Member States participate, a mix between high/low income, large/small MS . (26) Early Dialogue: Here mandatory uptake means that the MS cannot repeat an ED that was done at EU level. Technology providers initiate Early Dialogue s. (27) Either at time of market or re -assessment (28) A gradual introduction of products during a transitory period that allows to manage the workload while the structures/impleme ntation model are being developed.

The survey is part of a \"Study on impact analysis of policy options for strengthened EU cooperation on HTA\" (\"the study\") - run by the Austrian P ublic Health Institute (GO FP) and the London School of Economics on behalf of DG SANTE/CHAFEA . The following companies were represented : Biogen International GmbH Johnson & Johnson Pfizer Novo Nordisk Region Europe Pharmaceuticals A/S Eli Lilly & Co CelgenE Teva F. Giorgio, N.Orsi, C. Larsson Lindqvist, K. Valkova, N. Suleiman The Austrian Public Health Institute (GO -FP): Anja Laschkolnig London School of Economic (LSE): Panos Kanavos, Erica Visintin Purpose of the meeting Discussion, interpretation and validation of the survey results with industry experts regarding costs and impacts of the policy options. Discussion General observations Industry part icipants agreed that the results of the survey are useful to understand preferences of the pharma industry regarding the HTA policy options. The survey results should however not be over -interpreted as precise quantifications of the impacts (e.g. EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY Directorate B - Health systems, medical products and innovation Unit B4 - Medical pro ducts: quality, safety, innovation 71 cost incr eases by x%). The survey results should rather be taken as a general indication of trends. The respondents also noted that exact quantification of certain impacts has been difficult as many factors had to be taken into consideration for one indicator. Also the impacts will depend on how the policy options would be implemented and for some participants this was not defined sufficiently when answering the questionnaire. To compensate for the above limitations, it was recommended to triangulate the results with additional data sources and complement by the outcome of the focus group discussion. DG SANTE clarified that the online survey is one part of the data gathering exercise to support the analysis of the impacts of the policy options. The survey is further supported by the literature review and a set of case studies. In addition, it was also clarified that the study is one input to the impact assessment process along with the results of the public consultation, the outcome of the ongoing additional stakehol ders' consultation and further data gathering which is currently ongoing via additional studies which aim to map processes and procedures of HTA systems across the EU. Largely, the representatives of pharma companies expressed a preference for policy options 4.1 and 4.2. Both of them having provisions for a centralised REA with a varying degree of uptake - respectively voluntary participation and mandatory uptake; and mandatory participation and uptake. The stated reasoning was that pharmaceutical companie s could use the results from an EU -wide REA as supporting the various pricing and reimbursement discussions which normally follow the HTA process and these options would further increase the business predictability across Member States providing for a better investment as well as research and innovation environment. Participants expressed strong concerns towards policy option 5. As option it is considered to bring the most substantial (structural) changes by moving decisions from the local towards EU leve l. They agreed that a joint European full HTA is not feasible due to the specificities, e.g. in the organisational care or economic domains and so policy option 5 would lead to a duplication of demands for pharmaceutical companies - first at EU level, and then at national level, in the cases where Member States do not find the EU demands sufficient enough. This leads to duplications and even higher unpredictability, which strongly affects the responses to all indicators. EC1 Costs The participants confirme d that the general trend for costs is plausible. Discussing the results for policy option 2 to 4 the industry representatives explained that they do not expect any significant changes in their current costs, yet the overall consistency of HTA processes and outcomes would increase resulting in better business predictability having positive effects on investment as well as research and innovation. The participants explained that they usually prepare a central/global value dossier for each product. This dossi er is then used as a main source of input by the HTA teams across the countries where the products is foreseen to be launched. One estimation was that a joint HTA report could replace 20 -25% of the local HTA costs if there is no requirement for translation /adaptation. At the same time, even if there is an EU - centralised REA at the time of market launch, companies would still have to go through national reimbursement procedures. While this could result in a reduction of some costs (see above), the companies would still have significant and possibly increased expenditure for the national requirements, which are outside the EU cooperation (eg \"economic evaluation\"). That is why industry believes that the increases and decreases in costs would just balance each other out. Furthermore, it was explained that today there are certain risks when performing evidence generation. Should the company align to the market that requires the highest level of evidence or can a lower standard be sufficient. In that regard, comp anies take risks when deciding for a lower or medium standard. Following that logic it is perceived likely that a framework for an EU HTA may provide a compromise between data needs. 72 The key driver for HTA -related costs is the evidence generation. It is m ainly in the largest markets that companies perform additional clinical trials requested by HTA bodies. Otherwise, the existing knowledge gaps are often covered with post -marketing studies (investigator -initiated trial). The companies also explained that t he requests for evidence by smaller countries might be more difficult to address - taking into account the market size. Harmonisation of data requirements was perceived positive. It reduces risks but does not necessarily result in overall cost reduction as t he data needs at EU level will likely not end up at the level of the lowest denominator. Comments on the costs reported The costs for industry (absolute figures) were considered to be realistic, but erring on the conservative side. The actual costs would depend on what is included in the cost factors (such as costs related to RCTs, which were not included by the study team on purpose). It was also noted that many indirect costs may not have been reported and that establishing the costs for additional evid ence generation is particularly difficult (different budget lines, data may also serve other - regulatory/pricing and reimbursement - purposes etc.) Participants agreed to follow up on the issue of additional evidence generation and to provide further inf ormation to DG SANTE. EC2 Administrative Burden The industry representatives reiterated that the recurrent sharp rise of expected costs between policy option 4 and 5 can be explained with the aforementioned multiplication of national requirements - in addi tion to the harmonisation achieved at EU level. Industry also argued that option 5 does not appear feasible in practice due to the different economic situations of Member States. EC 3 Competitiveness of the EU health technology sector The pharma represent atives clarified that, overall, they could expect an increase in competitiveness in the EU with the reduction of the heterogeneity of the markets and the potential shortening of timelines that stronger cooperation in HTA on EU level would achieve. However, less heterogeneity among EU markets would not necessarily translate immediately into higher revenues since the negotiations on the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals will still take place and the overall budget for pharmaceuticals is not expecte d to increase. EC 4 Innovation and Research The main driver is the improved predictability of the HTA process which could lead to increased efforts to innovate, since operating in an environment with less variability between markets, would lead to less ri sks and thus, to more investments. Joint REA in parallel with market authorisation should shorten the market access process - at least in certain countries. If the process is shortened, there would cost savings and earlier revenues. Participants also point ed out the value in accessing the first markets quickly. This could be particularly relevant for SMEs. Meanwhile, additional efforts would be needed from the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to keep up with new requirements and stay competitive on the market. These trends are reflected in the answers for the respective policy options. 73 SH 4 Sustainability of health systems and SH 5 Public Health Most of the participants did not provide input to this question, since they deemed the question out of the ir reach. According to them, one of the positive aspects of HTA is the value -based approach for treatments and products. Follow up DG SANTE thanked the participants of the focus group and asked them to provide clarification on the occasions when they hav e been performed additional evidence generation by 12th May. 74 Annex 7: Minutes Focus Group MedTech Minutes HTA Focus Group: Medical Technologies (incl. diagnostics) Date: 02/05/2017 Location: DG SANTE offices Participants Medical technologies industry: Company representatives that participated in the online survey related to Health Technology Assessment (HTA) (\"the survey\") were attending in order to provide additional information on the survey results.

The Austrian Public Health Institute (GO -FP): Anja Laschkolnig London School of Economic (LSE): Panos Visintin Purpose of the meeting Discussion,interpretation and validation of the survey results with industry experts regarding costs and impac ts of the policy options. Discussion The majority of participants to the focus group had relevant HTA experience, either in their current function or in their past professional career. EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY Directorate B - Health systems, medical products and innovation Unit B4 - Medical products: quality, safety, innovation 75 General observations Industry participants agreed that the results of the survey are useful to understand preferences of the medtech industry regarding the HTA policy options. The survey results should however not be over -interpreted as precise quantifications of the impacts (e.g. cost increases by x%). Certain values ar e rather the expression of significant concerns that the market access path for medtech products might change substantially - over and above the new legislation for medical technologies that was just adopted. The survey results should rather be taken as a general indication of trends. The respondents also noted that exact quantification of certain impacts has been difficult as many factors had to be taken into consideration for one indicator. Also the impacts will depend on how the policy options would be i mplemented and for some participants this was not defined sufficiently when answering the questionnaire. To compensate for the above limitations, it was recommended to triangulate the results with additional data sources and complement by the outcome of t he focus group discussion. DG SANTE clarified that the online survey is one part of the data gathering exercise to support the analysis of the impacts of the policy options. The survey is further supported by the literature review and a set of case studies . In addition, it was also clarified that the study is one input to the impact assessment process along with the results of the public consultation, the outcome of the ongoing additional stakeholders' consultation and further data gathering which is curren tly ongoing via additional studies which aim to map processes and procedures of HTA systems across the EU. Many industry participants explained that their responses for Policy Option 2 are based on the assumption that the collaboration is expected to be d emand driven, from the 'bottom upwards' and the overall number of HTAs for medical technologies would remain stable. Whilst in options 3 to 5 the collaboration would become more top -down and the number of (joint) HTA reports would increase significantly - leading to additional costs for industry and delays in market launch. Also some participants indicated that in their responses they considered that Option 2 is fully aligned with the proposal of the European medtech association, where clusters of Member St ates (MS) that are interested in a given technology can agree to cooperate on a voluntary basis. DG SANTE explained that in its view the main difference between Policy Options 2 and 3 is the cooperation framework for HTA bodies. In Policy Option 2 the coo peration of HTA bodies is based on a contractual arrangement (like EUnetHTA). In Policy Option 3 the cooperation is based on legislation. In this sense the risk of diverging submission templates, diverging data requirements etc. is less pronounced in Polic y Option 3. Joint Assessments can be done under both Policy Options alike, in both cases on a voluntary basis. Industry participants had different understanding of Policy Option 3 had been clear to them - they would have replied differently by giving more favourable marks to Policy Option 3. Participants also clarified that they had interpreted Policy Options 3 -5 as legally mandating REA (or full HTA) at the time of launch, and as such they felt it would substantially increase HTA activities in MS for medi cal technologies. Ultimately it would fundamentally change the current business model, which is based largely on public procurement at local level. In their view the creation of a legal framework, even if it did not impose a legal obligation on REA or Full HTA, would provide a driver for further increase of HTA activities in MS. Some participants also argued that the market access path for medical products typically does not foresee setting prices or reimbursement levels at national level. This would questi on the value of HTA at time of launch (no impact on \"decision making\") and could delay market access. For the majority of technologies it might therefore be preferable to allow immediate market access and foresee a demand -driven reassessment based on real world evidence (value based pricing) at a later stage (e.g. on clinical uncertainty after a period of clinical experience). This would also maintain the first mover advantage. 76 Industry participants also indicated that there is a perceived risk that even t hough an EU Assessment would be implemented, there would be duplications on national and local level. In the view of the industry it will still be essential to capture the specific elements present at local level which have to be part of the assessment rel ated to the use of the technologies in the local settings. Therefore HTA bodies are considered likely to continue to ask additional information, including for generation of evidence, which are particularly costly for the industry. The discussion also touc hed upon the difference between regulatory and HTA requirements; where industry pointed out that they should remain separate. The regulatory framework, currently in transition, aims to ensure that products are safe, and that label claims are correct. HTA, on the other hand, intends to assess the clinical benefit of an intervention. These purposes are complementary but different, and should not be confused. It would instead make more sense to align HTA requirements with needs of market access decision -makers / payers, to increase the relevance of HTAs. When defining the value of a technology, one particular challenge for medical technologies are the large variability in service delivery models across Member States and the fact that the costs and benefits are often realised in health and social budgets (e.g. less invasive surgeries and other technologies shifting care from hospitals to social settings) and they are not fully captured in the assessment. Moreover, it is particularly dependent on the local specifi cities and would be impossible to capture it in a single EU full HTA. EC1 Costs The participants confirmed that the general trend visible is plausible. In response to the question how to explain the major differences between Policy Options 2 and 3, parti cipants explained that the main driver for increased costs from policy option 3 to 5 is the legal nature of the cooperation. A described earlier (see \"general observations\"), participants expect a legal system to significantly increase HTA activities acros s Member States and between Member States in the field of medical devices and IVDs at the time of the market launch of the product, where currently there are limited activities (if at all). The key cost factor is the generation of evidence. Companies note d that currently efficacy data is not required (and in the revised regulation it will only be required for a limited number of technologies). The cost of regulatory and HTA data generation differs; HTA evidence generation is estimated to be four times more expensive. It was also discussed that for products requiring additional clinical data, it may be beneficial to align requirements, if possible to maximise the use of data and reduce duplication. Comments on the costs reported: The large variation repor ted on the costs related to HTA is a good reflection of large variation of real -life costs of different technologies. Costs are considered to be realistic yet slightly conservative, depending on what is included in the cost factors. For the number compani es involved in early dialogues: of the participants that responded \"yes\", they clarified that they only had undergone one ED process respectively (i.e. do not routinely engage in early dialogues for medical devices), so the number overestimates the importa nce of EDs for medical technologies. This is explained by the short life cycle of medical technologies (including fast development phase) and the limited requirements for clinical evidence, according to the current regulatory framework. 77 EC2 Administr ative Burden Industry reiterated that they expect a legally mandated REA at the time of launch to substantially increase HTA activities in MS, and so fundamentally change the business model. This explains the sharp increase from policy option 2 to 3. At th e same time, once evidence needs to be generated for HTA there is little difference in terms of administrative burden, if this additional data should focus on effectiveness or on economic aspects. This accounts for the relative stability of the curve from policy option 3 to 5. EC3 and EC4 Innovation, Competitiveness If HTA is conducted at the time of market launch and the first mover needs to generate comprehensive evidence, which can then be used for the early followers, a situation is created where the f irst mover has a considerable disadvantage. In the view of participants this explains the sharp expected decline for these impacts form a voluntary cooperation to a mandatory one. More general/academic HTAs, which are not fully recognized by each Member St ate and hence informing decision making to a less effective extend create extra cost with a less clear link to a potential return. This would be harmful for investment decisions of all companies, but companies with a weaker cash position (i.e. many innovat ing SMEs) might be forced to change strategic direction away from the riskier/more innovative IVDs. In addition, if the EU market is not attractive (limited growth opportunities, difficult entry) industry would prioritise other markets. Ultimately all prod ucts would arrive on the EU market, but just delayed. It was further emphasised that the growth in the European medical technologies market is already quite low and that any additional burden might jeopardise it further. Additional legislation and slower m arket access in particularly for first movers/innovators with no clear link to pricing and reimbursement might reduce the attractiveness of the EU market. Particular challenges for SMEs relate to the fact that increased harmonisation can delay the first r evenues, which are particularly challenging due to the higher costs of financing. So even if harmonization means access to more countries, losing the quick access to the first market overrides the advantage of accessing some countries (quicker). This can already be seen today where focus is given to launch products in certain markets with earlier access to provide the first additional revenues. At the same time participants expressed understanding that Member States have a legitimate interest to ensure the sustainability of their national health systems and to favour effective treatments over ineffective treatments. Furthermore, one participant indicated that an EU system might lead to a higher demand for costly quality evidence, which does not inform decis ions and does not improve patients' situations. Moreover, SMEs might not be able to handle such increased costs (extra burden of adapting to any new harmonised tools or assessments). Therefore, private equity investors might be more inclined to find other opportunities for investment and/or larger companies would take over of SMEs. Large companies would probably be able to cope with the additional costs, but SMEs would have a very difficult time in an already competitive market. EC6 Internal Market Respond ents mentioned a number of factors through which legislation can in fact increase fragmentation and complexity: In particular in the first years of the new regulatory framework, due to the exceptions the landscape may paradoxically become more fragmented. 78 It was also considered that a joint submission template may even increase complexity if it adds a high number of general fields which are not relevant in local settings. Voluntary cooperation on the other hand would still enable HTA bodies and/or decision makers and Industry to work together/ facilitate evidence generation (eg cooperation with different research centres testing the new product). This is perceived to share the risk of evidence generation rather than provide additional hurdles. These reas ons would explain the expected positive impact of policy option 2. SH4 Sustainability Participants considered that due to the weak link between health technology assessments and pricing and reimbursement decisions for medical technologies, the changes in the HTA processes would not affect the negotiation power or the funding of technologies with little or no added value in this sector. It was also mentioned that there were difficulties in answering to the indicator on \"financing of expencive treatments wi th little or no added value\" (whether a higher score meant more technologies with little or no added value funded or an improved situation i.e. reduced number of technologies with little or no added value funded). It was also stated by certain participant s that they do not necessarily see that financing of medical technologies with little or no added value is a major issue, as the sector is very competitive and having large number of technologies on the market drives price down. But participants conceded t hat Member States might be concerned for ensuring sustainability. SH5 Public Health In general, if the number of medical technologies available decreases as consequence of any changes in the HTA sector, this is expected to translate to lower level of publ ic health. Participants accepted on the other hand that Member States might want to favour those treatments where the added value is particularly high for patients. Product scope In certain responses it was assumed that legal cooperation implies a broad s cope of medical technologies (potentially all devices), which has been an important factor in the responses relating to policy option 3 to 5. There was a general agreement that currently the topic selection for joint assessment is not defined and would ben efit from further input. Also, when defining the product scope, it the purpose of the HTA needs to be clarified. In response to two posed questions on potential product scope and timing of assessments the following was relayed: Suggestions for product scop e in the future: - Respond to decision -makers' needs and/or feed into access decisions - Transformative technologies - High budget impact - Unmet medical needs Timing of assessment: - Anytime when there is a need from decision -makers/ local request - Should allow fo r sufficient evidence to be gathered. - Transformative technologies in need of real -life evidence - Later, for disinvestment decisions It was also mentioned that when a common technology is adopted and further comparisons are needed with available alternative s of the technology also known as Multi Technology Assessment; EU cooperation and in particular Joint REA, could provide a 79 benefit where different health care providers might have adopted different alternatives and would jointly be able to deliver evidence to support comparisons between alternatives. Follow up DG SANTE, LSE and GO FP thanked the participants of the focus group and asked them to provide clarification on defining transformative health technologies as well as to provide examples on these by 12th May. 80 Annex 8: Minutes Focus Group Public Administration and others EUnetHTA Joint Action Executive Board Meeting - Focus group with Public authorities Summary of discussion results from the online survey for the \"Study on impact analysis of policy options for strengthened EU cooperation on HTA\" Date: 03/05/2 017 Location: DG SANTE offices Participants EUnetHTA Joint Action Executive Board G-BA - Pharmaceutical Dpt.

Discussion This report only refers to the first part of the Executive Board meeting, which was dedicated to the discussion of the results from the online survey for the \"Study on impact analysis of policy options for strengthened EU cooperation on HTA\", Anja Laschkolnig and Katharina Habimana (GO -FP) presented the results, which was followed by a discussion. General observations It was clarified in advance that the results represe nt the expectations of the respondents. The results do not allow precise quantification, but should be taken as general indications on the overall trends. The survey results should therefore not be over -interpreted as precise quantifications of the impacts (e.g. cost increases by x%). The respondents also noted that the quantification of the impacts has been difficult as many factors had to be taken into consideration for one indicator and some of these factors would also depend on how the policy options wo uld be implemented. To compensate for the above limitations, it was recommended to triangulate the results with additional data sources and complement by the outcome of the focus group discussion (as already planned by the study team). DG SANTE clarified that the online survey is one part of the data gathering exercise to support the analysis of the impacts of the policy options. The survey is further supported by the literature review and of the case studies done by London School of Economics. In addition , it was also clarified that the study is one input to the impact assessment process along with the results of the public consultation, the outcome of the ongoing additional stakeholders' consultation and further data gathering which is currently ongoing v ia additional studies mapping processes and procedures of HTA systems across the EU. There was a discussion on to which extent and how the different indicators can be interpreted. The interpretation has to be done with caution, as the number of different factors affects the impacts. For example for \"costs impact\" the answer would depend whether an activity is already done or not in the country responding, whether fees are charged to support a specific activities etc. Therefore it was underlined that the di fferent baselines also affect results, which is however natural since respondents were asked answer the questionnaire from their respective position. The contractor explained that this point was already made by the expert group, which is supporting the stu dy and a number of actions have been put in place to address this issue. An example will be provided during the presentation in relation to costs, where for example a comparison between the estimation on cost development will be displayed separated for HTA institutes that stated experience with Early Dialogues and the ones not performing Early Dialogues. One additional suggestion aiming at increasing the comparability of data was to distinguish HTA bodies with research focus and the ones which need to give advice for pricing and reimbursement decision as the timelines for their assessments as well as the criteria used may differ. It was also pointed out that where there is a high variation of responses (high standard deviation), the results are less concl usive and a simple average does not reflect a trend. The contractor was aware of this and will be transparent about this limitation, when this is the case. Grouping respondents according to their functions may address also this issue. It was also clarified that the focus group may help to explain the reasoning behind answers and large variations, when these occur. 82 EC1 Cost indicators: In the discussion, there was consensus that stronger EU cooperation would lead to cost decreases per products, rather than increases, as indicated in the online survey. This is mainly due to reduced duplication of efforts and increased efficiency. Current experience suggests that sharing the work lowers the costs for agencies very significantly (in one case where only two agen cies agreed to cooperate on clinical guidelines they were able to save 30% respectively). Whilst there are higher overheads, which are particularly important in the beginning, this would be more than compensated by work -sharing arrangements. It was suggest ed that for smaller agencies, with currently limited HTA activities, cooperation could increase the scope of activities - albeit with a relatively small investment. This could explain some of the answers. In conclusion participants agreed that the results as presented were not in line with their expectations based on their experience in the cooperation. DG SANTE confirmed that for the calculations of costs within the Impact Assessment, the primary input will be calculations based on the first part of the su rvey, and the follow up interaction with EUnetHTA Board in subsequent meetings (December 2016 and February 2017). The availability of the data regarding the baseline costs of HTA is not as extensive as it was hoped for. On the other hand, since the first f ollow up meeting with EUnetHTA Board, availability of data increased and is considered acceptable. In any event it is the best available evidence. It was also noted that for the respondents of the survey it was difficult to estimate the costs per product ( considering overheads or the methodology used for assessment). It was noted that the wage difference across MS will also explain some of the differences in the variations of costs declared for national HTA products. GO-FP presented the costs for HTA proce sses conducted by LSE. The HTA institutions were categorised in two ways. The first categorisation aimed to reflect the institutional differences. The second categorisation aimed to capture the differences in the costs of REA and single technology full HTA s. It was agreed that the costs from the Joint Actions on the joint products would be a very important input. Further efforts will be made using data available from Joint Action 2 and Joint Action 3 and work within EU funded project (i.e. SEED for early dialogues). When considering these data the relevant assumptions will be made to reflect the learning curves and the number of countries involved. EC2 Administrative burden: It was considered that this is an example in which the overall expected variati ons of administrative burden may not be significant between the different policy options. Policy option 1 to 4 are all in rather close range, policy option 5 would foresee a more relevant increase, which was considered to be plausible due to the increased complexity of reaching a common agreement on economic aspects of the HTA reports which will be more context specific. It was however also mentioned that while administrative complexity may increase from policy option 1 to 5, the resources for research may be spent more efficiently, which can ultimately lead to a more neutral effect. EC3 Competitiveness of the EU health technology sector, EC4 Innovation and research, EC5 Internal market and competition: These impacts and some of the sub -indicators are more applicable for industries, nevertheless the survey aimed at gathering the expectations of HTA bodies as key players in the HTA sector. It was agreed that the sub -indicator \"revenue\" is ambiguous in relation to HTA bodies and it was recommended to be disca rded. On other impacts, with the caveat mentioned above, the general trends outlined in the graph were confirmed as plausible. The following comments were made: 83 - The predictability is an important component also for academic research institutions. - It was noted and confirmed that stronger cooperation should reduce significantly fragmentation of the HTA. - Stronger EU cooperation may increase overall evidence needs, which are costly for the industry, in particular for medical technologies. Nevertheless t here would be a significant benefit for public health. SH4 Sustainability of Health Systems It was agreed that a joint perspective on the added value can improve sustainability. There was consensus that stronger cooperation would improve the negotiation p ower to achieve lower prices for technologies with limited added value. Nonetheless, it would be more difficult to discontinue the financing of such technologies alltogether. This is mainly due to the fact that final decisions on availability of technologi es will remain a national/local decision based on additional considerations than HTA assessments. SH5 Effect on Public Health It was noted that the availability of the technologies also depends on other factors, in particular the marketing authorisation and pricing and reimbursement systems. Therefore it is difficult to quantify with precision the impact of HTA cooperation. Nevertheless it was considered that increased convergence of HTA methods would increase the availability of health technologies with added benefits, and as such benefits public health. Variations between expectations reported between PO3 and PO4 were not considered significant. It was noted that in particular for medical technologies the regulatory framework is less stringent in the EU than in the US. Follow up It was agreed that it would be useful to look at the cost structures established for Joint Action 2. DG SANTE encouraged participants to engage with the HTA team if there would be any further comments or information to be sent i n relation to costs and perceived impacts in relation to the preliminary identified policy options. 84 Annex 9 : Sample of 20 Pharmaceutical products TECHNOLOGY GENERIC NAME TECHNOLOGY BRANDED NAME INDICATION M.A Holder Abiraterone Zytiga\u00ae Treatment of me tastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer in adult men whose disease has progressed on or after a docetaxel - based chemotherapy regimen.

How do the legal status, the scope and the role of HTA bodies influence investment behaviours and which are the HTA best practices from an industry perspective? Legal status of HTA bodies Did the legal status (if it is legally binding or not) of the HTA bodies have an influence on the business strategy of your company so far ? o If yes, how did you shape your market access strategy? o Did you prioritize settings where HTA has a legally binding status? Is it possible to give us a concrete example of whether your business strategy was affected positively or negatively by the HTA legal framework?

Were there any best practices worth noting in this context? Early dialogue Did the possibility of engaging in early dialogue influence your market strategy positively? o If yes, was your market strategy shaped accordingly? 97 o Could you give us a country -specific example? If you engaged in an early dialogue in the past, how did it influence the HTA submission? o Did it lead to a reduction of overall costs? o Did it lead to a shortening of the timeline for the full HTA submission? Rapid evaluation assessment (REA) Did the possibility to undergo a REA have any impact on or shape your market strategy? o If yes, in what way? o Did you prioritise launch in settings where a REA was present? In the last three years, did a REA process lead to a change in your market strategy? o If yes, in what way? o Could you give a specific example? Special arrangements Did any specific special arrangements influence the business strategy of the company? o If yes, in what way? o Could you giv e a specific example? Product -specific questions Were you involved in an early dialogue with any HTA body in Europe? o If yes, could you give us an example? How did this affect your business strategy?

Nota bene : HTA bodies that submitted cost information in response to the online survey do not need to respond to the questions contained in this document. The information previously provided will be used. Background In the course of the s tudy a detailed case study covering 40 health technologies including pharmaceuticals, medical devices and other technologies (such as screening programs) has been conducted to assess the status quo of HTA in Europe. Data for this case study have been retri eved by literature review and an additional survey process to complement information retrieved. Additionally, this study aims to provide an overview about the costs of HTA assessment processes in Europe for different stakeholder groups . Therefore, differe nt cost components of performing HTA were requested through an online survey. The information which will be provided in response to the attached questions will be used in a strictly confidential manner. Only aggregated data will be presented in the repor t including an indication of the countries and HTA bodies whose information was used. The costs submitted by individual HTA bodies won\u00b4t be presented alone and no comparison across different bodies/countries is intended. Please send the information by 18th April to EU.HTA@goeg.at . Many thanks for your kind cooperation. Comments: - Please fill in if relevant. If not relevant (=not done) please fill in NR.

Broadly speaking two forms exist: a) a Rapid Assessment produced (mainly) by an HTA -body (with no or some evidence/data submission provided by industry) or b) a Rapid Assessment produced mainly by industry and reviewed by an HTA body (please indicate). Please do not include EUnetHTA Joint Assessments. 3REA / rapid Assessment incl. economic evaluations is the p rocess to assess (1) the medical/therapeutic added value of a new technology (assessment of clinical domains) and (2) the cost -effectiveness / budget impact. Again it may take two forms (see above, please indicate which form corresponds best to your assess ments). Please do not include EUnetHTA Joint Assessments. 4Full HTA is the process to assess (1) the medical/therapeutic added value of a new technology (assessment of clinical domains), (2) the cost -effectiveness / budget impact, Total budget spent annually on HTA activities (approx.) in 2016 or latest available YEAR 119 and (3) other aspects, e. g. ethical aspects, legal considerations and impact on patients as well as on the health care systems. Please do not include EUnetHTA Joint Assessments. 5National adaptation of a joint REA or a joint full HTA : includes a range of options; please indicate f or your estimates on costs and annual numbers the most suitable option (according to EUnetHTA definition): 1) Summarizing: translate the summary and use this for background information, 2) Updating searches: using the original search strategy to identify a ny more recent evidence or adding to the search strategy and extending it. 3) Adapting: the systematic extraction of relevant HTA information from an existing report (from a whole report or from part of a report). 4) Adopting: making use of the report without making any changes at all (except perhaps tran slation into your own language). 120 Annex 2 4: Further impacts for Public Administration -

The product underwent HTA assessments in 11 countries by 12 agencies. In Germany, we considered both the evaluation from IQWIG and G -BA, even if they do not differ in terms of outcome, in order to assess differences, if any, between the two agencies in the way they perceive and assess the submitted evidence. Indeed, the procedure for arriving at the overall conclusion on the extent of added benefit is a proposal from IQWiG in the first instance; G -BA is taking the final decision and also conducts its own evaluation; in some cases, the opinions of the two agencies may differ. In this case, for example, G -BA extended the benefit to Level two also to t he other sub -population, rated at Level V by IQWIG. 136 Table 6- Overview of HTA recommendations Country (Agency) Ireland (NCPE) England (NICE) Sweden (TLV) France (HAS) Scotland (SMC) The Netherlands (ZIN) Poland (AOTM) Germany (IQW IG) Germany (G-BA) Portugal (INFARMED) Romania (MoH) Italy (CRUF) M.A. Date: XX/XX/XXXX 1: Level 2 Sub- population 2: Level 5 L (Level 2) L L LWC Clinical restrictions Not stated Economic restrictions Not stated Severity Rarity Unmet need for treatments 137 Country (Agency) Ireland (NCPE) England (NICE) Sweden (TLV) France (HAS) Scotland (SMC) The Netherlands (ZIN) Poland (AOTM) Germany (IQW IG) Germany (G-BA) Portugal (INFARMED) Romania (MoH) Italy (CRUF) Special conditions considered End of life criteria Humanitaria n aspect and solidarity principle SMC Modifiers Burden on family and carers emotional well being Impact on work and everyday life activities Wider societal Benefits Equality issues Small population Significant innovation Legend: : presence of the variables; NICE: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE); SMC: Scottish Medicines Consor tium; TLV: HAS: Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9; IQWIG: Institute for do Medicamento;.MoH; Mi nsitry of Health ; NCPE: Nation al Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. 138 The primary evidence for the clinical benefit stemmed by the same randomised, double - blind phase -III study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of the product with placebo. The total numbe r of studies submitted and evaluated by HTA agencies differed widely. In three cases (IQWIG, G -BA and ZIN) an indirect comparison was also included in order to compare the product with a direct comparator whereas NICE, TLV, AOTM and ZIN also included anoth er Phase III trial in order to support the clinical effectiveness arguments. Finally, TLV included an observational study to support the clinical benefit and ZIN included the results of the EPAR report, while AOTMiT included three studies assessing the dru g with a direct comparator. Considering the submission of the economic evidence, HTA agencies considered at least one cost -utility analysis. The comparators included in the analysis differed is some cases, which might lead to a different outcome. For Insta nce, TLV considered an analysis that compared the cost -effectiveness of the product against the direct comparator and partly against no treatment, that is, only symptomatic treatment, whereas ZIN, NICE, UVEF considered only comparison with the same direct comparator. INFRAMED considered the comparison with a direct comparator, that for example is not licensed in the UK. It is important to highlight also, that most of the agencies (e.g. SMC, AOTMiT and ZIN) considered a budget impact analysis, which, in some cases (ZIN), had a negative influence on the final decision. For instance, ZIN highlighted that the budget impact on pharmaceutical expenditure was calculated between \u20ac9 and \u20ac13 million per year, leading to a higher cost than the use of the comparator cu rrently used in clinical practice. A number of elicited and non -elicited social value judgments were identified in the reports, some of which helped shape or influence the final HTA recommendation. These values, comprising clinical, social, and ethical pa rameters, have increasingly been included in HTA decisions in order fully assess the value of healthcare technologies when making judgments regarding clinical and cost effectiveness. In some cases (e.g. End of life criteria by NICE in England; and SMC modi fiers in Scotland), HTA agencies state these values explicitly in the guidelines and are captured in a consistent manner across all the relevant reports. In other cases, some types of value (e.g. Degree of innovation or administration benefit) are taken i nto consideration in addition to the cost per unit of health gain but in a less standardized manner. Considering non -elicited social value judgments, seven out of 13 agencies considered important to include a treatment in this area because of unmet medica l need. Specifically, TLV, ZIN and HAS highlighted the national importance of having a treatment for this chronic disease in late stage disease whereas SMC specifically stated an unmet need in this treatment category. Whereas most of the agencies consider the product as palliative care treatment, HAS considered that product as a 'curative' treatment and commented it could provide an additional response to public health need compared to the therapeutic strategy currently in place. NICE, ZIN and AOTM pointed out the innovativeness of the treatment in terms of its mode of administration because it is an oral drug taken by patients at home. This advantage is highlighted also by SMC and HAS, the latter stating in its report that the product under review offers an alternative, orally administered to other treatments, and is better tolerated with a different safety profile. SMC highlighted the unmet need in this area with very limited treatment options in this stage of the disease. The most common alternative treatm ent was cited by HAS and NICE. NICE also suggested another product considered as main treatment an alternative in other countries has not been licensed in UK. Looking at the management of the disease, HAS pointed out that the method of administration coul d have a positive impact on the organization of patient care, having a clear influence on the final decision. 139 For all HTA agencies, the most important \"other consideration\" in the decision was the improvement in the quality of life of patients using the pr oduct. Looking at the elicited social value judgments, their consideration by three agencies (NICE, SMC and TLV) had a considerable impact on the outcome, leading the agencies to accept an ICER higher than their notional threshold. Specifically, elicited social value judgments played a key role in the assessment by NICE. Initially, NICE rejected the product because it was not considered to be cost -effective stating that the End of life criteria were not applicable due to the absence of the prerequisite o f a no small population and the ICER (XX,XXX/QALY) was significantly over what it would consider acceptable even with the application of EoL criteria (which is in the region of XX,XXX /QALY). However, in February 2012 the product underwent a re -evaluation and it was accepted with restrictions, stating that the eligible patient population was actually small and the drug was suitable for the consideration of the end -of-life criteria. Interestingly, NICE reversed its initial decision within one month, whereas it took nearly three years for TLV to decide to reimburse the drug with restrictions. 140 Table 7: Medical technology example: Conclusions Legend: *: clinical effectiveness uncertain and not demonstrated; : improved or positively assessed clinical effective HTA body England (NICE) Scotland (SMC) Sweden (TLV) France (HAS) Ireland (NCPE) The Netherland (ZIN) Poland (AOTM) Germany (IQWIG) Germany (G-BA) Portugal (INFAR ME D) Romania (MoH) Italy (CRUF) Clinical effectiveness Economic analysis * * N/A * * * N/A N/A N/A Social value judgments with an influence on decision End of life criteria SMC modifiers Human dignity and solidarity agreement/ Pricing agreements Commercial access arrangement Patient Access Scheme (PAS) Yes N/A Price negotiation Annex 1b Cost Sharing in accor dance with the contractual "}
