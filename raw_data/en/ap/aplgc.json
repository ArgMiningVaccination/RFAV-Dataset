Weird but fun bit the bullet and adopted an indie dog. please say hello to bruno!What took me so long to get to Visakhapatnam, I wonder. This sprawling city by the sea may well be eastern India's best-kept secret. It enjoys a blessed location, sandwiched between the necklace-shaped beaches of the Bay of Bengal and the mountains of the Eastern Ghats, where lie the wonders of the Araku Valley and the Borra Caves. The food is to die for and there's much to explore, from the fishing harbour (you might need a nose clip for that one) to the museums and hilltop viewpoints. The Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Temple at Simhachalam, over a thousand years old, will leave you spellbound. On my way north out of Vizag, I stopped at Thotlakonda, a 2,000-year-old Buddhist vihara whose showcase central stupa collapsed a few years ago. But the numerous dormitories, a prayer hall and the large kitchen can still be admired. You will sense the power of the land, infused with centuries of prayer. I was heading to Bheemunipatnam, a sleepy coastal town, where I stayed at the excellent Bheemli Resort. Where the beaches of Vizag are lively and atmospheric, Bheemli beach is all about quietude and healing seclusion. Remnants of the town's Dutch heritage can be seen. Note to foodies: you cannot come back from Vizag without some pootharekulu\u2014a sweet unique to Andhra (I'd recommend the version with dry fruits). February was a travel-crazy month, even by my standards. Before I visited Vizag, I was basking in sub-zero temperatures in Mukteshwar, deep in the Kumaon Himalaya. The contrast could not have been starker. After I'd had my fill of being a beach bum, I headed back to the mountains, to the salubrious environs of Rishikesh, before making a second appearance at the beach\u2014Konark this time\u2014for the Outlook Responsible Tourism Summit and Awards 2021.

Yet, Odia cuisine rarely features among the popular (or known) Indian food cultures today. With traditional recipes getting passed on from one generation to the other, the state is fast emerging as a favoured destination for avid foodies. Head to the land of exotic beaches and temples to celebrate the joys of Odia food in a way you have never experienced before. The flavours and ingredients will bring all your cravings to a halt and offer a slice of home. A typical Odia fare is a fine balance of piquancy and pungency. It is usually cooked in mustard oil and characterised by the addition of besara, a mixture of garlic pounded with mustard, ambula or what is also known as fermented dry mango and copious amounts of curd. An underrated culinary power house, the glory of Odisha's coastal delicacies is yet to be explored. From tangy dal to sweetmeats, catch a glimpse of some of the most popular dishes that this coastal state has to offer. Khaja A traditional Odia dessert, khaja is an ancient sweet pastry relished during the festive season. This crispy sugar-coated, layered delicacy is one of the chappan bhog offered to Lord Jagannath in Puri. Essentially, a flour, sugar and ghee- based dough that is deep fried to make a flaky, sweet dessert with spiraling layers, it is sometimes soaked in sugar syrup, depending on the regional variation of the recipe. Dalma Enjoyed as a main course with steamed rice, this traditional dish is great in taste and healthy too. It is made with toor dal, chana dal, potato, pumpkin, brinjal and other nutritious vegetables. A special FlavouRs oFF the TRAVEL PROMOTION sweet in roadside stalls and confectioneries all across the state of Odisha. Pithas These sweet delicacies form an integral part of the festivities in every Odia household. Steamed, baked, roasted or fried, there are numerous pitha variants. The most common base for pitha is rice flour although semolina, wheat flour, and lentils are also used. Most varieties of pitha are prepared as small cookies or dumplings that are filled with spices, nuts, or different vegetables, in either sweet or savory versions. Dahibara Aloodum Considered as the lifeline of Cuttack, this street food delicacy can be had for breakfast, lunch, evening snack or dinner. It is prepared by soaking vadas in watered down dahi and topped with aloodum and ghugni while serving. The authentic method of serving is by making a bowl out of the khalli patra (bahunia vahlii leaf), placing a few dahibaras in the bowl and then adding dollops of thick aloodum gravy or ghugni. Mati Handi Mutton A classic favourite among locals, mati handi mutton is a unique preparation, spicy seasoning made with roasted cumin and red chili powder is added to dalma which gives it its characteristic flavour. It is garnished with coconut shavings and fresh coriander leaves. Pakhala Summers in the region are often incomplete without this Odia staple. Pakhala is a fermented rice-based delicacy, prepared by soaking leftover rice overnight. It is accompanied by a variety of side dishes like shallow-fried vegetables, aloo bharta (mashed potato), fish, papad, condiments, and onion salad. This dish is known to be a preventive for heat stroke\u2014prevalent in the region. In order to keep the saga of pakhala love alive, Odias celebrate the Pakhala Dibasa every year on March 20, when the summer takes a sneak peek in Odisha. Chenna Poda An extremely popular smoky-flavored sweet delicacy, chenna poda literally means roasted cheesecake in Odia. It is made using sweetened cottage cheese baked in a traditional wood fire oven. This scrumptious cake-like dessert is unique in taste owing to the caramelisation of sugar/jaggery present in the cheese. Usually served during festivals, you can find this traditional Clockwise from facing page: the smoky-flavoured chhena poda; Dalma is an authentic curry dish prepared using vegetables and a blend of spices; mati handi mutton marinated in spices and simmered in earthen pots; and the comforting pakhala native to the region. Marinated in spices and slow cooked in earthen pots over wood fire, the elaborate process lends a delicious earthy taste to the mutton. The meat when cooked acquires a deep brownish tint while retaining individual aromas of the spices added. This mutton curry can be had with rice, roti or even chakuli pitha. Macha Besara A typical Odia coastal dish cooked in mustard gravy, macha besara is a simple delicacy cooked with basic and minimal ingredients. Ambula or sun dried mango is the magic ingredient in this recipe that lends a tangy flavour and goes really well with mustard-based dishes.

Dated : March 1, 2021 sd/- Indranil Mukha Svanasana: Inverted V pose Frequently used as a transition pose, the adho mukha svanasana is an integral part of ashtanga and vinyasa yoga series. Though it can be challenging initially, over time, as one's practice advances, it often turns into a favourite 'relaxation' pose between other, more strenuous postures. Since the pose replicates a dog bending forward, it is also known as the downward-facing dog pose. Steps to master Adho Mukha Svanasana 1. Start with table pose, with your knees under your hips and palms aligned with your shoulders. Move your hands about one palm length forward. 3. Initially, keep the knees bent to find a neutral spine. Find the length of your spine by pressing back from your hands. 5. Breathe deeply. Press your belly and chest towards your thighs and press out through your sitz bones and crown. 7. To release, exhale. Bend the knees and return to the initial table pose. Relax. 2. Curl your toes under and press into the pads at the base of your fingers. While exhaling, press down through the hands and lift up your hips to come into the pose. 4. Slowly begin to straighten the legs, bringing the upper part of the thighs towards the back of the room. 6. Press the hands into the ground. Pull the shoulder blades apart and down. outlook traveller 23 the yoga p age radar All About Self-Love Yoga is the practice of spending time with yourself, getting to know your breath and who you truly are. Facing challenges on the mat can do wonders for our inner landscape as we can be ourselves without having to compete. It's a space where we all come undone and learn to love ourselves irrespective of how we look, as yoga takes us past appearances into a place that is more real and the one that matters. It is through consistent practice of yoga that we can develop the inner strength to face not only the outside world but also our own fears, shortcomings and preconceived notions about ourselves. \u2014A professional dancer and certified yoga trainer, Tanvi Mehra is the founder of Tangerine Arts Studio Experts say slackline yoga is less about doing asana on the line, and more about bringing that yoga mindset to slacklining or more like 'distilling the art of yogic concentration' . To balance on a 1\" piece of webbing lightly tensioned between two trees is not easy , and doing yoga poses on it is even more challenging. Originally invented 20 years ago as a way for climbers to pass the time and improve their balance when not scrambling up rock walls, it is today actively used by yogis. The practice has many layers\u2014developing focus, dynamic balance, power, breath, core integration, flexibility and confidence.On Trend: Slackline Yoga Photo credit: Department of T ourism, Arunachal PradeshNamsai & its Rai Nbow spells Y ou feel it before you see it...

Allow me to explain. Adjoining the alley next to which I live in the city of Malm\u00f6 in Sweden is the outer wall of a parking building. Every day I pass it, and every other day it changes colour and form. Well, it's one of the walls reserved by the city for graffiti artists. They come and spray paint this wall with their creations, and never do any of these creations stay for more than a day . It's lifted up and painted all over again, and yet again by a number of graffiti artists. Sometimes, I stop and see them shaping their art. Spray cans in hand, a light mask covering the face, they go about doing their work with the devoutness of whirling dervishes\u2014unmindful of the world unfolding around them, they spray the walls with deft hand movements. Within minutes, shapes begin to emerge from nothingness\u2014a human figurine, orphan letters possibly of a word signifying underground culture, or at times simple streaks of movements crafting illegible and possibly meaningless signs. The more I see them practicing their craft, the more I wonder at the futility of their pursuit. Isn't art supposed to stay forever, serving us a reminder each day that there is more to life than chasing goals? Unable to contain my desperation to seek a reason, last week I tapped one of the graffiti artists on the shoulder. I appreciated his art, and told him how much I enjoyed it, and how the ever-evolving amalgamation of colours, and proclamations, and figurines inspired me\u2014however, what's the point in it for him of painting and repainting the wall every few days? \"Well, would you notice this wall had it been like this for the last ten years, \" asked the anonymous painter. No, I wouldn't have, treating it like any other wall with colour chipping off it after so many years. \"Then that's what we do\u2014we paint it for you to come and see something new everyday , take inspiration, and even look forward to crossing this street, \" he said, \"and, as far as protecting the art is concerned, these days protection is about saving it online. Once it's on your Instagram page, then be rest assured it's saved forever!\" Intrigued by the discovery , I have started looking around my city more curiously . It turns out that Malm\u00f6 is one of the cities in Sweden that has the largest amount of street art. Two blocks away , I found two murals by a Polish muralist Natalia Rak. Inspired, I took to searching for more and came across the whole side of a building that was painted in graffiti art of a British artist who goes by the name of Phlegm. Street art is mainstreet art now. Not hidden from public sight but out in the open for people to take inspiration from. And for once, I am thankful to Covid as it has opened up a channel for me to explore my surroundings more deeply and become curious about what always lay around me.

Thousands of devotees, monks and followers throng the temple complex during the Kathina Festival, the biggest annual festival of the Kongmu Kham or golden ki Jaali in Mukteshwar Mukteshwar is a quiet corner of Kumaon, away from the hustle and bustle of the bigger hill stations.

The town\u2014if one can even call it that; it's really just a ridge\u2014came into its own with the establishment of the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) on a 3,000-acre campus here, the cool climate being suitable for the preservation of vaccines. The institute actually began life as the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory , which moved here from Pune in 1893, but was renamed as IVRI in 1925. Following independence, the 'Imperial' was replaced with 'Indian' . The sprawling campus is still there\u2014looming over the town, with a few shops, a bank, a post office and a 'human hospital' latched on\u2014but now that the main institute is in Izzatnagar, Bareilly , this outpost has become the hill campus, housing the Division of Virology and the Division of Temperate Animal Husbandry . The town is also the setting of Jim Corbett's story , 'The Muktesar Man-Eater' , featured in The Temple Tiger and More Man-Eaters of Kumaon. Some of the places associated with 'Carpet Sahib' and the story can be seen even today . \"Eighteen miles to the north-north-east of Naini Tal is a hill eight thousand feet high and twelve to fifteen miles long, running east and west... This range, and all the hills that lie between it and the plains of India, run east and west, and from a commanding point on any of the hills an uninterrupted view can be obtained not only of the snows to the north but also of the hills and valleys to the east and to the west as far as the eye can see. People who have lived at Muktesar claim that it is the most beautiful spot in Kumaon, and that its climate has no equal. \" I was staying at J\u00fcsta Mukteshwar, a new resort on the other side of the Mukteshwar ridge, in the village of Saliyakot. And I can vouch for the view. From my balcony the peaks of the Nanda Devi range appeared to be within kissing distance. Built on a tricky swathe of land, J\u00fcsta seems a bit higgledy-piggledy , so it's difficult to obtain a composite sense of the property . But it comes together eventually . o occasionally, the sharp call oF a Bird Floats across the V alley. Fluffy mountain dogs let out a friendly bark or two. Apart from that there is complete silence in this neck of the Kumaon Himalaya. If you prefer peace over pep, Mukteshwar is for you. It's also for those hungry for adventure and keen to commune with the great outdoors. There's plenty for them to do here. Then there's the view of the legendary peaks of the high Himalaya on a clear day , a sight for sore city eyes. The drive into Kumaon in early February was beautiful. Once we left Bhimtal's busy sprawl behind, there were two options: to drive via Ramgarh or Dhanachuli. We chose the latter, ostensibly shorter route, made good progress, and then ran into some snow in Dhanachuli.

As a traveller, I now find myself free from the pressure of 'seeing everything' . Our trip across eastern Arunachal Pradesh focused on taking rare experiences everyday rather than trying to squeeze in as many places into the itinerary . Visiting Chongkham is a case in point. There were hills, there were those grand pagodas, there was great food and there was absolute serenity but it was the people who made it special. For instance, Sukiyo Chow Mein, our driver, tour guide, man Friday and now, a dear friend. He had been a sheer delight. We first met him at Dibrugarh Airport. Almost my age, the Khampti boy with cool tattoos vibed with me and Sandipan instantly .

By the time we reach, it's dark but fortunately we can see the beautifully lit pagoda from our cottage. And zillions of stars. Soon, a bonfire is raised, copious amounts of homemade rice beer is served. There is wine too, followed by a wholesome Khampti dinner. We have paasa, a soup made from raw fish and herbs. There is namson tongpuk, a curry made by fermenting yam leaves and rice, paapho or steamed fish which is prepared in banana leaf and cooked over fire and there is steamed chicken with dry bamboo shoots. But what steals the show for me is khao lam or steamed rice that has taken the shape of the bamboo it was cooked in. The next morning we wake up at five when dawn has already set in. Soon, we are at the Golden Pagoda or the Kongmu Kham, surrounded by monks. One of the senior monks Chowsang Ombgbu, sits in a quiet corner reading Buddhist scriptures. He is kind enough to join us for a walk around the pagoda. Built on a plateau overlooking the plains and the Eastern Himalaya, the Kongmu Kham stands in all its glory as an iconic symbol of Theravada Buddhism. Inside the pagoda sits a bronze Buddha statue that was gifted by the chief monk from a temple in Thailand. march 2021 42aR unaChaL pRaDeSh eXploRe the southeast Asian-esque landscape basking in past glory . Bound in the north by the commanding snow ranges of the last fringes of the Himalayan Hump and the descending misty mountains of the Patkai range to its east, Chongkham is blessed with its share of small rivers and rivulets and tributaries of Lohit and Kamlang rivers. It was through the numerous passes of the Patkai Range that the Tai Khamptis poured into Assam and then parts of eastern Arunachal Pradesh, from Burma. Sukiyo informs us that Chongkham was once known as the richest village of Asia, thanks to its abundant natural wealth that included timber forests and many sprawling tea estates. Till date, every house in Chongkham owns elephants, symbolic of their wealth. Khamptis have a legendary connection with elephants and they were skilled at The prayer hall is reverberating with the sounds of Pali chants and spiritual fervour as monks kneel in front of a one-of-its- kind Buddha statue made of cane. After the prayer service, some monks head to their schools to receive formal education and some stay for their Dhamma classes. We are leaving for Chongkham, when Chowsang Mojingta, who is running late for school, asks for a lift. The 17-year-old had joined the monastery last year to discipline his life. We drop him at the Momong Government School and pay a quick visit to the Momong Monastery .

Most Khampti families have looms in their homes on which they weave traditional garments for themselves. She welcomes us inside her kitchen, where rice is being cooked on a traditional hearth. She has packed the rice in tong leaves and put them in a vessel, which is placed on another vessel with boiling water. Dotted with uriam, banana, papaya and tomar trees, Empong is a friendly Tai Khampti hamlet with a population of only 50 to 60 people. Most families are involved in the cultivation of paddy , potato, beans, peas and other vegetables. They live in traditional huts with spread-out habitations, separated by paddy fields that produce the famous Khampti sticky rice. There's been no electricity since last night but we don't mind, thanks to the chilly breeze coming in from the river and the sunny rooms.

It's considered to be older than the monastery . lunch with Singphos Our next stop for the day is Piyong village, where a Singpho family has invited us for lunch. On our way to Piyong, we stop at the Chongkham Buddha Vihara. The ornate chong at Chongkham is more modern and Burmese in style than the older stilted chongs at Empong and Momung. Inside the compound are several golden pagodas or kongmus, with little carvings of the Buddha in their niches, and idols depicting scenes from the Buddha's life. We cross a steel bridge to reach the other side of the river, where stands the World Peace Pagoda. We loll around the river island under the bright afternoon sun, watching little monks being playful as they take turns to jump in the river. In Piyong, Ningru Onnong Maio and his wife Ningru Walet Maio are waiting for us with bated breath. They have called Sukiyo a couple of times since we left Empong. We greet the couple and meet our little host baby Sansan Maio, who is all dressed up in her cute Singpho dress. Her smile is infectious and we play with her as we wait for lunch to be served.

Onnong tells me that he is the great grandson of Ningru La Maio, who is believed to be Assam's first tea planter. I am curious. Onnong takes us to his uncle Ningru Chau Ja Maio's house. Adorning a traditional Singpho coat, the 70-year-old is the proud grandson of Ningru La Maio, and tells us that Ningru La was one of the many rulers of the Singpho community . The Singphos have been using tea or phalap, as they call it, since the time it required one to be seated atop an elephant to pluck the leaves. Ningru Chau Ja tells us that Major Robert Bruce of the East India Company came to know about tea after he was served a concoction of the beverage by Singpho king Bisa Gam in the early nineteenth century . The British sought Ningru La's assistance in locating tea-growing areas in Assam. Ningru La produced 35 boxes of the total 95 boxes of tea that the East India Company had sent for auction to London for the first time. Following the Singpho uprising in January 1843, he was deported to Arunachal Pradesh, where he spent the rest of his life. Intrigued by the story , we say our goodbyes to the Maio family .

The weather was pleasant; a thick line of clouds scattered about and gave way to a reluctant sunshine. The Kashmir Great Lakes Trek starts from Naranag\u2014a small hamlet wedged between two mountain lines. The place holds the ruins of an 8th-century temple, a disused shivling, a spring and a few stone carvings. The trail starts near this temple and winds up through pine trees ascending right from the hem of Butshiri Mountain. The steepness of Butshiri hides in its snaky trail and a patch of pine trees. The first day of the trek was strenuous. The steepness was felt in a few metres as everyone started panting, resting after every few steps. The ponies and porters ascended the way one descends, brisk like someone in a hurry . I was a little apprehensive to embark on this trek; a little reluctant to take on the ardent task of walking up the mountains, gasping for breath. But then a thought crossed my mind. What could transport one from the daily hustle-bustle and brooding routines to something refreshing and new? The answer was right in front of me. I joined the trek with a 'mixed group'\u2014men, women, Indians, Malaysians and others from different corners of the world. First Steps As the toll of ascending got heavier on us, some started ruing the thought of coming from afar places to this exhaustion, some thought it was better to go around tourist places, sitting in cosy hotel rooms and roaming around in cabs. But the trail turned easier after Butshiri Top. It opens itself onto Trunkhol Meadow\u2014a beautiful patch of grassy land circled by mountains. Our first day terminated at Nundkol Lake\u2014a beautiful lake calmly formed under the loftiness of Mount Harmukh. Harmukh, being cloudless, was beckoning and stared exotically at us; it was from this mountain, in 1856, that Thomas Montgomerie, the British Trigonometric Surveyor discovered K2.

Trekking felt debilitating, an age-old curse that was coming true in the meadows and mountains. Ascending reprimanding his comrades for suggesting trekking over beach visits to Goa. But a bowl of hot soup and instant noodles mollified him. It turned out that his hunger had overtaken his senses. We spent the next two days camping in the Gangabal Valley . We visited Gangabal Lake\u2014the largest alpine lake of Kashmir. The following days, we trekked through lush meadows of Satsar Valley and Gadsar Valley , crossed Zajbal Pass, visited the Bakerwal house made of mud and logs, and saw shepherds lazily grazing their flock of sheep. The entire meadow of Satsar is otherworldly in terms of its calmness and landscape. We forded little water-fed streams strewn with boulders and log bridges; occasionally , clumps of flowers would toss their heads in the breeze. trekkers cluB inc. We had a set routine. Though we'd begin our day on a chatty and cheerful note, the trekking enervated by the time we got back to our camps in the evening; often leaving us with no energy at all. I spent most of my nights sleeping like a log. The weather was mostly pleasant. New friendships were forged. My trek comrade was a middle-aged Malaysian trekker. Along the way he reminisced about his trekking life. He had trekked in Africa, Nepal, and Europe. Among all, he said, he loved Nepal the most\u2014a country that had a lot to offer in addition to its breathtaking and picturesque landscape. He said Nepal is austere in its offerings; it was the land of mountains, temples and simplicity . The day we left from Gadsar I looked up at the mist-shrouded sky . It drizzled first, and then as we covered some distance, it rained voraciously , the temperature dropped sharply and a thunderstorm whipped up the place. We all suited ourselves in rain gear, placing our feet cautiously . The sudden shower gave the meadow a further refreshing hue. It took us some time to reach the destination from which Gadsar Pass was visible. The rain inundated the trek trail. And as we neared the pass, the trail became less obvious. The verge of the already narrow trail shrunk, leaving whatever was left Mostly, people camp beside nundkol lake.

We had no choice, the guide told us. We were in the middle of the trek and halfway to the Gadsar Pass. Both ways, ascend or descend, it was going to be arduous. I rested near a big rock, looked up and caught a glimpse of the Malaysian trekker whom I had struck a camaraderie with. He was a tireless trekker, a fact that he didn't fail to re-emphasise time and again. To be honest, I did envy him. We finally reached Gadsar Pass after endless hours of trekking. The Gadsar Peak more than made up for all the blood and sweat. To see oneself at the top of the entire range, flanked by the Gadsar Valley on one side and two beautiful lakes\u2014Kishansar and Vishansar\u2014on the other, is an experience of a lifetime. For me, reaching this pass was far more strenuous than any other day of the trek, but also equally rewarding. We spent the next two days camping in the Vishansar Valley; feeding on trout and chugging down numerous cups of coffee and tea. a Dogged resistance The stream that ran alongside the campsite shimmered in the sun. An afternoon with Mary Jane seemed apt. I wanted to let the hundreds of thoughts recede. But I soon dropped the idea after sometime feeling that my mind was least jumbled, the seven days of walk into the mountains, body ache and fear had left my mind a little disoriented. I wished the trek would stretch for many days, beyond Sonamarg. To travel is to find an optimum point, the point where you let go of your past and don't contemplate the future.

Kashmir Great Lakes Trek has no sharp precipice hanging dreadfully over deep gorges; or a pack of bears lolloping down to eat your pound of flesh.

I was a teenager when I decided that food was my true calling and I wanted to pursue it professionally . Until then, I was simply acquainting myself with food in my hometown, Hyderabad. Helping at family events or enjoying different cuisines at my neighbours' homes, exploring the street foods and biryanis, all seemed quite novel and interesting to me. What started as a culinary exploration gradually grew into a passion. In those times Sanjeev Kapoor's TV show was the only inspiration and it was very hard to convince a south Indian family about the profession of a chef.

Mr Mein thanked the Ministry of Tourism GOI, and the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana, which is enabling and empowering youth in the region to leverage tourism as an instrument for change and progress. Director General, Ministry of Tourism, GOI, Meenakshi Sharma, spoke from her heart, as a senior representative of the government, and as an avid traveller herself. She said that we all need to be travellers, not tourists, when we come to explore peaceful destinations like Namsai, and preserve its identity by changing as little as possible. The Honourable Minister of Tourism, Nakap Nalo, highlighted the fact that Arunachal Pradesh is distinct from other states, and has enormous biodiversity, making it ideal for eco- tourism.

Meandering through the city, it is not only a delight for city dwellers and travellers alike but also a source of livelihood for many. The river bank is home to families of fisherfolk whose primary source of income is the fresh catch at dawn and dusk. The Hooghly River also has a deep-seated impact on the culinary scene of the city, owing to the availability of the fresh catch and a different variety each day.

Two Worlds: The Story of the Jews of Kochi by Dr KS Ma THeW & YaMini nair This illustrated coffee table book documents the history of the Jews in Kerala for over 2,000 years. Even as their culture wanes, it thrives with the keen attention of this community, who wish only to preserve their slice of life in the state. With the Jews' tenacious history unfurling worldwide, Kerala became a much-needed haven. One Heart. Two Worlds: The Story of the Jews of Kochi is laced with pictures depicting their life, some anecdotes and small informative sections on the religion and its practices, on symbols and instruments. Flipping through the book, one can find many handwritten songs and recipes. For instance, to make curries kosher, coconut milk is poured in so as to not mix dairy and meat. Or how tapioca is used in place of gelatin as a binding agent. There is much to unpack in this a Year In Provence by Peter mayle Expressed in the form of a vivid description, A Year In Provence unravels the excitement wrapped in local market visits, goat races, vineyard experiences and a verbal taste of Proven\u00e7al cuisine. British author Mayle's account, that starts with the episode of a New Year's lunch goes on to create an entirely new travel genre for readers. Amusement and insight blend easily in this timeless account and slow and simple living lies at the heart of this narrative. Mayle and his wife, Jennie left England and moved to the land of baguettes in the year 1987 , to live on a 200-year-old stone farmhouse in the village of Menerbes, southern France. More than just a reading experience, it plays like a visual reel that carries you through the streets of Luberon and leaves you with a memory of a regional food palette. Personally documented and detailed, the story comes with a basket case of wine, cheese and bread, the jostling of a competitive busy local market, traditional recipe of homemade marmalade, and raising dogs and cats simultaneously. A half-hearted diary that carved itself into fully-fleshed interesting chapters, Mayle's book, packed with style and witty remarks, inspired a whole new genre of travel literature. Penguin classics K475The Practice of asking those who don't think like us or those who express disappointment with the state of affairs in the country , to go to Pakistan, must have started sometime during the middle of the past decade. It was a little after that, that journalist Sameer Arshad Khatlani actually travelled to the country and ended up writing a travelogue about it, now called The Other Side of the Divide. Khatlani's book about his week- long visit to Lahore is a fascinating undertaking on many levels. A Kashmiri Muslim who was once hassled by the police at Jaipur's Sawai Man Singh Stadium, where he had gone to watch a cricket match, Khatlani writes unapologetically and with clarity , shattering all our conveniently held suppositions about our neighbour. As a Kashmiri, his status as a go-between, an interlocutor extraordinaire, is undisputed. He does exceptionally well at debunking the charitable template, the inevitable superior-brother gaze people often assume when they describe their travels to Pakistan in any form. The research is immaculate and the book benefits from the interviews and sketches of prominent personalities. With its inclusion of actual, human voices such as those living in the border villages as well as opinion-makers, Khatlani deconstructs the strange chimera of the enemy country .For sports lovers like myself and for those who send love from India and Pakistan on the comment sections of Coke Studio videos on YouTube, the book strikes a chord especially tenderly at moments such as when Khatlani recalls hiding his collection of posters that also had those of Pakistani cricket stars, with remarkable alacrity during a search operation at his house in Kashmir. Or when he raves about the superior motorways of the country , a fact that not many might acknowledge, but which has quite an underground following in India too. The Other Side of the Divide does the thankless job of giving an objective correlative to feelings of admiration birthed by envy . \u2014PrannaY Pathakthe Other SIde Of the by sameer a rshad k hatlani eBury Press K499 With its inclusion of actual, human voices such as those living in the border villages as well as opinion-makers, khatlani decon-structs the strange chimera of the enemy countryReaching for the Severed Arm outlook traveller 87 BOOK revieWS Back The sundar Bans covers 10,000 sq km of land and water in the Ganges delta and contains the world's largest spread of mangrove forests. Its beauty lies in the thousands of meandering streams, creeks, rivers and estuaries that enhance its charm and in the birds and animals that live there. The 'beautiful forest' is the natural habitat of the Royal Bengal Tiger and its rivers are combed by the 18 tides or atharo bhati that rule the lives of all those who live here. This tiger-haunted place is protected by Bon Bibi, the goddess with a Muslim name who with her brother Shah Jongoli were sent from Mecca to guard the forests against Dokkhin Rai, the demon spirit who ruled in the form of a tiger. This is the terrain against which Amitav Ghosh set his Hungry Tide, Gun Island and now Jungle Nama. Ghosh takes as his text the well-known story of Dukhey , the 'sad lad' who was taken by his rich merchant uncle to serve as prey for Dokkhin Rai. How long has it been since human flesh came my way What bliss to find a victim like this sad Dukhey There are many versions of this story and it links to the Bon Bibi Johuranamas, since Jungle Nama: A Story of the Sundarban by amitav ghosh har Percollins K699it highlights Bon Bibi's role as protector of the Sundarbans and bears testimony to the inclusive quality of belief in the region. The Johurnamas\u2014there are two of them composed by Munshi Mohammed Khator and Abdur Rahim Sahib in Bengali with Arabic and Persian words\u2014are written in the poya metre, 24 syllabic rhyming couplets. Following in this trend, Ghosh writes his Jungle Nama in couplets, using a freer version of the metre. This in itself is no easy task\u2014Vikram Seth has done it\u2014but matching couplets loosely or otherwise requires the seclusion of lockdown and Amitav Ghosh took full advantage of that. Some of the couplets may seem a trifle forced to lovers of Masefield and Kipling\u2014or even Seth. However, the story comes through vividly . The story of Dukhey was obviously used as part of a folk narrative for children in what Ghosh refers to rather preciously as 'Before Times' . However, he insists this has nothing to do with children at all, since the narrative covers the complexity of relationships, communities and the climate of the Sundarbans. Be that as it may , the story would have appealed to adults and children alike in evenings without light or television when the storyteller provided the only entertainment and people huddled together for safety against the forests of the night. Jungle Nama is a story of faith, forgiveness and closure and people, complemented by the mystic black and white illustrations of Salman Toor which create their own sense of disorientation\u2014an effect that Ghosh wanted so that his poem would stand apart instead of being the usual tiger meets boy narrative with childish illustrations. Possibly a greater balance of illustrations and text would have been welcome, but one cannot expect everything from an already unexpected book. \u2014anjana BaSuthe beauty of the Sundarbans lies in the thousands of meandering streams, creeks, rivers and estuaries that enhance its charm and in the birds and animals that live there. the 'beautiful forest' is the natural habitat of the royal Bengal tiger march 2021 88regular feature 88 BackRaveena Tandon's love for the hills and taking the road less travelled \u00bb What do you look for in a destination before you start planning your trip? Different places have different vibes. Some places are known for the cuisine, some for their historic culture and some have beautiful sights. It all depends on what the place has to offer. I make sure that when I plan a trip, it is wholesome for the kids. \u00bb What is it like travelling with your kids? Luckily the kids are as passionate as I am and they don't mind roughing it out either\u2014whether it is camping in the Himalaya or staying in government lodges. We love that old rustic feel, it's not always a luxury trip. As long as there is a bed to sleep in and early morning we are in the forest again, we are fine. And yes, with all the creepy crawlies in the bathrooms and on the bed! That's the fun of jungle life and we enjoy it. \u00bb any foodie recommendations from your recent Himachal trip? The dhabas there serve the most amazing bajre and makki ki roti, saag, vegetables, and gur. The hot ghee and gur in that snow is to die for! Their locally made bread, siddu, with walnut stuffing and masala is also great. \u00bb What's your favourite shoot location and why? Till now it's been Switzerland.

In fact, the 3C's\u2014chaos, conflict, and confusion\u2014sum up life on Indian streets quite aptly . From the plight of pedestrians to the pothole-riddled paths, chaos seems to be the underlying theme throughout. As the sun rises, city life slowly unfolds\u2014 and the start of the day can be seen in various forms on these very streets. Long before cars, scooters and buses dominated the Indian streets, it was cattle-oriented mode of transportation that could be witnessed here. But what often seems to evade public knowledge is that the streets of India weave a completely different tale post sundown; there's a certain character to each of the bylanes. It won't be too far- fetched to assume that in its heydays the streets were flanked with mansions. Today , the landscape has transformed beyond recognition. The lustre seems to have faded away and what remains is just a vague idea of the glorious past. \u2014roshni suBramanianindia 1960 As you spend your special moments with us, you would experience serenity as well as rejuvenation.
