Objective: This research aims to explore indigenous and non-indigenous spiritual healers' conceptualizations of MBS and consider implications for theory and practice. Design and setting: A total of 12 spiritual healers from Aotearoa/New Zealand participated in a semi-structured interview about their healing practices. Intervention: The research interview asked participants to discuss how they conceptualized the mind, body, spirit in their work. Main outcome measures: The data were analyzed using interpretative data analysis. Results: Transcripts of the interviews were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis, which led to the identification of three major themes: MBS interconnections of healing, impacts on the mind and the body, and spiritual aspects of healing. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for concepts of healing and conceptualizations of MBS. Keywords: Mind; body; healing; spirit; spiritual healer; spirituality.
