MATERIALS AND METHODS: T2DM rats were induced by high-fat diet combined with strepto - zotocin. There were normal control group, mod - el group, metformin group, high-dose Chinese medicine group and low-dose Chinese medi - cine group. Each group included 10 rats. Normal control group: normal feeding, no modeling, or - dinary feed, and gavage of 0.9% normal saline. Model group: rats, saline. group: Chinese medicine group: T2DM rats, high-fat diet, and gavage of concen - trated Chinese medicine at a dose of 6 times the clinical dose. Low-dose Chinese medicine group: T2DM rats, high-fat diet, and gavage of concentrated Chinese medicine at a dose twice the clinical dose. The general situation of T2DM rats was observed, and the changes of intestinal flora were observed with 16SrDNA sequencing. RESULTS: The T2DM rats induced by high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin were mold - ed. After intervention, at the class level, the ra - tio of -proteobacteria was 22.30% in the model group, 11.97% in the metformin group, 3.24% in the high-dose Chinese herbs group and 1.72% in the low-dose Chinese herbs group; the ratio of Erysipelothrix insidiosa was 4.73% in the model group, 4.68% in the metformin group, 3.93% in the high-dose Chinese herbsgroup and 2.92% in the low dose group; the ratio of Lactinobacillus was 2.30% in the model group, 0.01% in the met - formin group, 0.00% in the high-dose Chinese herbs group, and 0.00% low-dose Chinese herbs group; at the portal level, the Firmicutes/Bacte - roides was 0.88 in the normal control group, 3.40 in the model group, 1.71 in the metformin group, 2.74 in high-dose Chinese medicine group, and 1.34 in low-dose Chinese medicine group; at the genus level, the relative abundance of Lactoba - cillus in the model group was 3.28%, that of Ak- kermansia was 1.99%, that of Shigella was 22.08%, and that of Vibrio phaseus was 7.67%. All of them were improved after the intervention of metformin and traditional Chinese medicine. CONCLUSIONS: Potentilla discolor-Euony - mus Alatus could improve the composition and structure of intestinal flora in T2DM rats and reg - ulate the diversity of intestinal flora. The ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes was adjusted, mainly to increase the number of Bacteroides; the flora related to intestinal barrier was adjusted, mainly to increase the number of Lactobacillus and Ak- kermansia bacteria. Key Words: diabetes mellitus, Potentilla discolor, Euony - mus alatus, Intestinal flora. Introduction The treatment of obesity and diabetes is a long- term process. Traditional hypoglycemic drugs, such as insulin, increase the weight of patients to a certain extent, which in turn increase the insulin resistance of diabetic patients causing more dis - ordered blood sugar metabolism. Statistics have shown that the weight loss of 20 jin can reduce the risk of death of T2DM patients by 25%1. At pres - ent, there are many control strategies for T2DM, mainly including weight management, medical nutrition therapy, exercise therapy, smoking cessa - tion, blood sugar monitoring, diabetes education, oral hypoglycemic drug therapy (metformin, sul -European Rev iew for 1The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China 2The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China Shaoying He and Xinmei Qiu contributed to the work equally and should be regarded as co-first authors Corresponding Author: Rui Potentilla discolor- mellitus ratsIntervention effect of Potentilla T2DM rats9063fonylureas, glinides, TZD, etc.), insulin therapy, etc. In addition, there are also some new thera - peutic drugs2. The above drugs have achieved certain curative effect in lowering blood sugar, but at the same time, they also bring some adverse reactions3, which greatly affect the treatment effect and patient compliance. Therefore, the treatment of T2DM patients should have a definite effect in lowering blood sugar, reducing weight, and at the same time should avoid causing hypoglycemia, and protect the function of islet beta cells. More and more evidence shows that obesity, insulin resistance (IR) and T2DM are all related to the changes of intestinal flora. The abundance of Lactobacillus and Enterococcus in firmicutes is significantly increased, that of Bacteroides in Bac - teroides is low, and that of Bifidobacterium and Roche in Actinomycetes is low. At the same time, in T2DM patients, the abundance of Clostridium and other butyrate-producing bacteria decreased, and the oxidative stress resistance function of mi - croorganisms increased4. The abundance of four lactobacillus strains in T2DM patients increased, while that of five Clostridium strains decreased, and indicated that intestinal flora is very important in the metabolic changes related to T2DM5,6. In this study, taking T2DM as the break - through point, flora 16S rDNA sequencing meth - od was used, and the mechanism and treatment of T2DM after the intervention of the traditional Chinese medicine pair Potentilla discolor-Euon - ymus alatus were observed. Finally, the scientific connotation of T2DM treatment with traditional Chinese was clarified. Materials and Methods Drugs and Reagents Drug preparation 1. Took 800 g of Euonymus alatus and Potentilla discolor , refluxed and extracted for 2 hours for the first time, and used 6,400 ml of 75% ethanol; refluxed continuously for the second time for 1 hour, used 4,800 ml of 75% ethanol, and mixed the extractive solutions twice. After filtering, concentrated the extractive solution into 80 ml of concentrated solution (1 ml/10 g) by vacuum rotary evaporator. 2. Metformin hydrochloride, Aladdin, article number: M107827. Used 0.9% normal saline to prepare the suspension. The gavage volume was 10 ml/kg.Animals Model 50 rats were divided into 5 groups, 10 rats fed with normal diet and 40 rats fed with high-fat and high-sugar diet on unrestricted diet. Normal feed was purchased from Guangdong Laboratory Animal Center, and high-fat feed was purchased from Botai Hongda Biological Company. Establishment of Type 2 Diabetes Rat Model After 4 weeks of feeding with high-fat diet: (1) Fasting and water for 12 hours before modeling; (2) Prepare 0.1 mol/L citric acid (solution A)-so - dium citrate buffer (solution B). The preparation method is as follows: add 21 g of citric acid to 1,000 ml of double-distilled water in liquid A, add 29.4 g of sodium citrate to 1,000 ml of dou- ble-distilled water in liquid B, and mix liquid A and liquid B at a ratio of 1:1 to make the pH value 4.2-4.5. Then, the citric acid buffer (0.1 mol/L, PH 4.2-4.5) was prepared. (3) Take an appropriate amount of STZ in the dark as far as possible, dis - solve it in citric acid buffer on ice, and prepare a solution with a concentration of 1%. Protect from light, place on ice, and use up within 15 min - utes after preparation. (4) According to the body weight of the rat and to the STZ of 40 mg/Kg, the STZ solution was injected into the left lower ab - domen of the rat to induce type 2 diabetes. They received a high-fat diet immediately after STZ injection. (5) Criteria for successful type 2 diabe - tes model: collected blood from the tail vein for 3 consecutive days, and blood glucose was detect - ed. If the blood glucose level was higher than 16.6 mmol/L for 2 consecutive days, the modeling was considered to be successful. Grouping and Dosing There were 4 groups: model group, metformin group, high-dose Chinese herbs group, and low- dose Chinese herbs group. On the second day after successful modeling, the rats were given intragastric administration for 12 consecutive weeks of continuous intervention. Blood glucose and body weight were measured every week. The intragastric dose of rats was calculated ac - cording to 10 ml/kg body weight, and the intra - gastric dose of each rat was adjusted according to the body weight. Animal Material Before the experiment, the rat was fixed, the perianal area was sterilized, the tail was lift - ed, the abdomen of the rat was gently pressed S.-Y. He, X.-M. Qiu, Y.-Q. Wang, Z.-Q. Su, et al9064to promote defecation, and the rat feces were collected in a sterile cryopreservation tube, which was then labeled, stored at -80\u00b0C and shipped on dry ice. 16s rRNA was analyzed by Hangzhou Lianchuan Biotechnology Co. (Hangzhou, China). Statistical Analysis The measurement data of the experimental results were expressed as mean\u00b1standard devi - ation, and SPSS 23.0 statistical software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for analysis. Single factor analysis of variance was used for comparison of multiple groups of means, and LSD method was used for comparison between pairs. p<0.05 indicated that the difference was statistically significant. Results General Results Before modeling, the rats were in a good men - tal state, their fur was shiny, and their defeca - tion and water consumption were normal. After modeling, the rats were obviously depressed, with polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, and dull fur. After gavage of metformin and traditional Chinese medicine, the rats' spirits improved, and their mobility was more active than that of the model group. Due to the different tolerance of rats to STZ, three rats died in the model group, one rat died in the metformin group, two rats died in the high-dose Chinese medicine group and three rats died in the low-dose Chinese medicine group.Effect of Potentilla Discolor-Euonymus Alatus on Fasting Blood Glucose of T2DM Rats After modeling, the fasting blood glucose of rats in each group was significantly higher than that of the normal control group ( p<0.05). Compared with the model group, after inter - vention, the fasting blood glucose of rats in the metformin group and in the Chinese medicine group began to decrease ( p<0.05) after 4 weeks, especially in the metformin group, which indi - cated that Potentilla discolor-Euonymus alatus had hypoglycemic effect on the fasting blood glucose of T2DM rats (as shown in Table I and Figure 1).Table I.

Intervention effect of Potentilla discolor-Euonymus alatus on intestinal flora of T2DM rats9065Analysis of the Diversity of Intestinal Flora in T2DM Rats by Potentilla Discolor-Euonymus Alatus The diversity index of intestinal flora was used to evaluate the diversity of microbial flora among groups. In this study, indexes including observed species, Shannon, Simpson and Chao1 were used to evaluate the diversity of micro - biota. Simpson index refers to the diversity and evenness of species distribution in flora. Chao1 index is used to estimate the total number of spe - cies contained in flora samples. In our study, the Shannon and Simpson values of metformin group and traditional Chinese medicine group increased in different degrees. It shows that the diversity of flora is increased, and the distribution is more uniform. Therefore, Potentilla discolor-Euony - mus alatus could maintain the diversity of intes - tinal microbial flora in T2DM rats (as shown in Table II). Analysis of the Effect of Potentilla Discolor-Euonymus Alatus on the Diversity of Intestinal Flora in T2DM Rats Treated The diversity is a measure of the similarity of flora composition among different samples, and the difference of flora composition among dif - ferent samples is observed. In this study, NMDS analysis, PCoA analysis and ANOSIM analysis were used for diversity analysis. According to NMDS analysis, certain differ - ences among groups were detected. This indi - cated that the intestinal flora of T2DM rats was abnormal after modeling. And the intestinal flora had recovered to some extent after the interven - tion of metformin and traditional Chinese medi - cine (as shown in Figure 2). Analysis of Flora Composition at the Class Level At the class level, there were Bacteroides, Clostridium, Coriobacteriaceae, and Campylobacter in each group. Among them, the -proteobacteria in the model group was 22.30%, significantly higher than that in the model group ( p0.05). After drug intervention, the -proteobacteria level decreased significantly ( p0.05), with 11.97% in the metformin group, 3.24% in the high-dose Chinese herbs group and 1.72% in the low dose group. The rate of erysipelothrix in the mod - el group was 4.73%, which was significantly higher than that in the normal control group (p<0.05). After intervention, it was 4.68% in the metformin group, 3.93% in the high-dose Chinese herbs group and 2.92% in the low-dose Chinese herbs group. Actinobacillus in the mod - el group was 2.30%, significantly higher than that in the normal control group ( p<0.05). After intervention, it was 0.01% in the metformin group, 0.00% in the high-dose Chinese medicine group and 0.00% in the low-dose Chinese medi - cine group. All of them were significantly lower than those in the model group ( p<0.05). This Table II. Alpha diversity index of each group. Shannon Simpson Observed otus Chao1 4.13 each group. S.-Y. He, X.-M. Wang, Z.-Q. Su, et al9066indicated Potentilla discolor-Euonymus alatus herb pair could regulate the class-level flora of intestinal floras in T2DM rats (as shown in Figure 3). Analysis of Phylum Horizontal F lora Composition At the phylum level, the intestinal floras of rats in each group Firmicutes, was 0.88 in the control group and 3.40 in the model group, showing a significant increase compared with that in the normal control group ( p0.05). However, after the intervention of metformin and traditional Chinese medicine, the Firmicutes/Bacteroides decreased significant - ly (p0.05), being 1.71 in the metformin group, 2.74 in the high-dose Chinese herbs group and 1.34 in the low-dose Chinese herbs group. This shows that Potentilla discolor-Euonymus alatus can effectively regulate the intestinal flora disor - der of T2DM rats (as shown in Figure 4). Analysis of the Composition of Genus Level Flora At the genus level, the intestinal floras of rats in each group included: the - cillus and Akkermansia decreased by 3.28% and 1.99% in the model group ( p0.05). The relative abundance of Shigella Escherichia coli and - rio phaseus increased by 22.08% and 7.67% (p0.05). After the intervention of metformin and traditional Chinese medicine ( p0.05), they were all improved to a certain extent. This showed that Potentilla discolor-Euonymus alatus could im - prove the intestinal flora of T2DM rats (as shown in Figure 5). Figure 3. Analysis of flora composition at the class level.

Discussion According to IDF data, there are about 537 million diabetic patients in the world at pres - ent, most of whom are T2DM patients. T2DM is one of the main chronic diseases affecting human health. Intestinal flora has been proved to be involved in the occurrence and progress of T2DM mellitus. The disorder of intestinal flora can lead to the abnormal function of intestinal mucosa and the increase of intestinal permea - bility. As a result, many harmful metabolites cannot be excreted, but enter the systemic cir - culation, causing a series of inflammation in the body, and ultimately damaging the function of islet cells7-10. Some people have proved that it is one of the mechanisms of lowering blood sugar to correct the disorder of intestinal flora by adjusting intestinal flora. Traditional Chinese medicine is an oral medicine, which is bound to be absorbed by the intestinal tract and affect the intestinal flora. Potentilla discolor and Euony - mus alatus are used for treating diabetes. Our study observed the changes of intestinal flora in T2DM rats through concentrated extract in combination with Potentilla discolor-Euonymus alatus , thus further revealing the hypoglycemic mechanism of Potentilla discolor-Euonymus alatus for T2DM.According to this study, at the class level, the intestinal flora classes of rats in each group included Bacteroides, Clostridium, -proteobacteria in the model group was 22.30%, significantly higher than that in the model group ( p 0 . 0 5 ) . A f t e r d r u g i n - tervention, the -proteobacteria level decreased significantly ( p0.05), with 11.97% in the met - formin group, 3.24% in the high-dose Chinese herbs group and 1.72% in the low dose group. The rate of erysipelothrix in the model group was 4.73%, which was significantly higher than that in the normal control group ( p0.05). After in - tervention, it was 4.68% in the metformin group, 3.93% in the high-dose Chinese herbs group and 2.92% in the low-dose Chinese herbs group. Ac- tinobacillus in the model group was 2.30%, sig - nificantly higher than that in the normal control group ( p0.05). After intervention, it was 0.01% in the metformin group, 0.00% in the high-dose Chinese medicine group and 0.00% in the low- dose Chinese medicine group. All of them were significantly lower than those in the model group (p0.05). This indicated that Potentilla discol - or-Euonymus alatus herb pair could regulate the class-level flora of intestinal floras in T2DM rats. The presence of -proteobacteria in low-fat diet is low, while that in high-fat diet is high. Therefore, adjusting the abundance of intestinal flora of -proteobacteria is an important way to effectively prevent and control glucose and lipid metabolism; erysipelothrix has been detected in the urine of diabetic patients, which may be due to the low immunity of diabetic patients. As a re - sult, the erysipelothrix enters the body and causes some symptoms; therefore, erysipelothrix is also an important indicator of diabetes. Actinobacil - lus is closely related to infectious diseases, such as endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, etc. The increase of blood sugar in diabetic patients damages the immune system, thus increasing the abundance of Actinobacillus . In this study, the intestinal floras of rats in each group included Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Bacteroides was 0.88 in the control group and 3.40 in the model group. After the intervention of metformin and traditional Chinese medicine, the Firmicutes/Bacteroides decreased significantly (p0.05), reaching 1.71 in the metformin group, Intervention effect of Potentilla discolor-Euonymus alatus on intestinal flora of T2DM rats90692.74 in the high-dose Chinese herbs group and 1.34 in the low-dose Chinese herbs group. Stud - ies11,12 have shown that the number of Firmicutes in the intestinal tract of obese diabetic mice in - creased, while the number of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes/Bacteroides decreased. Firmicutes known as obese bacteria, can increase the accu- mulation of sugar and fat in the body and gain weight by improving the utilization rate of food. However, Bacteroidetes is called \"lean bacteria\". The increase of blood sugar in diabetes causes the abundance of Bacteroides to decrease but causes the abundance of Firmicutes to increase. So, the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in diabetic intestinal flora will increase. The same is true of this study. After drug intervention, the abun - dance of Bacteroides to Bacteroides increased, thus reducing the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroides . Figure 6.

S.-Y. He, X.-M. Z.-Q. Su, et al9070Therefore, discolor-Euonymus alatus medicine can regulate blood sugar in T2DM rats. At the phylum level, the hypoglycemic effect may be realized by increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes . In our study, the intestinal floras of rats in each group includes: the uncategorized relative of Lactobacillus and Akker - mansia decreased by 3.28% and 1.99% in the model group ( p0.05). The relative abundance of Shigella Escherichia ( p0.05). the intervention metformin and traditional Chi - nese medicine ( p0.05), they were all improved to a certain extent. It belongs to Gram-positive bacteria and is one of the normal intestinal flora. Lactobacillus is very important to maintain the normal intestinal balance of the body and is of great significance to intestinal health. It can play a probiotic role to increase the number of ben - eficial flora in the intestinal tract and adjust the structure of flora, thus enhancing the body's dis - ease resistance. Lactobacillus can produce short- chain fatty acids, such as lactic acid, to lower the pH value in the intestinal tract and produce anti - bacterial property, thus inhibiting the growth and reproduction of harmful colonies. It can maintain the intestinal barrier and keep the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells13,14. Akkermansia is also a normal bacterium in the intestinal tract of the organism, and it is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium . Some scholars have found that taking Akkermansia orally can improve the symptoms of mice with abnormal glucose and lipid metabo - lism. Akkermansia is also an important factor in maintaining the regulation of intestinal barrier, and it is very important to the homeostasis of the organism. Akkermansia can reduce the level of inflammatory factors in diabetic patients and improve the inflammatory state of the body, es - pecially the inflammatory factors caused by the increase of blood sugar. It can improve the glu- cose tolerance of diabetic mice and promote the expression of insulin secretion genes. Our study indicated that the levels of Akkermansia in the model group was the lowest, but it was improved after drug intervention. Therefore, increasing the abundance of Akkermansia in intestinal tract is probably one of the mechanisms of hypoglycemic effect of Potentilla discolor-Euonymus alatus . Conclusions Potentilla discolor-Euonymus Alatus could im - prove blood glucose levels, the composition and structure of intestinal flora in T2DM rats and regulate the diversity of intestinal flora. The ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes was adjusted, mainly to increase the number of Bacteroides ; the flora related to intestinal barrier was also adjusted, mainly to increase the number of lactobacillus and Akkermansia bacteria.
