It is composed of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to combat harmful pathogens, ranging from the common cold virus to bacteria. Scientists are continuously investigating ways to boost the immune system. Though there is no one specific \"medicine\" to improve immunity, many herbs have natural immune-boosting properties that can be easily integrated into your diet to enhance your body's defenses against pathogens. 1. Garlic (Allium sativum) Native to central Asia, [garlic](https://www.herbazest.com/herbs/garlic) has a significant role in herbal remedial culture because of its numerous medical properties as an antiviral, antibacterial, and antiseptic herb.
