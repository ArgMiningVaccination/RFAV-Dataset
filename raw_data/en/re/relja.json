Along with my thanks, I usually note that Yale Medicine is more journalism than jour- nal, a magazine rather than a medical tome. This is an important dis-tinction in academia, where the peer-reviewed scrutiny and serious aims of scientic publishing reflect one set of core values. We're a slightly different animal. Our primary goal is to keep alumni in touch with each other and informed about the work and schol-arship that goes on here. Our objective is to be intriguing to a wideaudience and still relevant to each of our readers, whose interests run thegamut from structural biology to the history of medicine. As cartoonistSidney Harris observes below, what one subspecialist nds hopelessly gen-eral may be incomprehensible to another learned person. It is our intent to bridge that gap in a way that readers will nd engaging. We hope you'll let us know how we're doing. As this issue went to press, we received some welcome feedback from the Association of American Medical Colleges, which honored Yale Medicine with its highest level of recognition, the Award of Excellence. Also this issue, we are completing the final phase of the magazine's redesign. I appreciate thesuggestions we've received along the way and hope you like the result.

I suspect myexperience during my tenure atYale in the early 1980s was fairlytypical. I certainly received themessage that truly caring about thepatient as an individual was veryimportant, but I did not receive anytraining regarding how to makethat \"caring\" experience happen onany consistent basis. This article tells me that Yale still cares very much about the patient.But I was disappointed to note itssuggestion that Yale still does notknow how to teach the studenthow to make the physician-patientrelationship happen within theshort appointment reality of pri-mary care today. I am now one of the chiefs of ophthalmology with Kaiser and ThePermanente Medical Group ( tpmg ) in California. I have also just beenrecruited to be the local \"communi-cation consultant\" in our facility.Communication consultants likemyself are given training on theessential ingredients of an effectivepatient-provider interaction. Theseevidence-based elements have beendubbed the \"Four Habits of theHighly Effective Clinician.\" Theyform the backbone of an eight-hourcurriculum which teaches the participants four key skills thatallow the physician to make a sat-isfying human connection withthe patient\u2014 even within a 15-minute presen- tations like those of Ms. Smith's arehighly valuable. I think the nextstep might be offering our physi-cians-in-training a program similarto tpmg 's, one that teaches specic and achievable techniques to im-prove communication. ellen kolarik, m.d. ' 85 petaluma, calif .TAKING THE PULSE OF HEALTH INTERACTIONS In the Spring 2001 issue, the article \" A Dramatic Turn\" provided athought-provoking look at the physi-cian-patient relationship. We wantto call your attention to anotherYale-based initiative that examinesthe clinician-patient relationship. The Program for the Study of Health Care Relationships, fundedby the Patrick and Catherine Wel-don Donaghue Medical ResearchFoundation, is a collaborative pro-ject between Yale University and theUniversity of Connecticut. The pro-gram's mission is to bring issuessurrounding the relational aspectsof care to the forefront of the ongo- ing discourse about health care inConnecticut and the nation. It seeksto enable patients, health-care professionals, providers, health policymakers and other interestedindi viduals to engage in successful partnerships, with the shared goalof improving patient outcomes,especially in the context of adher-ence to therapeutic regimes. A multidisciplinary team has been working for a year to study therelational aspects of care and theireffects on adherence. The interdis-ciplinary program provides a f orum for a range of issues, including healtheducation; the role of the Internetand technology; the influence oforganizations, insurance and poli-cy; and the relationships amongprofessions, as well as with patients.The group consists of physicians,nurses, social workers, consumers,academics and others, and has a website: info.med.yale.edu/nursing/hcr/ . sally cohen, r.n., ph.d., director, program for the study of healthcare relationships; associate professor, yale school of nursing THANK YOU FOR AN OUTSTANDING MAGAZINE May I take this opportunity to com- mend you on the excellent qualityand caliber of Yale Medicine .I ti s outstanding, informative, insight-ful and pleasurable to read.

WHAT THE STORY SAIDABOUT NEEDLE EXCHANGE I was very much impressed by \"What the Needles Said\" [Summer2001]. This very positive and accu-rate reporting of the events thatled to the creation and successfulimplementation of New Haven'sNeedle Exchange Program is per-haps the best summary of the pro-gram that I have seen. The Yale medical community deserves a great deal of gratitudefor its support of needle exchangeat a time when the entire nationwas still very much in a \"blackdeath/bubonic plague\" panic inregard to aids .

On September 11, a day of death and panic elsewhere, there was an odd sort of quiet in New Haven. In the med-ical school's clinics and classrooms, theday's routine activities fell by the way-side, overwhelmed by the horror of whatwas happening in New York, Virginiaand Pennsylvania. The medical centergeared up for an onslaught of traumacases that never materialized. For 24hours, Yale-New Haven Hospital was ondisaster alert for survivors who mighthave been pulled from the wreckage ofthe collapsed World Trade Center only 90miles away. But, said a hospital spokes-woman, \"It was the strangest kind of let-down. There were no patients to help.\" Medical school faculty and alumni who provided aid in Lower Manhattanexperienced a similar disappointment.Emergency physician Scott Weir, m.d. , a veteran of search-and-rescue effortsincluding the 1998 bombing of the U.S.embassy in Nairobi, had never seen any-thing like the devastation at the WorldTrade Center. During a week on thescene he treated no survivors, only res-cuers with minor injuries. Kenneth C.Rondello, m.p.h. '94, m.d., spent four days at the blast site and Chelsea Piers,where an ice rink became a morgue and the set of television 's \"Spin City\" atrauma center. \"No news footage you'veseen or cantruly do it justice,\" he said. \"The air waspermeated with the nauseating, acridsmell of burning jet fuel. Everything wascovered in inches of gray ash, as if a volcano had erupted.\"\"5 4 chronicle news from cedar street STEM CELL SCIENTIST URGES CONGRESS TO FUNDEMBRYONIC RESEARCH When Diane Krause, m.d., ph.d., pub- lished ndings this spring from her work on adult-derived stem cells in mice,she didn 't expect to become a player in a national political debate. \"I thoughtit would be important for those of us in the eld,\" she said in July, adding \"I didn 't realize it was going to get suchpress attention.\" Krause, an associate professor of lab- oratory medicine and pathology, identiedadult stem cells in bone mar row that can also create new liver, lung, gastrointestinaland skin cells. Working with collabora-tors at Johns Hopkins and New York University, she found the rst evidencethat these progenitor cells are capable of creating up to 15 di =erent mature cell types (See Findings , page 13). Since the publication of her work in the May issue of Cell, Krause has been besieged by media inquiries from aroundthe world. In early summer, she wasasked to testify on Capitol Hill. Her conclusions were published as the national debate over embryonic stemcell research was heating up and, to herdismay, have provided fodder to oppo-nents of such work, which requires thedestruction of human embryos. Thosewho oppose embryonic stem cell researchfor moral reasons argue that it is unnec-essary because adult stem cell researchshows such promise. Krause insists thatresearch down both avenues is vital. In July she had a chance to make her point before the U.S. Senate Appropria-tions Subcommittee on Labor, Health andHuman Services and Education, whichheld hearings on the federal government'srole in funding future embryonic stemcell research. Embryonic stem cell research needs to be funded for three reasons, Krause told the subcommittee. First, these cells can be grown in vitro , unlike adult stem cells. Second, because they are the mostversatile cells available, embryonic stem cells yield far more inf ormation on how they maintain that versatility than adult-derived cells. And third, she said, \"No one can predict which lines of investiga-tion will lead to e =ective and safe treat- ments for human disease.\" On August 9 President Bush out- lined his plan for funding embryonicstem cell research: only existing lines ofembryonic stem cells, left over from in vitro fertilization, could be used in fed- erally funded research. Research usingembryonic stem cell lines developedafter August 9 would be ineligible forfunding. On August 27, the NationalInstitutes of Health released a list of 64eligible embryonic stem cell lines. Scientists have questioned that list, noting that many cell lines are unavailableor inappropriate for a variety of reasons. \"The president's plan is not well thought out,\" Krause said. \"It doesn 't givefederally funded scientists the freedom to pursue scientic questions.\" On September 5, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompsontold a Senate committee that only about 24 of the 64 cell lines were ready for use in experiments. The usefulness of theremaining cell lines, he said, remains tobe proven.yale medicine autumn 2001In testimony before a Senate subcommittee, Diane Krause urged that federal funding be pro-vided to support embryonic stem cell research.Krause also took exception to the use of herfindings on adult stem cells to argue for restric-tions on embryonic stem cell funding. frank pooleStudents placed candles around the rim of the Women's Table on Cross Campus during a vigil the evening of September 11.Hundreds of people from throughoutthe Yale community gathered to honor the victims of the day's tragedies. michael marsland Life went on at Yale but the tragedy haunted everything that followed. No gathering could begin without someacknowledgement of \"the events of September 11.\" The day of the attacks,classes were canceled for rst- and second-year medical students, some ofwhom traveled to New York to volunteerin the Office of the Chief Medical Exam-iner. That rst night, hundreds of stu-dents and faculty members carried can-dles down College Street to a vigil atCross Campus. In the days that followed, the Univer- sity responded with drives for blood anddonations, along with lectures and dis-cussions on terrorism, foreign policy andIslam. Students at the School of PublicHealth held a teach-in. Medical and pub-lic health students visited local mer-chants of Middle Eastern descent to reas-sure them at a time when they might fear discrimination. On September 28,speakers invited by the Department ofPsychiatry and the Child Study Centerexplored the ways in which people copewith a world turned upside down. Among those determined to get on with their lives were Edwin Thrower, ph.d. , a postdoctoral associate in and hisanc\u00e9e, Bozena Sakowska. They decidedto go ahead with their wedding Sep-tember 15, even though his parents and friends in England could attend only via a conference call. The ceremonyincluded a prayer for victims of theattacks, and ended on an upbeat note.\"We had friends come from Manhattan,\"Thrower said. \"They said this was verymuch needed\u2014a celebration of joy, love and life.\"7 6 chronicle GRADUATE PROGRAM FOSTERS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY SPIRITAND A JUMP IN APPLICATIONS How does an academic program go from newborn to campus xture in onlyve years? Yale's Combined Program in the Bio- logical and Biomedical Sciences ( bbs) has accomplished this feat by uniting 11academic departments and fostering asense of community that's evident fromthe lab bench to the pages of its irrever-ent student magazine. Founded on the principle that re- search is inherently interdisciplinary andno longer conforms to traditional depart- mental boundaries, bbsprovides grad- uate students with flexible opportunitiesto study with more than 200 facultymembers from across Yale. \"There's a lotmore interchange than there ever wasbefore bbs,'' said Lynn Cooley, ph.d ., the program 's new director and a professor ofgenetics and cell biology. \"There's morecommunication, more coordination, andfewer territorial disputes over resources.\" The program is divided into eight interest-based tracks: Biological Sci-ences, Cell Biology and Molecular Physi-ology, Genetics and Development,Immunology, Microbiology, Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Neuro-science, and Pharmacological Sciencesand Molecular Medicine, each of whichdraws its faculty from multiple depart-ments. While students affiliate with asingle track, they have almost unlimitedresearch opportunities at Yale, includingaccess to faculty in departments such asComputer Science, Engineering, Psy-chology and Chemistry. bbsstudents \"can rotate anywhere and settle into thelab that's most suited to their interests,''said bbsAdministrative Director John Alvaro, ph.d . \"They have a nice home base and yet they have access to all thelabs on campus.\" bbs, which streamlined the admis- sions process and administrative structure for graduate students in thelife sciences, has also succeeded inrecruiting students. Applications jumpednearly 20 percent in the past year. One cornerstone of the program 's strength has been its partnership withBristol-Myers Squibb ( bms), which helped establish bbswith a multimillion-dollar grant in 1996. bms funds graduate study and provides opportunities for students to gain experience in pharmaceuticalresearch at its Wallingford, Conn., facility.One of Cooley's priorities is to expand partnerships between life sciences com-panies and bbs. She also plans to embark on a major fund-raising effort to estab-lish an endowment supporting graduateeducation. And she wants to continue to encourage collaborative research inemerging disciplines such as bioinfor-matics. The bbsprogram, says Cooley, provides \"a way for the campus to nur-ture new emerging scientic disciplines.\"yale medicine autumn 2001et cetera APPLICATIONS HIT AN ONLINE SNAG Every alum knows about the Yale System of Medical Education and its emphasis on inde-pendent scholarship over class rankings,grades and exams. This summer, applicantsto the medical school became familiar with a different kind of Yale system, created afterthe failure of a Web-based application pro-cess introduced by the MedicalCollege Application Service ( amcas ). Techni- cal glitches made it difficult for many appli-cants to file online, and the system for trans-mitting application data to medical schoolshas been crippled by software problems.Unfortunately, the old amcas paper-based system had already been dismantled, andmedical schools found themselves scram-bling to devise new procedures. The transition system developed by the Admissions Office and the school's informa-tion technology staff has worked so well that it has been adapted for use by othermedical schools. Despite the problems withamcas and a downward trend in medical school applications nationally, applicationsto Yale have remained steady, according toDirector of Admissions Richard A. Silverman.Meanwhile, amcas has developed an interim system of its own, sending printed copies of its applications to medical schools viaovernight mail. amcas has also announced changes in leadership and is devoting sub-stantial resources to evaluating this year'sproblems while working on a solution fornext year. CONTRIBUTIONS REACH NEW HIGH For the second year in a row, gifts to themedical school have soared. At the close offiscal year 2001, philanthropy from allsources totaled nearly $77 million, comparedto $63.5 million for the previous year and$40 million in fiscal 1999. Gifts from individ-uals more than doubled over the past year,from $15.5 million to $33 million. Of particu-lar note was record-breaking giving byreunion classes that celebrated last June.Donations from professional foundationstotaled $21 million; private agencies gavejust under $16 million and corporations gave $6 million. \"These totals are not only a reflection of the generosity of the manyfriends of the School of Medicine,\" said DeanDavid A. Kessler, m.d. ,\"but also a continu- ing commitment and support for facultyresearch and clinical excellence.\"Raymond Yesner, m.d., noticed two large ling cabinets that had been pushed intothe old dissection room. \"I was absolutelyknocked over by what I saw\u2014hundredsof Hemberger's paintings and drawingsstacked one on top of the other.\" Ane=ort to catalog the images began in earnest and steps to preserve the origi-nal works followed. Five years ago, JonS. Morrow, ph.d. '74, m.d. '76, hs'77, chair of the Department of Pathology, asked Katherine H enderson, the depart- ment's photography and graphics man-ager, to begin digi tizing the illustrations and transferring the original works intoacid-free, archival containers. Workingwith Deborah Dillon, m.d. '92, a faculty member who provided annotation formany of the drawings, this task has nowbeen largely completed. Last year, Judith Hokanson Barbeau, a public relations consultant hired by thedepartment, saw a stack of Hemberger'sart on a shelf and became interested inhis life and career. She located the artist'sson in New Hampshire, where sheexamined Hemberger's original water-colors, oils, woodcarvings and engrav-ings. She later located and interviewedHemberger's former students and col- leagues, recording information and per-sonal remembrances. Hemberger's work has guided gen- erations of medical students and physi-cians-in-training. One of them was Morrow, who said that the artist \"had anincredible ability to summarize theessence of the anatomical ndings of agiven condition in a single illustration.Hemberger conveys more informationabout a disease process in a single draw-ing than a pathologist can assimilate byseeing a dozen examples in dissection.\" With the support of Yesner and Mor- row, Barbeau hopes to make a lm about Hemberger, as well as organize an accom-panying touring exhibition of his work.FROM THE AUTOPSY SUITE, A TREASURE TROVE OF \"POST-MORTEMISM\" Before photography became the standard for capturing images of important ana-tomical ndings, pathology departmentshired specially trained illustrators to create visual materials for teaching andrecording medical knowledge. One ofthe most gifted among them was ArminBismark Hemberger, whose career atYale spanned six decades. Hemberger, who lived from 1896 to 1974, is the subject of new interest andmay someday be featured in a documen-tary lm and traveling exhibit. A student of Max Br\u00f6del, who is widely regarded as the father of American med-ical illustration, Hemberger worked inthe tradition of Vesalius, da Vinci andD\u00fcrer, combining artistic skill with a re-markable level of scientic accuracy toproduce brilliant images in pen and ink,pencil, gouache and watercolor. Approxi-mately 700 of these drawings are pre-served in the illustration collection of theDepartment of Pathology. \"Hemberger was one of the best,\" said Ranice W. Crosby, director emeritaof the Department of Art as Applied to Medicine at Johns Hopkins, whereBr\u00f6del's papers are archived. Born in Scranton, Pa., on April 1, 1896, Hemberger graduated from the Mary-land Institute of Art and Design in Balti-more. In 1917, he was recruited by Mil-ton C. Winternitz, m.d., as a medical illustrator for the New Haven Station ofthe Army Chemical Warfare Service. Hisdrawings are in two classic monographsedited by Winternitz, Collected Studies on the Pathology of War Gas Poisoning and The Pathology of Influenza . Hemberger returned to Baltimore in 1920 for a yearof study with Br\u00f6del before spending theremainder of his career at Yale. Heretired in 1962. In addition to his medical work, Hemberger painted landscapes and isrepresented in the collection of the Met-ropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 1987, during the construction of a new autopsy suite, faculty member John Alvaro and Lynn Cooley frank pooledepartment of pathology Armin Hemberger had \"an incredible ability to summarize the essence of the anatomical find-ings of a given condition in a single illustration.\"MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS THE TARGET OF EXPERIMENTAL SCHWANN CELLTRANSPLANT Physicians and researchers are hoping that cells from a nerve in a patient's anklewill stem the degeneration of the nervoussystem caused by multiple sclerosis. In July a Yale team transplanted Schwann cells from the sural nerve intoa patient's brain in an e =ort to reverse the stripping away of myelin, the protec-tive sheath that surrounds nerve bersin the spinal cord and brain. It was therst central nervous system transplan-tation to repair the myelin-forming cellsin a patient with multiple sclerosis. \"The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether the procedure is safe and has enough promise to jus-tify future research,\" said TimothyVollmer, m.d., associate professor of neurology and principal investigator onthe experiment. Animal studies have found that Schwann cells, which make myelin inperipheral nerves, can replace oligo-dendrocytes, which make myelin in thebrain and spinal cord. Vollmer and his team wanted to determine whetherSchwann cells can not only survive in the human brain, but also wrapmyelin around nerve bers and restorenormal function. Over two days in July Vollmer's team rst isolated Schwann cells from thesural nerve in the patient's ankle. Then,a neurosurgery team led by Dennis D.Spencer, m.d., hs'76, used a magnetic resonance imaging machine to guide a needle through the patient's frontallobe and inject the cells into a previouslyidentied multiple sclerosis lesion. For the next six months researchers willmonitor the patient with both neuro-imaging and functional assessments.Then surgeons will perform a biopsy tosee whether the cells survived and made myelin. The team included Je =rey D. Kocsis, ph.d., Stephen G. Waxman, m.d., ph.d., and others. The research is funded byThe Myelin Project in Washington, D.C.HOME MONITORS DEEMED INADEQUATE FOR SPOTTING SIDS Events that home monitors routinely detect as warning signs for sudden infant death syndrome ( sids), such as a prolonged cessation of breathing or aslow heart rate, may be common even in healthy infants, according to Yaleresearchers. \"This study calls into ques-tion the utility of home monitoring for sids,\" said George Lister, m.d. '73, hs '75, professor of pediatrics and anesthe-siology. The ndings were published inMarch in jama : The Journal of the Ameri- can Medical Association . A study group made up of physicians at institutions around the country moni-tored 1,079 infants, some healthy andothers considered at high risk for sids, for periods ranging from 16 to 66 weeks.Infants who were born prematurely, had a sibling who died of sids or had experienced a life-threatening event that9 8 rounds clinical medicine at yale SLOT MACHINES AND THE CINGULATE CORTEX The neurobiology of pathological gambling bears striking similarities to that of drug craving. From the green towers of the world's largest casino rising up from the Con-necticut farmland to the smash-hit television program Who Wants to Be a Million aire, a culture that promotes and glories gambling is all around us. But until recently, little has been done to investigate gambling addiction, a sig- nicant health problem that may be asprevalent as some other major psychi-atric illnesses such as schizophrenia,according to Marc N. Potenza, ph.d. '93, m.d. '94, an assistant professor of psychi- atry and director of the Problem Gam-bling Clinic at Yale. Research suggests a rise in the rate of pathological gambling during the explo- sive growth of legalized gambling in theUnited States, which began with state lot-tery systems in the 1960s, proliferatedwith riverboat gambling and casinos onNative American reservations two decadeslater, and now continues to expand withInternet gambling and video poker. While historically viewed simply as a sin or vice, pathological gambling hassymptoms similar to those of drug addic-tion, said Potenza, who is using brainimaging and drug trials to better under-stand its causes and to develop moree=ective treatments. \"The gambling industry is huge,\" he said. The $51 billion generated from casi-nos, lotteries and horse race betting exceeds the revenues of the movie, themepark and music industries combined. One estimate pegs the societal cost ofproblem gambling\u2014including legal feesfor divorces and incarceration, as well as health bills\u2014at $5 billion a year. Potenza believes the price could run far higher. While it is estimated that 86 percent of adults have gambled at some point intheir lives, fewer than 10 percent developa problem and fewer than 3 percent ofthose become pathological gamblers, hesaid. Still, many compulsive gamblersreport devastating troubles\u2014their livestorn apart by bankruptcy, divorce andcriminal activity. About a fth of patho-logical gamblers attempt suicide. Problem and pathological gamblers, though, have had few treatment optionsavailable. For example, about 85 percentof callers to the Connecticut Council onProblem Gambling's hotline reportednever having received any prior help fora gambling problem. Potenza is workingto change that. The Problem Gam bling Clinic, a col- laboration between Yale's Department of Psychiatry and the Connecticut MentalHeath Center, is one of only four sites inthe U.S. to participate in the rst multi-center trial of a drug to treat compulsivegambling. Initial data from the trial eval-uating the effects of paroxetine (Paxil)are encouraging, said Potenza. He isalso using functional magnetic reso-nance imaging to monitor the brain activity of both gamblers and healthy sub-jects who have viewed videotaped cuesintended to spark the urge to gamble.Only in the pathological gamblers didviewing the cues lead to lower activity inthe anterior cingulate cortex, a brainregion which has been repeatedly impli-cated in previous studies of drug cravingand mood states. While further study isneeded, the neuroimaging study may helpidentify a possible intervention point forpatients with the addiction.yale medicine autumn 2001 Marc Potenza has used functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize brain activityassociated with pathological gambling to theanterior cingulate cortex. frank poolerequired intervention were classied as high risk. \"The threshold for an 'event'conventionally used for home monitoringpicked up so many infants that it wouldbe hard to separate those who are normaland not normal,\" said Lister, who chairedthe study group. Researchers then usedspecial monitors to record breathing andheart rate patterns around the time of an \"event.\" The most extreme events, those that lasted a very long time by usual medicalstandards, were common only in infantsborn prematurely, but occurred before theage when sids was prevalent. The study group concluded, therefore, that extremeevents are not immediate precurs ors to sids. \"These early events might be mark- ers of vulnerability to sids,\" said Lister, \"but are unlikely to be events thatdirectly evolve into sids.\"james yangPATHOLOGISTS SET NEW CRITERIA FOR CANCER PRECURSOR Pathologists tracking the progression of disease from acid reflux to esophagealinflammation to Barrett's esophagus, a precursor of cancer, can 't always agreeon how to evaluate biopsies. Now, anational group of gastrointestinal pathol-ogists founded by a Yale professor hasdeveloped new criteria for grading pre-malignant changes in cells, also referredto as dysplasia. Criteria for grading dysplasia were established in 1988, but still led toinconsistent results among pathologists.\"That grading decision,\" said Marie E.Robert, m.d., associate professor of pathology, \"is made by looking througha microscope at a slide of a biopsy. It is very subjective.\" Using their new criteria, Robert and 11 other gastrointestinal pathologistsfound that they agreed more often oncategorizing dysplasia. Among the revi-sions they suggested was more attentionto the location of atypical cells. Atypicalepithelial cells on the surface of themucosa are more predictive of futurecancer than cells in the deep mucosa.The new criteria also sought to clarifythe di =erence between low-grade dyspla- sia, which usuallyprompts surgical resection, Robert said. A follow-up study of patients found a correlation between diagnoses with thenew criteria and cancer risk. \"When wemodied and discussed the criteria, therisk of developing cancer went up in alinear fashion, after earlier biopsy diag-noses of negative, low-grade and high-grade dsyplasia,\" Robert said. \"That would argue that our new criteria are valid andcan guide clinicians and patients on howthey ought to be followed once thesediagnoses are made.\" The Gastrointestinal Pathology Study Group, which included pathologists fromJohns Hopkins University, the Universityof Michigan, Vanderbilt University andothers, published their ndings in Aprilin Human Pathology .11 10 rounds INSTEAD OF A NEEDLE, SIMPLE MEASUREMENTS RULEOUT DOWN SYNDROME Yale researchers have developed an algorithm that allows physicians to gaugethe risk of Down syndrome in fetuseswithout resorting to amniocentesis, aninvasive procedure that could cause amiscarriage. Instead, physicians rely onwhat is called an ultrasonic biometryalgorithm, which measures risk basedon a number of factors, including infor-mation gathered by ultrasound\u2014measurements of the fetus's upper armand skin at the back of the neck. In a study published in the May issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Ray O. Bahado-Singh, m.d., associate professor of obstetrics andgynecology, reported that the algorithmproved accurate in almost 80 percent ofcases. Having this assessment allowsparents to determine whether to proceedwith amniocentesis.

Now, with a $1 million gift from Foresight Inc. and $1million in matching funds raised by Yale, theDepartment of Ophthalmology and VisualScience is on its way to establishing a centerto address problems in retinal functioning.The funding will be put toward the $5 millioncost of establishing a center to study thecellular and molecular biology and physiol-ogy of the development of the retina. Foresight Inc. is a Connecticut-based char- itable foundation. It was founded in 1968 by patients treated by Yale ophthalmologists.LESSONS IN GERIATRIC MEDICINE The care of elderly patients is far more complex than treatment of younger people,yet clinicians too often ignore this differ-ence. The medical school has received a $2 million grant from the Donald W. ReynoldsFoundation to teach medical students how to care for the aging population. \"With theelderly, any problem has many causes and consequences that need to be understood,\"said Margaret A. Drickamer, m.d., associate professor of internal medicine and geri-atrics at Yale, and lead investigator on theproject. \"It means asking more questionsand asking different questions.\" Drickamerhopes to integrate geriatric medicine intoexisting curricula. \"We don't want to takeaway from existing programs,\" she said.\"We just want to make sure the concepts are taught.\" of the virus and two hivproteins called Env and Gag put the monkeys' immunesystems on high alert, making them moreeffective against hiv, John Rose said. \"It is a very strong stimulator in both arms of the immune system\u2014the antibodies and the cellular immune sys-tem,\" he said. \"This holds down thespread of the infection in the animals.There are fewer infected cells. It is lessof a task for the immune system to holdthe virus in check and the viral loads go down to very low or below detection.\" The ability to deliver the vaccine in drops rather than through needles, saidRose, is crucial in developing countries.\"It would be impractical and very expen-sive to inject millions of people with dna vaccines,\" he said. \"The vsv-based vaccine would be a cost-effective andequally successful alternative to othervaccines that have been tested.\" In addi-tion, the vaccine proved far more effec-tive when administered nasally thanwhen injected intramuscularly. In two studies carried out over the past four years, the team vaccinatedseven monkeys and left eight monkeysin a control group with no vaccination.All 15 monkeys were then infected with a hybrid of human and simian aids viruses. \"We found that seven out of theeight unvaccinated monkeys developed aids in an average of ve months, while vaccinated monkeys have been aids free for up to 14 months,\" Rose said. Wyeth Lederle Products Corp. has licensed rights to the vector and is conducting further animal tests in col-laboration with Yale scientists beforeproceeding to clinical trials.13 12 findings from the IN A STUDY IN MICE, ADULT STEM CELLS REVEAL THEIR VERSATILITY Stem cells derived from the bone mar- row of adult mice, a Yale researcher and her colleagues have found, can cre-ate not only new bone marrow cells, but liver, lung, gastrointestinal and skincells. \"Thus far, this is the closest adult-derived stem cell to the embryonic stemcell, which can transform into any cell type in the body,\" said Diane Krause, m.d., ph.d., associate professor of labo- ratory medicine and pathology. Krausewas lead author of the study, which wascarried out by scientists from three insti-tutions. Their study was published inthe journal Cellin May. The research built on the same group's earlier experiments in mousemodels that showed that bone marrowcells could generate new liver cells,including hepatocytes and cholangio-cytes ( Findings , Fall 2000 | Winter 2001). Krause and her colleagues thenshowed that this regeneration alsooccurs in humans. \"However, we didn 'tknow if the bone marrow cell that could make liver was the same cell thatcould make blood,\" Krause said. \"We wanted to know what cell it was.\"In their most recent experiment, Krause and her collaborators irradiatedfemale mice, then transplanted a singlemale-derived cell. Using the Y chromo-some as a marker, they identied theprogeny of that cell. To their surprise,they found the male chromosome notonly in the blood and bone marrow, asexpected, but also in 15 di =erent cell types. \"The adult bone marrow cell, wehave found,\" said Krause, \"has remark-able plasticity.\" The other principal investigator on the project was Neil Theise, m.d., associ- ate professor at New York UniversitySchool of Medicine. Saul Sharkis, ph.d., of the Oncology Center at Johns Hop-kins School of Medicine, was the seniorauthor. Other collaborators were fromthe Department of Genetics at Yale andthe Department of Pathology at the nyu School of Medicine.AIDS VACCINE CLEARS FIRST HURDLE Livestock virus is the vector for agent that works in monkeys;nasal administration seen as plus. A vaccine that uses an attenuated live- stock virus as a vector for two hiv pro- teins has kept infected monkeys free of aids for more than a year, according to a team led by Yale scientists. The vac-cinated monkeys, some infected with a highly pathogenic simian aids virus for as long as 14 months, have not developed full-blown aids and their viral loads have remained low. The vaccineshows promise in another area; it can beadministered through nasal drops rather than by injection, making it moreaffordable and practical for use in developing countries, where aids is taking its heaviest toll. \"Based on our results we think it is likely that this vaccine could be an effec-tive aids vaccine in humans,\" said John K. Rose, ph.d ., professor of pathology and of cell biology. Rose and his wife,Nina F. Rose, ph.d. , an associate research scientist, led a team that included scientists at Yale, the Aaron Diamond aids Research Center, Tulane Univer- sity, Duke University and the GladstoneInstitute of Virology and Immunology.Their results were published in the Sep-tember 7 issue of Celland presented at the aids Vaccine 2001 Conference in Philadelphia in September. The virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv), is a preferred vector for vaccines because it provokes a strong immuneresponse. Although never tested inhumans, vsvhas proved effective in ani- mal models as a vector for influenza and measles vaccines.

The finding has also uncovereda previously unknown metabolic pathwaygoverning blood pressure that could offernew targets for medications. The finding, reported in the August 10 issue of Science , identifies genes on chromo- somes 12 and 17. In their mutated form theycan cause increased reabsorption of salt bythe kidneys and impaired secretion of potas-sium and hydrogen ions. This leads to a rareform of hypertension called pseudohypoal-dosteronism type II. The principal investigator on the study was Richard P . Lifton, m.d.,ph.d., professor of genetics, medicine, and molecular biophysicsand biochemistry and an investigator for theHoward Hughes Medical Institute.AN HERBAL CLUE TO INFLAMMATION An herb commonly used to treat migrainesinhibits a protein that causes inflammation,Yale pharmacologists have found. In an arti-cle published in the August issue of Chem- istry & Biology , a team led by Craig Crews, ph.d., associate professor of chemistry, phar- macology, and molecular, cellular and devel-opmental biology, showed that a componentof the herb feverfew targets a protein calledIkappaB Kinase, which is responsible forinflammation. \"Now that we have identifiedan inhibitor of this protein,\" said Crews,\"that information can be used to developadditional inhibitors.\"A CASE OF HIDE AND SEEK? Treated early, Lyme disease is usually curedwith antibiotics, but the prolonged form ofthe disease can be more troublesome. Yale sci-entists have observed that while the Lymespirochete is easily digested by immune cellsin vitro , rare bacteria within the body can withstand the onslaught of the immune sys-tem, perhaps explaining the spirochete's ability to survive long-term. Ruth R. Mont-gomery, ph.d. , set out with colleague Stephen Malawista, m.d., to determine whether the spirochete somehow weakened the immunesystem. Results of a study of mice publishedlast June in the Journal of Infectious Diseases strongly suggested that this was not the case.With defects in leukocyte function all butruled out, the team will look next at the otherside of the equation: how the spirochete maybe masking itself from immune surveillance.14 booksyale medicine autumn 2001The descriptions above are taken from the book jackets. send notices of new books to Cheryl Violante, Yale Medicine, P.O.

Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders,m.d., said during a visit to New Haven in early July. Speaking toteachers, principals, programdirectors and policymakers at the12th annual conference of theSchool of the 21st Century (21C)initiative, Elders urged schools toestablish clinics focusing on pre-vention.\"You can't educate peoplewho are not healthy, and you cer-tainly can't keep people healthy ifthey're not educated,\" said Elders.Established in 1988, the 21C initia-tive was founded by Edward F.Zigler, ph.d., one of the principal architects of the federal Head Start Program, Sterling Professor of Psychology and a faculty member in the Child Study Center.

He also oversaw the growth of the endow-ment fund and forged an agreementwith New Haven Hospital that allowedthe school to take charge of the wards anduse them for medical education. One ofBlumer's proudest achievements was theestablishment of the Department of Pub-lic Health in 1915, with Charles-EdwardAmory Winslow as its founding chair. In 1920, Milton C. Winternitz became dean. He oversaw the construction ofthe Sterling Hall of Medicine, the expan-sion of clinical facilities and the estab-lishment of several departments, includ-ing the Department of Pediatrics (1921),the Department of Obstetrics and Gyne-cology (1921) and the Psychiatry Group(1935). During his tenure, the Departmentof Surgery was moved to a full-time basisand the Yale System of Medical Educa-tion was established. Under the Yale Sys-tem, medical students were treated likegraduate students, required course examswere eliminated and electives were en-couraged. The Institute of Human Rela-tions, specializing in interdisciplinaryresearch in medicine, law and the socialsciences, was created in 1931. Accordingto the exhibit text, \"Winternitz evokedstrong emotions in his colleagues. Tosome he was brilliant, bold, and a 'steamengine in pants,' and to others he was aninsu=erable 'martinet,' a Napoleon, and an anti-Semite\" though he was Jewishhimself. In 1935 he was forced to stepdown from his post as dean, continuingon as chair of pathology until his retire-ment in 1950. Yale had three more deans during the rst half of the century: Stanhope Francis Among other notableaccomplishments, they succeeded in get-ting the medical school on solid nan-cial ground so that it could continue togrow following World War II. The release of the Flexner Report in 1910 was bad news for most of the nation 'smedical schools. Commissioned by theCarnegie Foundation for the Advance-ment of Teaching to evaluate the abilityof U.S. medical schools to train new doc-tors, consultant Abraham Flexner's ver-dict was that most weren 't up to the task.He recommended that the vast majorityof schools be shut down; in New England,he said, the only two worth saving wereYale and Harvard. And despite the tacitendorsement, the report singled out Yale'sthinly stretched faculty as a weak point.\"The instructors ... are overworked, beingcalled on to carry the routine work ofextensive subjects in all their parts with-out adequate assistance. Under such cir-cumstances, the work, however conscien-tious, is bound to be limited.\" The reportalso recommended that the school obtaina larger permanent endowment. The School of Medicine's bleak con- dition at the turn of the century and itssuccessful e =orts to rehabilitate itself are the subject of Medicine at Yale, 1901-1951 , the second in a series of exhibits at theCushing/Whitney Medical Library mark-ing the University's Tercentennial thisyear. The exhibit, which has been adaptedfor the web, shows how, in the 1920s,the school transformed itself from amediocre institution with part-time fac-ulty and limited resources into one of thenation 's top medical schools. With a full-time sta =, new facilities and many new departments, including the innovativeand controversial Institute of HumanRelations, the school generated enoughmomentum in the '20s to survive both theDepression and World War II intact. The Flexner Report's grim assessment of Yale's resources and facilities came asno great surprise to the school, which hadbeen struggling for its survival since the1880s. Herbert E. Smith, dean from 1885to 1910, had made some improvements.He tightened entrance requirements, ex-panded the curriculum and made e =orts to establish closer ties with New HavenHospital. His successor, George Blumer,dean from 1910 to 1920, was able to estab-lish a sorely needed, more functional sys-tem for key faculty, providing them with 17 16 capsuleyale medicine autumn 2001After Flexner, a new start In 1910, the medical school's fate hung by a thread. The deep criticisms it weathered in a land-mark report ultimately made it a much stronger institution. by Pem McNerney The Flexner Report of 1910 prompted Yale and many other medical schools in the United States to make fundamental changes. AuthorAbraham Flexner, above, recommended thatYale School of Medicine remain open but thatit bolster its fund-raising and hire full-time faculty, among other improvements.from top George Blumer, dean of the medical school from 1910 to 1920, started making many of the reforms that were needed to improve theschool's operations. When Blumer steppeddown as dean in 1920, he became the DavidPaige Smith Clinical Professor of Medicine untilhe retired in 1940. Harvey Cushing was enormously fond of Yale College, his alma mater. But when the Univer-sity invited him to become a professor of surgeryin 1907, he declined the offer because he feltYale did not have adequate control of clinicalfacilities at New Haven Hospital. He went on tohave a distinguished career as a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins and Harvard. Then, upon hisretirement from Harvard, he came to Yale as a professor of neurology in 1932. His rare bookcollection was bequeathed to Yale in 1939. Milton Winternitz, dean from 1920 to 1935, presided over the boom years of the medical school following World War I, when it emergedas one of the top medical schools in the coun-try. Winternitz embarked on a campaign ofbuilding buildings, hiring faculty, organizingdepartments and raising money to finance itall. The son of an immigrant doctor, Winternitzwas controversial and evoked strong feelingsamong his colleagues. He was forced to stepdown as dean in 1935, but continued on as chairof pathology until his retirement in 1950. In 1916, the Yale School of Medicine admitted women students for the first time. Louise Farnamwas one of two women to graduate in 1920.She won the Campbell Gold Medal for scholasticachievement. Her classmate, Helen May Scoville,was later hired by Yale as an instructor. background During World War I, the medical school organized a mobile hospital unit. Itarrived in France in early 1918, spent the winter in Limoges and moved to the front during amajor German offensive. The group improvedits efficiency to the point where it could operate on one badly wounded patient every45 minutes.More on the Web info.med.yale.edu/ymm To view the online exhibit Medicine at Yale, 1901-1951 , please visit our website and select extras . bettmann/corbis historical library of the cushing/whitney medical library (5)18yale medicine autumn 200119 An intensive week at the bench in Maine introduces students to modern lab strategies and techniques,ancient DNA and a clambake to write home about.

Or thatthey ended their rst year by seeking clues to human disease inthe organs of a sh that reached its evolutionary peak morethan 300 million years ago. This past June that pool of sharks lured about two dozen Yale students to Salisbury Cove, Maine, just a few miles from Bar Harbor. For more than a century, scientists at the Mt. DesertIsland Biological Laboratory here have explored the genes sharedby sh and humans. For about half its lifetime, the labora-tory has had strong ties to the School of Medicine, a relation-ship that began in the 1950s, when Franklin Epstein, m.d. '47, hs'49, professor of medicine, began bringing residents and fellows to Maine. In June 2000, for the rst time, med- ical students arrived for a week's training in bench research. This year another group of students repeated the Intensive Pedagogical Experience, a program designed to introduce themto the strategies and techniques of laboratory science and toencourage them in careers as physician-scientists. Most of thestudents arriving in June had just completed their rst year of medical school; the group also included a student who beganmed school this fall. In the course of their week on Mt. Desert Island, the students cloned genes, learned to synthesize dna by means of polymerase chain reaction and generated copies of pro-teins by inserting rna into frog eggs. They also learned the difference between Western blots, used to nd specic proteins, and Southern and Northern blots, used to nd the rna and dna for specic genes. Rupali Gandhi, who is beginning her second year at Yale this fall, majored in biology as an undergraduate, then went on to get a law degree at Yale before taking up medicine.\"I hope to come away from this course with a better under-standing of a lot of research methods so that the next time I read a journal article my eyes won 't glaze over the methodssection,\" she said, sitting on a porch outside one of the manylaboratory buildings scattered throughout the forest. Under-standing research strategies and gaining familiarity with thescientic method are among the goals of the course, accord-ing to its director. \"The idea of rigorous pursuit of a question and a clear hypothesis is applicable to all that students do in research atYale,\" said John N. Forrest, m.d., hs'67, who heads the Ofce of Student Research at the medical school and is directorof the Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory, where he hasspent the last 32 summers. Long before the rst group of Yale students traveled to Maine, the notion of an intensive laboratory experience was brewing in the mind of Dean David A. Kessler, m.d. As an undergradu- ate at Amherst College, he spent four weeks one summer at theWoods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. The time he spentstudying macrophage inhibition factors in sea urchins served asa model for the program in Maine. Kessler wanted to providestudents with both hands-on laboratory experience and a chanceto interact closely with faculty. \"You get to see things you justdon 't see sitting in a lecture hall,\" he said. \"This is what educa-tion should be.\" And holding the course on Mt. Desert Islandfreed students and faculty from the day-to-day distractions ofbeing on campus. Nestled amidst hundreds of acres of woodlands, the buildingsat the Mt. Desert Island BiologicalLaboratory belie their true pur-pose. Although it resembles a rus-tic fishing camp, the laboratory is the summer home to scientistsfrom around the world. The view from the laboratory's dock on Mt. Desert Island's north-ern shore takes in evergreenforests and rocky shores typical of the Maine coast.22Sharks, salt (and a taste of lobster)23yale medicine autumn 2001 the importance of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the post-genome era? Students may look at the entire organ, measuring its func- tion with agents such as barium, forskolin or ibmx , which inhibit or stimulate chloride transport. For another experiment,working with tissue from the gland, they isolate a protein andtry to turn on and off its capacity to transport sodium, potas-sium and chloride. They may phosphorylate the protein andlook for signs of activity. When they look through a confocalmicroscope, the students expect to see a lot of green, a sign thatphosphorylation has activated the cotransporter protein. Theyalso take the cftr chloride channels they've generated in frog eggs and measure their electrical activity. Continuing that exper-iment, they add hormones to open and close the channels. The science behind the experiments was complex, and at times the mechanics could be demanding and repetitive. One rainy afternoon medical student Jenny Blair watched as ashark's salt gland excreted liquid into a narrow-bore pipette several inches long. When the pipette lled, every few minutesor every few seconds, depending on whether chemical agentswere involved, she inserted a new pipette into tubing comingfrom the gland, while others on her team measured theamount of liquid, then determined how much chloride it con-tained. Upon completing the experiment, they calculated thegland's ability to excrete chloride under the conditions studied. Part of the students' fascination comes from knowing that another team in another lab or rotation will pick up on theirexperiments. \"We took the body parts of a shark and extracted rna from them,\" said student Benjamin Negin, describing a typical research sequence. \"Then we passed the baton on to the next group. They're turning the rna into dna. The nal group is using polymerase chain reaction of the dna to identify what it is.\" Niya Jones and Bao Duong were part of the second team in the sequence Negin described. They learned how to manipulatea pipette to insert shark dna into an agarose gel. They were ltering the dna by size, looking for the genes related to a family of proteins that regulate chloride transport. Steve Aller, a doctoralcandidate at Yale, guided them through the process, teachingthem how to hold the pipette so the dna slips into a well in the gel wi thout smearing. When, at the end of their experiment, they found a set of small genes they could not identify, Jones and Duong passed them offfor further research to the next team in the rotation. \"If it's a sub-unit of the cftr channel or an unrelated protein, it would beForrest scheduled the course for early June, after students have completed their medical school course work and before the lab'shigh season in July and August, when its year-round populationof 17 staff members swells to more than 200 principal investiga-tors, postdocs, graduate students and laboratory technicians. Amidst the laboratory's 350 acres of poplar, pine, spruce and cedar forest, the hierarchy that typically rules academia takes asabbatical. First of all, the laboratory, with its shingled and weath-ered buildings in the woods, looks more like a shing camp than a research center for top scientists from more than 50 institu-tions. But enter those buildings and you'll see they're lled notwith lobster pots and shnets, centrifuges and a gene sequencer. Dress is informal. Asoften as not, students and faculty wear T-shirts, shorts and san-dals. They spend most of their waking hours together. And, mosttroubling for some students, only rst names are used. \"We allknow him as Dr. Forrest because he's the head of research,\"said student Dena Springer. \"We come here and he's John.\" At the heart of the students' experiments is the rectal gland, an organ unique to sharks and other sh. Local shermen pro-vide a regular supply of spiny dogsh sharks, also known asSqualus acanthias , a relatively benign member of the shark order. Between 16 and 20 inches long, they are decidedly passive com-pared to their great-white cousins. Students say these sh willbite, but only if you stick a nger in their mouths. Their rectalgland is a highly specialized organ whose only function is topump salt. Among the gland's virtues is its relatively large size,about an inch long, making it easier to manipulate for neo-phyte researchers than cells or molecules. Examining a sh 's ability to control its salt may seem a highly esoteric eld of study. Yet the rectal gland offers clues to under-standing cystic brosis, the most common fatal childhood dis-ease and one that is also concerned with salt imbalance. It iscaused by a genetic disorder, the malfunction of a protein calledthe cftr chloride channel, which renders the body unable to regulate chloride transport. Without the proper functioning ofthis protein, a sticky mucous secretion develops, clogginglungs, sinuses and the digestive system. Working in four groups of six, the students approach the gland from various perspectives. Over the course of a weekthey try to answer these and other questions: What is the func-tion of the rectal gland in the shark? How is secretion by the gland regulated by known agents and second messengers?What is the function of cftr ? Can we determine Na-K-Cl cotransporter activation in an isolated cell preparation?

(Frizzellarranged a similar program this year for medical students fromPittsburgh, who arrived a week before the Yale students.) If the rst year of the Intensive Pedagogical Experience offered any lessons, it was that the schedule left students littletime to enjoy Mt. Desert Island. This year, students had a freeafternoon and evening every other day. During those free hoursForrest and Forbush led bicycle and hiking tours of the island. On Friday, the last day of the course, students made their nal presentations after lunch and had the rest of the day tothemselves. That evening Forrest organized a clambake at Sea-wall, a picnic area and campground at Acadia National Park in asection of the island the locals call the \"quiet side.\" Forrest arrivedearly to stoke a bonre for cooking. Before long, lobsters andbags of vegetables and mussels were steaming in huge pots ofseawater as the sun set over the rocky shore. Earlier in the week Forrest sat on a wooden chair outside his lab on a bluff overlooking Mt. Desert Island's Eastern Bay andmused about the course. One of its virtues, he said, is a \"confer-ence room \" like this, in the shade of a tree with the ocean below.\"It's asking a lot,\" he said, \"to say you're going to change peo-ple's lives in a week, that people are to change their career goalsbased on a week's experience. But this course has the potentialto encourage people who otherwise might not think about aresearch career. Some of these students have never run a gel,ground up tissue or looked at cells under a microscope in aresearch mode before. Here we have very bright students learn-ing all this medicine from lectures, books, videos and the Inter-net. Unless they are looking inside a cell, thinking about how tostudy some component of how that cell functions, unless theyare striving to interpret what really exists, from their own ques-tions, they are going to be passive recipients. The idea of hands-on work is often so illuminating that it leads people to say, 'Thisis what I want to do for the rest of my life.'\" YMof nature,\" said Jerilyn Bowers, director of development andpublic affairs at Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory. \"Hewanted this to be a very cultural, artistic society.\" The laboratory was founded at a time when scientists had embraced Darwinian thought and looked for answers to humanbiology in the sea, where life began. Dozens of marine biologylabs sprang up, but only three in New England have lasted: WoodsHole, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York and the Mt.Desert Island Biological Laboratory. Of the three, only the Mt.Desert Island laboratory continues to study links between shand humans. Among its neighbors on Mt. Desert Island is TheJackson Laboratory, the world's largest mammalian geneticresearch facility, which specializes in breeding genetically engi-neered mice for research. As a research center the Mt. DesertIsland Biological Laboratory has brought forth signicant dis-coveries, said Bowers. \"Much of what we know today about howthe kidney functions came from early research conducted here,\"she said. The c dna of several sodium chloride transporters was rst cloned here by two scientists now at Yale, Steven C. Hebert, m.d., chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Physi- ology, and Biff Forbush, ph.d., professor of cellular and molec- ular physiology. A quarter-century ago the laboratory renewed its educational focus by offering programs for both graduate and high schoolstudents, along with conferences and symposia for scientistsfrom around the world. Still going strong is an eight- to 10-weeksummer science program for high school students from sur-rounding Hancock County. (One of those alumni, Aller, is nowa ph.d. candidate in molecular biophysics and biochemistry at Yale and an instructor in the summer program for Yale medicalstudents.) It is also strengthening its research component witha ve-year plan to recruit three scientists who will be the labora-tory's rst year-round researchers. Throughout the years, according to those who know it well, the lab worked its magic through an informal environment that brought together biologists, physicians, basic scientists andstudents and, by its remoteness, encouraged cross-fertilizationof ideas. \"It is more conducive to learning and picking up dif-ferent approaches than if you just stay with your own groups,\"said Boyer. \" At Yale,\" he added, \"you have to go out of your wayto make those interactions. Here, you can 't help but do that.\" For medical students, it is these interactions that make the experience worthwhile. In their evaluations of the program 'srst year, students said that the opportunity to work in smallgroups with faculty was one of its most attractive features. john curtis is the associate editor of Yale Medicine.More on the Web info.med.yale.edu/ymm To explore the Mt.

Not all the experiments yield clear results. In presenting their ndings students were refreshingly honest about the suc-cesses and failures of their experiments, as well as the unan-swered questions. \"We don 't have wild-type data,\" said one stu-dent whose team explored mutations in ion channels, \"becauseit got messed up.\" \"The sequencing did not work,\" said a mem-ber of Epps's group, which had hoped to identify unknowngenes, \"and we're not sure why.\" Most experiments proved suc-cessful, insofar as the students noted patterns of behavior inthe way cells responded to stimulants and inhibitors. For exam-ple, John Koethe explained the slopes and valleys on a graphthat tracked the rectal gland's response to different agents.\"They show barium inhibition, recovery, then inhibition,\" hesaid. Another group working with rectal gland slices andtubules found that forskolin and ibmx activated the chloride channel, leading to chloride excretion. Working with the wholegland, one team reported inconclusive results of their experi-ment; a high dose of potassium inhibited chloride secretion buta low dose yielded mixed results that offered no rm conclu-sions as to its effect. The experiments conducted here are a natural outgrowth of the laboratory's focus on the physiology of marine and humanorganisms. Sharks, for example, reached evolutionary perfec-tion between 300 million and 400 million years ago and havechanged little since. Their genome is about 70 percent iden-tical to that of humans. \"Humans adopted many of the success-ful systems they evolved,\" said James L. Boyer, m.d., hs'67, Ensign Professor of Medicine and director of the Yale LiverCenter, who heads the Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory'sboard. \"That is why we are able to use those marine creaturesfor relevant research on human systems. The differences arefar fewer than the similarities.\" Since its founding as a summer school for Tufts University students in 1898 in South Harpswell, Maine, the biological laboratory's focus has shifted between education and research.It rst taught marine biology to undergraduates, but quicklybecame a center for marine research as well. In 1921 a land-hold-ing organization, Wild Gardens of Acadia, offered the lab 100acres on Mt. Desert Island. George B. Dorr, one of Wild Gar-den 's leaders, was instrumental in founding Acadia NationalPark and had a vision for Mt. Desert Island. \"He believed thispristine setting would be an ideal circumstance for the study The week in Maine ends with a clambake, campfire and sing-along at a park on theisland's \"quiet side.\"27 26yale medicine autumn 2001a world Yale's International Health Program sends young doctors around the globe to provide needed care\u2014and learn the basics of a simpler medicine. by HaitiIsraelPakistanNepal Vietnam BoliviaBrazil Zimbabwe South Africa images courtesy michele barry, frank bia, joel gallant, delia radovich and photodisc29 28A world of difference Zimbabwe in 1988, he now serves as associate director of the Johns Hopkins aids Service. \"It was always my goal to be work- ing with underserved populations in developing countries,\" saidGallant. \"However, my training at Yale and at Hopkins showedme that there were underserved populations on our doorstep,and that was especially true with aids .\" The fact that many participants in the program go on to care for marginalized patients appealed to the contributions com-mittee at Johnson & Johnson, according to Conrad Person, itsdirector of international programs. The New Jersey company'scredo calls for community and global responsibility. \"This pro-gram t,\" said Person. \"Yale was able to demonstrate that peoplewho participated in this program were more likely to developcompassion in the practices they developed years later.

Next year, the gift will allow the programto expand to include residents from other medical scho ols as well as physicians with established practices. Bia estimates that thegrant will come to about $350,000 annually, covering expensesformerly paid for by the Department of Medicine and incomefrom a travelers' clinic run by Barry and Bia. Yale-New Haven Hos-pital will continue to pay residents' salaries while they are away. For Radovich, now a fellow in hematology/oncology at Memo- rial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the experience of workingabroad was invaluable. \"I chose Yale for Yale, not even knowingthat this program was in place. But I think people should cometo Yale in droves, knowing this is an option.\" September 11 hasn 't diminished the program 's ambitions; if anything, it has set the bar higher, Barry told a group of students attending the poster session for the Downs Interna-tional Health Student Travel Fellowship Program in October.\"There is a whole world out there that is going to need you evenmore,\" she said to the students, who had conducted researchabroad. \" As America becomes more xenophobic, and as morehealth care workers hunker down and stay in the United States,I just hope you keep your global vision.\" YMyale medicine autumn 2001 cathy shufro is a contributing editor of Yale Medicine and a tutor in the Bass Writing Program at Yale.Ramona Farid, m.d., knew she wasn 't in New Haven anymore the night she found herself on a hospital patio pouring a patient'surine on an anthill. She was testing for glucose. If she'd been at Yale, Farid wouldn 't have had to think twice about how to follow the progress of a 16-year-old girl in diabeticketoacidosis, or dka; she would simply have ordered nger sticks at two-hour intervals and checked the patient's blood for glucose using a glucose mo nitor. But this was rural Haiti, where the second-year resident was working for a month with Yale'sInternational Health Program ( ihp). It was 2 a.m., and there wasn 't a test strip to be found at H\u00f4pital Albert Schweitzer. \"I said, 'How the heck am I supposed to manage dka with- out Chemstrips?'\" recalled Farid. Finding low-tech (or no-tech) strategies for diagnosing and treating patients is one of the challenges for residents like Faridwho take part in the Yale ihp. Since 1981, the popular program has sent residents in internal and emergency medicine to serve more than 300 rotations overseas or in Indian Health Servicehospitals in the United States. This year, 40 of the 100 resi-dents in internal medicine will spend four to eight weeks inlocales ranging from Alaska to Zimbabwe. They will be the rstto be sponsored by a grant from Johnson & Johnson that willfund the 20-year-old program and allow it to expand. That night in Haiti, Farid realized she understood enough about diabetes to monitor her patient's ketoacidosis withoutChemstrips. Talking on the phone with the Haitian attending, shesaw the logic behind the anthill approach. In a patient in dka, glucose levels would be high not only in blood, but also inurine. By observing how many ants were attracted by the sugar in the girl's urine compared to urine from someone without diabetes, Farid could track the decline in the patient's glucoselevels. And so, for the rest of the night, she went out to theanthill with urine samples every two hours. At 8 a.m., the antsstopped coming. Farid took the girl o =the insulin drip and sent her home with injectable insulin. The insight that Farid gained in Haiti\u2014recognizing that she had useful knowledge of a disease independent of expensivetechnology\u2014is one of the goals of the ihp, according to Frank J. Bia, m.d., its co-founder with Mich ele Barry, m.d., hs'77. With the extensive use of diagnostic radiology and laboratory testing,said Bia, young doctors today \"often are not allowed to think through a diagnosis. The diagnosis might be handed to them on a silver platter, or an mri scan.\" Overseas, residents \"have to go back to actually listening and touching. We feel these are veryimportant skills to bring back to the art of being a doctor.\"In a retrospective study of the program, residents reported that by practicing back-to-basics medicine they gained con-dence in their ability to do physical examinations and came tovalue them more. The study by Robert Wood Johnson ClinicalScholar Anu J. Gupta, m.d. '94, hs '00,was published recently in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene . Residents in the program also have the chance to try proce- dures they rarely get to practice at home. At the Alaska NativeMedical Center in Anchorage, second-year resident Walter Lin, m.d., helped with a bone marrow biopsy and saw internists take on other tasks usually reserved for specialists. In South Africaand in Cuba, resident Delia Radovich, m.d., hs '01, found that practicing medicine where care is free and resources are limitedwas liberating. She did not have to document every move shemade, haggle with insurers or track myriad conrmatory tests.Working in a medically underserved area, she said, \"makes you a better doctor just by realizing the whole world doesn 't work the same way the United States works. It makes you more human. It pulls you out of your daily grind, and it brings you back to the real reason you chose medicine, or should have chosen medicine: taking care of patients.\" The physician 's obligation to care for patients provides the motive for the International Health Program, said Bia. \"It's a pro-fessional ethic that guides the program. You have a social con-tract that extends beyond the walls of the hospital, and which oth-ers do not have. You have taken the Hippocratic Oath.\" Barry, who is president-elect this year of the American Soci- ety of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, said the goal of the pro-gram is \"not to train tropical disease doctors but to instill a senseof global responsibility. Our philosophy is opening people's mindsto underserved areas around the world, not only overseas butalso in New Haven.\" Alumni of the program have chosen careers reflecting this vision. Gupta's study found that the 130 Yale residents who wentabroad between 1982 and 1996 were more likely than their coun-terparts to practice in public health settings and more likely tocare for indigent patients, immigrants, substance abusers andpatients with hiv. For instance, among the doctors in the study who now practice in public health settings, 10 had participatedin the International Health Program, while two had not. Amongthose in the study with a substantial number of hiv-positive patients (more than 20 percent), 30 had gone abroad, while 13had not. Joel E. Gallant, m.d., m.p.h., hs '89, ts this prole.

Yale investigators are seeking better ways to prevent and treat the disease and to understand the science of fat.An epidemic in the making31 30yale medicine autumn 2001Story by Hutter Epstein, M.D. Photographs by Gale Zucker33 32An epidemic in the makingyale medicine autumn 2001For a nation obsessed with tness, it's a small wonder that so many Americans manage to keep gaining weight. Despite an ever-growing choice of diet products and weight-loss programs, moreand more Americans are losing the struggle against an expandinggirth\u2014or not ghting it at all. According to the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention, rates of obesity surged 60 percentduring the past decade and, today, one in ve Americans is con-sidered obese, or 30 percent above his or her ideal weight. People who are serious about e =ectively battling obesity have generally turned to tness instructors or nutritionists. Butat Yale, fat is also the stu =of serious science, pursued by nearly 100 epidemiologists, pediatricians, endocrinologists, biologists,nurses, biochemists and psychologists, among others. They areall part of the Yale Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center, ledby Robert S. Sherwin, m.d., the C.N.H. Long Professor of Med- icine and past president of the American Diabetes Association.Founded in 1993 with a grant from the National Institute of Dia-betes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the Yale diabetes centerprovides the infrastructure for an active interdisciplinary teamrepresenting 16 departments. Its mission is not to trim theAmerican waistline but to nd ways to prevent and treat anoften-serious consequence of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes occurs when beta cells in the pancreas lose their ability to produce enough insulin to compensate fordefects in glucose metabolism. Unlike type 1 diabetes, anautoimmune disease that destroys the beta cells and all of thebody's insulin-making ability, type 2 diabetes leaves patientscapable of producing insulin but unable to use it e =ectively. This can result in kidney and heart disease, stroke, blindness,nerve damage and loss of limbs. In 1997, the American Dia-betes Association ( ada) estimated that 16 million Americans had diabetes. According to Sherwin, the number has increasedby at least 6 percent a year since then, largely in tandem withthe rise in obesity. Worse, type 2 diabetes, long thought of as an adults-only illness, is now striking increasing numbers of young people,particularly Native Americans, African-Americans, Asians andLatinos. \"We are seeing obesity running rampant, particularly in young adults,\" says Sherwin. \"It's a major health problemthat has gotten increasingly worse in the past ve years.\" The Yale group has focused its e =orts on understanding the biology of type 2 diabetes and on crafting strategies to preventits occurrence in key groups of patients at risk for the disease.These approaches draw in a diverse group of investigators whoare interested in everything from the biochemical pathways ofglucose metabolism to the best ways to encourage at-risk chil- dren and older adults to exercise and follow a healthy diet. IN VIVO BIOCHEMISTRY Gerald I. Shulman, m.d., ph.d., has spent the past 15 years ex plor- ing the cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance, the defect inthe body's ability to use insulin that characterizes type 2 diabetes.Insulin resistance has been shown to be the best predictor forwhether or not an individual with a family history of type 2 dia-betes will go on to develop diabetes. Recently, his team proposeda new mechanism to explain how an excess of fatty acids in thebloodstream increases the risk of diabetes by interfering withglucose metabolism. \"Clearly too much fat is bad for you andsomehow it interferes with insulin 's ability to stimulate glucoseuptake into skeletal muscle. We wanted to know how,\" saysShulman. To nd out, he and collaborators including DouglasL. Rothman, ph.d., Kitt F. Petersen, m.d., Robert G. Shulman, ph.d. (no relation to Gerald) and Gary W. Cline, ph.d., have used the tools of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spec- troscopy to perform what Shulman calls \" in vivo biochemistry in real time.\" Their techniques allow researchers to measuremetabolic changes noninvasively and with much greater sensi-tivity than was possible before. \"In the old days, we would have had to perform muscle biop- sies to assess the concentration of a metabolite in a particular tis-sue. Even then we wouldn 't have had nearly as clear a picture ofwhat was going on inside the cell because a cell doesn 't behave thesame once you remove it from the body,\" says Shulman, theassociate director of the Yale Diabetes Endocrinology ResearchCenter, professor of medicine and of cellular and molecular phys-iology, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. An example of the power of the nmr technique was recently demonstrated in a study in which his group used it to measurethe amount of fat inside the muscle cells of normal volunteers.They found that higher levels of such intracellular fat are the bestindicator of whether or not an individual is insulin resistant. In order to determine the way in which fatty acids trigger the chemical defects that interfere with insulin 's ability to stimulateglucose transport, the Yale researchers infused fatty acids intohealthy volunteers and found that they could induce insulinresistance temporarily within ve to six hours\u2014demonstratingan inverse link between the presence of fatty acids and the body'sability to metabolize glucose. In subsequent studies the Yale teamfound that excess fatty acids block insulin 's ability to activate phos- phoinositol 3-kinase, a key enzyme responsible for mediatingWe are seeing obesity running rampant, particularly in young adults. It's a major health problem that has gottenincreasingly worse in the past five years. Robert Sherwin Robert SherwinA tax on fat? The rise in obesity around the country has led a number of inves-tigators to seek solutions in therealm of public policy. Amongthose is Kelly D. Brownell, ph.d., director of the Yale Center for Eat-ing and Weight Disorders, whoadvocates a six-step solution thatwould, among other measures,impose a tax on foods of poornutritional quality. While the idea of a \"fat tax\" has raised eyebrows (and the ire ofmany a conservative talk-showhost concerned about limits onour right to eat whatever wewant), it makes perfect sense toBrownell, a professor of psychol-ogy and of epidemiology and pub-lic health. He sees a health systemfar more focused on treatmentthan on prevention of obesity. Heargues that \"for every person wesuccessfully treat and removefrom the obese population, thereare thousands more entering it.\"In addition to taxing junk foods,his plan calls for publicly financingrecreation centers and bike paths,regulating food advertising aimedat children, banning fast foods andsoft drinks in schools, subsidizinghealthy foods, and incorporatingnutrition education in schoollunch programs. \"I think we havebeen obsessed with the biologyand missed the obvious,\" saysBrownell. \"It's the horrible foodand lack of physical activity thatare causing the problem.\" Loretta di PietroFor older adults, is moderate-intensity exercise sufficient to lower the risk or severity of diabetes? Must one exercise a little bitevery day or is one intense training session a week just as good? Loretta di Pietroclinics that number has soared as high as 40 percent, according to Caprio. The phenomenon is so new that epidemiologistshaven 't yet compiled national statistics by age. To understand whatis happening, Caprio began a ve-year study last year to deter-mine the metabolic reasons behind the explosion of new cases oftype 2 diabetes in children. \"We want to learn more about the pathway and where the defect is,\" she says. Meanwhile, the race is on to nd better ways to treat this new subset of patients before complications set in. Because peoplewith type 2 diabetes usually develop it in middle age, complica-tions often do not arise until their 60s or 70s. For the pediatricpatients, the prospect of kidney failure or cardiovascular diseasemay come decades earlier, in their 30s or 40s. In August, Caprio was awarded a $3.5 million grant over seven years as the principal investigator at Yale for a multicenter trialto compare standard medical therapies such as insulin and glu-cophage to newer drugs that have not yet been used in childrenand adolescents. These include inhaled insulin, insulin sensitiz-ers and insulin secretagogues such as nateglinide. \"We proposeto be very aggressive in treating the disease in children, ratherthan taking the usual, laid-back approach,\" Caprio says. \"It usedto be the case that you would try to improve diet a little and trya little exercise. But in 10 years, the pancreas is out of shapeand the damage is done.\" At the other end of the age spectrum are participants in studies conducted by Loretta A. di Pietro, m.p.h. '85, ph.d. '88, an associate professor of epidemiology and public health and associate fellow at the John B. Pierce Laboratory in New Haven. Working with adults 60 and older, she is studying how fat isdeposited and teasing out the di =erences between the physical changes caused by normal aging and those attributable to lack of exercise. Di Pietro is in the midst of a study including dozens of female volunteers at Heritage Village retirement communityin Southbury, a 45-minute drive from her o ;ce at Yale. The aim is to study the impact of nine months of exercise trainingon hormonal regulation and sugar and fat metabolism. Partici-pants agree to provide blood samples and muscle biopsies that will yield information about precisely how exercise seems to reverse or prevent insulin resistance. The women are divided into three groups. One group does high-intensity aerobic training, jogging on mini-trampolines atabout 85 percent of their maximum capacity as measured by heartrate. The second group jogs at moderate intensity. The thirdgroup, considered the placebo group, does stretching, tai chi oryoga. The mini-trampolines provide aerobic exercise without35 34An epidemic in the makingyale medicine autumn 2001insulin 's capacity to stimulate glucose transport. This is the same step that the Yale scientists, in a study published last yearin The New England Journal of Medicine , found to be defective in patients with type 2 diabetes. Further research into this path-way could lead to the development of new drugs that are moreprecisely targeted and carry fewer side e =ects. In another study, the Shulman group examined whether or not exercise training might be able to reverse the defect in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in the o =spring of patients with type 2 diabetes. In 1995, Shulman 's team demonstrated that exer-cise alone can reduce or reverse this abnormality. In that study,also published in The New England Journal , the team examined 10 sedentary adults whose parents had both developed type 2diabetes and who consequently faced a 40 percent lifetime riskof getting the disease themselves. All of the subjects were insulinresistant but none was obese. The exercise routine consisted ofthree 15-minute sessions on a stair-climbing machine, four timesa week for six weeks. The researchers gave the volunteers glu-cose intravenously and took blood samples to monitor how wellthey processed sugar. After one workout, the muscle cells' abil-ity to store glucose improved by 69 percent; after six weeks, by102 percent. At the end of the study, insulin sensitivity, the abil-ity of the body to use its own insulin, improved by 43 percent. \"It'sclear that exercise training can reverse the major defect respon-sible for insulin resistance in these individuals,\" says Shulman,\"and that it is likely to be an e =ective means in preventing or even reversing type 2 diabetes.\" AN AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO TREATMENT While researchers including Shulman are doing the kind of basicresearch that leads to new drugs, clinicians are working directlywith people vulnerable to the disease, especially children. \"There have never been so many obese children,\" says Sonia Caprio, m.d., associate professor of pediatrics in the section of endocrinology. She has shown that excess weight clearly carrieswith it the risk of type 2 diabetes. Last year at the ada meeting in San Antonio, Caprio reported that 19 percent of 180 childrenshe tested during the course of treatment for weight disordershad impaired glucose tolerance. \"That is not to say that all thesechildren will become diabetic\u2014because it's not too late,\" she says.\"If they do improve their weight and increase exercise, they canprevent it.\" Still, a decade ago it was rare for more than 5 percent of all pediatric diabetes cases to manifest themselves in the type 2 formof the disease; most children had type 1 diabetes. Today, in someThere have never been so many obese children. That is not to say that all these children will become diabetic\u2014becauseit's not too late.

About ve women can work out at a time, which di Pietro says makes the routinemore fun and motivates the women to continue exercisingwhen the study is completed. Fat in the abdominal area, which increases postmenopausally due to the drop in sex hormones, is linked to an increased riskof diabetes, says di Pietro, who is expanding the study to seniorcenters in New Haven and West Haven. These fat deposits, thedeep kind that cover tissues within the abdominal cavity, aremuch more metabolically active than fat cells in the thighs andbuttocks. In addition, there is a decline in both the quantity andquality of muscle mass with aging and disuse. Researchers theorize that when abdominal fat is broken down, it goes directly to the liver, where it interferes with insulinfunction and glucose metabolism. Di Pietro and research assis-tant Jodi Crimmins, m.s., are studying hormonal responses to exercise and, in particular, the e =ect of exercise on growth hor- mone, insulin-like growth factor and cortisol and how thesehormonal changes relate to improvements in whole-body glu-cose metabolism. The goal is to study how much exercise a subject must perform to garner the anti-diabetes e =ects. Are there gains after one bout of exercise or is long-term trainingnecessary? Is moderate-intensity exercise su ;cient? Must one exercise a little bit every day or is one intense training session a week just as good? FIGHTING EVOLUTION As any dieter knows, gaining weight is a breeze compared tolosing it. The reason, as is becoming increasingly apparent, hasmore to do with the evolution of the human species than withgluttony. Humans evolved into a sturdy species because of aninherited ability to prevent starvation, says Sherwin. \"We evolvedon a planet where food was scarce and you had to work hard toget it. You needed a gene pool to hold onto calories.\" In otherwords, those who survived long enough to produce o =spring were able to pass along their calorie-hoarding genes. Those whodropped pounds easily died young. That was good for the sur-vival of the species but is frustrating for those trying to loseweight today. Recent clues derived from studying the basic biology of the fat cell are lending credence to this theory. Several studies haveshown that when individuals reduce their food intake, they alsoslow metabolism and increase their appetite, thereby negatingthe impact of fewer calories. Hunger and metabolism are con-trolled by an intricate system of hormonal signals to and fromwithin the brain. A minor shift in this chemical balance can have a dramatic impact on weight loss or gain. For instance, a slight change in the hormonal milieu could prompt a craving for, say, an extra hundred calories a day andlead to a gain of 10 pounds in one year. Multiply that by veyears, and the average-sized person becomes obese. Sherwinand others at Yale have been studying how leptin, a protein sig-nal released by fat cells, controls appetite. The name for leptin,identied in 1994 by scientists at Rockefeller University, comesfrom the Greek word leptos , which means thin, and its discov- ery prompted speculation that a better diet pill was on the way.Further research has revealed a much more complex picture,and many questions remain to be answered about leptin andits role in controlling appetite. Sherwin has shown that leptin acts by binding to receptors in specic regions at the base of the hypothalamus, triggering acascade of hormonal changes. The leptin cascade, he says, \"is acomplex system that seems to have an enormous impact onhow much we eat. \"Theoretically, if a person has too much fat, the body would stop eating; if there is not enough, the body would increasefeeding,\" says Sherwin. The problem is that individuals whoare obese appear to have an altered set point for leptin. \"It takes more leptin to shut o =feeding. Then you go on a diet and leptin drops, so you want to eat again.\" Researchers hope these insights into the leptin receptor will lead to a new approach toweight loss, perhaps a drug that would latch onto the receptorand minimize appetite without slowing metabolism. As for the genetically blessed\u2014those annoyingly lean peo- ple who eat whatever they want without gaining an ounce\u2014scientists have a hunch that they may be endowed with moreso-called brown fat than white fat. According to this theory,supported by animal studies, brown fat cells, so namedbecause they have a redder hue due to an increased blood sup-ply, burn calories faster than do white fat cells. The goal, then,for drug-makers would be to somehow increase the proportionof brown cells, promoting fat burning rather than storage. \"We are trying to turn the tables on millions of years of evolu- tion,\" says Sherwin. \"We are not doing too well yet, but at leastwe are beginning to understand and recognize the problem.\" YMSENIOR FACULTY HONORED WITH ENDOWEDPROFESSORSHIPS Five faculty members with appoint- ments at the School of Medicine wererecently named to endowed chairs. Ronald S. Duman , ph.d., was appointed the Elizabeth Mears and House JamesonProfessor of Psychiatry. He has been on the Yale faculty since 1988, mostrecently as a professor of psychiatry andpharmacology, and has worked on char-acterizing the molecular and cellularmecha nisms that mediate the long-term e=ects of psychotropic drugs and stress. His research suggests that antidepres-sant treatments increase the survival and health of neurons and alter theirsynaptic architecture. Duman 's laborato-ry has also identied several neuropep-tide receptors that are expressed in drug reward and craving. Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Susan Hockfield , ph.d., was named the William Edward Gilbert Pro-fessor of Neurobiology. She joined thefaculty in the Section of Neurobiology atthe medical school in 1985 and hasserved as dean of the graduate schoolsince 1998, overseeing the academic andadministrative policies of the school, its2,300 students and 750 faculty. Hockeldhas sought to improve the quality of lifefor graduate students and increase oppor-tunities for informal interaction betweenfaculty and students. Her research workhas looked at the molecular substratesinvolved in brain development, and shediscovered a protein in the space aroundcells that is involved in early developmentand may play a role in brain tumors. G. Shirleen Roeder , ph.d., was appoint- ed the Eugene Higgins Professor of Mol-ecular, Cellular and Developmental Biol- ogy. Also a professor of genetics, shewas part of a Yale team that recently fullycharacterized the function of the yeast genome. She has studied the process ofmeiosis by isolating and characterizingyeast mutants defective in the process.She was named a Howard Hughes Med-ical Institute investigator in 1997. Roed-er has been on the Yale faculty since1981, and her work has appeared in the journals Celland Science , among others. Peter Salovey , ph.d., a professor of epidemiology and public health and chairof the Department of Psychology, wasnamed the Chris Argyris Professor of Psy-chology. He directs the Health, Emotionand Behavior Laboratory and with John D.Mayer coined the term \"emotional intelli-gence\" to describe how people under-stand, manage and use their feelings. Hehas focused on how feelings facilitateadaptive cognitive and behavioral func-tioning. Salovey has also investigated howpublic health messages can best encour-age prevention and early detection behav-iors for hiv/aids and cancer. He is deputy director of the Yale Center forInterdisciplinary Research on aids . Robert M. Weiss , m.d., was named the Donald Guthrie Professor of Surgery. Heis a specialist in pediatric urology andurologic surgery and was listed in the lat-est edition of \"Best Doctors in America:Northeast Region.\" His research has cov-ered topics from the role of nitric oxide inurinary tract infections and the bio-chemical and functional changes in thebladders of diabetics to the use of pulseDoppler sonography in the diagnosis ofurinary tract obstruction in children. Hehas been at Yale since 1967 and hasserved as chief of the Section of Urologysince 1988. He also served as interimchair of the Department of Surgery.Weiss received a merit Award from the National Institutes of Health for his workon age-dependent factors in ureteral-vesical function and the UrodynamicSociety's Duman Susan Hockfield Shirleen Roeder Robert Weiss41 40 students HELPING, AND LEARNING, THROUGH DISASTER RELIEFIN INDIA After an earthquake and as many as 60,000 deaths, Yale students andphysicians help shore up health system. Midway through their 10-day trip to western India in March to help withearthquake-relief e =orts, a team of Yale students and physicians visited the Chil-dren 's Hospital in Bhuj, a city near theearthquake's epicenter. Shantiben Patel, m.d., the hospital director, had set up tents outside the damaged building andwas seeing patients when the teamarrived. \"She had been working sixweeks straight, day and night,\" said RajKrishnamurthy, m.d., who practices internal medicine at the VA hospital inWest Haven and was a preceptor for theteam. \"She didn 't have a day o =. She was the only pediatrician in the whole area.\" Patel quickly put the Yale team to work seeing outpatient visitors while shetended to the neonatal intensive careunit in one of the many tents on thestreet. Over the next four hours the vestudents and their two preceptors tendedto about 25 children, most su =ering from diarrhea, dehydration, upper respi-ratory tract infections, malnutrition andurinary tract infections. The earthquake that struck the west- ern Indian region of Kachchh, on January26, measured 7.9 on the Richter scale.Estimates of the death toll vary, with thegovernment estimating between 20,000and 30,000 deaths and relief workers say-ing as many as 60,000 people may havedied. The Yale team, made up of ve med-ical students, a public health student andtwo physicians, arrived six weeks later toscenes of rubble and ruin. They alsofound an already fragile health care sys- tem in shambles. In New Haven, students' initial response was a fund-raising drive thatnetted about $1,000 for earthquake relief.The students wanted to do more andapproached Dean David A. Kessler, m.d., who agreed to send six students to India.It was up to the students to organize the trip. Seventeen students applied to go,and six, all but one of Indian heritage,were chosen through an applicationprocess. After securing their preceptors\u2014Krishnamurthy and David Litvak, m.d., a third-year resident in internal medicine\u2014and nding a nongovernmental organiza-tion to work with, the students were ontheir way. Upon their return, the studentsled a report with the dean 's o ;ce. Kachchh is 17,000 square miles of plains, desert and salt flats bounded on thenorth by Pakistan and on the south by theArabian Sea. Most of its inhabitants farmgrains, cotton and lentils. Some work inlimestone, marble and gypsum mines. Inrecent years the region has su =ered two droughts and a cyclone. \"It's a verydi;cult state to live in as it is,\" said stu- dent Simran Singh. The team 's guide to the region and its medical needs was Anupam Banerjee, m.d., an intern in India fresh out of med- ical school who had begun a term of service in Kachchh just after the earth-quake hit. Banerjee, in turn, was workingwith the Shrujan Trust, an organizationfounded in 1969 to provide famine relief.The trust branched out into economic aidby marketing embroideries made by 2,500craftswomen in 85 villages. It also beganmedical outreach and provided the van thattook Banerjee's mobile medical unit intothe countryside to provide primary care. The students arrived at the Shrujan compound about 20 miles west of the cityof Bhuj ready to work, despite a 36-hourtrip from New Haven and a 10-and-a-half-hour time di =erence. Their new home was a one-room, thatched-roof hut with a sin-gle bed. (Most of the team slept on the floor or outdoors in their sleeping bags.)The next day half the team joined Baner-jee on the medical van, while the otherhalf went to the nearby village of Ghadato organize activities for schoolchildren. Although several members of the group spoke Hindi and one spokeGujarati, language remained a problemin this country with more than 800dialects. The dialect spoken in Kachchhwas at times incomprehensible to theone Gujarati speaker on the team, RupalBadani, a third-year medical student.Nevertheless, because of their knowl-edge of Indian languages and with thehelp of interpreters, the students man-aged to communicate. Within a few days of their arrival, the team undertook a health assessment forGhada, looking into nutritional patternsand access to health care, prenatal careand primary care. They also organizeddiabetes and hypertension screenings ata health camp at Shrujan. When it wastime to leave, team members felt theyhad contributed something of value tothe relief effort. The presence of the stu-dents and physicians on the medical vanallowed more patients to be seen. Theirsurvey left health workers a tool for pro-viding medical care to villages. Their dia-betes and hypertension screenings werethe rst for many patients and includedfollow-up via the mobile unit. And theyestablished a program for children thatothers would continue after they left. They also returned to New Haven with valuable experience, having beenable to participate in emergency and pri-mary care in a remote setting with lim-ited resources. \"We felt like we weredoing something for someone, but wewere also really learning,\" said third-yearstudent Vivek Murthy.yale medicine autumn 2001 yale gujarat team (2) The epicenter of the earthquake struck near Bhuj, the capital of Kachchh, and left much ofthe city in ruins. ap/wide world photos john curtis top Simran Singh took a patient's blood pres- sure during a medical screening at the Shrujancamp.

Another student, Rahul Rajku-mar, helped organize the trip but was pre-vented from leaving by a family emergency. bottom Children such as these girls, dressed in the brightly colored garb typical of the region,were a main focus of the team, which organizedan interim day program to provide some struc-ture to their lives until schools could be rebuilt.43 1941 I want to thank the School of Medicine for a very pleasant 60threunion this June. It is always niceto follow the development of thefacilities of the school and, moreimportant, the achievements of itsgraduates, particularly those ofclassmates. It was great, this year,to talk with irv waltman who, if I remember correctly, I had notseen since the day we were dis-charged from the Army in 1946. I would like to thank the mem- bers of the Class of 1959 for theirkind invitation to socialize withtheir group at the clambake, whichI greatly appreciated. peter a. duncan 1946 The highlight of our 55th reunionwas the traditional gathering atEvelyn and marty gordon 's beautiful home on Linsley Lake inBranford. As always, the refresh-ments were lavish and the enter-tainment began with videotapesfrom previous reunions as far backas our 40th. It convinced us thatwe haven't changed since thenexcept, perhaps, in appearance.What Miki and Judy, child brides of jim kleeman and tom doe , thought of this is not recorded.We also saw a tape of tim beck receiving the \"Human Condition\"award from the Heinz Foundation,which led to other accolades sinceour last reunion, including marty gordon 's Distinguished Service Award and leadership of the associates of the Medical Libraryand vinny longo 's role in Pzer's development of Viagra \u2014fascinating! Our guest of honor was levin water 's widow, Priscilla Norton, who with Howard Spiro is writing abiography of Milton Winternitz,former dean of the medical schooland promulgator of the Yale Sys-tem. Vivid memories were evoked of\"Winter\" and his pathology course,and for some \u2014 bill banfield , eli wing , and bill and molly albrink \u2014 Winter's influence ex- tended beyond our graduation.Our memories of the World War II years were further sparked by a recording of our astp marching song, MacNamara's Band , which we received via don shedd from the nevilles . The vocalist couldn't compare with our maestro, tom whelan , but perhaps no one could! don shedd polled the group t o see how many of us wore hear ing aids and, of those, how many were satised with them.The re sults would dismay the man- ufacturers of those gadgets! I wasable t o give family pediatri- cian, bert filer , a favorable, 45- year follow-up on our four kids, whowere among his earliest patients. Those sending regrets due to illness or conflicting commitmentswere frank behrle ,linus cave ,george cusick ,greg flynn , Mary Judd, Muriel Murphy, jack and laura neville ,vince pepe and bob wagner . bill wedemeyer 1951 We were a post-World War II class that lacked the homogeneity ofpre-war cohorts at the School ofMedicine and enjoyed a largediversity of age and life experiences.The majority were veterans of the armed forces who served over-seas and attained ranks from pri-vate all the way up to colonel. Of 63chosen to enter as rst-year stu-dents, several dropped out early oraltered course to pursue re search and graduated with later classes.Fifty-two of us graduated in 1951,the last of Y ale's \" small\" classes, and then dispersed acr oss the USA to resume our war-in terrupted lives. Our 50th reunion began on a bittersweet note as we mournedand fondly remembered eight class-mates who had died since our 45th reunion, which many of themattended. They were frank allen ,muriel bagshaw iverson ,alfred owre jr. and john sullivan , who, as our secretary since grad-uation, best embodied the spirit ofour class. Our condolences and best wishes go to their families. Any classmate returning to Yale for the rst time since 1951 musthave felt like Rip van Winkle awak-ening! The growth of the physicalfacilities and the size, diversity and excellence of the faculty areawesome. Yale is well positionedto move the frontiers of researchand patient care forward in thenew millennium. Our major activities during our reunion were renewing old friend-ships, reminiscing, sharing news ofclassmates unable to attend andlistening to the excellent neurolog-ical sciences symposium and in-formative alumni association meet-ing. We applauded the awardgiven to jocelyn malkin for her contributions as a medical schoolalumni representative to the parentaya and enjoyed meeting her mother and children, who were pre-sent. Classmates and spouses atthe reunion were tom and Barbara amatruda ,paul and Polly bruch ,john filley ,lowell and Ione goodman ,bob and Sonia hamburger ,aland Cecelia katz ,bill and Emily kiekhofer ,jocelyn malkin , wally morgan ,aland Donna mowlem ,jim and Jan riley , and andy and Irene wong . The medical school administration andalumni association treated us likevips. We were their guests at both the spectacular clambake and the elegant reunion dinner. john groel ,bob and Dawn adams ,john and Ruth berg , larry harris ,john and Mary Lou haxo , and brad and Ruth straatsma could not attend and expressed their regrets. brad was invited to be the opening-dayspeaker at an international con-gress of ophthalmology in Istanbulon the same date. We agree withhis choice and send congratulationsfor the honor he received. We left Yale Medical School with a renewed and increased respectfor our school and the friendshipswe formed more than 50 yearsago. Finally, on behalf of the class I would like to thank lowell goodman for his efforts over many years as our class agent forthe annual alumni fund drive 42 alumni reunion 2001 FOR 500 ALUMNI AND THEIR GUESTS, A RETURNTO NEW HAVEN Congress Avenue Building, brain research, admissions process are the focus of 2001 reunion. At this year's reunion, alumni donned hard hats for a tour of the CongressAvenue Building and put on their think-ing caps for a seminar on admissionsthat asked them to decide the fate of ahypothetical medical school applicant. More than 500 alumni and their guests attended reunion, which startedFriday, June 1, with a discussion of theadmissions process, a welcome fromDean David A. Kessler, m.d. , and the tra- ditional evening clambake. Across town,at the New Haven Lawn Club, alumni inpublic health were honored for their ser-vice to their communities. The admissions discussion Friday afternoon in the Jane Ellen Hope Build-ing included an interactive exercise thato=ered the audience a chance to review the qualications of various applicantsand make their own selections. The next day discussion turned to \"The Last Frontier: Understanding theBrain, Curing its Disorders,\" with apanel that comprised Bennett A. Shay-witz, m.d. , professor of pediatrics and neurology and in the Child Study Cen-ter; Patricia Goldman-Rakic, m.d. , the Eugene Higgins Professor of Neurobiol-ogy and Psychiatry and Neurology;Je=ery D. Kocsis, ph.d. neurology and neurobiology; Dennis D.Spencer, m.d. , chair and the Harvey and Kate Cushing Professor of Neuro-surgery; and Stephen G. Waxman, m.d. , ph.d. , chair and professor of neurology. Topics includingdiscussion of such famous dyslexics asHarvey Cushing, m.d. , to memory loss and epilepsy. At the alumni meeting that followed the brain symposium, Jocelyn S. Malkin, m.d. '51, right (top), received the Distin- guished Alumni Service Award for hercontributions as a teacher of studentsand residents, her advancement of theeld of psychoanalysis and her commitment to the Association of YaleAlumni in Medicine. Vincent T. Marchesi, m.d. '63, ph.d. , below (bottom), director of the BoyerCenter for Molecular Medicine, alsoreceived the D istinguished Alumni Ser- vice Award, for his commitment to Yale and his research into the proteins of the red cell membrane, discoveriesthat are featured in student textbooks. Following the alumni meeting, Dean David A. Kessler, m.d. , led alumni on a tour of the Congress Avenue Building,still under construction. Alumni climbedstairways to floors strewn with piping andwiring, while Kessler and John H. Bollier,executive director of facilities developmentand operations at the medical school, out-lined the building's progress. On Friday, the School of Public Health observed the Yale Tercentennial by hon-oring 50 outstanding alumni who havehad exemplary careers in government orcommunity organizations. The 50 werenamed to the eph Alumni Public Service Honor Roll at a luncheon at the LawnClub in New Haven. This year's Distinguished Alumni Award went to James Hadler, m.d. , m.p.h. '82, director of the Connecticut Depart-ment of Public Health 's Infectious Dis-ease division for almost 20 years. \"I haveone of the best jobs in the world,\" Hadlersaid in his address to alumni. Althoughhe acknowledged the \"dark side\" of work-ing in government\u2014the politics thatsometimes interfere with programs\u2014he said his work gives him \"the ultimatereward, the feeling that what I do makesa di=erence to society.\"yale medicine autumn 2001 reunion reports the names of class members appear in bold .45 and a stick pointer as tall as himself to flail feckless interns who droppedthe slides. Probably a good thinghe didn't have a laser. Saturday evening the class din- ner was held at an Italian restau-rant on the outskirts of New Haven'sLittle Italy, in the shadow of Inter-state 91, unpretentiously namedAdriana's Restaurant. It turned out to be very nice. Mythic thirteensat at table. During the early part of dinner, who should show up but DeanKessler accompanied by two keep-ers, ladies from the alumni ofce.It reminded me of our belovedpresident, also with a Yale connec-tion, making the rounds of inau-gural balls. The members of the class of '66 (Latin, sextiest-sex), no shrink-ing violets, offered opinions and observations. The dean wasreminded that he was going tohave to feed that r eally big build- ing. And, was he doing the new graduates and the w orld any favor by sending the new bies out on graduation day $100K negative? At dinner, and before, various class members briefly recited theircurrent status. As I heard it:rey spector , after a distin- guished ( rey is modest; this is my estimate) career including the Uni-versity of Iowa and Merck, is nowsemi-retired with several medicalschool appointments. He is build-ing a dream house in Colt's Neck,N.J. He and wife Michiko are cur-rently having a memorable motelstay while getting a hard-knockscourse in contractor delays and costoverruns. If anyone has a magicanswer, rey is having cervical and lumbar disc problems and gettingfed up with conservative therapy. john and marian matheke melish , in from Honolulu, report that everything is not heavenly inparadise. Even though Hawaii hasa unique health care funding sys-tem, gaps abound, and it soundslike they work pretty hard. When Imentioned to john some roof leaks I had this past winter, I wastold Hawaii has industrial-strengthtermites that specialize in eatingroofs. marian also reports footballlinesman cockroaches play soccer with full size ball in kitchen late at night. mary alice bernet houghton and husband Bill ( m.d. '64) are both still practicing psychiatry inMilwaukee. I understand psychicinsight is little help in raising chil-dren, and traditional methods(scream and kickass) were used. arne youngberg , senior radiologist in his group in Water-bury, is the group mammographer.He expects to hang it up in thenear future. He was especiallylooking forward to a shing trip in Patagonia. peter gibbons , with wife Christina, was here. He is a radiolo-gist in Brattleboro, Vt. He notedradiology, long somnolent aftersunset, has become increasingly24-hour, a signicant burden. jim brown , in medical oncol- ogy, from Middletown, alsodropped in with wife Pat for thelast night's dinner. He looks veyears older than he did in 1966.Still going strong. eugene p. cassidy 1971 The 30th reunion of the Class of1971 was attended by 29 of ourclass members: Drs. The class dinner was high- lighted by Dr. foster 's sartorial creativity and the dean's visit. It isnot true that Dr. Kessler was seensmoking on the 17th green. barbara kinder graciously invited us to her lovely Branfordhome for a delicious brunch. alice o'neill was lovingly remem- bered and an initiative for anannual lecture in her honor was discussed. joan menden-reese , a Brown/ Pembroke classmate,will share this idea with david lippman , unable to attend the Saturday dinnerbecause of his daughter's gradua-tion, gave yet more puzzles to pon-der. The solution to the puzzle \u2014what do the words pact, vandal,floral, calamari, Coca-Cola, etc.,have in state abbreviations, e.g.,pact = Pennsylvania (PA) + Con-necticut (CT). An unanswered query is what common medication can also be so composed. The answerwill be given at the 35th reunion.See you there. david lippman 1976 Outstanding 25th reunion, a trib-ute to the vitality and youthful-ness of our class!

Of the remain-ing 66 classmates, 24 came back toNew Haven. We all agreed wecaught the golden age of medicineand that Yale was the best possi-ble entrance into that golden age.On Friday night the downings , for the fourth time, hosted an ele-gantly casual buffet at their home in Guilford. Saturday, the school's activities were capped by a formal banquetat the Quinnipiack Club. With mostof the class in retirement, numer-ous addresses and invitations forvisits were exchanged. The classwishes to thank Dean Kessler andthe staff of the alumni ofce fortheir effort to make us feel welcomeand have things run so smoothly. Attendees included levon and Gloria boyajian ,rosalie burns ,edwin and Barbara child ,james and Tina collias , don and Leanne (MacDoughall) dalessio ,steve and Helen downing ,mitchell and Janet edson ,gilbert and Rona eisner ,tom and Carol ferris , john and Arne gardner ,sum- ner and Shayna gochberg , robert groves ,charles and Joan hopper ,mary louise and Ken johnson ,jerome and Linda klein ,william and Gloria lewit ,preston and Jane manning ,dwight and Carol miller ,donald and Anna Marie nalebuff ,frederick north , david and Eleanor page ,robert scheig ,james and Ruth scheuer , and stanley and Anne (Falk) simbonis . Last- minute regrets were sent by bob and Joan hill ,gary and Karen fry ,joe and Pattie cerny , and bill and Jane o'brien . dwight f. miller1961 Our 40th reunion went very well.

Ellen Levy presented to Yale the funds to endow a professorship,the robert levy Chair in Preven- tive Cardiology. This substantialgift had been raised from family,friend s and supportive companies. Eight other classmates spent much time writing suggestions fora class seminar entitled \"If You Hadto Go to Medical School again,WhatChanges in the Curriculum W ould You Recommend?\" Their effortsculminated in a 22-page handout.Our alumni suggestions may helpexpand the horizons of the Edu-cational Policy Curriculum C ommit- tee ( epcc ) of the medical school. The committee consists nearly en-tirely of in-house academics. Thefour student representatives to theepcc cannot be expected to be familiar with practic e problems either. Since most Yale gr aduates eventually enter private practice,alumni advice is quite relevant. vincent marchesi hosted the class meeting at the BoyerCenter for Molecular Medicine onSaturday. It was noted thatresearch and clinical practice havegrown so much at Yale that support for teac hing, although strong, has fallen b ehind. How to encourage good t eachers became the topic around some class dinner tables atthe Quinnipiack Club, and at Sun-day breakfast, Lois and frank top suggested that our class con- tribute funds to reward excellencein teaching. Others pointed outthat identifying a single bestteacher of the year can be difcultand that a s tudent survey may turninto a po pularity contest. vincent suggested that alumni arrangingto take a medical school class todinner with their best teacherswould provide more widespreadrecognition for the dedicated fac-ulty. bill rogoway , our class reunion gift chairman, in dicated to roland that alumni coul d desig- nate their donations also for theabove-mentioned purposes. roland paegle 1966 Practicing half-time, detesting air-lines, having a pretty good car, earlyon Wednesday, May 30, I headedeast with CDs of late string quartets of Beethoven and a lengthy audiobook.

Medical school tuition is now $30K per year, $50K with expenses.Wow! In nominal dollars my classgot the whole package for whatwould buy a few months today.. . . Did we live in the golden age, or what? Friday night, under holding sky, there was a clambake on the Harkness dorm lawn. Very pleasant.Lots of raw oysters and clams onthe half shell. They must be med-ically safe. Overcooked steaks andperfect steamed lobster followed. As I was slurping half-shell critters, I felt a hand on my arm. Iglanced right. It took 200 milli-seconds. Someone I had not seenin 35 years. I proclaimed,\" mary alice , you haven't changed a bit!\" Wryly smiling, mary alice bernet houghton replied,\"Nei- ther have you!\" Saturday morning there were impressive presentations on neuro-science.

In addition, wewere honored by a visit from Dr.Morris Dillard, whom many of usknew and loved as director of theWednesday Evening Clinic. Mes-sages with regrets came frommarc agronin (whose envelope art ensured that everyone openedtheir invitations), daryl daniels , rick ihnat ,ann denehy smith ,bob spillane ,sym- phorosa williams , and, just now, jim hicks . Last-minute regrets came from kent min and ellen markstein geller and husband David. colleen foy could not make it but sent e-mailphotos (which presided over thekitchen Saturday night) of herselfwith husband Craig Sterling andtheir young son. And steve ugent revived the \"Uge, Uge,Uge\" chant during a hilarious tele- phone call Saturday afternoon. Finally, I must thank the Ofce of Alumni Affairs for making thedinner at my house possible and forarranging catering from the incom-parable Adriana's Restaurant, oneof New Haven's greatest culinarygems. I think it fair to say that every-one had a fabulous time at reu nion. They seem to be getting betterexponentially. So start thinkingnow about 15! francis m. lobo 1996 This year's fth reunion class had abumper crop of attendees. Manywere still in New Haven doing resi-dencies and fellowships.

'66 ,i n the winter 1966 issue of yale medicine : \"Upon arriving in Ganta [Ganta Methodist Mission Hospi-tal in the hills of eastern Liberia],I soon discovered that tropicalmedicine would be considered ageneral practice by American standards. For example, on anygiven morning the rst ve peoplein the clinic line might include achild with amoebic dysentery, aman suffering for a long time withonchocerciasis, a boy whose bloodsmear for P . falciparum is 6 plus positive, a pregnant mother ofeight who complains of back pain,and an old man whose scrotumextends almost to his knees. Later in the morning things might become somewhat morehectic. While you are examining achild with chickenpox, you send a man who has obviously brokenhis femur to the emergency roomand hope that the woman whohas just been taken into the exam-ining room doesn't have anectopic pregnancy as suspected.It's hectic because you can't sendthe man with the broken femur toX-ray. Instead you do the alterna- tive: that is, you roll out the oldU.S. Army eld unit and trust thatthere'll be enough power to take arespectable lm. You can't sendthe pregnant woman to surgeryfor, unlikely as it might seem, youare surgery! In many ways onemight consider such an experiencea rotating internship. But insteadof rotating every two months, yourotate with each new patient.\"from winter/spring 1981: \"Growth in medicine A visit tothe computer-search ofce gath-ers in a few minutes a volume ofcitations that would have takendays of hand searching.

Technologynow being developed holds evengreater promise for libraries andlibrary users. The National Libraryof Medicine, which developedMedline in the sixties, is workingon a videodisk system that couldfundamentally alter the conceptof publishing. Electronic 'publica-tion' of journals, whether throughvideodisks or some other method,would eliminate paper copies.Readers could use computerizedbibliographic searching to nd ref-erences, then scan the articles on acomputer terminal screen. ...

While older books and jour-nals would survive \u2014 and need to be stored\u2014 current publicationswould take up far less room. Andtheir content would be availableto computerized searching, freeingresearchers from mechanical tasks to concentrate on the infor-mation itself.\" archives ALUMNI QUESTIONNAIRES TO BE MAILED SOON The School of Medicine will publish an updated alumni directory in the autumn of 2002, providing contact and profes-sional information for more than 11,000 graduates of theSchool of Medicine and its training programs.
