MA thesis abstract The feminisation of magic in classi cal Greek literature: the subversive potential of women in the polis Angela Matheson This thesis examines the apparent over-representation of women (by comparison with non-literary evidence) as magical adepts in the classical literary tradition. A flui d and ideologically based an cient definition for magic is posited, and will be demonstrated throughout. Methodologies based on theoretical insights drawn from stru ctural and symbolic anthropolog y, and from feminist scholarship will be employed in an effort to unravel a number of the forces at work in the constructi on of women as most expert in the deployment of magic. Having identified women as marginalis ed, or 'other' to Greek ideas of personal and politic al se lfhood, their appear ance in fifth century drama as amateur and experien ced users of m agical arts will be assessed, with reference to other 'intruders', as a perce ived threat to the order and integrity of the community ( oikos , polis and Hellas variously). The relationships of women and of magic with divinity, otherness and liminality will be explored in various guise s. In Chapter one, different ancient and modern ways of understanding magic will be e xplored, with a view to establishing a useful theoretical fram ework. Chapter tw o will approach the iinterconnections of liminality, magic and pr ivate ritual through the figure of Hekate. Chapter three will discuss women's control over dangerous and important transformative processes, and the relationship between transformations and the idea of magic. Chapters four and five will examine prom inent themes in the construction of magic as a disruptive art dominated by women. Chapter six, on the other hand, will explore the treatm ent of magic under law in the reality of Athenian society, and the ways that lit erary stereotypes informed this social reality. Chapter seven will explore the idea, prevalent in classical discuss ions, that magic is ultimately for eign in origin. The assimilation of various ide as of otherness - including femininity, anima lity, divinity and barbarity - in the creation of a powerful category of m agic will be discuss ed. Finally, it will be suggested that magic was powerfully sym bolic of subversion of accepted social and metaphysical hierarch ies. Women's prominence in representations of the deployment of magic may thus be viewed a s an express ion of the tensions inherent in gender re lations in classical society. iiTable of contents Chapter one: Introduction to ancient Greek m agic: definit ions and social contexts Page 1 Chapter two: Hekate: traversing dangerous boundaries Page 36 Chapter three: Cooking and m idwifery: dangerous knowledges and technologies Page 63 Chapter four: Medeia: barbarian sorceress and divinity Page 106 Chapter five: Deianeira' s philtre: conj ugal tensions in the Trachiniai Page 144 Chapter six: Magic under Athenian law: a threat to the polis?

Such representations co-exist with indications - explicit or otherwis e - that women wer e the magic users par excellence of the ancient wor ld. This gendered pattern in representations of magic users also has a diachronic dimension, as female magical figures continued to outnumber and overshadow their male equiv alents in the lit erature of the Roman worl d, and in divers e folk tales of the European cultural traditi on. Stories about female witc hes from later periods frequently owe so mething to their Graeco-Roman roots, and attest to the power an d longev ity of certain ideas about women.1 One might also cite the hist orical phenomena of the sixteenth century witch-hunts and -trials in we stern Europe and north America as evidenc e for interest in (or obsession with) the subject even closer to the present time. The most well-known and high profile pr actitioners of magic in classical Greek literature are w omen. Medei a and Deianeira, from Euripides' Trachiniai respectively, so fired ancient 1imaginations that they reappeared in Roman guise centuries later in the works of Seneca, by which time their sorcery and savagery was much embellished.2 To these we may add a myriad of passing references in poetry, drama, and philosophical and l egal texts to wis e old women, anonymous stepmothers and the like w ho are identified as amateurs or adepts in the magical arts. These di scussions, indepth and brief alike, help to build up a picture of women as the keepers of arcane wisdom in ancient Greece. Non-literary evidence for magic use in the classical period A glance at the epigraphical, arc haeological and papyrologic al evidence for magic from the ancient Greek world, on the other hand, reveals a rather different demographic of adherents to magical ritual practices, from that suggested in the poetic works. For instance, the extensiv e depositions of RH\u008dH\u0099KL\u008c\u0081\u0086P - also known as curse inscriptions or defixion es - attest, by their varied aims and textual qualities, to the extremely diverse nature of the people who made and commissioned them. Nearly six hundred of these inscribed tablet s - usually thin lead sheets - have been published thus far.3 Early depositions of curse 1 For a gen eral introdu ction to the persist ent theme of wome n as witche s and poi soners in Western lit erature see es pecially Margaret Hallissy , Venom ous Wom an: fear of the female in literature (New York , 1987). 2 Seneca wrote a Medea of his es O etaeus, make s Deianeira' s nurse and confidante the wo man with so me comm and of magical kn owledge. 3 Good survey s of pattern s of depo sition are to be fou stoph Dirk Obbin k (eds.), Magika Hi era: Ancient Greek Ma gic a nd Religi cursin justice dicial p rayers' in Farao ne and of a ntiquity (Leeds, 2inscriptions are most concentrated in wells and tombs within Attika,4 and inscriptions are particularly plent iful for the cl period.5 Of the classical Hellenis tic inscrip tions of any length and clarity,6 prominent motivations for men and women to s eek magical ass istance are the need to defeat ri vals in business or opponents in lawsuits.7 The same competitive mood is retained amo ng the Roman evidence, which is dominated by amatory and athletic curses. Indeed, Faraone has found this agonist ic aspect to be inherent in the nature and functions of cursing in Mediterranean societies.8 The fourth and fifth century judicial curses in particu lar attest to the use of magic by the most powerful element s of Athenian society during the classical period. Prominent polit ical figures were frequently targetted for curses by their similarly prominent (male) rivals,9 challenging the id ea, popular in mid-twentieth century scholarship, that such practices were 1991 ).

The epig raphical evide nce for magical cu rsing amon g the male elites o f society is a ccomp anied by a tradition of accusations: Demo of po ssessing magi educated11 in classical society. Papyrological evidenc e, too, contribut es to the picture of a society in which magic was a possible means of redress for a broad cross-section of society. The Greek Magica l Papyri collection (henceforth PGM12) constitutes a particularly rich source of magical data. This body of papyri, consisting of spells, formulae, hymn s and rituals, assumed written form between the second century B. C . E. and the fifth century C. E.,13 but in many cases its contents have been shown to be much older.14 The PGM are understood to be, in most cases, act ual spells kept for use or sale by professional magicians of Hell enistic and Roman Egypt, and thus governed by the laws of supply and demand . Spells of erotic attraction figure prominently in the collection in generic format,15 suggesting considerable demand for such merchandise. Such attraction spells 10 A. A.

This study will confine itself, as much as is feasible, to evidence from the cl assical period. This is in acknowledgment of the consi derable transformations undergone by magic (however one defines it) betw een the archaic period, before a language existed to adequatel y describe the concept,17 and the beginning of the Common Era, by which time there had evolved a strong culture of self-defined professional magician s, and elite philos ophical magic. Defining magic with reference to religion and science Much of the abundant recent work on ancient Greek magic has been concerned with the issue of how magi c is to be defined. The debate has focussed upon the ext ent to which the theories of Sir James Frazer - who posited a radical opposition betw een religion and magic on the one 16 In 'The con straints of Eros' , in ), 214 -43 Joh n J. Win kler explore s gender divisi ons and rol e reve rsals in the PGM. 17 For the idea that the pra ctice of magi c precede d the langu age of m agic see Richard Gord on, 'Ima gining G reek and Roman magic', Part Three in Be ngt Ankarl oo an d Stuart Clark (eds .), Witch craft an d Magic in Eu rope, vol. 2: Ancient G reek and Rom an Magic (London, 19 99), 165. On the develo pment of terms d enoting ma gic and the la ck of a dedicated terminology bef ore the classi cal period see belo w, pp. 14-1 6 and F ritz Graf, 'Excludin g the cha rming: the develo pment of the Gre ek con cept of magic', in Ma rvin Meyer an d Paul Mire cki, Ancie nt Magic and Ritu al Power (Leiden, 1995 ), 29-42, esp. 37 - 8. 5hand,18 and an intellectual evolution from magical through religious to scientific outlook on the other19 - are to be retained as a useful framework. The notion of a 'r adical oppos ition' between magic and religion is problematic in itsel f, as i ndicated by the debates among subsequent anthropologists and ancient hi storians. Generally speaking, anthropologists have largely dispens ed with the Frazerian model of a magic-religion dichotomy,20 preferri ng instead to see magic, religion, sorcery and witchcraft as a number of different points on a shared spectrum.21 In the field of ancient hist ory, though, a number of scholars have retained and refined the Frazeri an dichotomy, whereby magicians are those who hubrist ically attempt to constrain and coerce deities , or else attempt to manipulate people wit hout divine mediat ion. Fearing and respecting the gods, and praying for assistance with an attitude of meekness, on the other hand, is deem ed religious piety by this logic.22 18 Sir Jame s Frazer, The Gol den Boug h: a study in m agic and religio n, 3rd edn., vo l. 1 (London, 19 13), pp. 224 -6. 19 Frazer (191 3), pp. 220-4. 20 Fritz Graf provides a bi bliogra phy of im portant contri Ritual', in Faraone a nd Ob bink (1991), 8, n. 1.

Still others believe that the only difference betwee n magic and reli gion i s a se mantic one: se e esp ecially Hamm ond (1 970). Fra zer himsel f concedes that despite bei ng 'radi cally op posed', magi c and religi on did co exist in individual p ractitioners' rep ertoires for a l ong time: Fra zer (1913), 2 26. 22 See, most re cently, Jen s Braavig, 'Mag ic: reconsidering the Montg omery Eina r World of Anci ent Magic: pape rs from the first Intern ational Sam son Eitr em Sem inar at the Norwe gian In stitute at Athens, 4-8 May 19 97 (Bergen, 1999 ), 52; Fritz Graf (1995 ), 35. cf.

(Oxford, 1908 ), 93-12 0, esp. 109-15. 6 A more recent trend among ancient histor ians is to acknowledge that this neat, diametrical opposition does not fit with literary, i nscriptional and archaeological evidence for both Greek and Roman civilisatio n. As a number of scholars have pointed out, t he division of ritual acts and words into 'religious' and 'magical' is lar gely an artificial and modern distinction, which obsc ures the breadth and meaning of Greek ritual. In a recent study Roy Kotansky points out th at word sequences traditionally considered to be 'magical' incant ations23 often coexist on amulets with words whic h are traditi onally cons idered be of a 'religious', prayerful nature.24 Plentiful exam ples of this phenomenon present themselves in the PGM . 25 At PGM VII.745 the magician prays thus: Emphatically I beg, I suppl icate, I your servant...26 displaying none of the hubristic forcefulness which supposedly characterises magical incantation.27 Again, at PGM V.400, the magi cian concludes his/her request for an or acle with submissive piety: 23 Acco rding y invoke a ction or co mpel ende d victims with no refe rence to highe r powers. Th e magici an's tone is comma nding, an d force s gods or d aemon s to act. Religious langu age o r prayer, on the other ha nd, chara cteristically employs a submi ssive a nd praising ton e of addre ss, and req uests deities to act o n behalf of the person p raying: Frazer (1913), I:222, 225. 24 Roy Kotansky, 'Incantations and prayers for salvation on inscri bed Greek am ulets' in Faraone a nd Obbin k (1991), in Fa raone and O bbink (1991), n. 43. cf. XIII.72. 7 I ask you lord: be graci ous and wit hout deceit appear and prophesy to me.28 Indeed, in at least five cases, spells are actually entitled L\u008bQJO\u0099 (prayer),29 and the same word appears in the body of many other spells.30 Furthermore, so called 'incantations ' and 'pr ayers' were explicitly acknowledged to coexist in the reperto ires of professional magic ians by Plato as early as the fourth century B.C.E.31 Compositio ns identified as prayers can similarly exhibit elements traditionally identified as magical. Sappho's Prayer to Aphrodite possesses a classic tripartite prayer structure.32 Opening with an invocation of the deity, the prayer goes on to remind Aphrodite of her past loyalty to Sappho, in an effort to secure the goddess' aid once again. Finally, Sappho makes her demand, commencing: Come to m e now...33 The language here suggests coercion, although the format is otherwise classically prayerful, which onc e agai n helps to suggest that coercion and 27 This is not to s ay that c oercion of diviniti es do es not feature in the PGM . The point is that coe rcion is not a goo d indicator of the boun dary b etwee n praye r and ma gical incantation. 28 Trans l. Fritz VI.5-46; praye r forms see J. M. Bremer, 'G reek hymn s' in H. S. Versnel (ed.), Faith, hope, and worship (Leide n, 1981 ), 193-21 4. 8submission are not appropriate ways of distinguishing m agical texts from pious pray erful texts.34 A comparable degree of ambiguity between religious and magical sentiment and intent is detectable in the RH\u008dH\u0099K L\u008c\u0081\u0086P . .H\u008dH\u0099KL\u008c\u0081\u0086\u0005 , although being a genuine ancient term, is a modern categorisation given to an artefa ct identified as magical. H. S. Versnel identifies the 'typical' RH\u008dH\u0099KL\u008c\u0081\u0086\u0005 as: a). of anonymous authorship; b). addressed to Chthonic or sometimes foreign deities; c). seeking to coerce deiti es; d). demonstrating a lack of piety towards the gods in question; and e) . furtively enacted and conce aled, due to the malicious, wrongful or self-serving sentiments or wishes expressed.35 However, in reality a signifi cant number of texts inscribed on lead (or other material) tablets have been found whic h fulfil only some of these cri teria.36 Given that pious prayer s are traditionally held to exhibit the opposite feat ures to those of u nless othe rwise note d. 34 O.

Farao ne poi nts out that the great bul k of publish ed RH\u008dH\u0099KL\u008c\u0081\u0086P are so bri ef that it is impossible to gaug e the tone of ad dress. Coercive imperativ es (e g. Fara one in F araone an d Obbink (1991), 6, 18. 9above,37 such tex ts fall rather awkwar dly between the two supposedly diametrically opposed practices of pray ing and magically binding. The official 'constitutional' curses issued co llectiv ely by cities in the classical period wor k to further undermine modern definitions of ancient prayer and magical inc antation, given that th ey are public and piously issued and displayed, and most commonly addressed to Olympic deities. One example will suffice here: If anyone should trans gress these pr ovisions (to refrain from settling upon the accursed territory of Kirrha)...let the offender be accursed in the sight of Apollo and Artemis and Leto and Athena Pronoia... neither should the earth bear them fruits nor their wives give birth to children...but rather monsters, nor should their cattle bear young in accordance with nature...38 Versnel suggests that it is more a ccurate to say that the Greeks moved quite freely along a supernatural spec trum stretching from curses to prayers.39 This theory finds suppor t in the fact that the Greek language40 observes no distinction between ' good' and ' bad' prayers. 37 That is to sa y: a). the person offering th e praye r ident ifies themselves; b). the pe rson praying i s submissive, and begs the g ods to act on hi s or he r behalf; c). the gods are praised a nd flattered; and d). the praye r is m ade pu blic, or at any rate not con cealed. See Versnel i n Fara one a nd Obbin k (1991), 62. 38 The cu rse of the Amphikty ones is re corded in Aeschi nes, ag. 110-1. c f. Kritias 119e, Laws 871b. cf. Watson (19 91), pp. 18 -21. 39 Versn el (1991), 66. 40 Latin simila rly uses a single term to den ote diverse ki nds of p rayer. 10Christopher Faraone has argued that any speculation regarding the piety or malevolence on the part of the pr actitioner consists of subjective responses by the modern reader, and that this approac h is irrelevant.41 For Greeks of the fifth century B.C.E., he continues, the practitioner has already demonstrated piety, by believ ing that the gods will respond appropriately to certain ritual observances.42 As far as the RH\u008dH\u0099KL\u008c\u0081\u0086\u0005 issuer - be they indivi dual or collective - is concerned, Faraone's thesis may hold true.43 Indeed, it is clear that some issuers of RH\u008dH\u0099KL\u008c\u0081\u0086P did so with a firm sense of righteousness of their act, and that magical (by modern definitions) curses could fulfil a law-affirming role in classical Greek communities. Howev er, the literature of the peri od overwhelmingly conveys the idea that practiti oners and suspected prac titioners of magic arts are most impious, and a threat to society. This would suggest that either: a). modern understandings of classical Gr eek magic remain at odds with ancient conceptions; or b). the anci ent Greeks' opinions about magic, as stated in the literat ure of the period, are at odds with actual practice. In the course of this thesis I will suggest that both of the above contribute to the troubled and ambiguous status of magic, in modern and ancient literature alike. 41 Chri stoph er A. Faraone, ' The Agoni stic C of Early Binding Spell s,' in Faraone a nd Obbin k 18. 42 Farao ne, ibid ., 19. 43 Farao ne ma kes this state ment in the c ontext of a discussio n of depo sition s of RH\u008dH\u0099KL\u008c\u0081\u0086P . 11Besides having close associations with divinity and religious ritual, magic also has a complex affiliation wit h science, and especially the healing transformations of medical science. In Homer and Pindar, the most esteemed physicians were those who were taught by deities. Asklepios, and his sons Machaon and Podaleirios all practised arts they learnt from the centaur Cheiron. Asklepios was eventually elevated to divine status on account of his excellenc e in he aling, underscoring that healing was closely connected to the divine or 'miraculous'.44 Incantations (LQ\u0087\u008a\u0012K\u0086\u0099\u0005 ) and amulets were celebrated and accepted tools and techniques for healing. The sons of Autolykos, for i nstance, treat Odysseus' injury with a bandage and a spoken incantation.45 In Pindar, Asklepios gives his patients MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH , either a s liquids to drink or as amulets to atta ch to their bodies.46 In the Archaic period it was believed that illnesses could have a num ber of causes, variously punitive, daemonic, traumatic or environmental.47 Consequently, for the self- defined healers of the per iod and their customers,48 purifications and appeasem ents for divine anger were important elements of healing repertoires. These self-defined healers incorporat ed the itinerant diviners, healers and charlatans of whom we hear so much in the 44 The divine a ssociation s of healers an d healin g tech nologie s are e xplored fu rther in Pedro L ain Entralgo, The Therap y of the Wo rd in Cla ssical Antiquit y, trans l. L. J . Rather and John M. Sharp (Ne w Haven a nd Londo n, 1970 ), p. 41. 45 Homer., Od. 19.457 -9. Th e bindin g of banda ges and the recitatio n of incantatio ns are both de scribe d usin g the word KL\u0099\u008a in Gree k, sug gestin g that these act s and words together constitute an early, sympathetic 'ther apeutic i dea': Lain Ent ralgo (1970), p. 21. 46 Pindar, Pyth. 3.47-54. 47 Lain Entralg o (197 0), p. 4 . 48 Such medi cal markets dev elope d on an informal, sup ply and sis: Vivian Nutton, 'Mu rders toward s medicine in cla ssical a ntiquit y', in Roy Porter (ed.), Patients and Pra ctition ers: La y Perception s of Medicin e in Pre- industrial So ciety (Camb ridge, 1985 ), 26. 12classical period.49 Amulets were used with the same theoretical framework in mind, wherein illnes s was an affliction from without, and could be warded off accordingly. Su ch amulets (often with accompanying incantations50) were extremely popular throughout ancie nt civilisatio n, and were u sed various ly to ward off daemons, illness an d adverse magic or the evil eye. The polemical attitude of the Hippokratic treatise On the sacred disease , which attacks belief in divinely sent illnesses , suggests that such beliefs were still prevalent in the classica l period.51 However, practitioners of rationalistic Hippokratic almost inevit ably continued to relate their healing techniques to divinity. Some rati onalistic phy sicians believed in the phenomena of miracl es and divine or m antic dreams. Dreams of this type may have necess itated the services of a diviner or priest. Certain Hippokratic physicians advise prayer in combination wit h their own medical treatments.52 Even the firmly anti-magical author of On th e Sacred Dis ease asserts that all things - illnes ses and cures alike - are 49 See espe cially my discussions below, pp. 16-1 9. this topic see e specially Roy Kotansky , 'Incantatio ns an d praye rs for inscrib ed G reek amul ets' in Farao ne an d Obbin k (1991), 107 -37. 51 This Hippok ratic author attack s very s pecific falla cious belief s about disea ses, that certai n sympt oms poi nt to attacks by pa rticul ar gods: piercing cries like a horse i ndicate that Poseido n is to blame, other sym ptoms indicate a ttacks by the 'mother of to, Phaedru s 244c argues in a similar vein to the Hip pokratic writer, agai nst the belief that offering to Chthonic deities and obtaining purifi cations w ill produce a cure for ill ness, whil e another Platonic dial ogue ha s Sokrates reve Pl., Belief in evide ntly d into late cian, and incantation s; cf.

This relati onship betwe en divinity, medicine (traditional and rational) and magic is explored in more detail in Chapter Three below, in the context of rhizoto mia. The terminology of literary magic In an effort to grasp specifically classi cal literary notions of magic, and to sidestep some of the problems associ ated with modern attempts to define magic, we shall now investigate epi sodes and acts that are explicitly identified by ancient writ ers as magical. Three terms (and their cognates) will be particularly relevant here - \u0086 he firs t two terms are atteste d quite early in Greek l iteratu re, and it is to these that we shall turn firs t. 52 Hipp., Regim en 4 ngthy discu divine drea ms and dream int erpretation; Regim en 4, 87.14 and 90.63 encourage prayer. cf. Arist., On the gene ration of anim als, IV.4.770b9; L Edelst 1,5. Airs, waters, plac 4, Progno stic 1.20, and a corru pted section of Decorum 6 for similar idea s.

Kirke, a di vine nymph in Book ten of the Odyssey , feeds a MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084 in beverage form to Odysseus' companion s, thereby turning them into swine.55 Odysseus is able to resist Ki rke's charms with the aid of the counter-acting MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084 - \u0081\u008a z\u008b\u0018\u0019 - with which Herme s supplies him.57 Also in the Odyssey Helen giv es an Egyp tian MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084 with grief-assuaging properties to Menelaus' troubled guests.58 In each of these instances t he substance in question is of strange (variously div ine or foreign59) origin and remarkable efficacy, which locates it in the realm of the magical.60 An Homeric MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084 could have medicina l, healing qualities.61 Here again divine connections assert themsel ves.62 Elsewhere in Homer, the same term is used to denote poison, such as that which Ody sseus smeared on 55 Ibid., 10.388ff. 56 This drug is discu ssed in more d etail in my ne, Versnel a nd R.

We shall see in subsequent chapters that substances and rituals which were believed to defy normal boundaries and distinctions tended to be feared, revered or scorned, and were frequently categorised as 'magical'. In the Laws , Plato makes clear that in his own day the single term MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084 could refer equally to poisons 'acting accordin g to nature', medicinal substances, and the substances used by experts in more arcan e lore.65 By this time, ex perts in such lore were known by names built on the MH\u0088\u0081 - root.66 The medical usages of MH\u0088\u0081- that appear in Homer also contin ue into the classical period and beyond.67 Plato explicitly dwells up on the diversity and confusion of 63 Home r, Od. 1.261; cf. 2.329. 64 On this non -differentiating appro ach se e Graf (1 995), 36-7; Jo hn Scarboroug h, 'The pharma colog y of sacred pl ants, he rbs, a nd roots' in F araone an d Obbink (1991), 139. 65 Plato, Laws 932e -933e, transl.

The word is related to \u0086 N\u0086\u0099\u0086\u0005 - the ritual lament that helps the dead make the transition out of the realm of l iving.69 Like the singers of ritual laments, the N\u0086\u0099O\u008dL\u0005 of classical literatu re were invariably marginal, or marginalised figures, a ssociated variously with ecstasy and lamentation, ites and div ination.70 Herodotos, Euripides and Plato all us e the term to descri be charlatanry as much as genuine sorcery,71 which fits with Plato's assertion t hat it is difficult to discern the truth about sorcer y and superstition.72 The first uses of \u0086 \u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 known to us are in Heraklitos and Herodotos. Herodotos refers to member s of the Persian priestly class by 68 Pl., Laws 932e-933e. 69 Aesch., Pers. 687. 70 Graf (19 95), 32. 71 Hero dotos is doubts the Neuri pe ople's alleged themselve s: Hdt. 4.105. He al so refe rs to the pow erful utteran ces of the Persi an pri te rm: just as The seus accuses his son of lying with the words to both 932e-933e. 17this name, and the word never lo st this original association.73 On the other hand, Heraklitos of Ionia (himse lf a subject of the Persian kin g), associates \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P with bacchants, maenads and mystai who 'err in the night'.74 That is to s ay, for Heraklitos the \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P were not an elevated religious caste, but simply another group who practised rituals at the margins of society, that we re variously feared and ridiculed.75 The groups with which Her aklitos ass ociates Persian \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P are all practitioners of non-civic ritual. In classical lit erature words related to \u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 come into use to describe magic arts, usually in a hostile sense. In Sophok les' play, for instance, King Oidipous rejects an unwelcome prophecy of Tieresias, and deni grates the seer by refering to him as a \u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 .76 This works to identif y the esteemed seer with the more socially dubious itinerant priests ( HQN\u008b\u0099\u0088\u008dL\u0005 ), seers (\u0081H\u0099\u0084\u008dLP\u0005 ), e fourth ce ntury evidenc e that at least some Greeks per ceived that the functions of the Persian priesthood were being misconstr ued by their own culture. The ethnographer Pseudo-Aristotle for exam ple, explic itly challenges prevailing beliefs by asserting that: ...the \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P do not know magical sor cery.78 73 B 14, from Cleme nt, Protr . 22.2. 75 Graf (19 95), 31. 76 Soph., OT 387. But see Eur., Or. 149 7 for a more ambivalent u sage. 77 On these religiously margi nal and di strusted figures see Pl., Derven i Papyus The Ori zing Near Ea stern i nfluen k culture in the early A rchaic p eriod (Harvard University Press: Camb ridge, s, transl. to \u0086 0H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 and \u0086 N\u0086\u0099O\u0005 both appear from the fifth c entury onwards, and are associated with foreign, incomprehensible or dubious practi ces. Nonsensical (ie. non-Greek) vocalis ations are associated wit h both terms, as N\u0086H\u0099\u008a suggests animalistic howling, and Persian 0H\u0099N\u0086P used language and rituals which were deeply enigmatic to t he Greeks of the fifth century.79 It is notable that both of these words lack a good Greek pedigree.80 Indeed, A. D. Nock has located the origins of \u0086 \u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 and O \u0081H NLP\u0099H in the religious language of Persia.81 This is relevant to the Greeks' own beliefs, that forei gn places and peoples were the primary source of magical knowledge. Magic as marginal and distanced 'other' Magically effective substances are most commonly attributed to distant and exotic places in both the sci entific and poetic lit erature throughout Graeco-Roman antiquity. It has been noted that already in Homer MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH are attributed to divine or foreign sources.82 Medeia, a 79 Hero dotos tells that the 0H\u0099N \u0086P are not burie d at death, but allow their b odies to be maule d by a bird or d og, and that in life t hey like to kill cre atures indiscrimi nately with their ba re ha nds: Hdt. 1.140.

In Aristophanes, as elsewhere, emphasis is placed upon relatively remote Thessaly as the home of all the most powerful sorceresses.84 The PGM betray a continuing belief in the m agical prowess of various exotic cultures, in their indiscr iminate use of the names of Christian, Hebrew and other gods.85 The Greeks' ten dency to assign their magic a foreign origin is ac cepted as fact in some modern scholarship on the subject. Walter Burkert, for instance, explor es the influence that Near Eastern augury techniques had upon Greece in the Archaic period through trade and travelling ritual experts.86 Others go further, to suggest that all magic in Greece was essentially foreign in nature.87 Jonathan Smith has cautioned that to take this stance is to make the same mistake that the Greeks themselves made.88 For to identify rituals as foreign is to render 83 On whic h see further chapter four, pp. 121ff. 84 Aristoph anes mentions a T hessali an ch in the cont ext of magica lly drawin g down the moon at Clouds 749. This was clearly a popula r motif, recu rring as it character Lucius travel s to Thessaly to study magi c (Meta . 3.21 -8), such is th e reputatio n of the place. The Latin word for a male witch is in fact thessalus , from the Greek locality: Gord on (199 9), 165. 85 Chri st, chri stian archa ngels, Yahwe h (or IAO) and Mi thras a re called upo n as p owerful and u seful 'd aemon s' in spells from raeco-Roma 187 -262, 282- 409, 424-66; IV.1227-64; VII.1009- 16, among many examples. 86 Burke rt (1992). 87 Barb (19 63); Edelstein (1934), 219. 88 The Gre eks' tenden cy to believe magi c to be foreig n to their cultu re is taken u p in altered fo rm by Roman culture. While P lutarch believ es magi c rea ched Gre ece throug h the barb arian people s, Ovid finds that al l magic at Ro me is forei gn, and much of it is Fasti II.38; 20them both marginal, and more powerfu l by virtue of th e mystery they thereby convey.89 In the course of this thesis I will a rgue that these fifth century developments in defining and viewing magic are part of a pattern of defining the Greek self by its opposit ion to the deeds (real or perceived) of foreign and marginalised groups.90 The presence of indigenous and foreign elements in particular rituals and figures identified as magical will be assessed. Processes by whic h indigenous Greek practices became associated with foreignness will be identified. Processes by which acceptable practices develop ed a magica l identity will a lso be exp lored, in an effort to cast light on the way that Greek culture identified itself by contrast with foreign or unacceptable behav iour. It will be shown that this 'Greek self ', created through t he conglomeration of myths and dramatic and philosophica l writing, is overwhelmingly male and citizen in profile. Chapter two: the transformations of H ekate Chapter Two will trace the development through time of a specific deity - Hekate - from her first appearanc e in evidence of the Archaic period through to her much-altered fourth c entury identity. Some suggestions will be made as to why this esteemed deity evolved into a marginal, fearful figure with strongly magical U nderworld associations. Greek ideas 89 Smith, Jonathan Z., 'Towa rds inte rpreting demoni 1978 ), 425 -39. 21about firmly delineated states of being and spaces, and how they relate to radically op posed states and spaces, will he lp inform thi s discussio n. As a number of scholars have argued, Gr eek culture grew increasingly concerned with boundaries during the Archaic per iod and later, and corresponding concer ns with trans gression of these boundaries emerged simultaneously.91 On the subject of t he creation and crossing of boundaries , Richard Gordon imagines t hat magic was, to Greek and Roman minds, a paradoxical m eeting of opposites between powerful/helpless, It will be sugges ted that Hekate's role as a guardian of boundaries was one catalyst for her own transformation into an especially dangerous and magic al deity. The fact that Hekate was worshipped in private, ra ther than civic, cult also contributed to her profile as a goddess of magic. Chapter three: the dangerous potential of women's knowledge Chapter Three will ap proach the ri tuals, langu age and im agery of MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH in their relation to the feminised roles of cookery, herbalism and midwif ery. It will be noted that each of these crafts constituted a more or less exclusiv e technology, and that they were imbued wit h special powers and dangers because of this exclus ivity. 90 This app roach owe s some thing to the work of Edith Hall, Inventing the Barba rian: Gree whi ch see two below, . that trav ersing bo undaries invites p ollution see Mary Douglas, Purity and Dang er: an anal ysis of concepts of pollution a nd taboo (London, 1966 ). 22These inherent dangers were magnified, I shall argue, because the knowledge was believ ed to resi de mainly with women. Construction of feminine behavi our in the tragic tra dition Chapters Four and Five will return our attenti on more especially to constructions of magic and magic users in the classical literary tradition. The focus will be upon the characters of Medeia and Deianeira in turn, primarily in the plays by Euripides and Sophokles, to examine closely how magic was subtly constructed as a femi nine, threatening realm of knowledge. Beyond offering an analysis of the obvious c ontrasts and more subtle similarities between the motivations and actions of the two female figures, this approach is intended to reveal a consistent ideologic al framework that informs them both. Moreover, it is intended to show that the images are consistent with the two most prev alent stereotypes available in the construction of women in classic al Greek culture. Through innov ation and the deployment of certain literary techniques in the writing of the Trachiniai and the Medeia , it may be posited that both authors reveal a conscious ness of the dangerous power and gender ass ymetries inherent in the ideologies they simultaneously maintain. 92 Rich ard G ordon, 'Aelian' s Peony: the critici sm 9 (1987), 61. On the cent rality of such opp ositions to Gre ek thought see b elow, pp. 18 -20. 23The heavy use in these two chapters of literary, specifically dramatic, evidenc e requires some introduction and explanation. The intention is emphatically not to reconstruct the largely invisible category of real women's voices by way of the pl entiful and voluble voices of female characters in classic al drama. The phenome non of women's visib ility and power to bring about political wat ershed in drama has been the focus of much femi nist scholarship over the past three decades. The pitfalls of seeking 'real women' in these sources have been amply explored in pioneering works by Helene P. Fo ley, M. Shaw and others, and the plethora of responses that these i nspired.93 Instead, new ways of gleaning inf ormation about women and gend er from this literature have developed, incorporating psychoanalyt ical, structural anthropologic al and post-structuralist theories and methodologies.94 Of particular concern to us here are t he ideas expressed in Levi-Strauss' important works on st ructural anthropology.95 This discipline seeks to isolate and identify the encoded units of meaning upon which soc ieties are founded. In the case of the ancient Greeks ( and many other societies 93 J. P. Gould, 'Law, custom and myth: aspec ts of the social p osition of women in classical A thens', JHS 100 (1980), 38 -59; Helene P. Foley, 'The co nception of women in Athenian d rama' in Hel ene P. Foley (ed.), Refle ctions of Wom en in Antiquity (New York : 1981 ), 127 -68; M. Shaw, 'The Fem ale Intrude r: wom en in fifth-cen tury drama ', C. Phil 70 (1975), 25 5-66; P. E. Easterling, 'Women in tragic the feminine in G reek dram a', in J. J. Win kler and From a I.

In his Polarity and Analogy G. E. R. Ll oyd finds that the conscious application of binary oppositions to problems is firmly entrenched in Greek thought as early as the Presocratic philosophers.97 Gender and symbolic structuralism The primacy of dualism in Greek thought is also evident in tragedy and myth, where it is expressed through discord and antagonism. Few of the conflicts explored in dr ama consti tute simple black and white cases,98 but the emergent patterns have nonet heless proved to be a useful platform from which to assess the plot- and t heme-patterns in the extant tragic corpus.99 Exploration of the interplay of t hese implicit 'units of meaning' in Greek myth and literature has been led by French classicists such as Marcel Detienne and J .-P. Vernant.100 In applying structuralist methodologies to classical drama, numerous feminist scholars hav e 96 Working with compa rative data, Lloyd n otes a si milarl y conscio us dualism in the thought of the East Timbira tribe of Sout h America, the peopl e of Amboyna, Indo nesia, and the Me ru people of Ke nya: G.

The present study accepts that this cat egory of 'woman' is frequently us ed in rhetoric to signify either nature or the oikos - the balancing or opposing ideas101 to the symbolic equations of man:culture or man: polis. While neither set of opposites fits all the scenarios presented by the literature, whether artistic, philos ophical, litigi ous or scientific, both are useful to varying degrees, depending on the indiv idual context. One ought not to expect unanimity in such patterns in the case of the ancient Greeks, at least, as they applied the bulk of these dichot omies self-conscious ly and rhetorically, and thus were in a position to alter them according to the needs of particular arguments.102 Among various Hippok ratic and competing theorists on anatomy, fo r instance, women were ascribed various combinations of hot/cold and dry/moist constitutions (with men exhibiting the opposit e combination). Such perplexing variations and contradictions may be attributed to t he diversity of scientific opinion, or just as often to the need for a ne at and persuasive explanation of the phenomenon under investigation.103 101 The ambig uity of this inversion, eq ually suggestive of conflict an d harm ony, is essential to the interp retati on of confli cts in drama (an d to my thesis of the outsi der within the social system, an d to Foley' s idea of the com plementa ry/antithetical relation ship betwee n oikos and polis). 102 David Co hen, Law, Sexual ity and Soci ety: the enfor cement of morals in cla ssical Athens (Cam bridg e, 1991 ), 71. Lloyd, too, notes that the subje cts of his anthrop ologi cal study tende d to view their own cultures as defin ed by dualism, alth ough em (19 92), 31-4 1. 103 Preso cratic p hilosophe rs, upon whose works the fifth centu ry me dical write rs based their own the oretical outlo ok, we re not i n agre ement as to the man :woman Empedo kles, like the Pyt hagorean s asserted that me n were hotter than wome n, and that this wa s why they were dar ker, hairi er and m ore powerful. Parmeni des on the other hand claime d that women were ho tter, a nd that menst rual ble eding proved that this wa s so. Aristotle reco rds his surprise at the o ngoin g disp ute over su ch basic and Empedo kles: H. a nd W. Kran z (eds.), Die F ragmente 26 What is important to t he present analys is, though, is that a diametrical opposition between male and female genders invariably features prominently in some fashion in the dramatic texts. As recognis ed by post-structuralist approaches to art, the audience is as involv ed in the construction of the meanings of a work as the writer is. With women and matters of gender being so prominent in Greek drama, it is not surprising that much i nk has been spilt over the issue of whether women themselves - particularly citizen wom en, formed a part of this audience.104 Some scholars favouring female citizen presence cite the vocality of officially silenced groups (such as women, slaves and foreigners) as evidenc e of the implicit egalit arian ideals of Athenian drama.105 Howe ver, the stock nature of many minor c haracters such as slaves and nurses would seem to detract from this argument. Furthermore, symbolic, mythologic al and liter ary constraints mean that dramati c figures are simultaneously much more and much less than representatives of the der Vorso kratiker (Zurich, 1967), frs. 62 648a34. The Hip pokratic write rs lacked consensus on thi s issue too: Hipp., Mul. 1.1 (Littre (vii.494.22 -3) find wome n to be hotter than men, while Steril . 216 (viii.416.20-3) a nd Vict. 1.34 that men are hotte r than wome n. cf.

Detractors from the argument for female audience presence have highlighted the frequency with whic h male-authored and male-acted female characters voice male concerns rather than reflect social reality.106 While no firm conclusions on the matter may be drawn from the evi dence as it stands, the present writer tends to favour the dissenting arguments of the latter group of scholars. Seek ing a firmer ground on the issue, J. Henderson and Laura McClure argue that, regardless of the presence or otherwise of citizen women, the p oets nonetheless addressed their ideas to a \"notional audience of men\".107 Such an approach views the Athenian dramatic festivals as another forum for discussion on matters of political (ie. masculine) concern. It is through their interactions with this 'ideal' audience of citizen men that the poet s contributed to the construction of the 'Greek self', discussed previously.108 Keeping this notional audience of men in mind, then, we shall consider how Deianeir a and Medeia interact with their own myths and gender stereotypes.

It is significant to the present study that both Deianeira and Medeia suffer hards hip on account of the gender inequities permitted by the Greek marriage contract, and that the reactions of each take the shape of seizing upon the supernatural powers made accessible to them. In each play the morality of using such subversive forms of power constitu tes a dominant theme. Both the Trachiniai and the Medeia deal with the use and abuse of power both in marriage and on the divine, univ ersal level. Here, magic becomes an avenue for redress, a tool offering leverage to those in a position of powerless ness.109 Two faces of magic: accusat ion and self-admission Chapter Five will draw attention, onc e again, to the fact that two very different attitudes to magic presen t themselves, depending whether it is one's own or another's magic that is at issue.110 Discussions of the use of magic in dramatic literature tend to take o ne of two forms: accu sations of the use of magic by others; and narrative descr iptions or admissions of personal magic use. We shall turn first to accusations of magic use. In Euripides' Bacchai Pentheus, the reigning king of Thebes refers to the foreign evangelist who is actually Dionys os in disguis e, as the king himself refe rs to Tieresias as 109 The uses of magic in n egotiating unev en relatio nships - especially between th e sexe s - will be surveyed in my conc luding rem arks, pp. 241-47. 110 On whi ch p, 11 above . 111 Eur., Bacc. 234. 29\u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 .112 A third accusation of some thing resembling magic is to be found in Euripides ' Hippolytos, where Theseus LQ\u0087\u008a\u0012K\u0086 \u0005 RHP N\u0086\u0099O\u0005 .113 In each of the examples I have given the speaker is in an absolut e rage, from which we may assume that vile insults against Dionysos, Tieresias and Hippolytos respectively are intended. It is also worth noting that the accuser in each case - all three are in fact ki ngs - enjoys a firmer and considerably higher status than the tar get of their accusation. In each case the target is of unusual (and therefore vulnerable ) status. Dionysos comes under fire on account of his effeminacy, his foreignness, his strange powers of influence and his disl ocation as a foreign religious figure. The seer Tieresias is ta rgetted on account of the unwelc ome truths he speaks. Hippolytos is an overtly pious, chaste devotee of Artemis whose offence is to calmly, if somewhat tactlessly, deny a charge of rape with which his father has confidently, though wrongly, charged him. The great potential of such fi gures to upset the natural order of society, or to bring shame upon thei r accuser, is matched by their vulnerab ility to charges of fraudulence. In the instances surveyed here, it is notable that all of the accused are in fact male, as are their accusers. We also have instances where male figures accuse females, as for example in the Trachiniai . Herakles, 112 Soph., OT 387. 113 Eur., Hipp. 1038. 30horrified and astounded at the dam age wrought by Deianeira's 'lov e potion', demands to know: ...and who, of the Trachini ans, is such a sorcerer?114 Hermione's accusation against Andromac he, that the Troj an woman used MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH to render her infertile, cons titutes a relatively rare instance of one woman accusi ng another of using magic.115 Such accusations by women against men are not attested at all in the literary sources (to the best of my knowledge) . This fact may of course be attributed to the incompleteness of the classical dramatic sources. On the basis of other ancient treatments of the subject of magic, though, I will suggest that accusations of magic are primarily a masculine weapon, issued from a position of power and used against those of less secure status. Accusations of all kinds - with or without foundation - play ed an important role in agonistic public lif e in ancient Mediterranean societ ies. Accusations of the practi ce of magic by others proved to be an effective tool for disrupting and renegotiating one's status, relative to their peers.116 The vulner ability of women and other margi nal groups to such accusation s - formal or tacit - will be reiterated throughout this thesis. When it is the reality of magic that is at issue in tragedy, as opposed to rhetorical description of one kind or another, a rather different generic 114 Soph., Trach . 1140. 115 Eur., Andr . ds to this accusation at Andr . 205. 116 This a spect of the public f ace of magi c will be explo red furthe r in chapter six bel ow. 31scenario presents itself. The user s of magic and divine or otherwise privileged s ubstances are, as previous ly not ed, overwhelming ly female. When, in fifth century B. C.E. tragedy, female characters have recourse to magic, they tend to do so with an attit ude of apology or self-justification. This is certainly the case with Phaedra and Deianeira in Sophok les' Trachiniai , both of w hom are presented as otherwise good, chaste citizen wives, who are painfully aware of the need to maintain a good public reputation. Their apolog etic and desperate uses of witchcraft are at odds with the images of purveyors of magic suggested by the tone of the accusations of O \u0081H NLP\u0099H and O N\u0086O\u008dLP\u0099H I mentioned earlier. In those accusations, ideas of hubris loom large, along with at time s confl icting notions of fraudulence and access to great power.117 In the Trachiniai , on the other hand, Deianeira goes to some effort to distance herself and the love charm she plans to use from the 'evil bold de eds' of other women. Deiane ira is daring enough to use the love charm, yet fearing for her reputation she rejects the notion that she resembles a MH\u0088\u0081HRP\u0099\u0005 in any way. Even within these two plays - Trachiniai and Hippolytos - I think we can observe a critical split between t he thought of being regarded by others as a MH\u0088\u0081HRP\u0099\u0005 , and the actual use of magical devices. This constitutes literary evidence in su pport of a tendency among the Greeks to espouse opinions about magic which are at odds with actual practice. This may be viewed a s an illustration of the tensions e xisting betwe en 117 Perhap s cap turing an other of the para doxes erent in Gree k und ersta ndings of 32public morality and private enterprise, observed and dis cussed by Henk Versnel.118 Thus it is possible to justif y to oneself the use of a helpful potion, although the same behav iour in others would be considered a threat to social stabilit y and lawful process. Or , stated differently, magic is the product of a shared imagination. Magic is thus considered to pose the most powerful threat when it is the imagined magic of others.119 Indeed, when practised by oneself, magi c is barely regarded as such. Chapter six: Magic and the polis Discrepanc ies in the way that magic is viewed in the literature - as a powerful tool or mere c harlatanry; as a gross impiety or a helpful lit tle philtre - remind us that Greek cu lture possessed no central religious, scientific or ethical canon. Instead, the legitimacy of practices such as magic were subject to constant negot iation through public (ie. political) debate.120 Continuing the focus upon accusa tions of magic, Chapter Six examines the way O \u0081HN LP\u0099H and O N\u0086O\u008dL P\u0099H were constructed and pursued in the At henia n legal framework. It will be suggested that the secrecy and individual enterprise that are central to magic set the practice at odds with the public ethos of the democratic Athenian legal system. By the sa me process, magic was increasingly constructed as a socially and politi cally disruptive - ie. undemocratic - magic, of whi ch Go rdon (1987) speaks: see p. 21, n. 92 above. 118 Versnel (1991), 62 argues that an 'amoral fa milist' ethos operates i n (ancient and mode rn) M editerranean cul tures. Simply stated, one d oes a nything possibl e that will benefit one' s family, and assume that ot hers will do th e same. So me su ch actions may be publi cly bo asted, othe rs must neve r be adm itted. In accordan ce with this dou ble moral stand ard, one wo uld deno unce an other for a cting in una ccept able ways, bu t surre ptitiousl y practi ce the s ame methods . 119 Gordo n (1999); Gordon (1987). 33force. The increasing concern ab out magic in literary and politic al discourse at Athens will be correla ted with the emergence and rise to prominenc e of a democratic polis identity. As public life became valorised in the classical period, pr ivate initiatives increasingly risked being char acterised as magic, or otherwise uncitizen-like behaviour. Chapter seven: Magic and Greek iden tity - otherne ss and foreignness The democratic rhetori c of the ex panding Athenian empire of the fifth century helped to connect ideas about magic and Persia as foreign, imminent threats to Greekness. Chapter Seven looks at magic's relationship with foreignness (real and imagined variously), and at ways that ideas of 'Greekness' were solid ified by contrast with magical and cultural 'otherness'.121 The Greeks' extens ive ideas of otherness presuppos e a rather circumscribed noti on of selfhood. Their preference for defining with reference to binary oppositions means that the category 'Greek citizen adult male' was op posed to barbarian, non-citizen, non- democratic, female, animal and divine. Thus it is that we find explicit correlations of feminine/magical /P ersian/bar barian/div ine/beast in the literature.122 In their oppositionary role, all of the above categories are constructed as potential threats to or der in the pre-eminent, masculine, public disc ourse of the period.123 120 Gordo n (1999), 162. 121 On the role o f the idea of otherne ss in re lations b etween the sexe s see Simo ne de Beauvoir, The Sec ond Sex , tran sl. H. M. Parshley (Lond on, 195 3), esp. pp. 15f f. 122 Magic p roves to be mo st powerful whe n it is perform ed by wome n, and whe n the magical tech nology is of foreig n or divi ne orig in. cf. my discu ssions of Kirke an d Medeia in particular. 123 Thus it is that even Deianeira, a good and Greek wife, still reveals herself to be a threat to the oikos. 34 Magic as a threat to legi timate power structures In my concluding rema rks I will e xplore the magica l asso ciations of erotic love in the PGM , and i n the poetic literature of the classical period. Gender inversion is a recurrent featur e of literature pert aining to erotic love and es pecially erotic magic. This relates directly to ancient Greek understandings of erotic love as a so rt of disease, and to the mechanics of romance, wherein the beloved is always of subordinate status and yet is felt to exert control over the other wise dominant lover. Ideas of gender inversion s uggest that erotic magic was understood to be a subversive tool with the potential to disrupt accepted power hierarchies to the advantage of otherwise weaker parties . Indeed, magic more generally seems to fit this profile. The cu rse inscriptions, for instance, are frequently issued with the intention of at taining justice when one's inferior social pos ition makes formal or pub lic means of redress i naccessible.124 Once again, we see magic operat ing privately in contempt of, or disregard for formal polis-sanctioned avenues for redress. Magical activities, as identified by the ancient sources, are invariably private in nature. Because such rites were exc lusive of the polis, there was a tendency to believe that their ai ms were not merely self-serving, but openly hostile towards the broader community. This inclination towards distrusting the intentions of others w as a corollary of the agonistic, duplic itous nature of classi cal Greek society. Throughout this 35thesis it will be shown that private, covert and unseen activities were stigmatised as antagonistic towards t he ideals of public life. Private activities, and especially those activi ties that dealt with transformative processes, were particularly vulnerabl e to accusations and intimations of magical dealings. By vi rtue of their reproductive potential, women were closely connected with transformat ions and boundaries. Being als o confined (as far as was feasible) to the unseen interior of the house,125 and exc luded from public life women were especially open to accusations of magical misdemeanour. The Greek conception of magic was conceived as alien to the world of ci vic-focused, citizen males, and thus consanguineous, by virtue of a binar y pattern of thought, with feminine 'nature'. 124 Vers nel (1991), es p. 68ff. 125 Indeed, wom en we re them selve s understood, biologically, as con stituting a kind of enclosed spa ce: Padel (19 83), 3-19. 36Chapter Two Hekate: traversing dangerous boundaries In Attic drama of the fi fth and early f ourth centuries Hekate is implicitly connected with Chthonic and uns avoury areas of Greek religious belief and practice. In subsequent centurie s this goddess came to be firmly connected with the rituals, prefer red location s and lang uage surrounding magic, as known from the elite literary tradi tion. Disparities in representations of this deity, however , indicate that she may not have always pre sided over such activities. The present chapter will be devoted to an examination of the evolving relationships between the goddess Hekate and magic and the Underworld in Greek myth, cult, literature and iconography. In his Medeia , first performed in 431, Euripi des has the heroine declare: By the mistress whom I revere / most of all and (whom) I choose as a partner in schemes / Hekate, inhabiting the inmost recess of my hearth.\u0014 Medeia's invocation of Hekate occurs during the speech in which she first reveals that she intends to kill the off ending trio of Jason, his new bride, and Kreon by her skilful use of MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH . As discussed in chapter one above, the term MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084 may be used to 1 Eur., Med. 395-9 7. 36designate poisons, or magical potions, or both.2 Given the barely fathomable boldness of Medeia's characte r in this play, and the terrible deeds she is calmly devising, it is di fficult to accept that the naming of Hekate here is meant to be other t han a morally and dr amatically loaded term. A fragment of S ophokles' Rhizoto moi connects Hekate wit h Helios (possibly as the goddess' partner in a lunar-solar parallelism3), with roads and the associated Greek goddess E nodia, and with crossroads in sacred fi re, weapon of Hekate of the road, Which in service to you she brings down through Olympos and the terrible crossroads of the sacred land, wreathing herself with oak leaves and the winding coils of savage serpents. 2 Chapte r one, pp. 14-16. 3 A. n (ed.), The Fragm ents of Sopho kles, vol. 2 (Cam bridge, 191 7), p. 176. 4 Soph., Rhiz. Frag. 535: Richard 198 1), p. 411. 37In a recent and insightful work on how the Greeks related to their dead, Sarah I. Johnston has interpreted the context of this fragment to be an invocation and reques t of Hekate for assistance in preparing a spell, although s uch a specific reading does not appear to be justified by the text.5 The subject matter of the play and the presence of language suggestive of invocation, however, ma y go some way to justifying such an interpretation. Passing remarks elsewhere in tragedy and comedy indicate other of Hekate's areas of apparent exper tise, concern and protection during the classical period. A character in a tragic fragment of unknown authorship asks fear a p hantom in your sleep, and have received a visitation from Chthonic Hekate. Hekate's role as a leader or s ender of phantoms is re-affirmed by Menelaus ' exchange with t he wife whom he believed he had carefully concealed in a cave: 5 Sarah Iles Johnsto n, Restless De ad: en counters bet ween the livin g and the de ad in ancient Gre ece (Berkeley, 1999 ), p. 204 . 6 Trag. Ade sp., 375; TrGF , vol. 2, p. 115. 38 Menelaos: You, my wife? What sort of wife? Do not touch my robes! Helen: (The wife) whom my fa ther Tyndareos gave Menelaos: Oh, Light-bearer visions! Helen: It is no nocturnal minist er of the Road Goddess whom you are seeing, but me.7 In addition, the fourth c entury Hippokratic treatise On the sacred disease tells us that practitioners of 'dubious arts' attribute nocturnal attacks by phantoms to Hekate-Enodia. (If) in the ni ght there occu r terrors and fears, madness and leapings up off the bed and flight s outside, they say it is an infliction fro m Hekate, or an attac k by Heroes.8 The efforts at persuasion and the appar ent exasperation expressed by the Hippocr atic author here suggest s that this belief had a strong following. Other factors which may hav e coloured this Hipp okratic writer's view of such 'superstitious' beliefs are discussed in chapter three below.9 Again, in his Plutus , Aristophanes makes light of the practice of setting out 'Hekate's Suppers' at the beginning (new moon) of each month.10 7 Eur., Hel. 567-70. 8 Hipp., On the Sacred Di sease , 4: above-mentioned extracts and fragments it is apparent that in the fifth century Hekate is connec ted in various ways with dreams, chthonic terrors, the Thessalian godde ss Enodia, magic al spells, and the complex of Greek ideas surrounding crossroads.11 To thi s collection may be added a fragment of Aeschylus , which asserts that hekataia (images of Hekate) were placed at the ent rances of houses of ore the doors of the homes of kings. This may be viewed as somewhat of an inversion of the more ambi valent or even sinister roles, which class ical writers ascribed to her, but as we shall see, these protective and harmful functions are logically and especially, connected in the case of Hekate. In a fragmentary paian the slightly earlier Pindar rejoices on behal f of the Abderitans of Thrace for a propitious and genuine orac le of the 'gracious maiden' Hekate, and connects her once again with lunar cycles But when (the enemy) has come near the river he will c onfound 11 On whi ch see Frag. 388, TrGF , vol. 3, p. 435. 40them using a few powerful arms agai nst a great army.\" That day fell on the first of the month, and the ruddy-footed, gracious maiden Hekate announced the prophe cy, which was eager to be fulfille d.13 In each of the instances given the re ferences to Hekate are brief and unelaborated, besides certai n epithets. This is commonly interpreted, by modern scholars, as indicating that Greeks of the classical period must have been thoroughly familiar with such information, and so did not require elaboration on meanings in each context. Modern scholarship, of course, does not have the benefit of this unstated body of knowledge. Indeed, the fragm entary state of our knowledge is testified by disagreem ent and trepi datio n regarding the reconciliation of singular 'Hy mn to Hekate' in Theogony (lines 411-52) with archaeological findings from the same period, and with the later classical (and Hellenistic and late anti que) figure/s of the goddes s. The singularly rapturous and lengthy hym nal tribute to Hekate in Hesiod's Theogony has been dismissed as an intrusion by a number of highly regarded scholars14 largely on hist orico-religious grounds, although more recently it has been accepted as stylis tically and thematically cons istent ny?', TAPhA 113 (1983), 80 in clude s a goo d bibliog raphy on this de bate. 41with, or rel evant to the work as a whole.15 Taking a somewhat different approach, Berg finds the 'Hymn to Heka te' to be archaic if not actually Hesio dic,16 and so valuable nonetheless from a broader perspective. The Hesiodic Hekate, who dates to c. 750-650, retains a share in the earth, sea and sky, but is notably absent from chthonic affairs, which later become central to her spheres of influenc e.17 It is also clear that Hek ate specifically aids men,18 in contrast with the feminine cultic and mythic associations which she later displayed.19 The only child of Asteria and Perses,20 Hekate is honoured by Zeus, despite belongin g to the disgraced Titan order, and with his grace her powers are even ext ended to include the role of kourotrophos - 'raiser of youth' . Froma I. dis pensati on of honours upon Hekat e to be a reconfirmation of her status in t he new divine order, or perhaps ev en a 'second birth' into the Olympic pantheon.21 Hekate's powers in the Theogony (and indeed elsewhere, as we shall see), overlap those of numerous Olympic deities, although t he poet assures the listener/reader that such encroachment is entirely harmonious. Her mediation in the 15 Froma I Zeitlin, 'Signifying Differen and Barba (eds.), Women in Antiquity: new a ssessments (London an d Ne w York: 1995 ), 58-74, esp. 62; Boe of Hec ate', AJP 102 (1961), 24 3-60, esp. 250 -1; M.

In combination with her unfixed mythologic al genealogy,24 it also suggests that the goddess herself may have been superim posed onto pre-existing, and rather mo re fixed, myth structure s.25 Before leav ing the Theogony , it should be not ed that while Hekate is most beneficent and very powerful, the poem repeatedly adds that her blessings may be enjoyed only 'if she so wills it'. While the poem offers Hekate the lavish prais e appropriate to a hymn, it also implies unpredictability26 and wilfuln ess, as the goddess may withhold her blessings, or even bestow them on one's adversaries. The repetition, in this connec tion, of subjunctive forms of the word LQ\u0089L\u0099z\u008a at lines 429, 430, 432 and 439 is most notabl e, and other adjacent uses of LQ\u0089L\u0099z\u008a -based words at lines 435 ( LQ\u0089LzO ), 443 22 In her mediat ion of these realms, Hekate's ro le overl that of Demeter.

In this work the poet i s discussin g the power and wilfulness of a deity, but here the subject is a predatory hawk - an allegory for Zeus' power to determine the fate of mortal s. Hekate's behav iour here is in keeping wit h the gods of Homeric epi c, whos e intervention in human affairs is also guided by caprice and bias.29 I would suggest that it is Hekate's mythical (if somewhat generic) wilf ulness, in combination with the cultic developments and associations to be discuss ed below, which led to her nature to becoming incr easingly chthonic and malevolent in the course of the classical period and increasin gly during the Hellenis tic period. Hekate features once again in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, where she is introduced as the only divinity , besides Demeter herself, who both knows that Persephone has been abduc ted, and is sympathetic to her 27 West (196 6), p. 285. This repetition al so indicates th e ritualisti c aspect of the hymn. 28 Hes., WD, 207-1 1 29 Hom., Il. 4:1-130. This bel ief in wilfulne ss and bia s on the part of the god s is al so well represented in the cla ssical literature. Cf . ultim ately benevole nt was also a rticulated, cf.

In this hymn, which has been dated to c. 650-550 on stylistic grounds,30 Hekate emerges from her cave , bearing a torch. Richardson interprets the cave and torch as being relev ant to her chthonic link s,31 although s uch connec tions are not pronounced elsewhere in this text. There was, however, a second version of the story of P ersephone's abduction and marriage to Hades, recorded by Callima chus, in which Hekate herself enters the Under world and leads Persephone out.32 This alternative version constituted a popular theme for vase paintings.33 In the Hymn, when Pers ephone and Demeter are reunited, Hekate is established servant ( \u0087\u0088\u0086\u0099\u008c\u0087\u0086z\u0086\u0005 ) and companion ( \u0086Q\u0087H\u0099\u008a\u0084 ).34 The wording at line 438 which introduces this role, LQR \u008d\u0086 \u008b ..., has been identified as characteristic of mythologic al aetiologies fo r the institution of rit uals, and this may exp lain Hekate's role in the Eleusin ian Mysteries.35 In the two archaic poems discussed abov e, Hekate is largely free from the chthonic or otherw ise sinister undertones that are detectable to varying degrees in classical and late r writings.

Modern scholars alm ost unanimously acce pt that Hekate originat ed as a goddess of Asia Minor - specifically Caria - whose wor ship reached mainland Greece by 700 B.C.E., or earlier.36 William Berg seems to constitute a lone voice of dissent, arguing that the evidence from A sia Minor is weak and largely dates to la te antiquity, suggesting instead that Hekate is no more an i mport to the Greek mainland than Dionysos .37 Berg's questioning of the meagre Ca rian evidence is valid, but his arguments for her Greekness rest on at least equally shaky grounds.38 One of the earliest pieces of archaeological evidenc e for Hekate consists of a late sixth century alta r in the precinct of Apollo Delphinios at Mi letus, inscribed to Hekate in boustrophedon -style. Its location front of the prytanneum would indicate an elevated, offi cial cult status for her there. Also dating to the late sixth centur y - this time from Athens - is a terracotta statuette, dedicated to Hekate by a man, and presumably representing the goddess herself. This female figure is indistinguis hable from any other langu age tend to rely heavily upon Krau s.

Given that Hekate was s ubject to a great deal of syncretism between the archaic, classica l and Hellenistic periods,42 it is imprudent either to project her status and popular ity backwards to earlier periods, or to assume a predictable, steady developm ent of her cult.

He is echoed by Johnston in suggesting that a more productive approach would be to examine how the demonolog ical beliefs held by the Greeks or the Romans operated within their cultures.44 It is notable that at no stage in her development is Hekate declared to be foreign, by Greek writers.45 Tentatively maintaining an eastern orig in for Hekate, then, we shall turn now to her functions within mainla nd Greek cult and myth, and how this relates to the Ephes ian, Milesian and Carian evidence. We have already discussed Hekate's connection to the El eusinian Mysteries in her role as Persephone's eternal attendant in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, composed circa the seventh or sixth c enturies. This would appear to underscore the idea of Hekate as kourotrophos , which was propounded in Hesiod's Theogony at lines 450-2 with much emphasis but little explanation. In t he Hy mn to Dem eter, Hekate's role of kourotrophos is Persephone's Underw orld marriage, with that of psychopompos . By the fifth century the identification of Hekate as a leader of the Underworld's denizens was clearly a useful and familiar theme. Hence a fragment of unk nown authorship, discussed previously, which has a character inquire of anot her whether they expect to be 44 Sarah I.

As with her genealogy, Hekate's duties are apparently superimposed onto pre-existing belie f structures. These 46 Trag.

A number of like Hermes,59 was particula rly concerned with points of in tersection and transition.60 Given the importance of spatial definition and polar oppositions to Greek conceptions of the cosmos,61 transgression of such boundaries, or occupation of the undefi ned boundary zones themselves constituted a cause for considerable unease.62 While boundaries gav e order to the world, they were themselves a poin t of weakness, or boundless ness. 55 Milet , I.3, 392, no. 172 (Rehm); John ston (19 99), p. 206. 56 LSAM 50.25-9; J.

Kirke dwells at a confusing, liminal point at the edge of the world, near the entrance to the Underworld. Kirk e herself resists stereotypes, and 63 Pindar, Pyth. XI.38. 64 Johns ton (1990), c h.

They were, it would seem, believed to gather at liminal places.67 While there is no explic it confirmation of this belief in the ancient sources, Plato tells us that crossroads were a preferred location for the deposition of such magical paraphernalia as waxen 'voodoo' dolls.68 Hellenistic and late antique PGM texts both indicate that magical rites were per formed specifically at crossroads in the hope of making contact with the spir its of the dead in later centuries.69 Plutarch tells us at Quaest. Rom . 290d that Hekate was present at crossroads in a beneficent capacit y, averting evil there, and at Quaest. Conv. 708f he lists her together with the danger-averting deities as recipients of 'Hekate's Suppers'. Such suppers were placed at crossroads at the new moon of each month.

E. author.74 Crossroads were a hub for diverse kinds of religious act ivity. They were equally ass ociated wit h pur ification and pollution, and so functioned as a membrane between the two ritual stat es of being. The dramatic and psychological potential of the use of crossroads in a Greek tragic context is explored in an arti cle by Stephen Halliwell.75 In the ex tant classical sources the word \u008d\u0088P\u0099\u0086K\u0086\u0005 - a meeting of three roads - i s rarely 70 Suda, Photius offering s of suppe rs to Hekate, \u0086Q\u008b\u0089\u008b\u0081P\u0099H may be more closely asso ciated with the Athenian cu stom of expelling pollute d corp ses (su ch as those of mu Enodia may also suggest that Polyneice s' corpse lay at a crossroad s at Soph., Ant. 1199ff. 71 Parke r note s a distinctio n betwe en such su ppers an d depo sition s of polluted material at cro ssroads, but nonethel ess co nsiders all su ch material to be a way of \"pinni ng the dang erous goddess at the crossroad s by prophyla ctic offerings: Pa rker (1983), p. 30, n. 65; Erwin Rohde, Psych e: the cult of so uls an d belief in imm ortality am ong the Gree ks, transl.

It should be remembered that Hekate wa s not different from Artemis or Apollo insofar as she might just as easily wit hhold the graces that i t was in her power to bestow. This ambivalence is detectable in the representations of gods in Homer, Hesiod and classical drama, and so was clearly an accepted element of divinity for most Greeks,77 but may also be somewhat responsible for e rrors in the analysis of Hekate's character.78 Artemis could, if her m ood tended towards the wrathful, choose to kill women, rather t han protect them, during child birth.79 Hecate, similarly, could choose to a llow spirits of the dead or other evils to gain access to people, either to puni sh them for neglect of her, or even despite their best efforts to gain her support.80 The risks associated with encountering He kate or spirits at liminal points when the goddess ha ppened to be ill-d isposed may have been exac erbated by the classical period, as a result of newly adopted beliefs about the potential of spirits for interfer ence in the world of the living. A 76 Eur., Suppl . 1212; Soph., OT 1400-1 is 29 ab ove. 78 See nn. 70 a nd 71 ab ove for a bri ef bibli ography of su ch comp romised a nalyses. 79 John ston (19 99), 212 80 The two si des to He kate's nature, an d her wilfuln ess, are di scusse d above at pp . 43- 44 in the co ntext of Hesiod' Theo gony. See also Johnston (199 9), 209. 54number of scholars have posited that interactions with Mesopotamian and Egyptian peoples led Greeks of the ar chaic period to move away from their belief in a passive and insubs tantial afterlife, towards new conceptions of the dead as potentially active and able to interact with the living.81 The fact that the two apparently contradictory notions coexist after Home r may sugg est just suc h a transition in beliefs about the dead.82 Hekate's esteemed duties of guarding liminal places and leading the souls of the dead may have been altered somewhat by new polis emphases upon boundaries and new belie fs about the dead, but this does not explain why her evolution was so different to that of Hermes. I would suggest that there was a tw o-fold reason why Hekate became increasingly associated with mora lly questionable or unacceptable 81 Prominent e xploration s of this idea in clude Walter B urkert, The O nfluen Gree k culture in the early a rchaic a ge, trans l.

Indeed, even the exception to this rule of public silence - the hymn to her in Hesiod's Theogony - has been interpreted in a context of private cult observance by Hesiod's Boeotian family.85 Here, too, though, one is left to wonder the source of Hesi od's information regarding Hekate's esteemed genealogy. As an outsider to Olympic and civic religion, Hekate's profile might be expected to suffer some neglect at the hands of civic-focused writers of the classical period. The Theogony (and arguably also the Hymn to Demeter) identifies kourotrophos , and Aristophanes, Pseudo-Herodotos and Apollonius Rhodius all indicate that this was a popular attribute of the goddess.86 As a raiser of children, Heka te could reasonably be expected to play a role in childbirth as well. Hekate's association with Artemis should be noted in this connection. According to Aeschylus, Artemis- Hekate brings labour pains to women.87 I would note that childbirth is yet 83 See chapte r one, p. 35 for my definition of magic a s religiou s behaviour whi ch is considered publicly un acceptable o r immoral (u ncitizen-li ke), but efficacio us in a chievin g person al gain s. 84 While John ston lists evid ence for shrines at gates in Thasos (Maritime Gate; Ga te of Silenus; Gate s of He rmes) and Athen s (near the Sa cred Gate; at the entran ce to the Akropolis), Deborah Lyon s notes the rari ty of temples to Hekate on the mainlan d: Lyons, Gend er an d Imm ortality: heroin es in a ncient G reek myth and cult (Princeton, 1 997), p. 153. Accordi ng to Marq uardt, He kate m ay have been the subje ct of private and family cult from the archai c period: Marqu ardt (1961), 25 3. 85 West theo rises that He siod's family observed an d encouraged a p rivate cult to Hekate: Wes t, Hesio d: Supp be sodes fro m myth in whi n to 'beco me Hekate'. A fragment of Stesi chorus tells that instea d of 56another transitional zone over which He kate presided, although this time the conceptual journey is specific to women. In her associations with birth and the raising of children He kate would have been popular as a household deity, and certainly favoured by women.88 This association with childbirth also underscored Hekate's affinity with situations inv olving pollution. ~~~~~ Given that Hekate seems to belong firml y within the sphere of private cult, with limited Olympian associatio ns it will be fruitful to explore, at this point, the relative values of mascu line and feminine lifestyles and forms of worship in classical Greek society. The ideal of strict gender segregation upheld by Greek, and especially Athenian, society has been widely explored by social his torians in recent decades. The largely male- authored lit erature of t he fully-fledged Athenian polis projects the notion that political life is the highest id eal to which a man could and should aspire. On the other hand, accord ing to the (arguably ideology-tinged89) letting Iphige neia be killed or rem oved (t o Taur is), Art emis tra nsformed the girl i nto Hekate: Stes ich., Frag. 215 PGM .

These works dra w Hekate into the 'dying maide n' paradigm, with which Artemis was i nvariably con necte d. For the 'dying mai den' in G reek myth, see esp. Lyons (199 7), John ston (19 99), ch. 6. 88 John ston (19 99), pp. 213 -4. 89 David Co hen advise s caution in the interp retation of th e literary source s, whi ch are overwhelmin gly elite, and ideolo gical in conte nt. He make s use of modern Mediterran ean sociological data in his argum ents: Da Perikles and Xenophon, women were relegated almo st wholly to what may be termed the private or domestic sphere.90 Through the mouth of Andromache in his Trojan Women Euripides too gives voice to the senti ment that feminine virt ue is best display ed through silenc e and public invis ibility.91 On the basis of such beliefs an oppositional framework of 'public versus private' has been utilised a s a mode of analys is in many recent studies of gender relations in classical Greek cultures.92 Howev er, a number of sc holars have instead aged the use of more and 'mutually defining'93 institutions of polis and oikos . Ancient writers themselves id entified this pair of concepts as significant to social structure.94 Sally C. Hu mphreys, for instance, observes that the separation of the sexes in social life constituted an extension of public life into the private domain. From fourth century family law cases (themselves an exercise in governance of the oikos by the polis) we know that women had relatively secure quar ters, separate from those belonging and the statu s of wom en in cla ssical Athen s' in Ian a nd cot (eds. ), Wom en in An tiquity (Oxford, 1996), 13 4-45. 90 Xen., Oec. 7-10; Thu k. 2:45 History an Anci ent Histo ry (Chapel Hill and L ondon, 1991 ). 93 Foley (198 1), 127-68, e sp. 156. 94 Sally C.

Suc h tensions are presumed to have informed Plato's and Xenop hon's views. The value of personal or familial activities is thus derided, albeit subtly, in the rhetoric of the (elite) At henian civic ideal.99 Some recent studies on this issue have suggested that the sexes in ancient Greek society occupied s eparate spheres, and had their own tools for exerting influence, thus enjoying \"psychologic al independence\" from the opposite sex100. Such approaches contest the view that women were segregated and subjugated. By introducing modern Mediterranean 95 Lysias 1:6 -14. 96 This was, of course, only relevant to the w ealthie r sections of so ciety. Many were too poor to afford such intricately desig ned houses.

The impli cations oration. 59parallels, though, such ar guments ignore the fact t hat ancient Athenian women wer e excluded from the highl y esteemed mechanisms of formal politic al po wer.101 Women's so-called informal influence through citizen males of the household was correspondingly mediated by their kyrios or other male relatives. Whether one employs a public-private or polis-oikos mode of analysis, the issue remains that the realms properly occupied by women present more limited opportunities for the acti ve exer cise and display of civic and religious virtue. Indeed, the very invis ibility of women in society would tend to draw suspicions of impiet y or other misdeeds. For appropriate behaviour in religion was, as an aspec t of lifestyle, similarly governed by the need to maintain an orthodox and tr ansparently 'citizen-like' public profile. Those who deviated from su ch norms of public worship were open to charges of impiety, atheism and other publicly abhorred relig ious behaviours. Hence Plato's ruling, par allel to that which abolishes the oikos itself, that private shrines be proscribed.102 While it may be argued that private wo rship of minor deities was, in reality, deemed acceptable to the polis, along with kins hip-based cults, most of these were subject to degrees of public scrutiny and imposition.103 For devotees of foreign deiti es to establish s hrines, for 101 Foley (198 1), 129. 102 Plato, Laws 909d -910d. 103 Robe rt Parker, Athenian religion: a hi story (Oxford, 1996), ch. 8. 60instance, the consent of the a ssembly had first to be secured.104 In fifth century Athens priesthoods that were formerly passed along genos lines were now chosen by lot from the citizen body,105 or were subject to public audit.106 As with classic al Athenian soci ety generally, religious practices are not readily div isible into 'public' and 'private' categories. Robert Parker observes that even those who er ected a shrine using private funds would commonly be expected to allow others to use it.107 Humphreys asserts that Greek religion was s o intrin sically social that \"a sacrifi ce in which there was no sharing of food outsi de the everyday family circle (or oikos ) could barely find a place in it.\"108 The partial supersession of the oikos ' hearth in classic al Athens may be discerned in the establis hment of a city hearth.109 It may be posited, then, that the machinery of the classical Athenian polis directly undermined the religious and so cial validity, and indeed the piety and justice of the oikos . We have already identifi ed magic in its classical context, as a ritual with primarily non-civic aims.110 This will hav e particularly impacted upon the status of a goddess such as Hekate. Absent from the works of Homer, Hekate was predominantly a hearth 104 Such consen t was obtai ned by Thra cian devotees of Bendis at Ath ens: IG II:2:1283; Xen., Hell. 2:4:11. 105 While ou r eviden ce for p riesthoo ds is very scant, we know that this alteration was made to the selectio n pro cess fo r the pri estess of Ath ene Ni ke: IG I:3:35=M/L 44 ), 110 See chapte r one, pp. 34-3 5 For the im portan ce of ci vic sha ring to Gree k reli gion see C.

Howev er, her attendant involv ement with uncertainty and pol lution (in childbirth, death, at crossroads, through restless dead spirit s) constituted unwelcome, but unavoidable facts of polis life. Ideas about Hekate in the classical period seem to correspond quite closely with mythologic al and ideologic al approaches to women, such as H esiod's story of Pandora. Both Hekate and mortal Greek women were str ongly associated with transitions and transformations. It will be demonstr ated in subseque nt chapters that such liminal states tended to attrac t negative valence in many cultures, including that of classical Greece, and that this contributed to the association of women with magic - an art that wor ks to manipulate boundaries and possib ilities. 111 For the app arent di p rescription of cults su ch as that of Zeus Herkeio s, see Parker (199 6), 6; Sourvino u-Inwood (2000b). 62 Chapter Three Cooking and Midwifer y: dangerous knowledges and technologies In approaching bodies of knowledge ident ified in the literary sources as magical1 - particularly such technai as root-cutting, pre- and non- Hippocratic medicine,2 and cooking and the production of pharm aka in its broadest sense - associations with exclusiv e or divinely introduced technologies assert themselves. Such cons anguinity between magic and science or technology does not invalid ate the much debated issue of the relationship between magic and religion,3 although it clearly conflicts with the linear model of development from magic to religion to science advocated by Frazer4 and his followers. In the following chapter I shall ex amine some of the technologies employed by women in their day to day life, and those ascribed to women in the literary tradition as they relate to divinity and magic.

The use of evidence from Greek communities so distant, temporally, from those of classical Greece obviously requires some justifi cation. There has been demons trable continuity with the past in the technologically isolated and c onservative cultures of rural Greek communities. This is especially so with regard to the patriarchal structures of authorit y, and the strongly gender ed nature of social and occupational roles. Consistency in the relations between the sexes persists diachronically despite obv ious religious, economic and legal differences between the anci ent and modern societies. The ancient Greek word for cook ery, and especially baking, is O \u0081H NLP\u0088PRO\u0099 . In the classical literature this term and its cognates, including \u0081H\u0099NLP\u0088\u0086\u0005 - a cook - are i nvariably present in their masculine forms. The public butcher or meat cook was always male, particularly on account of t he sacrificial nature of his role.5 Specialist bakers, butchers and chefs ar e also referred to in classical sources, the majority of which are Platonic, in the masculine. From taxation records and other formal lis ts preserved on papyri, though, it would appear that women too were well-represented in these trades.6 More to the point, though, is that the bulk of an oikos ' culinary classical relig ion.

Xenophon's Oikonomikos , and archaeologic al evidence both make clear that considerable spac e in the physical edifice of the oikos was allocated to the storage of grai n and other foodstuffs, to be prepared or baked as required.7 More to the point is that cooking was strongly associated with women, by virtue of culinary symbolisms surrounding the female body. The female sex is va riously represented as a bread-oven, a blackened hearth or a cooking hole, just as a woman's belly is likened to a kettle.8 Terms with the stem \u0081HNLP\u0088\u0010 relating to cookery - bear obvious resemblan ces with \u0086 0H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 and O \u0081HNLP\u0099H , although this semantic link may be mo re apparent than real. That the ideas of cooking and MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH were connected in the Greek mind is suggested, though, by a discu ssion about definitions in Plat o's Republic . In seeking the essence of the way that justice is to be implement ed, Plato's speaker Simoni des int roduces the paralle l example of medicine. Medicine is rightfully implement ed, it is suggested, by: \"...the art that renders to bodies drugs ( MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH\u0099 foods (\u008cP\u008dP\u0099H), 7 Xen., Oik. 7-10; on hou sehold layout see Sara h B.

It has already been established that the term MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH is used ambiguously by Greek writers to indicate herbal or other substances, whic h may be variously beneficial or harmful.10 Attempts by modern scholar s to definitively categorise individual appearances of the word into 'magical' or 'medicinal' contexts risk introducing modern distinct ions into ancient debates.11 For as John Scarborough has demonstrated, such multi combination of approaches to phenomena - which may be described as variously religious, magical and rational - is a feature of Greek tho ught observable from Homeric epic to the third century research effo rts of Theophrastos and Herophilos.12 What is clear from t he statement above is t hat Plato associates comestible s with MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH by virtue of their shared capacity to affect the human body . Given that they are grouped together under the rubric of O \u0081HN LP\u0088PRO\u0099 , the possibility of further resemblances ought to be considered. 9 Plato, Rep. 332c, tra nsl.

When we attempt a mo re detailed s tudy of kitchen-based tasks within the oikos , we draw an unfortunate but unsurprising blank wit h most of the literary sources, which exhi bit little interest in the subject.13 It is in such instances that modern Greek ru ral communities may provide clues as to ancient ideas about the nature of kitchen processes and its products. In her study of the roles of cooki ng and kitchens in modern, rural Greece, Jill Dubisch observes that married women's day to day duties centre upon transforming raw products of nature into edible or otherwise usab le cultural products.14 She cites in particular the women's careful and time- consuming 'preparation' of all raw produce - even fruit - in order to render it culturally palatable.15 The women of the house are also responsible for keeping anything whic h is unclean out of family living areas, cleaning what has become soiled, and keeping t he vessels used for food, laundry and personal cleaning separate.16 A less tangible corollar y of this task of 13 Myths, with whi ch we will soon deal, are an exce ption to this rule. 14 Jill Dubi sch, 'Culture ente rs throu gh the kitchen: wom en, food, and social bo undaries in rural Greece' in Jill Dubisch (ed.), Gender an d Power in Ru ral G reece (Prin ceton, 1986 cross-cultu ral import of co oked and u ncooked substances see Claude Levi-Strauss, The Raw and the Cooked: intro ductio n esp. pp. 33 5-9. 16 Dubi sch note s that the porch - a tra nsitional area bet ween the out doors an d the interio r kitche n - is the u sual site for cle aning veg etables a nd washing lau ndry among the village wo men of the Cycladi c Islan ds.

Against the argument that women are viewed as potential polluters and a weak point in the maintenance of the household's reputation,18 Dubisch suggests instead that wo men are the control lers of pollu tion and boundaries . Village women work to reinforce and main tain established boundaries , and mediate such boundaries in effecting transformations necessary to the society. This challenges somewhat the prominen t structural anthropological view th at women, cross- culturally, are considered to be more 'natural' than men.19 The idea of woman:nature and man:culture as opposing categor ies is blurred by women's guardians hip, in modern villages, over the transition bet ween the opposing states of nature and culture. The structuralist equations of wo man:nature and man: culture have been mapped onto ancient Greek symbolic syst ems and notions of the order of the universe, adapting theoretical insights from the work of Levi- 17 Ibid., 200, 208-10. 18 Wome n as pollut ers: She rry B.

Women, characteristically excluded from offici al power structures, are conceived to be 'other' to culture, and more often below culture by virtue of their close association with the 'animal' proc esse s of reproduction. The sub-cultural status of women, relative to men w ho constitute the cultural norm, also places them in a position to medi ate between nature and culture for men, asserts Helene P. Foley, foreshado wing the findings of Dubisch above.21 In their mediation of boundaries, women are exposed to the possibility of pollution.22 In their otherness, women ar e also apt to be associated with the transcendental and myster ious powers of divinity.23 As Foley points out in her analysis of the uses of structural methodologies in the classics, the categories of divinity, culture and nature are all culturally defined assumptions, and highly unstable even within their cultural contexts.24 Thus it is that heroic males may take on the characteristics of beasts, and Hesiod's first woman Pandora is an artifice 19 See espe cially Ortner, (1 974), .

Faced with the problems inherent in this methodology, then, we must be alert to the idiosy ncratic uses of this dichotomy in each source-text. Let us build upon the basic premise t hat cooking is a transformative technology, by which cultural objects are wrought from natural 'raw' products.26 The origin of fire, by which such transformations became possible, is divine in Greek myth ology, and particularly connected with the god Hephaistos. This technology reaches humanity vi a theft from the gods by Prometheus. The figure of Prometheus is presented in Aischylos' Prom etheus bound as a culture hero, who is also credited with introducing skills and sciences to humanity.27 Hesiod and Aischylos alike recognise Prometheus as epitomi sing cunning intelligence, or metis.28 The myth of Prometheus and hi s punishmen t illustrates the dangers inherent in such cunning ingenuit y. For despite (and because of) its capacity to permit the defeat of more powerful adversaries, the deployment of metis may invite divine retri bution upon those who would overturn the proper order. 25 Foley dra ws attention to these a nd othe r dev iations ). 27 Prom . 442-52 cf. J. G. Frazer, 'The o rigin of fire' in Apollo dorus, Loe b edn. vol. 2, appen dix 3; M. L. W est, Theo gony (1966); J .-P. Vernant, Myth and Societ y in Ancient G reece (1980), 168-85. 70 The myth of Prometheus' gift of di vine fire, and his punishment by Zeus, indicates a certain ambivalence towa rds the use of this divine - and hence 'unn atural' - yet civilis ing te chnol ogy. When we consider arts and practices which share a reliance upon fire technology - namely metalworking and cooking - comparable not es of ambivalence present themselves. Let us first consider metalworking. Homeric epic makes clear that metalworking, like fire itself, bel onged to the realm of Hephaistos.29 The god himself had been rendered lame, and e lite writers of the classical period argued that human metalworker s were prone to being similarly marred by the nature and worki ng conditions of their trade.30 Given the social stigma adhering to physical deformity in ancient Greece,31 such themes point to a certain uneas iness about metalworking. There was a sense that exploiting metal technol ogies challenged the gods, and invited divine retribution. Such warines s existed in tandem with the obvious pride that the Greeks (and later Ro mans) felt for their cultural achievements in transforming raw ores into refined metal products.32 28 Indeed, He siod even give s the divine figure 's name the se nse 'Forethoug ht'. On metis see Soci cago and Lond on, 19 78). 29 Heph aisto s as the god of fire: Hom er, Od. 24.71, Il. 9.470, 21.33 0-80; and of me tal trade s: refe rred to as such through out the Iliad and Odyss ey. 30 Plato, Rep. 495d-e. In Homer, too, Hep haisto s is presented as comically grotesque: Il. 1. 600.

Myths that deal with the introduction and circulation of the secrets of metalworking are closely bound up with myths about magic. Doumas has credibly ar gued that the myth of Jason and the Argonauts is based on early journeys aimed at gaining new smelting and forging techniques.33 The Telchines, a race of smiths who dw elt at the periphery of the earth in myth, were believed to possess a spec tacular command of the secrets of metalworking.34 Like magic, metalworking was thought to belong to the fearful yet marvellous margins of the earth, i n close communion with divinity. Perhaps we should regard Odysseus' moly in similar terms to fire- management and metalworking, for her e, too, danger and benefit mingle in a single exceptional tool . This plant is, lik e the aforementioned cultural achievements, a gift from the divi ne realm in Homeric epic. Herme s plucks a moly plant for Odysseus' benefit, teac hing him how to use it as an antidote to the powerful magic of Kirke. Homer tells us that: 33 C. Douma s, 'What did the Gree ks seek i n Colchis?', Herm athena 150 (19 91), 31-41; cf. Peter Gre en's int roduction to Apolloni os Rhodi os, The Argo nautika (Berkeley, 1997), p. 21. 72 \"...it is a dangerous plant for mortal men to dig up. But the gods, after all, can do anything.\"35 While metalworking technology has t he capacity to draw extraordinary transformations and creations fr om mineral ores, Hermes' moly is able to forestall Odysseus' impending transformation into a pig by the mal evolent nymph. Or, stated differently, meta lworking enables humans to transform natural or raw substances into cultural products, just as moly can protect humans from being reduced to power lessness and animality by more powerful aggressors. Wondrous things that allo w such control over important metamorph oses are fitting for use by gods, b ut present risks for humans who would venture to appropriate them. With this background of the use of fire as a divine and inherently dangerous transformative, civi lising art in mind, we shall now return to cookery more specifically. In the abs ence of explicit ancient information about contemporary domestic cooking, data are drawn largely from the evidenc e of mythological accounts , and fr om sacrificial rit ual. If I appear to emphasise fire and sacrifice at the expens e of cookery itself, it should be remembered that the three were al most always ine xtricably linke d for the Greeks, as the Hesiodic acco unts of the myth of 5.55.2-3; Ri chard Go in Bengt Anka rloo a nd Stuart Clark (eds.), Witchcraft and Magi c in Euro pe: anci ent Gre ece and Rom e (London, 1999), 17 8-9. 73Jean-Pierr e Vernant has provided an important and mu lti-dimensional analys is of this myth, presented as it is with different temporal aspects and focal points in the Theogony and Works and Days .36 He has demonstrated ways in which the myth of Prometheus' deceitful sacrificial meal with the gods articulates the divisions between men37 and gods at the close of the Golden Age, with refer ence to the use of fire, agriculture, and the need for marri age (and by infer ence, sexual reproduction) for survival. Before Prometheus' fateful sacrificial act there was no such division bet ween the realms of men and gods.38 Nor did an opposition exist then between nature and civilisatio n, for naturally oc curring grains and fruits were available to men in a cultivated, palatable state.39 Prometheus' sacrifice is thus itself an act of transformati on, creating the oppositions between divinity and men, and men and nature. The various corollaries of Prometheus' action - social and religious institutions, marriage rituals, sacrificial procedures , and use of fire and agricult ure for the production of food - are in turn the det ermining features of 'culture', by the Greeks' own definit ions. Such practices are both evidence of humanity's rise above mere nature, and the products of the fall from the divine Golden Age. 35 Home r, Od. 10.305, tran sl. E. V. and D. C. H.

Plutarch, in his Quaestiones Rom anae , explains that flour is 'incomplete' in its uncooked state. Freshly killed raw flesh, wit h which he compares flour, is described further as 'hideous lik e an ulcer' in its physical aspect. Such incomplete and unpalatable substances have lost t heir capacity to live and reproduce themselves, but are yet to gain a new usefulness as edible foodstuffs. This intermediate stage in their transmu tation from living things to edible cultural objects is marked by a form of impurity, by which it is rendered more or less untouchable until the transformation is complete.40 Ambivalen ce regardin g the skill of cook ery is clearest in myths when it is flesh that is being prepared and tr ansformed, no doubt because this introduces the additional iss ue of boundaries between humans and animals. Such uneasiness is counterbalanc ed through the ritual of sacrifice, wherein the symbolic consent of the selected victim is sought,41 and animal death is incorporated into the spiritual wellbeing of the community. It is not my intention to enter into the complex nature and functions of sacrificial ritual here.42 What is import ant to the present discussion is that an intricate set of ritual practices was deemed 40 Plut., Quaest.

Such ordinances applied as much to large public sacrifices as it did to meats cons umed in conjunction wit h smaller, more private sacrificial offerings, and to meat purchased from the butcher (\u0081H\u0099NLP\u0088\u0086\u0005 ) in the market.43 Stories abo ut the killin g, cooking and consu mption of human flesh are among the most spectacular mytholog ical accounts of transgression of the customs pertaining to meat and kill ing. Such meals are most often served intrafamilia lly, givin g greatest emphasis to the ties of allegiance which are vulnerable if human custom s are desecrated . Perverse meals of human fl esh may be contrived fo r the purpose of revenge. Prokne served Tereus a meal made of hi s own child to avenge Philomela, whom the king had raped. A treus served Thyestes' children up to him in vengeanc e for seducing his wife and challenging his kingship. Harpagus was treated to a similar feast by the angered Persian king Astyages. Tantalos earned eternal torment fo r himself by serving his own son Pelops to the gods. Lykaon offered to Zeus a male child at Arkadia, and was turned into a wolf as punish ment by the angry god. Such transformations into animal form are a recurrent feature of the omophagia motif in myths. Prokne and Philomel a were turned into birds for their unacceptable mode of vengeance, as was Tereus, for eating the flesh of family. These transformations made co mplete the transgressions of the 43 Fish seem s to be a notabl e exceptio n to the rule that all meat eaten must first h ave been sacrificed, prob ably on acco unt of thei r undo mesticate d and relatively chth onian 76customs separating humanity from ani mality and nature, of which all three were guilty.44 Medeia's a ct of killin g king Pelias of Io lkos by means of her cauldro n may be viewed as an extension and v ariation of this theme of transgressive to rejuvenate the ageing monarch by a pr ocess that involves cutting him up and magic ally boiling him in her cauldron.45 The fact that Pausanias preserves this episode among his Ar kadian stories suggests that the story may be especially old. M edeia's power to perform such a rejuvenation was evidently a well-est ablished element of her myth, as Aischylos also depicts her rejuv enating elderly mortals, in his Trophoi .46 Havin g demonstrated her ability to enact the rejuvenation with an old ram, and gained the confidence of the ki ng's daughters, Medeia enjoins the Peliades to assist her i n the task. They do so, stabbing and slicing their father, but Medeia wit hholds a ll her magi cal skills. Pelias is kille d, cut up and boiled (although not consumed) by hi s own daughters. Conspiring as they are with Medeia to perform a beneficia l magical pr ocedure upon their father, the Peliades inst ead are duped by the sorceress, to perpetrate a crime no less grave than Prokne' s. In this instance, an act of pharmaka would have been infinit ely preferable to one of cookery. status: Julian , On the m other of the god s 17; Detienn e, 'Culina ry pra ctices' (198 9), 3, n. 8, 11. 44 Burke rt (1983), ch. 2; as o bserved by Judith Maitlan 77It has been noted above that the chem ical c hanges produced in foods with the application of heat were viewed in Greek culture in terms of a transformation from one distinct state - nature - to another - culture. By her rejuvenation of the ram Medeia enacts a parallel transmutation with her cooking pot/kettle ( \u0086 zL\u0099IO\u0005 ). Just as co oking traverses the hazardous boundary between nature and culture, or the raw and the cooked, rejuvenation effects an i mpossibl e progression from old to new. Cooking ordinarily controls the na tural processes of decay, and its product - fermentation. Medeia's deed may be viewed, technically, as a complete reversal of the cooking process.47 A relations hip between cooking and magi c is made quite explic it in this episode from legend. For here Medeia performs first an act of magic, and then an act of cookery masquerading as a second act of magic. The efficacy of her plot to kill Pe lias relie s upon the fact that the techniques of Medeia's c ooking out wardly resemble those of her magic. Of course cooking only resembles potion-brewing if it is boiled, us ing a cauldron. This means that the public cook ery functions fulfilled by the (male) mageiros are clearly identifiable as non-magical.48 Private (feminised) cookery on the other hand, which often involv ed boiling, did not enjoy this distinction and so was open to susp icions and accusations. 46 Aisch., ancie nt Gree ce' in Josine Blo k and Peter Ma son (ed s.), Sexual Asy mmetry (Am sterda m, 1987), 20 0. 47 Breadma king is relia nt up on ferme ntation, while roa sting an boili ublished le cture. 48 See p. 81 an d n. 58 belo w. 78Medeia's masquerade of cooking as pot ion finds numerous parallels in the literary sources and l egal texts of the classi cal period, albeit with particulars reversed. In a case prosecuted by Antiphon,49 for instanc e, the client's stepmother stands accu sed of poisoning her husband. The woman's defence is that she had int ended the substance to function as an aphrodisiac rather than a poison. That a single subs tance was understood to have aphrodisiac qualit ies at one dosage but harmful or lethal cons equences at a larger dos age is discussed below in a later section.50 However in cases of poisoning and subjection to magic philtra alike, the pharmakis administers the substance disguis ed as or concealed within ordinary food or drink. In a parallel cas e reported in the Magna Moralia51 one may imagine the woman in question administering a pharmakon in the form of a beverage - presenting a magical act as a common domestic act. Plutarch, t oo, makes numerous references to situations where it is feared t hat women hav e added aphrodisiacs and other herbs to the cooking pot in an effort to manipulate their unsuspecting diners.52 It was clearly feared that in the confines of the kitchen women would take the small step that separated cookery - itself a mysterious and ambiv alent art - and magic, in pursuit of their own ambitions. 49 Antiphon, Against the Step mother, 1.9.2. 50 See my chap and the demise of Hera cles: eroti c magi c in So phocles' Trachiniae Helios 21, 2 (1994 a), 124 -5; P s.-Arist. 1188 b30-38). 79It is clear b oth from the classical literature, a nd from the spell tex ts preserved in the magical papyri collections, that pharmaka were understood to take a number of equal ly effective forms. A magical concoction could work by being worn as an amulet, applied externally as an ointment, or by being eaten or (more commonly) consumed as a liquid.53 A fourth century lead amulet, of fering protection against magic, declares that would-be attackers \"...shall not harm me with ointment or with applic ation o r with drink\"54 and other instances attest to the multiplic ity of ways in which a pharmakon may act.55 In their consumable forms, pharmaka were referred variously, as I\u0088\u008a\u0099\u008cP\u0081H , \u0087\u0086\u0099\u008dP\u0081H , \u0087\u0086\u008dH\u0099 and \u0087P\u008c\u008dH\u0099 - terms which elsewhere de scribe mundane solid and liquid foods. Thus it is only the context and the use of modifying adjectives, which distinguish ordinar y foods from consumable pharmaka in cases where the above terms are used.56 The perversion of food production, or the masking of harmful substances as nourishing foods arguably mirrors an aspect of the myth we examined 52 Plut., de tue nd. m agic s', in The Co nstraints of De sire: the anthro pology of ge nder a ncient Gree ce (New York an d Lond on, 199 0), p. 81. 53 Farao ne(199 4a), n. 14. 54 Tran Hesperia 13 m (1 992), 19 1-4.

In his unfair division of the meat at the first sacrifice shared by men and gods Prometheus uses his metis to pervert his duty as mageiros , giving only bare bones to the gods, dressed up to appear succulent under a thick layer of fa t. Prometheus' cunning deceit, and his subversion of sacrificial ritual , angered Zeus and resulte d in the introduction of toil and mortality for the race of men. H umans who pervert the transformative rites of cooking are guilty of a similarly grave offence. In myth, this is particu larly indicat ed by crimes of omophagia and the harsh punishments they elicit from the gods. As in politic al life, women were largely e xcluded from adult roles in community sacrificial rituals.57 The mageiros who led the physical act of the public s acrifice was male, without any known exceptions.58 In the lived reality of classical societ y, on the other hand, women were undoubtedly the real possessors of kno wledge of, and responsibility for, cooking tec hnology on behalf of their kyrios ' oikos . This fact is well illustrated by the symbolic bringing of torches from the bride's natal home to her ma rital oikos in the evening procession transmitting her from old hearth to new. In this wedding rite , the taking of a wife is insepara ble from the introduction of fire to t he hearth for culinary and sacrificial purposes.59 The transfiguring technology of cookery was, I have 56 As at Aes ch., Prom. 479f; Eur., Hipp. 516; Aris t., Pl. 717; Theo k. 11 .2. 57 Exceptions t o this rule a re discus sed in Detien ne, 'Violen ce' (198 9), 131-3 sion of the torch es by the brid e's moth er he lped en sure the legitima cy of the marri age: Eur., IA 732-4; Schol.

This is particularly evident in light of the fact that the Greeks observed no clear cut distinction bet ween dr ugs and diet in their medical prescriptions. The Hippokratic doctors' approach to treatment, for instance, would now be termed 'holisti c', with advice pertaining to diet, exercis e, rest, clothing, living environment and sexual activity.60 Even in prescriptions for what a modern obs erver would cons ider drug therapy, mundane ingredients such as barley groat s, olive oil, honey and wine are prominent. This further highlig hts the inter-connections of cookery and pharmaka - magical and medical - I have suggested in the previous section. As indicated in my discussion of t he relationship between medicine and magic,61 traditional and temple medicine coexisted with the more or less rationalistic (and literate) Hippocr atic m edicine. My focus in this section will be the older, largely undocum ented lore of traditional, especially 60 E.g. On regim en chs. 57 -66; Jerry Stannard, of of e 35, 6 (1961 ), 512, 516. 61 Chapte r one pp. 11-1 4 82herbal remedies. I hope to demonstrate that these areas of therapy were strongly associated with women, and c ontrib uted to ideas of women as wielders of exc lusive, danger ous, magical power. Folklore of any kind is, by nature, lar gely unwritten. This is because, in part, such knowledge had a strong traditi on of oral transmission before literacy took hold in the society, or because the information resided with the non-literate elements of a literate society. Goody suggests (with some reservations) in The dom estication of the savage mind , that literacy is the primary catalyst for the developm ent o f rational scientific inquiry out of folkloric origins.62 Considering the uneven distribution and standards of literacy in fifth- and fourth-century Greece,63 this thesis would sug gest a transitionary stage in the dichotom y between a folkloric and a rati onal basis to Greek thought at this time. Theophrastos and especially the Hippokratic writers are conscious of a degree of separati on between their own work and the idea s of the uneducated o r illiterate keepers of 'superstitious' medical knowledge. H ence our sources are primarily those of self-conscious 'outsiders' to the co mmunity of lay prac titioners of folk- medicine. Dichotomis ing tendencies, though, by ancient and modern scholars alike, need to be approached with caution. G. E. R. Lloyd has suggested that the growth of literacy also raised obstacles to progressiv e scientific 62 J. Goody, The Dom estication of the Savage Mind (Cambridge, 197 7), pp. 36-51. 83inquiry, particularly by contributin g to the barriers against communi cation between bodies of knowledge and sc hools of thought. Thus the spread of literacy would have enc ouraged exclusiv ity of fi elds of knowledge, rather than a democratic s haring of scientific ideas.64 Lloyd's stance is supported by Rosalind Thomas' more recent study of the relationship between or al tradition and written reco rds in Athens (and elsewhere). Focussing upon the historie s of prominent Athenia n families, Thomas finds that the oral traditions remai ned strong and important in the fourth century, and unaffected by the lit erary tradition that had developed alongs ide it .65 While there is clearly an awareness of separate, indeed opposing systems of medical pr actice, t he extent to which these actually conflicted with each other in terms of philosophy or practice is open to debate.66 The earlies t surviving systematic appr aisal of classical knowledge of and beliefs about plants is contained in Theophrastos' History of Plants (HP), written c. 300. Book nine of this work constitutes a dedicated study of plants deemed pharmacologically acti ve, and provides numerous insights into the practices of the rhizotomoi , or root-cutters, of the Greek world.67 63 For a re cent asse ssment of the degre es and kinds of literacy at Athen s see Ro salind Thoma s, Oral Tradition a nd Written Reco rd in Cla ssical Athens (Cambridge, 198 9), esp. p. 16. 64 G.

He did so with reference to scholarly, common and arcane authorities on plants, cutting across the rational scienc e-folklore dichotomy described above. Theophras tos employs a combination of Aristotelian reasoning and 'common s ense' to reconcile herbalists' assertions with the avowed rationalis m of his elite, medically expert contemporaries.68 He is critical, for inst ance, of the claims of the rhizotom oi that one risks blindn ess or prolapse of the anus if seen by a woodpecker whilst harvesting peony, but cautiously acc epts that one should first anoint oneself and then st and upwind when plucking the plant thapsia .69 Again, he finds it reasonable to pray whilst cutting medicinal plants, but absurd to believ e that one must offer unburnt sacrifices to Asklepios when cutting all-heal.70 The distinct ions observ ed by Theophrast os between what is scientif ically possible or impossible, and between what is proper and pious or absurd and superstitious appear hazy or even contradictory to the m odern reader. Such ambiguities serve to remind us that the boundaries bet ween magic, religion and rational science were as flexible as they were debated, and could thus be manipulated accordin g to the will of a powerful speaker or group. authenti city: Scarboroug h in Fara one a ' CP 71 (1 976), 67-76; cf.

Oral folk trad itions are clearly deemed to be worthy of recording to Hesiod and Theophr astos, as they were to Pliny centuries later, although they are invariably identifi ed as such, and may be subject to suspicion on that account. In Works and Days Hesiod makes note of the best days of the month for various agricultural activities, before adding that different people's tradi tions invariably contradi ct each other, and that each claim s to possess superior, exc lusive knowledge.71 Book nin e of the History of Plants includes many accounts which Theophrastos rejects as products of exaggerat ion by self-interested rhizotomoi , who wished to enhance their own reputation, or that of their craft.72 Similarly, Pliny attacks his own non-literary sources, the herbarii , for dishonesty, and for withholding full accounts of plants not well-known by outsiders to the craft.73 G. E. R. Ll oyd has demonstrated that ancient writers' sense of the division bet ween Hippokratic and folk medicine could p ersist even though there was considerable borrowing on the part of the newer, rational medical tradition.74 Cyclamen ( O R\u008bRzH\u0099\u0081P\u0084\u0086\u0005 ), for instance, is recommended by the authors of On the Diseases of Wom en (Mul.)

Peony requires special ritual attention.79 When cutting mandrake one should first draw three circles around the plant with a sword, and then dance around speaking at length about love.80 Once again the Hippokratic writers omi t the deta ils they consider ritualistic and superstitious. That herbal folklore retained its id entity and status as a relatively exclusive medical tradition beyond the classical period, and discrete from the appropriations of rational medicine,81 is suggested by the appearance 75 Hipp., Mul.

Tyrrhenia, Latium, Ethiopia, Skythia and Thrace are cited as sources of abundant herbal pharmaka .84 Theophrast os cites Egypt as the source of nepenthes , the calming drug famously used by Helen in the Odyssey .85 If Majno is correct to identify Helen's drug as opium, though, exotic or igins seem historically unlikely, as opium poppies were plentiful in the Greek world.86 Beliefs, correct or other wise, about the exotic origins of much herbal lore helped to construct a sense of histor y and prestige for empirical, herbal medicine and its practitioners.87 Aside from Theophrastos ' notes on the procedures and observances of the semi-professionals who harvest and/or sell medicinal plants, we possess several intriguing fragments 82 On the conti nuou s tran smission of herb al lore throug h d d Byzant ine en cyclopae dists see Scarboroug h (199 1), 152-4. 83 On the com bination an d confusi on of Syri an, Gre ek and Roman p lant lists over time see John Scarborough, 'Th eoph rastus o n herb als and herbal reme dies', Journal of the Histo ry of Bio logy 11 (1978), 357.

The subject of the play seems to be Medeia's d eception of the Peliad es, and the killing of Pelias with feigne d magic. In one fragment Medeia is depi cted in terms that strongly evoke the turning her eye from her hand she collects the milky juice dripping from the cut in bronze vessels. Covered chests conceal the root cuttings which she, cr ying out and screaming in cantations, gathers naked with bronze sickles. Medeia's demeanour is comparable with that of a maenad, which immediately connects her ritual behaviour with dangerous, chaotic, and specifically fe minine behaviour.89 She uses bronze ritual instruments to 88 Soph., Rhiz. Fr. 534, TGrF a nd traged (Oxfo rd, 1994), pp. 258-61 on m aena dism 's role as a ' safety valve' for wom en in Gree k society, which re-affi rmed thei r roles in soci ety by means of 89cut the plant and collect the sap, and as in Theophrastos' account of the technique employed in the harvesting of thapsia, her head is averted from the task. S ophokles' association of rhizotomoi with Medeia the plotting murderess points to a rather marginal status for hist orical root-cutters in the classic al period.90 A note about Epimenides , the semi-legendary purifier of Athens, suggests a spatial el ement to the marg inality of root- cutting. A tradition preserved in Diogen es Laertius tells that Epimenides eventually sought complete solit ude, and practised root-cutting.91 The historical, or quasi-historical notes of Theophrastos and Diogenes Laertius remind us that rhizotomia was far from an exclusively feminine pursuit in the classical period. Ep imenides' status as an elevated, purificatory figure perhaps renders him exceptional. However, numerous rhizotom oi are named by Theophr astos, Pliny , Galen and Athenaeus, and almost all of these historical figur es bear masculine names too.92 The picture we get from the poeti c works concerning the gender slant of rhizotom ia conflicts with the ostensibly factual evidenc e of scientific writers. Women, and especially older wom en, are presented as the temporary re versal s.

We have already not ed Medeia and the Peliades.93 Alex is' Mandragorizomene , a work of the New Comedy genre, evi dently c oncerns the harvesting and use of mandrake, almost certainly by an elderly woman. Later works by Theokritos and other poets confirm the lasting popularit y of the theme of old women' s expertise with botanical pharmaka.94 The conflicting dat a from poetic and historical sources are consistent with a point made previously, regarding the profile of magic users according to poetic and documentary sources. Most of the surviving katades moi and magical papyri from the PGM collections were used or intended for use by men.95 It is women, though, w ho are presented in poetic works as the primary users of spells. One is drawn to c onsider whether women's use of root- cutting was indeed les s prevalent t han men's, or whether women's involv ement was simply of a less visible, public and professional character.96 The male rhizotom oi named by Theophrastos are apparently professionals of public renown. T he many 'wise old women' to whom female figures in literature can tu rn, on the other hand, are generally unnamed, low-profile figures. Are we then to imagine, as Aline Rousselle 93 This may also con stitute e vidence for a n ancient perceptio n of the passing of h erbal knowledge from one ge neration of wo men to t he next. This notion of the transmi ssion of herbal knowledge i s posited by Rou sselle and Dema nd (on which see b elow, p. 93, n. 102). 94 Alexis 3-4. 96 Wome n's lim ited acce ss to money and li teracy i s cited as a po ssible reason for th e gend er bia s towa rds male s in the cu rse inscri ption s and sp ell texts.

The question of the existenc e of a di screte, unwritten corpus of women's herbal knowledge continues to di vide modern scholars of ancient medicine, magic and poisoning. Argument s in favour of such a tradition are necessarily based, to some exten t, upon the near si lence of the elite medical so urces regarding women's illn esses. The Hippokratic Epide mics contain twice as many case histories for men as for women.98 This gap in the medical data is used to suggest that women were more likely to seek out the expertise of a sympathetic and knowledgeable woman,99 or else temple medicine.100 Such arguments assume that wise-women were general ly less literate than their male peers in the medical industry, henc e the lack of medical literature pertaining both to women's complain ts, and to traditional medicine. Positive evidence for women's pr eference for non-Hippokratic medicine is admittedly not abundant. The Hippok ratic treatises on diseases of women are notable exceptions from this pattern, containing as they do a plethora of treatments for, and 97 Rou sselle (1 988), pp. 24 -6. 98 Lesley Dean -Jones, en's Bo dies in Cla ssical G reek Scie nce (Oxford, 19 94), p. 34. 99 Sue Blundell , Wom en in Ancie nt Gree 995), p.

Both Aristotle and the Hipp okratic author of On the nature of the child (Nat. Puer. ) assert that an experienced woman is able to discern whether and precisely when she has conceived by monitoring whether the man's seed stays within her, 84, n. 21.

Indeed, contraceptives (in t he modern sens e of the word107) are almost entirely lac king from the Hippokratic corpus and other classical works.108 Thus it is on Roman evidence that scholars such as Sue Blundell and John Riddle base their suppositions of an orally transmitted Greek contraceptive technology.109 Abortifacients, on the other hand, hav e some presence in the classical Greek sources, and it is to such cases that we shall turn instead.

A slave-entertainer, for instance, is openly adv ised by a Hippokratic physician on how to abort a seven-day-old concept us.110 Plato states that mi dwives c an bring on a miscarriage \"if that is what seems best\".111 While the exact meaning of such a judgement is unclear, it woul d appear that the social status and health of the female patient are relev ant factors in determining if abortion is appropriate. Abortion seems to have been forbidden in classical Athens where the woman's husband had died.112 This was in the interests of producing a male heir, underscoring the fact that the ri ghts of the kyrios outweighed those of his expectant wife.113 It seems equally unlik ely that most married women would or could freely obtain abortions from Hippokratic physicians while their husbands s till lived, espec ially giv en the importance of producing heirs, and the difficulty with which ancient Mediterranean families raised their offspring to maturity.114 Depending how we int erpret the refe rences to 'experienced women' earlier in this discussio n,115 it appears that wives were believed to 109 Sue Blundell , Wom en in Ancie nt Gree ce p. 108; Riddl e in Bru ce W.

The author of Fleshes admits that his experienced female sources are in fa ct prostitutes and midwives, which is plaus ible.116 The Hipp okratic writer of On the nature of the child , on the other hand, makes the more dubious and hazy claim of having gleaned his information from 'w omen as a group'. Knowing how to produce an abortion would certainly be valuable to 'ordinary' women who wer e involv ed in pre- or extra-marital se x. It does not follow that all women would know such things as a matter of course. Once again, prostitutes and midwiv es were lik ely to be the keeper s of most of this information, as Plato suggests.117 Helen King asks the reader to consi der whet her the authors' claims of seeking women's opinions might in stead be pure invent ion, aimed at outdoing m edical rivals and persuading potential customers of their expertise.118 This is a valid theory, when one c onsiders that Hippokratic physician-writers were at time s arguably more concerned with the competitive aspects of their trade than with scientific inqu iry.119 If this was the case, the writers' unsubstant iated claims that w omen have their own private ways of knowing whet her they are pregnant, and can also control the outcome of their pregnancy, belong to the same pattern of dangerous feminine knowledge I have previo usly identified in the contexts 116 Carn. 19; cf.

In such ca ses, women are believed to wield potentially dangerous power against the community by vi rtue of their control over special knowledge.120 King's critic isms aside, there is substantial ev idence to suggest that certain of the Hippokratic writers did indeed appropriate at least some 'folk-wisdom' in their treatises concer ning the diseases of women. In the gynaecological works121 in particular, we find medical recipes featuring animal excr ement.122 Excrement w as most frequently used sympathetically, to treat impurities or draw out trapped waste products from the (female) body.123 Lesley Dean-Jones has compiled numerous other recommendations for diagnostic and healing rituals in the gynaecological works, along with folk axioms which hav e little regard for the rationalising efforts of other Hippokratic texts.124 The author of Diseas es of Wom en, for instance, advises the use of a ritual spanning several day s and nights and using menstrual rags and cinders to 119 Hippo kratic write rs critici se and compet e with their m edical rivals i n several Hippokratic treatise s, the attacks preserved in OTSD 1-4 bei ng the best kno 2.114, L 8.246; Airs, Water s, Plac es 22 120 King (199 8), p. 156. 121 These being On the Natu re of the Child (Nat.

Sacr. ) openly attacks the use o f amulets a s 'superstition'.128 Infirmities that would be remedied with enemas, emetics, exercise and fumigations129 if the patient were male are invariably treated with emmenagogues in the case of female patients.130 It is in these emmenagogic recipes, which tend to take the form of pessaries and draughts, that we find the use of animal dung and other arcane ingredients, which are a featur e of the gynaecological works.131 These (=viii.42.9-16). diagn p involving of nsin Academ y Review 35 (1 989), 19-2 5, esp. 2 2. 127 The use of menstrual blo od in su ch recipes suggests a theory of sympathetic efficacy, wh ereas the Hippokratics belie ved that oppo sites cured o pposites (esp ecially regarding the humou rs and elements): Hipp., Nat.

The multiple authorship of the Hi ppokratic corpus means that some incons istencies in outlook are inevitable bet ween authors and treatises. Howev er, it is also reasonable to assu me that the testimonies of women - especially midwives and prostitutes134 - were sought by some writers, and that folk remedies entered the elit e medical literature in this way.135 Whether this constituted an exclus ively feminine folk medical tradition is less secure. Helen King has contes ted the claims of Dean-Jones and Hanson136 that the gynaecological works are unique in their range of materia m edica, noting that most substances named in these works also appear els ewhere in the Hippokratic corpus. This does not, in itself, diminis h the case for an orally tr ansmitted corpus of women's medical contextuali sation of folk-re medies throughout the corpus, with the ' women's recipes' simply bein g less ration alised and a dulte rated than m ost.

It highlight s that women's medic al tradition exists in close dialogue with the broader folk medical tr adition. It is logical that there would be considerable overlap of k nowledge between the two, and some scope for specialised ' women's knowl edge', particularly among health- and sex-workers. There is little to suggest, in the Hippokr atic accounts, that the information about birthing amulets and the like constituted well- guarded or exc lusive knowledge. Rati onal medicine inevitably drew upon folk medical traditions, as discuss ed previously, and some of this oral tradition will have been relevant to women alone, and so logically kept predominantly by women.137 Insofar as midwives did function as repositories of medical knowledge pertinent to women and birthing, their status in Greek society was quite signific ant. Plato tells us that midwives were experienc ed women who had given birth themselves but we re now beyond child-bearing age.138 As such, these older women effe ctively stood outside the primary functional identity of married citizen women as producers of legitimate heirs.139 They consequently enjoyed gr eater freedom of movement in 135 Hipp., Praec . 2 (=ix.254.4 -5) explicitly tentativel y support the trustworthin ess and value of wo men's own information a bout chil dbirth. 136 Dean -Jone s (1994), p. 30; Han son (199 8), p. 73. 137 See pp. 83ff above.

Brem mer, 'The ol d wome n of an cient G reece', in Blok and Maso n (1987), 191-215, e sp. 191. 100Greek societies (bot h ancient and modern140), which made it more appropriate for them to leave their homes when they were required to assist at a birth. Jan Bremmer has highlighted a number of motifs by which these older women wer e targetted for invect ive in Greek and Roman cultures.141 Besides engaging in such vices as drunkenness, obscene language, and corrupting younger women, old women wer e said to be responsible for perpetuating ignorant suspici ons and 'old wives' tales'.142 The flip side of this reputed foolishness is their ap titude for magic - a motif which Aristophanes and subsequent writers amply exploit.143 There is clearly some ambivalence, from the classica l perio d onwards, as to the quality and status of knowledge possess ed by old women. Bremmer notes that images of older wom en as drunkards , and as lacking in good sense, are not discernible in Hom er. This could simply be becaus e such themes were inappropriate to Homer's genre. It is also possible that these changes ar e genuine, and help to mark changing attitudes towards women in general in the classical per iod. That such changes could have 140 Hyperid es, fr. 205 Blass; see Bremm mode rn anthrop ological finding s.

See Bremme r (1987), 205 for Rom an an d later examp les. 101arisen, in part, from the emergence of a literate, public culture will be explored in a subsequent chapter.144 Midwives belonged to the marginalised demographic of older women, which adds complexity to their alr eady mixed reputation in the literary sources. P lato's Sokrates describes the midwife as having knowledge of pain-relieving drugs and incantations, and paints a positive picture of the role upon which he bases the metaphor of himself as 'midwife of ideas'.145 At the other end of t he spectrum, Aristophanes repeatedly implic ates midwives in the act of helping women pass off strange babies as legitimate offspring.146 While this is clearly Aristophanic excess, it nonetheles s points to an import ant tension in the role of the midwife. A woman wit h knowledge of pharmaka and ritual is in control of what is normally a n all-female occasion147 - an event that is, however, vital for the kyrios to attain eternal glory through his heirs . ********** Like cooker y, folk medi cine and more especially midwifery are bodies of knowledge which were viewed with some ambivalence in Greek society, and were subtly imbued with ideas about magic. Cooking, a wondrous transformative art, is endowed wit h a divine origin, having been brought 144 See Chapte r six below. 145 Pl., Theaet . 149 c-d, 157c-d. 146 Arist., Thes 147 The legen d of Agnodike al so poi nts to women' s preference for only female attendant s: Hyginus, Fab. 274. 102to humanity by Prometheus. The hea ling arts are similarly regarded as having divine associat ions, notwit hstanding the rational fa\u00e7ade of Hippokratic medicine. Asklepios, for example, eventually gained status as an immortal by virtue of his l egendary healing capac ity, as did other 'first discoverers' in the field of medicine.148 Rhizoto mia, located as it is along a continuum it shares with co mestible and medicinal substances, has similarly divine as sociations.149 Where women were the repositories of these mysterious transformative and creative bodies of knowledge, certai n tensions disc lose themselves. In domestic kitchens, in contrast with polis sacrifices, women were the primary controllers of the transformations of cookery on behalf of the oikos . It is in this contex t that women are suspected, in the literature, of perverting the mysteri ous and powerful transformation of cooking through the feminised vices of trickery an d secrecy. Magical philtrai are constructed as the product of such deceptions, and as a subversion of proper power hierarchies within the oikos . Analogies of cookery and magic are repeatedly presented in the literature by means of narrative and iconograpic assimilation. 148 On Askl epios see He ctor Avalos, Illness and Health Care in the Ancie nt Nea r East: the role of the temple in Greece, Meso potomia, and Isra el (Atlanta , Georgia, 19 95), p. 38; and see a lso Ped ro Lai n Entralgo, The The rapy of the Word in Classical Anti quity , transl.

The associ rhizotom ia with semi -legenda ry Epimenide s also helps to locate the a rt in the realm o f the divine. 103Within the field of folk medicine we have attempted to locate a distinct strand of w omen's medical lore, despite the source problems inherent in finding 'real' women in male-author ed texts. Ancient suggestions of a discrete corpus of women's medi cine, and especially 'old women's remedies' need to be viewed critically in any case. This is because, as John Scarborough, Helen King and ot hers point out, such statements may simply be reiterati ng gendered impressions of women as predisposed to 'cooking up' schemes of damage and deception.150 Also, ancient perceptions - as opposed to historical reality - of a clear dichotomy between rational medicine and folk- pharmak a can tell us something about the construction of sorc ery in Greek society. This is evident in the treatise On the sacred diseas e, which accuses its rivals of trickery and magical superstition. By modern standards, the Hippokratic text's avowedly superior rationale is no less fanciful, and similarly without validation by evidence.151 The efficacy of the accusation rests primarily upon its persuasive force, rather than any fixed canon of what is magical and fanciful and immoral, and what is scientific and reasonable and pious. 150 Scarb orough points to the role of female figures - parti cularly Hele n and Kirke - a s herbal specialists, with ele ments of sexual sorcery: (1991 ), 140, n . 37.

Whether these are to be cons idered 'folk traditions' or more specifica lly 'women's traditions ', the medicaments involv ed are still invariably cooked, which implicat es women regardless, by virtue of their kitchens. Ancient demands fo r feminine m odesty make an overwhelmingly female birthing tradition likely . The fact that births were an occasion normally barred to men is suppo rted by the literary evidence, and is cons istent with the structura list equation of femal es with polluting transformations and creative potential. Given the highly sexually segregated nature of mu ch of Greek society,152 distinct 'masculine' and 'feminine' k nowledges may be assu med, with masculine knowledge being the more literate and socially valori sed of the two. Feminine medic al knowledge, real or imagined, was thereby rendered less accessible, and thus more mysterious and unsettling.153 As with women's symbolic control of the transformative ar t of cookery, women's perceived knowledge of and control over their r eproductive potential was particularly threatening to t he notion of the kyrios as the ultimate holder of power in the context of the oikos . On a lar ger scale, wo men's c ontrol over these important creative proc esses was at odds with their 'necessary' subjugation in classical society, sinc e in almost all other matters women functioned as perpetual minors in a male dominated society. The disruptive potential of these female-dom inated areas of activity was thus 152 See espe cially David Coh en, 'Seclu sion, sepa ration, and statu s of wom en in classical Athe ns' in Ian M cAuslan a nd Peter Walcot (eds.), Wom en in Antiquity (Oxford, 1996 ), 134 -45. 153 The role of the Athenian demo cratic et hos in shaping interp inacce ssible or exclu knowl edge s will d in chapte r six below, pp. 198ff. 105an unknown, feared quantity. This thr eat is reflected in the literary and mythologic al evidence by the assim ilation of images of midwives with those of ignorant and superstitious, yet cunning and intricately skilled users of magic. 106Chapter Four Medeia: barbarian sorceress and divinity Euripides' Medeia is a complex and compelling work, which has engaged critics since it was first performed in 431 B.C.E. Its plac e in the current discussion of magic is itself a matter of contention, as modern critics are divided as to whether or not Medeia is presented as a sorceress in classical terms in this most enduring Eu ripidean play. Thus it is that I shall begin with a review of the recent treatments of the subject. Recent developments in ways of conceiving of ancient magic naturally play a critical role in the course of such debates. Like the Trachiniai , which will be discuss ed in the next chapter, this pl ay lends itself to feminist and structuralist modes of analys is. Im possible as it is to di stil the Medeia down to a single essence or theme, we may say at least that its acti on centres upon an explosion of tensions within the marri age of Medeia and Jason in one strand of t heir myth. It explores and is constrained by the dichotomising tendenc ies of the Gr eeks' dominant worldv iew regarding the sexes and ways of relating to others. Denys Page, in his important and defin itive 1938 edition of the play, can comfortably identify Medeia as \"a barbarian sorceress\"1 and \"a witch\"2 and rationalise the course and outcome of the tragedy with reference to these concepts. Towards his interp retation of a magically expert Medeia and entary nys L. Page (Oxford, 1938 ), p. xiv. 106Page cites the heroine 's foreign orig ins, her familia l des cent from \"the most notori ous of all witches, Circe and Hekate\", her ready access to strange poisons and the winged char iot, and indeed the whole story of the Golden Fleece.3 The explic it linking of Medeia with Hekate, it should be pointed out, may not have occurred before Dionys ios Skytobrachion in the third century.4 Contemporaries and nea r-contemporaries of Page such as Grube, Elliot, Lucas and Conacher have tende d to follow his reading, us ually in no more than passing remarks.5 More recent w orks on the meaning of the play and the charac ter of Medeia, and on the nature of ancient magic itself have permitted rather more subtle analyses of Euripides' heroine. Led by B. M. W. Knox's 1977 public ation,6 such assessments have tended to question the assumptions and interpretations of Page listed above.7 2 Ibid., p. xxi. 3 Dionysi Skytobra chion, writing a round the time of Apollonio s Rhodios in the third ce ntury, who first made Me deia the dau ghter of Hekate an d siste r of Kirke: Frit Graf, 'Medea, the en chantress from afar', in Jame s J.

For as Knox hims elf observes, the audience is made aware by the nurse's introductory words10 that Medeia is a \"brooding menace\", as she laments loudly within the house.11 Having emerged from the house and persuaded Kreon to allow her to stay in Korinth for one more day, Medeia declares to the women of the chorus t hat she is plotting to destroy her enemies. At 384-5 she resolves to do so by means of pharmaka, the art in whic h she professes wise' (OC\u0012 P \u0081H\u0099zP\u008c\u008dH ). Since of Hekate occurs just twelve lines after this,12 it would seem reasonable to infer that she is being c alled upon in one of her more dangerous guises,13 despite Knox's arguments to the contrary.14 8 See Page (1 938) o n lines 364, 397; al so Grub e (1941), p. 154. 9 Knox (1977 ), 204. 10 The nurse la ments that M edeia a nd Ja son ev er met: 1-11; the nu rse fears that Medeia will hatch a d eadly schem e again st her own children, herself or the royal family of Korinth: 36-4 5. 11 Knox (1977 ), 196. 12 Eur., Med. 395-8, e sp. 39 7. 13 Hekate's spheres of influe nce in cluded, by the classi cal pe riod, d reams, crossroad s and the chtho nic bei ngs bel ieved to con gregate the re, threshold s and magical sp ells: see my chapt er two ab ove, p. 3.

Medeia is never referred to by other characters in this play as \u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 , N\u0086O\u0099\u0005 or MH\u0088\u0081HRP\u0099\u0005 - a so rceress, and so we are left to consider whether she is otherwise portrayed in a manner that would suggest such an interpreta tion to the origina l audience. We have, for instance, repeated referenc es to Medeia's cleverness or wisdom (\u008c\u0086MP\u0099 H). This \u008c\u0086MP\u0099H is stressed with reference to her aptitude for pharm aka, plotting, and equally to her abi lity to comprehend oracles and other worldly conundrums. By the mid to late fifth century the term \u008c\u0086MP\u0099H had begun to develop new and ambivalent subtleties of meaning, particularly at Athens, as the sophistic schools of rhetoric and learning grew prominent. The sophi sts enjoyed notoriety for encouraging their pupils to be wise or clever ( \u008c\u0086M\u0086\u0099\u0005 ) enough to argue either side of an argument, rejecting the absolute moral value of either argument as subjective.17 This new ambivalenc e is perhaps detectable in the repeated 15 Med. 406, 74 6, 752, 954-5 , 1251-5 5, 1321-2. 16 Hes., Theog. 957 The amo rality or otherwise of the sophi sts' 'd ouble argument' style of rhetori cal training 13, as in the works of 109attribution of \u008c\u0086MP\u0099 H and synonymous terms to Medeia, by her friends and enemies alike.18 Jason admonishes Medeia, arguing that because of him all Greeks know that she is clever ( \u008c\u0086MO\u0099\u0084),19 and similarly credits her with a subtle \u0005 zL\u0087\u008d\u0086\u0099 \u0005).20 Kreon justifies to her thus: 'You are wise and adept in many evil skills... '21 The king's use of the words \u008c\u0086MO\u0099 and RHR\u008a \u0084 in combination is suggestive of magic,22 and Medeia' s own explicit assessment of where women's wisdom lies further reinforces such a reading. At the end of the speech to the chorus (364-409)23 in which she determines to inflict deadly pharmaka upon her enemies, Medeia iss ues the following statement, making (uncomfortable) faintly ironic use of traditional invective against women, invective she elsewhere challenges.24 'And als o we are women, who are in noble deeds most unskilled, Euripides and Thukydides: see Jacqueline de Romilly, The Great So phist s in Peri clean Athens , tran sl.

Euripides' Medeia is a creature w ho eludes r eady compartmentalisation within the scope of the play and its c haracters. Assessments of other earlier versions of the myths surr ounding Medeia are thus particularly valuable for elucidating the playwr ight's own aims and innovations, and for other clues to the meanings of the work. 25 Med. 407-9. 26 292-3 06. 27 677. 28 nea r easte rn influe nce o n Gree k culture in the early a rchaic a ge, transl.

There are separate mythic episodes about Medeia which centre upon Kolchi s, Iolkos, Korinth and Athens. Eumelos' e pic, the Korinthiaka , dates to the mi d-eighth century,30 and is recognisable as a precursor to Euripides' tragedy.31 In this tradition, though, the Korinthians summ on Medeia to their city as the rightful heir to the throne,32 which, as D. J. Conacher has pointed out, leaves little scope for the crime of passion envisioned by Euripides.33 The children died in as many as three different versions of this early form of the myth, although Medeia was apparent ly innocent of the act in each case. According to the scholiast to Pindar Ol. 13.74 Medeia concealed the children in the temple of Hera and sought to immortalise them with the goddes s' help.34 Hera destroyed the children instead, and Jason would not forgive Medeia for her role in the catastrophe. One alternative version has the Korinthians kill the children,35 and yet another records that Kreon's kin were responsible fo r these murders, but spread rumours 29 Hom., Od. 12.70. 30 or perhap s the seve nth c entury: Graf (1997 b), 34. 31 Page, p. xxii.

Medeia's familia l conn ection with the goddes s is established Hesiod's Theogony , although her position in this catalogue suggests that s he is considered to be an immortal heroine rather than a true goddes s.38 Euripides retains this descent from Helios for his Medeia.39 In his Pythian 4 of 462 \u0087H\u0081MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0005 just Kirke is \u0087\u0086z\u008bM H\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0005 in the Odyssey .40 Medeia was the subject of numerous tragedies in the fifth century. Euripides' Peliades (and probably also Sophokles' Rhizotom oi) dealt with murderous 'rejuvenation' of Pelias at Iolkos. Euripides and Sophokles each also an Aigeus , covering Medeia's attempted murder of Theseus at Athens, and Neophron wrot e a tragedy parallel to Euripides' Medeia , on the infanticide at Korinth. There is considerable debate concerning the relative dates of production for Neophron's and Euripides ' plays because of the striking similari ties in characterisation and dramatic 36 Kreophylo s, para phrased by Didy mus: Page (1 938), p. xxiv. 37 Page (19 38), p. xxvi. 38 M.

What is to be gleaned from this collection of fifth centur y fragmentary plays about Medeia is that they centre upon cunning ploys by her, repeatedly invo lving horrible murders of rivals or enemies, usua lly by feminine or magical means.42 ********* Although some prominent scholars lo cate her origins in folk-tales,43 most tend to follow the argument that Medeia was or iginally a deity, at l east in Korinth and Thessaly.44 If so , the d evelopment of her myth in early and classical lit erature may perhaps be viewed as documentation for her displacement by the newer order of Olympian divinities. We have already mentioned Medeia's early presence in Korinth, as collated and composed in Eumelos ' eighth century Korinthiaka .45 Also dating to the eighth 41 Both plays treat Medeia with a degre e of sympathy lacki ng from ot her tra gic and earlie r treatm ents; both ha ve Medeia foretelling Jason 's demi se from 'on high'; b oth observe the tradition of utilising o nly two ac tors pe r Page (19 38), p. xxxi.

Michelini, 115-35; Page, xxxi; D ss and John ston (1997 ), 127. 42 The slaying of her own ch ildren in Eu ripides' play is a n exceptio nal, 'masculine' action, as Med eia elsewhere proceeds by trickery and coo kery (the so-ca lled rejuve nation her pharmaka (the attemp ted poisonin g of These us, the incendia ry potion used on Kre on and the pri ncess). It is remarkabl e that it is in the two 'most sym pathetic' renderings of Medeia that s he re sorts to infanticid e. 43 D. J. Cona cher finds the e arly figure of Medeia to be that of a \"standard fol k tale witch\": Co nacher (196 7), p. 185. In light of rece nt advances a nd de bates in the study of Gree k ma gic, such statem ents are no longer self-expl anatory o r useful. 44 Sarah Iles Johnsto n, ea and the cult of Hera in Clau ss and Johnston (1997), 61; Ni lsson (1 906), 59; L.

And to this land of Sisypho s I shall issue a solemn festival and rites from this time forward to atone for this impi ous murder.'47 and other ancient authors similarly a ttest to the ongoing importance of such a cult.48 Johnston argues that featur es of the cult suggest that Medeia was a local deity, displac ed and replaced by Hera Akraia. In such situations it is common to find the pre-existing deity (who is frequently diminis hed to human or nea r-human status in the myth and cult) set at odds with the newer divi nity in their particular sphere of influenc e.49 46 On this sa nctuary and its relation ship wi th Korinthian Medeia see -83. as 3.6-8. 49 John ston in Clauss and John ston (1 997), 62. See also John ston (1999), pp. 2 18-48 for other exa mples of this pattern, eg. Heka te/Arte mis in Asia Iphigeneia/A Medeia seeks Hera's aid as a kourotrophic goddess - a deity of nurturing and motherhood.50 Hera's kourotrophic role wa s widely recognised in archaic Greece, as evi denced by votive offerings and other artworks,51 and votive offerings at the sanc tuary of Hera indicate that it, too, particu larly attracted w omen.52 In the Korinthian myths it is Medeia her self rather than her childr en who remains the most consi stent element, as she is forced out after a conflict concerning her children and Hera. This is in spite of the fact that the cult is one of adolescents' initiation and transitions.53 Thus it appears to be Medeia' s displacement that lies at the heart of t he Korinthian tale. This displacement came to be a significant element in later myth.54 Euripides' Medeia , rich as it is with newer discourses on magic and foreignnes s, retains some traces of th is divinity for its complex heroine. Her use of a chariot in the closing scene is, as Knox not es, iconographically more appropriate for a deity than a sorceress.55 A 50 As with other deities con cerned with the birth and raising of child ren, such a s Hekate and Artemi s, it was recogni sed that Hera coul d just as easily with hold prote ction o f her charges: se e my chapte r Hekate, p. 13 a nd Jo hnston (1999 ), p. 212 ; John ston Clauss and John ston (1997 ), 53.

This initiatrix role, argue s Graf, is well-suited to her di vine cha racter: Graf (1997b), 39-4 1. 54 See Gord on (1987), 59 -95, esp. 80; also belo w, pp. 122-23. 55 By aloft on the mechane , a spa ce usu ally hecying nd instituting a cult Medei a faithf ully mirrors the role of a deity in the play: Knox (197 7), 212; M.

Medeia is represented here in Greek dress, but is rendered unique by her wearing of a polos - a type of hat associated with divinities and women connected with divinities.57 Medeia's early (and to a lesser exten t, ongoing) identific ation with divinity is well established. Her identity as a sorceress in ancient terms is less so. Even Graf, who argues that Medeia has the character of a pharmakeutria (expert in herbal lore) from the archaic period (by way of her Hesiodic genealogical connect ion wit h Kirke) concedes that this is quite different from her powerful co mmand of sorcery i n the classical period (and beyond).58 Chris Mackie has theor ised that knowledge of drugs was originally ascribed to Jason and that this knowledge was passed to Medeia - a foreign wo man - instead becaus e it was increasingly viewed as a dangerous ar t, and thus inappropriate for a (1954); Clauss and John ston (1997 ), 259. 56 By depicting her in o rnatel y foreign co stume, the artist doubly dista nces his Med eia from the four Gree k figu res below: bell krater , Clevela nd Museum o Art, M. graphicum Mythologia e Classicae (henceforth finds that this work is ea rlier than 430. 58 Graf (19 97b), 31. 117Greek hero.59 Jason (w hose own name means 'healer'60) was raised by the medically expert Cheiron, who famously taught Asklepios, another of his pupils, medicine beyond hum an knowle dge. Mackie cites early visual material, most importantly a Korint hian colum n-krater of ca. 575 depicting Jason's healing of the blindne ss of Phineus, as evidenc e for an alternative tradition in which Jason di d have special knowledge of herbal lore.61 He further argues that t he healing knowledge imparted to Cheiron's pupils, especially Asklepio s, was a matter of unease in the ancient sources, being conceived as a \"fundamental challenge to the order of the world\".62 This unease is indic ated, Mackie suggests, by Asklepios' harsh punishment by Zeus for his transgressions in some accounts, and the careful silence on the matter of other sources.63 Unease wa s doubtless attached to Asklepios ' ability to raise the dead, although M ackie perhaps pushes the evi dence too far to suggest that all such 'magical' healing is inappropri ate to the heroes of Greek epic.64 Further, Jason's subtle magical a ssociations are never more than understated, and there is little to s upport the suggestion that Medeia's medicina l skills were newer or ever overshadowed by J ason's. 59 Chri s J. Ma ckie, 'The ea rliest Ja son. What's in a na me?', G&R 48, 1 (2001 ), 14. Mackie do es not enter the discu ssion as to how this chang e in attitude s towa rds pharm aka came about. 60 On whic h see B. K.

The prominence of dichotomising tendencies in Greek philos ophic al, and especially tragic literature, and positioning of women as 'other' in such dualisms has been discuss ed previously.66 Suffice it to say, then , that Euripides' Medeia constitutes a most elaborate, explicit and subtle exploration of su ch structures. Through careful blurring and inver sion of accepted categories, mapped as relations hips between (or intersections of) Greek/barbarian, beast/mortal/divine and masculine/feminine,67 Euripides unravels, challenges (and perhaps reaffirms) these models for relating to others. If initially Medeia was s eparat ed from humanity by virtue of her divinity, in Euripides' play she retains some of the qualities of a goddess, but they are understood as pertaining more import antly to her signifying status as a foreigner. Such modern efforts to distil Medeia into primary categories are complic ated by the fact that E uripides has maintained for his heroine a distinctly limina l, or more precisely shifting, status. Having early moved from the status of divinity to that of humanity, Medeia at some point also bec omes both non-Greek and a powerful sorceress, 65 Nan cy Sorki n Rabi nowitz, Anxiety Veile d: Euripide s and the traffic i n wom en (Ithac a and Lo ndon, 1993 ), p. 136 . 66 See chapte r one, pp. 24-2 7. 67 These th ree groups of con cepts are id entified by Rab inowit z (19 93), p. 126; Page duBois, Cent aurs and Am azons: wom en and the pre -histo ry of the great chain o f being (Michigan, 1982), 4 ff. To t hese may be added, more generally, polis/oikos , as espoused by Margaret Williamson, 'A woman's place i n Euripides' Medea ' in Ant on 119more or less simultaneously. This close association bet ween magic and foreignnes s - especially where it is constructed as the 'barbarian other' - is crucial to the understanding of Eurp ides' play. Setting aside for the moment the knowledge that the earliest Medeia in Korinth was Greek, we shall turn to the role of her forei gnness in Euripides ' play. Establishing this important theme early in the play, Jason boasts to Medeia that he has saved her from ignominious barbar ian origins to enjoy a Greek way of life: 'Firstly, you live on Greek land, in stead of in a barbarian place, and you know both justice and the ru le of law, and (need) give no favour to force. All Greeks hav e learned that you are clever, and you have gained a reputation.'68 In the early scenes of the play one is almost convinced that Medeia has become Greek. Indeed, Knox and ot hers have concluded that Medeia must have worn Greek costume i n the early scenes of the play for her behaviour and interac tions to have been believable.69 In her early meek comportment in public Medeia's behav iour accords well with the wifely ideals repeatedly espoused by wr iters of the elite classes.70 She clearly enjoys a great deal of sympathy and fellow feeling with the wives of Powell (ed.), Euripid es, Wom en, and Sexu ality (New York, 199 0), 16-31 and G eorge B. Walsh, 'Publi c and p rivate in three play s of Euripide s', CP 74 79), 294-309. 'The Medea of Euripide s', in E. Segal (ed.), Oxford Rea dings in Gree k Tragedy (Oxford, 1 983), 27 2-93, esp. 287. 70 Medeia leav es : 120Korinthian citizens as she grappl es with marital problems which are entirely familiar to them.71 As the play progresses though, the audi ence is made distinctly aware of Medeia's barbarian 'otherness', by repeated, if subdued and undev eloped allusions to her history. The her oine has come to Korinth from beyond the limits of the known world, past the Symplegades.72 In this detail we may align her with the immortal Kirke, who in the Odyssey similarly occupies a distant, liminal part of the world.73 In Euripides ' play some emphasis is placed upon the ex tremity of Medeia's phy sical displacement.74 This dis placement, however, is not initially permitted to impact meaningfully upon Medeia's interactions with others. It is only in this final scene, with a devastated Jason confronting Medeia aloft in the chariot with her slain child ren that the switch from Greek to oriental cos tume occurs, according to Sourvinou-Inwood.75 She notes that images which date to just afte r 431, and which evoke the Euripidean tragedy depict Medeia as oriental when the chariot of Helios is als o present.76 In contrast, images known to be earlier than 431,77 along with 71 Med. 214-66 , 576-8. The chorus continues to emb race Med eia's cause even (o r especially) when she is pl otting to destroy her rival s in marri age with deadly pharmaka: see b elow, n. 106. 72 Med. 1-2, 12 63.

Given that images which appear to be based on this play but depict the murder of children - wh ich does not occur onstage - adopt varying degrees of Greekness and orientalis m,79 Sourvinou-Inwood is led to consider whether this was the poi nt during the play at which a change of costume was introduced.80 Early in the play, Medeia's barbarian heritage is repeatedly pres ented as something that has been left behind in favour of Greekness.81 Indeed, oriental dress would most likely detract from one's early impression that M edeia is accepted by much of the Greek community.82 Jason's exc lamation at the beginning of the chariot scene, that: 'No Greek woman wo uld have d ared to do this (ie. kill her children)'83 marks a logical point, dramatically, fo r Medeia to be distanced - culturally, ethnically and geographically - by t he introduction of oriental costume.84 78 An Apulian a mphora de picting the cha riot sce ne with Medeia in G reek d ress deviates from the ce of L yssa a nd Sel ene on a h umanised he roine: Schmidt (1 992), no. 37.

Kreon rel ents to Medeia 's demands only when she ap peals to him as a sup pliant a nd a fellow p arent - that is, by values which stress their common hum anity (or 'Gree kness', acco aring to wards Medeia certa inly indicates that he embraces her as a me mber of the community: 663 ff. 83 Med. 1339 -40. 122In contrast to his earlier boast of hav ing Hellenised Medeia, the motif of taking her from a barbarian envir onment is now used to underscore that she has always been a barbarian.85 Medeia's b arbarian status is thus cr ystallised by Jason's response to her infanticid e86 in combination with the tangibl e fact of Medeia's costume. That Medeia should be depicted orientally of course has a more meaningful function than merely to c onfirm Jason's opinion of her as a savage foreigner.87 Indeed, Euripides destabilises the very dichotomies that make her action comprehensible to Jason. Medeia is both a fully enculturated Greek wife and a sav age foreign woman with divine and magical as sociations. This technique of \"shifting distanc es\" has important repercussions for the relationship between ordinary Greek women or wives and magic, as wil l be explored below. Edith Hall has argued that the conc eption of barbarians (as opposed to foreigners) as the antithesis of the qualities upheld by Greeks was 84 Medeia' s ele vation on the mechane here simultan eously sp atially isolates Medeia from no rmal humanity, aligning h er with divinity rather than foreig nness. See p p. 116-1 7 and nn. 56 a nd 57 above. In the se cond half of the play, even as Medeia' s mo re than human n ature become s apparent, she i s simulta neously align ed with less than human creatures, by the use of me taphor: see n. 93 belo w.

Reckford, 'Me dea's first exit', TAPhA 99 (1 968), 32 9-59, esp. 356. See also the previou s note. 123primarily a fifth century innovation.88 The wealth of discussion and comparison on this subject in tragedy89 constituted an exercise in self- definition, which had not been deemed nec essary before the rise of Persia as a formidable neighbour and threat in the last half of the si xth century. The re-conc eptualis ation of the polis by the imperialist democracy of Athens during the later fi fth century is also cited as an influential factor.90 Oriental dress appear s in art and drama not simply as a literal signifier of eastern origins, but also as an indi cation of metaphorical (and ine vitably distasteful) orientalism.91 The stereotype capitalise d upon the emergi ng idea that foreigners were variously emotional, cruel, tyrannical or subservient , cowardly, and stupid or naive.92 Other disagreeable traits could equally be attributed to lack of Greekness, as the context required. Thus even Greek figures such as Aigisthos (in the Ores teia) and Kreon (in the Antigone ) could be depicted as somewhat oriental on vase paintings, thereby communicating the luxur y, effeminacy and 88 Pierre Vidal -Naq uet had e arlier suggested that barb arians were largely a fifth century notion: Pierre Vidal-Naquet , The Black Hunter: form s of thought an d form s of so ciety in the Gre ek world, tran sl.

The idea - both ancient and modern - that the magic known in Greece was a foreign, specifically eastern practice, introduced by outsiders, has been noted previously.95 As early as Hesiod Medeia is explic itly associated with the M edian people who later become synonymous with Persians, in Greek thought. That her son i s named Medeios (or Medos) and included in this part of Hesiod's ca talogue is taken by M. L. West to indicate he was presented as an archetypal and eponym ous Mede as early as the mid-sixth century.96 Medeia hers elf was closely aligned with the Medes (who were synonymous with Persians for the Greeks) according to Herodotos, who record s that the Medes changed their name 93 Aegistho s: Apulian b ell krater, Ne w York Fleisch man colle ction F 93, see O.

The heroine thus occupies an ambivalent position vis a vis Greek ideas about belonging. To the male citizen Medeia is a cultural outsider, but to citizen wives - themselves a marginalis ed group - she is embraced as a peer. Underscoring t he gendered basis of their support is that these women only challenge her when she rejects maternal instinct in favour of an heroic masculine concer n for honour at any cost - i n this instance by killing her own childre n.99 While Jason rails against his wife's infanticide as the work of a barbari an, a lioness, a creature more savage 97 Hdt. 7.62.

However the rhetorical eloquence105 with which she likens a distant stranger like herself to the position of all fifth century Greek women in marriage106 is as revealing as it persuasive, not least becau se of the negative juxtaposition of oriental costume and oikos -destroying behaviour in the final scene. Through Medeia's speech to the chorus and their subsequent support for her, Greek citizens' wives are equated with foreignnes s and the potential for oikos -destroying behaviour. While the support of the chorus eventually falter s, its earlier sentiments and role in the successful execution of Medeia' s plans are not forgotten. The idea that women were a kind of foreigner - a barbarian even - to the conjugal oikos , complete with questions of loyalty and value, clear ly had some currency in Greek thought. The identification of women with barbarians is clearly present in the work of A ristotle.107 Ensuring a bride's loyalty to her new family was the sym bolic function of the burning of the wedding cart axle on arrival at her husband's oikos , for instance.108 A major topos of the literary genre of invective against women, or psogos gunaik on, gives voice to nervousness about the virtue of wives. The iambic poet ry of Archilochos and Semonides constitutes an early 105 Medeia he re approp riates the tradition ally gend definit ion sh e is see king to affirm. cf. Laura McClu re, Spoken Li ke a Wom an: spe ech and g ende r in Athe nian dram a (Prin ceton, 1 999), pp. 8 -15. 106 In a single spee ch Med eia identifies h erself as a strange r, and th us soci ally vulnera ble (222-4) and describe s a b ride's expe rience of her ne w oikos as similarly fraught with p owerlessness and pre carious soci al relat ions (238 -47), and invoke s comm on wo manho od (23 0-31, 25 9-66). 6-19; see Vid al-Naqu 83), pp. 2-7; 989), 128exploration and elabor ation on the theme.109 The most prominent example of such invective, though, is Hesiod's treatise on Pandor a - the first woman (and therefor e the first and archetypal110 wife) - sent by the Olympian deities to the Titan Promet heus as punishment for his theft of fire.111 Here 'woman' is presented as an attractive but baneful artifice, and one who is crucial for the producti on of offspring, yet simultaneously an insatiable devourer of the provi sions and wellbeing of man (and so also his oikos). That is to say, woman is an alien evil, which is nonetheles s essential for the continuanc e of one's family.112 Hesiod even goes so far as to say that even in a 'w orthy' wife, her evils are a match for her benefits.113 The topoi of invective literature are put to several uses in the course of the play. Medeia deliberately inv erts su ch ideas, to celebrate the vi rtue of women and equally to scorn the wicke dnes s of Jason and all men on the subject of their conduct in marriage. In lamenting that women must buy a husband and only learn his character la ter, and that they must also endure the perils of childbirth, Medeia is directly answering to a discourse about the vices of wives found in Hesiod, as indeed in the words of 109 Archilochos, Clogne epo de = fr. 196a 2 4-41; Dougl as E. Gerbe r (ed.), A Com panion to the Gree k Lyric Poet s (Leiden, 19 97), pp. 66-7; Se monide s in Hugh Lloyd -Jones, Females of the Specie s: Sem onides o n wom en (London, 1975 ). cf. Lora ux (19 93). 110 It is a characteris tic of psogos g unaikon literature that all women a re denig rated f or the misde eds of a single woman: Lau ra McCl ure (19 99), 377. 111 Hes., Hesio d' in idem , Myth and Societ y in Ancient G reece, transl.

H aving chast ised herself for her foolishness and excess of emotion, Medeia dec lares to Jason: 'Well, we women are what we are - I won't say evil.'117 Towards the end of the play the chor us begin to yield in earnest to the substance of such invective, c onceding men's superior wisdom, and eventually lamenting: 'Oh womankind and marriage-bed full of suffering, how many evils you have already created for men!'118 114 Med. 232-6, Laura M cClure (199 9), 374-5.

An exceptional woman, she nonetheless us es a traditionally male style of discourse to draw attention to genuine griev ances of ordinary Greek women concerning the system o f mari tal exc hange whic h dominated their lives. The same 'bad' woman reveals herself as a justifiable target for all such invective, having destroyed her husband's oikos out of jealousy and emotional rage. Medeia proves threatening bec ause, consistent with the psogos gunaikon tradition, she employs deceptive or double language,120 is emotional to excess,121 and is dominated by sexual lust (or so her behaviour could be construed). In these idiosyncrasie s she simply represents an extreme example of the dangerous potentia lities latent in all women.122 Dangerous female sexuality and it s magi cal associations are features of the Medeia . In her excessively eager pur suit of Jason, and concomitant 119 Given that Medeia cham pions the cause of women when she needs to gai n the chorus' confid ence, and rev erses such argument s to win over Ja son, ulterior moti ves are to be detecte d in her spee ch. 120 Zeitlin and Verna nt have o bserved that by her divinel y wroug ht nature Pan dora - an importa He siodic contrib ution to the Verna regardi ng the virt ue of women: se e previous n ote.

Page, however, ha associ ated such ex cess with barba xix. 131betrayal of her natal family, Medeia represents the dangers inherent in autonomous female desire.123 Early, Medeia laments that unlike the chorus she has: '...no mother, no brother, no kin...'124 The chorus seem to respond most inappropriately to this perverse statement which follows the received tradition that Medeia betrayed her father using her exper tise in pharmaka , and also dismembered her own brother Apsyrtus for the sake of Jason's quest.125 With Medeia out of his reach in the final scene, Jason rails against his former ally for her abominations against blood relations: '(You were) a traitor to your fa ther and the land which nur tured you. But the gods have visited upon m e the avenging spirit meant for you. For you killed your brother at the hearth and embarked onto the fair-prowed Argo.'126 as though to absolve h imself from his part in the allia nce. His particular emphasis upon the scene of the slaying of Apsyr tus - the hearth - is 122 O'Higgi ns (1997), 12 2; Ra binowitz (1 993), pp. 126, 1 39, 142. 123 On the ren dering of female desire as p roblematic see Rabinowitz (1 993), pp. 14 0-1. 124 Med. 257. 125 Medeia' s betrayal of her father Aiete s: Med. 166 -67, 483-8 5, 502 -3, 506-8. killing and 546 and Apollonio s make Apsyrtu s only a half-broth er to Medei a, as thou gh to soften her crime.

In effect, she rejects her primary cultural function as an exchangeable commodity. In its i dentif ication of women as the point of greatest vu lnerability in t he syste m of marita l exchange,130 the my th of Medeia is consistent with a well-est ablished set of normative stories about marri age. Against positive myths - such as that of the Sabine women - in which nata l loyalties are temperately balanced with new conjugal alliances, Medeia's myth highl ights the perils of intemperately 126 1332-35. 127 Situating the murd er at a h earth - a ty pe of domesti c altar - ma kes Medeia 's act one of sacrileg e in addition to kin-murde r: see Ja n N.

Nonetheless, a crisis accompanies both marriage myths. The cultural abnormality of Medeia's sexual proactivity is signposted by the manner in which s he ratifies her union with Jason. Unlike 'normal' Greek brides Medeia took an active masculine role in marriage, exchanging oaths with Jason, t he partner of her own choosing.131 The force behind Medeia's marriage to Jason, and her subsequent vengeanc e, is identified by Jason, t he chorus and Medeia herself as lust, or lechos . This term, which literally m eans 'marriage couch' is rather ambiguous , encompassing as it does i deas of both sexual desire and the status attached to the marital union.132 Jason defends his new marri age against Medeia's protests, challenging her: 'Did I plan badly? Not even you would say so, if lust di d not vex you so.'133 and likening her unreasonable behaviour with that of all women when sexual relat ions are marred in some way: 'But you women have come to such a point that if all goes well in the bed you believe you have everything, but then 131 Med. 160-65 , 488-95. Th e cho rus and Medeia 's own nurse have n o experie nce of actively contracting a ma rriage, but non etheless si de with her a gainst the breaching of oaths: nu rse: 168-72; ch orus: 205 five, pp. 152-5 3; also Rabino witz (19 93), p. 140. 133 Med. 567-8. 134again if something happens in bed you see your best and finest assets as most hateful.'134 Jason here seems to be using lechos in its sense of sexual lust, although Medeia's wifely status is cl early part of the issue here.135 In her deception of Jason, though, Medeia apparently yields to her husband's superior judgment and temperance on t he subject of the new lechos, or allia nce: 'So now I approve, and it seems that you are sensible and caring in the alliance for us, w hereas I am the foolish one, I who should join you in your plans, help to accomplish them and stand by the bed and take pleasure in caring for your new wife.'136 before eventually conceding that lechos is indeed the reason for her extreme act of vengeance: Jason: It was not my hand, I tell you, that killed them. Medeia: No, but the offenc e of your brand new marriage. Jason: And you thought it was ri ght to kill them because of this? Medeia: Do you believ e this to be a small woe to women?137 134 569-7 3 135 At 488-91 M edeia p oints out that the new ma rriage would have b een un dersta ndabl e and re asona ble if she and Jason h ad no t already had children. 136 885-8. Med eia's feig ning of anti-femini stic sentiment s in the su bseque nt lines thematically matches those of Jason at 573 ff. 135This emphasis upon the disproporti onate weight given by Medeia to matters of sex po ints to another familiar topos of psogos gunaikon - women's alleged hypersexuality. Hesiod makes reference to this theme, declaring that his archetypal wom an would wither a man with her twin appetites for sex and food.138 This idea continued to be influential in literary, philosophic al and medica l works throughout the classical period.139 In the passage above, as at 569-73 we see the destructive behaviour of Medeia being relat ed to women's conduct more generally, underscoring that the heroine' s behaviour is consider ed to be exceptional only in its degree, not its character. In conjunct ion with her complaint at 244-7 that Greek women are forced by cu stom to limit their attention to a single man, Medeia here seems to be confirming that dangerous preoccupat ion with lechos would be systemic among (Greek) wives. Through Medeia's arguments Euripide s may be seen to challenge the customs which curtailed Greek women' s freedom in marriage. However, having his most eloquent spokesperson for women's freedom being at the same time a most unfathomable, sexualised feminine nightmare figure greatly undermines any support for Medei a's well-cons tructed arguments. 137 1365-8. fr. We p re-cla ssical expressio ns of this idea: Se m., fr. 7.48- 9, 53, 106-1 1 (We lust: Anacreon, fr. 44 Gentili (432 PMG )', CQ 34, 1 (19 84), 37-4 2, esp. 39 n. 18; K. J.

The sui cidal tenden cies of young virgin s in Hip p., Virg. is attributed to patholo gical, unrecognised desire for int ercourse and reproductio n. Dean -Jone s concludes that women's inferi or ability to resi st sexual urges was considered to be a form of pass ivity, itself a fe minine role. 136The audience is surely left instead with a sense of the deceptive, destructive potential of all such feministic debates.140 Medeia's own damning admission that she committed i nfanticide out of erotic (or dynastic)141 jealousy142 is countered by the role of the magical iunx wheel in the myth preceding the acti on of Euripides' dr ama. As early as Pindar Medeia is a hel pless victim of the iunx wheel, after Aphro dite bequeaths knowledge of this m agical technology to Jason.143 Euripides too exploits the motif of the exotic woman who is expert in pharmaka yet equally a victim of divinely conferred magic. Medeia cla ims to have allie d herself with Jason of her own free will, alb eit with impair ed judgment: 'For I betrayed my father and home of my own accord and came with you to Iolkos near Pelion, wit h more passion than prudence...'144 Jason, on the other hand, emphasises the driving force of Aphrodite behind Medeia's dec isions: 140 Rabin owitz, too, finds that this play raises the po ssibility that women feign helple ssness and po werlessness to s, whil e achi eving feminine aims: Ra binowitz (1 993), p. 142. 141 Con sider the interplay of erotic an d dyn astic concerns in Euripi des' Androm ache. 142 Michelini considers Medeia's words h ere to con stitute an admi ssion of simple jealou exaggerate your a ssistance too much, I consider Kypris alone of gods or mortals to be the saviour of my voyage. As for you, I'll say you have a subtle mind - but to divulge how Eros compelled you with unerring arrows to save me would leave me vulnerab le to animosity.'145 This situation, in whic h a heroic figure is granted by a deity magical technology with whic h to counter the magic of another powerful being, finds an Homeric parallel in Book 10 of the Odyssey . Against the transformative and stupefying pharmaka of Kirke, Hermes provides Odysseus, the most cunning of heroes,146 with a superior antidote in the form of a pl ant called moly .147 From another perspective we may correlate Jason's outmanoeuvring of M edeia in her own area of expertise with Zeus' swallowing of his wife Metis.148 Zeus appropriates all the guile and intelligence of this primordial deity by swallowing her whole. This act of turning Metis' own weapons agains t her proves to be judicious for Zeus, as it prevents her from pro ducing a son who would overthrow his divine father.149 145 526-3 1. Tha t Jaso n has access he re to magic - alth ough a divine gift rather tha n his own creation - is pe rhaps a diminish ed relic of Ja son's own forme r healin g expertise.

To prevent vanquishm ent Zeus adopts a feminine mode of agonistic engagement . Where women are triumphant over men in tragedy, in conflicts conceived as involv ing metis in its more pejorative sense150 (with meanings involving treachery, disloyal tricks and deceitful lies),151 they may be represented as so mehow masculinis ed, with their male adversaries correspondingly em asculated. This type of gender inversion is clearly in evidence in Sophok les' Trachiniai and Herakles, initially presented as harply dichotomised examples of feminine and masculine comportment respectively,152 are drawn towards role reversal as Deianeira's magical deception unfolds. In the throes of agony after having come in contact with the pharmakon obtained by his wife Herakles admits to having been defeated by a woman, and to having 'become' a woman in his delirium.153 Deianeira, for the destruction she 149 Aesch., Prom. t ), esp. chs. 1 an d 3. 150 Loraux note s that languag e sug gestive of feminine e xpertise a nd cunning is used of females where it most prob ably woul d not if the deed was perfo rmed by a male.

Her pursuit of heroic honour, her skilful use of persuasive rhetor ic and her egalitarian approach to male peers all help to assimilate her with the masculine gender.155 While in her closeted, deceitful use(s) of pharmaka she is indubitably feminine, her final double infanticide onc e again calls that feminini ty into question. It has been pointed out by Margaret Vi sser that in myth (as opposed to historical reality156) female figures rarely kill t heir conjugal families - either husbands or children - whereas mythical males are rather more likely to exercis e Patria Potestas - their power of life and death over their own children.157 Unlike Jokas ta, Deianeir a or Eurydike, Medeia does not kill herself upon learning t he destruction she has wrought for the Korinthian 154 Trach . 915-6.

Hera's reason for using Aphrodite's kestos on Zeus, for example, was to prevent him from taking part on the divine level in the Troj an War, by distracting him and then putting him to sleep.160 Common, ancient human magical technology shares this potential for sexually arousing then incapac itating or 'unmanning' it s male victims. The PGM collections include sev eral exampl es of individual spells which can both attract ( HNLP\u0084 ) and lay a person low (RH\u008dHRzP\u0099\u0084LP\u0084 ).161 Faraone detects a parallel to such spells in the common lore about the capacity of certain individual substances to 158 Rabin owitz consi ders whe ther the male ness children is significant to the gend ered agenda of the tragedy: (19 93), p. 146. 159 See espe cially his 'Sex and power: mal 92-1 d (199 4a), 115-35. 160 Hom., Il. 14.150-360. 14. 158 ma kes clear that the sedu ction of Zeus with the aid of the kestos was not motivated by her lov e for him; Faraone (199 2b), 92-3, g emston obv erse a ce rtain Achill as, pias to Dio nysias, the dau ghter of Serapia s, while o n the reverse the ai m is to either attract him o r else lay him l ow: C.

P lato highlig hts the dangerous potential of the substance to be used to disturb proper social hierarchies . In a fable ibes mutineers drugging their captain with mandrake and seizing command of the ship. With the use of guile, then, a woman or an i nferior may administer such substances to render their master passive, and therefore inferi or and feminin e. In his advice to young brides Plutarch seems to have such travesties of proper hierarchies in mind when he speaks of women who try to gain mastery over their husbands through pleasure, with the help of pharmaka. This idea of gender reversal and the upsetti ng of proper hierarchies in male- targeting lo ve magic will be d iscussed furt her in my concluding remarks. Female-targetting love spells frequently seek to attract and lay low their victims, and withhold their power of re sistance in much the same way as the male-targetting spells. The PGM collections yield numerous versions of 'love' spells which invoke the torments of sleeplessn ess, restlessness and lust upon the named female belov ed, until she brings and yields herself to the spell's issuer.163 The intention of such spells is forcible constraint, as sadistic magical tec hnology inv olving the piercing of wax 162 Mandrake: as an ap hrodisiac (T heophr., HP 9.9.1), as a narcoti c an aphrodi siac (Arist., de 456b31), to ov erpower the ca ptain of the ship of state i n a political fa ble (Plato, Rep. 6.488c); the unnam ed drug of Ari stophilos, a Plataean d rug-selle r: an a phrodisiac, but can al cause rary or pe below, p. 147 . 142'voodoo' dolls would s uggest.164 The aims of female-targetting spells appear to form an analogue to male-targetting spells, a t least in the way that Plutarch conceives of them. In female-t argetting spells, thoug h, accepted gender and power hier archie s are not breached - women are inscribed as passive targets of masculine constraint - and so travesties of gender are not at issue. Medeia's deployment of magical sc hemes is strongly connected, in Euripides' play, with the idea of t he disruption of gender (and other) distinctions . Through her use of magic Medeia destroys her children, along with the oikos that a Greek woman woul d normally be expect ed to nurture. By this act, Medeia is effe ctively attempting to exert a level of influenc e over her surroundings to which she has no legitimate access. As a woman and a dispossessed fo reign concubine, the heroine has limited lawful means of redress. Medeia's m urderous, magical behaviour leads her to be constructed as 'other' to accepted modes of feminine comportment. Foreignness, divinity and masculinity are instead inv oked as ways of understanding this perverse female figure. There is also some attempt to ex plain, if not actually ju stify, Medeia' s behaviour with reference to the difficulties impos ed upon women by the Greek system of marital exc hange. The plight of the heroine, and indeed of all Greek 163 PGM IV 1496-15 95, 171 6-1870, 164 Winkl er sugg ests we loo k throu gh expre ssed in the female-ta rgetting spell s to see in stead an attempt to transfer th e real angui sh of un requite d love by males ont o their female subje cts, an d the intende d torment s to be born of mal e self-cent redness not mali ce: Win kler (1990c), 88 ff. 143women in marriage is explicitly discussed throughout this play. Remain ing carefully ambiguous in it s judgments, though, the play still suggests a relationship between Medeia's m agical schemes and the destructive potential of all women in marriage. 144Chapter Five Deianeira's philtre: Conjugal tensions in the Trachiniai Sophok les' Trachiniai has been subject to di sparaging analyses in the millen nia between its ancient po pularity an d its twentieth century rehabilitation. Criticisms have hinged largely upon its disjointed dichotomous structure, and the unsett ling c haracters and actions of both Herakles and Deianeir a.1 As Easterling observes, the bulk of the remaining difficulties with the play hinge upon the religi ous and cultural assumptions that underpin the action of the play, rather than technic al issues of structure.2 Given that the twin crises which drive the action of the play are Herakles' return to his marital oikos with a new 'bride'3 as a spoil of war, and Deianeira's cons equent dec ision to employ a 'love charm',4 such perplexity and the diversity of interpretations of the play are unsurprising. The first major point of contention am ong modern interpreters of the play is Deianeir a's understanding, or lack t hereof, of the nature of the l ove charm which Nessos the centaur gave her as he died by Herakles' poisoned arrow. While most scholar s agree that Deianeira employed the 1 On the histo ry of Trachinia 1; Charl cles' Trachiniae: values', YCS 25 (1977 ), 101 -3. 2 Easterlin g (1982), p. 1. 3 The legal ma rital statu s of the young wo man, Iole, is left ambiguou s throu ghout the 0-1, 1224; cf.

Errandonea argues Sophok les' hus band int entionally, while Chris topher A. Faraone suggests that her only error was to overdose Herakles with an eros-inducing MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084 which she knew to be potentially lethal. An assess ment of treatments of this part of the myth in other texts may better illuminate the source of this impasse. While the side of the story concer ning Herak les' victory against the Oichalians and subsequent seizing of Iole was apparently inspired by the epic poem Oichalias Halosis ,5 Deianeira does not seem to have played a role in this part of the myth until a later date. T he earliest extant reference to Deian eira's killing of her husban d with a poisoned robe is in Hesiod's Catalogue of wom en.6 As in the Trachiniai , the deed in Hesiod's version is carried out through the her ald Lichas. The source of the MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084 is not given in Hesiod's account, nor is detail provided regarding the reasons or intentions behind Deianeira's act.7 Herakles' battle with the lascivious Nessos appears as early as Archiloc hus8 and was a popular s ubject for vase paintings. In these works, however, Herakles favour s weapons other than the bow, which 5 This poe m is discusse d in more d etail b elow with refe rence to Dei aneira 's jealousy or otherwise re garding Iole. 6 Hes., 25 M W 14-33. 7 Easterlin g finds the Hesi odic text \u0086\u0084: Easterlin g (1982), p. 16.

A later poem, thought to be by Bakchylides , conforms to this pattern of a simple battle between Herakles a nd Nessos for sexual access to Deianeira.9 On the basis of such evidenc e it is reasonable to conclude that in pre-Sophok lean accounts, De ianeira's killing of her husban d by means of an anointed robe was probabl y not associated with a potion from the centaur. In conjunction with other, adm ittedly circumstantial evidenc e, March and Jebb, among others, have s uggested that Sophok les' portrayal of Deianeira as gentle and na\u00efve runs counter to her otherwise fierce and 'Amazonian' mythologic al character.10 The state of this early evidenc e goes some way to justi fying the disagreem ent regarding Deianei ra's intentions Trachiniai . If we accept March's thesis, Sophokles ' painstaking characterisation (and rehabilitation) of a once murderous wife underscores the poet's sensitive and pointed approach to gender in this play. While the pre-Sophoklean literature is too sparse to be certain of Deian eira's traditional role in myth, March's gathered evidence is compe lling. The ramifications of Sophok les' innovation will be disc ussed further in my concluding remarks. 9 P.

Davies (1991), p. xxxi gi ves more cautious creden ce to this theory. 146In a recent work discussing the love potion used in this play, Christopher A. Faraone has identified in Deiane ira's word s and actions an extensive knowledge of the essentially lethal quality of many love potions in common ancient usage.11 He draws attention to the oft-drawn connections between aphrodis iacs and narcosis or fatal poisoning in the classical Greek sources. The fourth century B.C.E. comic poet Eubulos, for example, notes that wine in sm all quantit ies induc es erotic desire, while larger quantities produce sleep.12 An elegiac poe m by Evenus makes the same observation.13 Theophrastos , Aristotle and Plato no te that a combination of mandrake and wine or vi negar produces sexual desire, sleep and paralysis, depending how much is imbibed.14 Theophrast os exp licitly muses on the ability o f one substance to produce such conflicting results.15 In light of this widespread knowledge of the toxicity of love potions Faraone reads in Deianeira's expressions of dread and regret after dispatching the anoint ed robe via Lichas (ll. 663-4) a realisation that she has perhaps over dosed Herakles with poison, not the first realisation that s he has poisoned him at all. Such an int erpretation as Faraone's is consistent with Deianeira's acceptance of a demonstrably danger ous substance as being of aphrodis iac value. Deianeira's narration of her receipt of the centaur's potion at lines 572-5 has been the subject of much interpretative 11 Farao ne, (19 94a), 11 5-35. Cf. 13 Som ent.16 However one reads them, th ough (and more importantly in the present context), the lines ma y be taken as proof that Deianeira was aware that the potion was dr awn from bl ood containing Hydra' s poison. Unless one reads it in c onjunction with Sophok lean dramatic devices and the well-characterised fi gure of Deianeira, this is indee d damning evidence. On the basis of these lines F. Errandonea ev en finds Deianeira c ulpable for the int entional slay ing of Herakles.17 Once we observe that late-learning is as central a theme in this play as it is in the Oidipous Tyr annos , and that Eros blinds and bewitches Deianeira as much as i t does He rakles, interpretations such as Errandonea's seem simplistic and unlik ely. Sophok les' deployment of theme and character similarly detract from Faraone's thesis. At lines 441- 4 Deianeira proclaims that she herself is governed by Eros. She makes this statement in a speech justif ying the improper behaviour of her similarly enthralled husband.18 Here, as elsewhere in ancient Greek literature, erotic love is presented as a form of madness or disease, which results in impaired comfort and reason and a reduced sense of propriety.19 Deianeira's sense of reason is further hampered, as she later tells, by the persuasive powers exercised by the cunning centaur. After the potion has been appli ed and the robe is taken beyond her reach and 16 Easterlin g and Davie s discuss the tech nical difficultie s asso ciate d with these lin es at length in their comme ntarie s. messen ger explains that Hera kles beseiged Oi also ) L\u0089LzNL is usually translated here as 'cajoled' or 'tricked', but given that l. 355 is the only other place in the Sophok lean corpus where this word occurs, the usage is far more signific ant.20 The nexus of ideas of pers uasion, magic and sexual desire should thus be acknowledged here.21 Deianeir a has therefore exonerated herself from blame, ci ting two plausible exter nal factors22 that compelled her to make use of the poisonous substance. In the opening scene of the play Deianeira dis plays a lac k of inquisitiveness concerning her hu sband's whereabouts which conf ounds her more perspicacious nurse.23 Upon learning of the prophecies regarding Herakles, Hyllos too is com pelled to act immediately where his mother did not think to do so.24 It is thus consistent with her characteri stic quiet, sad acceptance of the peculiarities of her life that Deiane ira is so easily pers uaded of the aphrodisiac qua lities of the dying centaur's poisoned blood. Studies which apply rigorous logic to the question of Deianeira's prior knowledge and aims fail to do justice to Sophok les' careful characterisation, and his explor ation of the subtleties of Eros and Persuasion and their capacity to obscure truth and wisdom. In this play 20 Segal (19 77), 111-2. 21 cf. Aes ch., Suppl . 104 0; Gorgia s, Helen 10 and 14.

Hyllo s mitigates censure of his mother by ex plaining that Herakl es' fate made 'norm al' s prolo nged absence imp ractical. 149involv ing late learning, as indeed in the Oidipous Tyrannos , Sophok les does not seek to indic t each character as they each dis cover the truth of their situations. The focus inst ead lies with the limits of human knowledge in contrast with that of the gods. T he interwoven fates of Deianeira, Herakles, Nessos an d Hyllos u ltimately rest with Zeus, as the poet underscores throughout the action and in the closing lines.25 The marked diptych structure of this play, which effectively separates the worlds occ upied by Deianeira and Herakles, results in a work which, more than most of the dramas, may be viewed as a confrontation between the concerns of oikos and polis respectively. The two lead ing characters may be interpreted as extr eme polarisations of the ideals of feminine and masculine behaviour,26 although Easterling is right to warn that such a subtle play as the Trachiniai cannot be distilled to a single, simple conflict.27 In the extens ive portion of the play devoted to her, Deianeira is presented as a chas te and devoted wife to the absent Herakles, whose acc ess to information about her husband's wher eabouts is greatly limited by her cloister ed lifestyle, in which her primary companions are her nurse and a chor us of young Trachinian women.28 25 251, 983, 99 5, 1002, 102 2, 1041, 1278. 26 Davies (199 1), p. xix; Helene P.

Segal see s the prim ary confrontation as lying bet ween t he world s of the fifth century oikos and that of the heroi c past, with ge nder confli cts being inh erent in his analy sis: Segal (1977), 99 -158. 27 Easterlin g notes that He rakles and Deianeira h ave m uch in comm on, particula rly ab out He rakles present state of affairs (Hyllo s is far more familiar with rumou rs of hi s father's receive from outsid e is not always reliab le, as the me er's accusatio n of Lichas shows; 346-7 4. 150Her life, like her lonely death, is played out withi n the confines of the marital oikos that she keeps for her husband.29 Herakles, on the other hand, lives a life foreign to his own oikos , as Deianeira is quick to point out.30 His primary concerns, as articulated in this play, revolve around his servitude to Eurystheos,31 and the violent defeat of enemies, human and bestial.32 Segal examines Sophokles' use of imagery and tone to def ine the radically opposed spheres inhabited by Deianeira and Herakles as \"domes tic and naturalistic\" and \"schematic and mythological\" respectively.33 In the radically opposed spaces occupied by Herakles and Deiane ira, communication (and attempted reconciliation) between the two is enacted only through the agency of Lichas and Hyllos.34 In the exchanges between Deianeira, the herald, the messenger and the enslaved Oic halian wom en the specific points of conflict between these two ways of life are made manifest. Upon learning of Herakles' foreign victory, Deianei ra can only express amazement that he should have been away for such an incomprehensibly long period.35 At ll. 242-3, 298-313, 329-31 Deianeira expresses sympathy for the harsh fate that has befallen the forei gn women, and especia lly Iole, while 29 542. 30 31-5. 31 Eurystheo s is left unname d by Deian eira: 35. 32 18-23, 38 -40, 74-5, 181 -3, 240-9 0, 105 8-61, 10 89-1100. 33 Segal (19 77), 100.

Lichas, on the other hand, presents t he women simply as trophies of war.37 The truth, as revealed by the messenger, that it w as on account of Eros, and Iole's beauty that He rakles undertook the deeds which destroyed these Oichalians' lives, is far more shocking to Deianeira.38 In light of such exchanges, then, the oikos and its potential opponents may be regarded as elementary to the understanding of the play.39 After struggling with the threat that Herakles' erotic affliction and the nubile Iole herself pose to her marita l security, Deianeir a resolves to solve the conundrum with the aid of the love charm she had concealed in the house many years earlier. In a recent study on the motivations behind Deianeira's tentative decision at this point, Faraone has posited that ancient uses of 'love' spells may more accurately be classified as either erotic or dynastic in their ultimate intent.40 Deianeir a's greatest fear, he argues, is of being replac ed as Herakles' primary wife, and the legitimate keeper of his oikos . That is to say , hers is a d ynastic concern.41 To this end he cites Deianeira's history of calmly accepting her husband's erotic exploits as evidenc e against a simple case of erotic 36 295, tran sl.

Farao ne offers the following definition for his u se of the term 'dynasti c': \"... the broa d range of oyed in the 'politica l' comp etition among subordinates for the favour of a single m ale, be he a king...o r simply a Gree k husband in his oikos.\" Farao ne (199 4a), n. 26. 152jealousy.42 Such an int erpretation, howev er, ignores the prominent roles played by both Aphrodite and Eros in the play.43 Deianeira makes clear that Herakles, she herself, and even the gods are slaves to Eros,44 and it is to Aphrodite that the chorus a scribes blame when Deianeira's error becomes apparent.45 That erotic jealousy is involved is made quite explicit in Deiane ira's st atement to the chorus s hortly after she discovers Iole's identity, and her signific ance to Herakles: '...So this is why I fear that while Herakles may be calle d my husband ( \u0087\u0086\u0099\u008cP\u0005 ) / he may be called the man ( HQ\u0084O\u0099\u0088) of the younger woman.46 Her fear here is clearly prompted by sexual jealousy rather than dynastic displacement, as her position as Hera kles' legitimate wife and the lead ing woman of the household is not at issue.47 By categorising attraction spells as either erotic or dynas tic in purpose, Faraone risks creating artificial dis tinctions, especia lly where spells upon spouses are concerned. For it is clear that De ianeira's concern s pans both of these 42 459-6 3, 536 -55. -3, chas concurs: 48 8-9. 45 860-1. 46 550-1. 47 Such a re ading finds support in Easte rling (19 82) on lines 5 50-1; Cha rles ua, 'Heroism, Heracle Trachiniae,' Traditio 36 (1980 ), 44; Segal (19 77), 107, 114. 153categories,48 and the same is arguably true of the other examples from literature of women placing attr action spells upon their husbands.49 After recounting the story of how s he acquir ed the charm from Nessos, Deianeira turns to the young wom en of the chorus seeking guidanc e on the critical decision whether to utilis e it. Her plea to the Trachinian women at ll. 582-7 is clearly fr amed as a question of morality.50 In keeping wit h audienc e expectation of a respectable citizen's wife, Deianeira is careful to guard her good reputation, and to distance herself from the kind of women wit h whom she normally asso ciates such 'terrible bold deeds'.51 Stealthy, destructive scheming by women constitutes a recurring motif in various genres of ancient literature.52 As argued above, Deianeira's poisoning of Herakles was probably straightforward and intentional, rather than covert, in pre-Sophoklean accounts. The allusion here both underscores the partial rehabili tation of the 'husband-slay ing' Deianeira's character, and prefigures the murderous role that she is destined, nonetheless, to perform. 48 Deianei ra is aware that the livelihood of Hyllos an d herself depe 1188b30-38; Mor. 256 c. 50 Davies (199 1), p. 581. 51 582, my transl.

There is clearly a distinction to be made here betwe en the standard of morality to be publicly upheld, and the type of approval being sought from the chorus of women. That a double standard of morality i s being obs erved is suggested elsewhere in the text, t wice by Deianeira hers elf. Upon discovering that Lichas has omitted fr om the account of Herakles' s acking of Oichalia the truth of her husband's new lov e, the chorus aims a righteous curse at the aut hors of such deception: 'A curse upon not all bad people, but / specifically he who furtively practises evils unseemly for him!'56 Deianeira's admonition of the herald for his evasivenes s comes somewhat later, and in signi ficantly different terms: 53 Due to unresolvable difficu lties with the dating of the Trachiniai, it is not po ssible to know which o f the two plays wa s perform ed first, alth ough schola rs tend to favour an earlie r date fo r Sopho kles' play than 55 Eur., Hipp. 507-1 5. 383-4.

An ironic c ontrast is developed betw een Deianeira's word s to the chorus here, and her lengthy address to Lichas earlier at ll. 436-69.59 It is evident that Deaineira seeks not full moral clearance for her act, but the complicity of a far more exclusive group of peers. Following F araone's mode of analysis, H. S. Versnel fin ds a strong link between secretive uses of magic and the agonistic nature of Greek society.60 In a society where one's status is established in relation to one's social, political and professional rivals, he argues, honour could be garnered by two distinct means. Wily tricks of an Odyssean nature could 57 468-9. 58 Davies (199 1) on line s 468-9. 59 Easterlin g (1982) o n lines 596-7. 60 Farao ne (1 991), 3-32; Versnel (199 1), 60-106. 156be employ ed, and further enhanc ed by means of judicious boasting.61 In addition, methods which were not mora lly or socially sanctioned could be silently em ployed. Versnel ident ifies magic and cursing among these 'unboastable' actions against rivals.62 Anthrop ologists of r ural Greece and the Mediterranean region attest to the longevity of competitive, amoral values, and the continuing role of covert magic i n these present day societies.63 Faraone makes the important point that the secrecy associated with ancient competitiv e curses does not automatically indicate that such acts were shamef ul, but could simply be defensiv e, to minimise the risk of counte r-magic by the intended victim.64 Both Faraone and Versnel also note that co vert magical operations may have been viewed as a rare opportunity for disempowered individuals to obtain justice.65 Nonetheless, actions taken in silenc e maintained an ambivalent position in ancient Greek thought. This ambivalence gives way to negativity when applied more strictly to t he female 'race', as it does in the Trachiniai . 61 Odysseu s' use of sile nce and de ception is highly cel ebrate d in epi c poetry an d archai c literature, but by the fifth century this he roic figure is a far more e quivocal charact considerable cratic stance of Theo gnis n above, but is co nsidered dish onou rable by many fifth century source s.

Firstly, it must be conceded that due to their permanent presence onstage the silenc e of the chorus must, by convention, be w on in order for antagonists' plans to be carried out. In plays where choruses consist of mal e figures, silence is usually ens ured by having another char acter order them to depart at the critical moment.69 In the case of female choruses, though, knowing silenc e is more often sought instead. Monti glio further notes that i n almost all of the latter cases, it is a female character who seeks such promises of secrecy from her female peers.70 Thus Deianeira's request 66 Zeitlin see s the depl oyme nt of plot (in bot h the 'intrig ue' and ' story line' sen ses of the word) a s an instance of ex ploratio n of 'the fe minine ' in the dram atic form: Zeitlin (1996 b), 357ff. cf.

Montiglio (20 00), p. 253. 158of the chorus at ll. 596-7 is consis tent with a prominent pattern of all- female conspiracies of silence. The chorus engages intimately with Deianeir a regarding her intended use of Nessos' love charm at ll. 588-9 and 592-3, but ambiguities in their language here have led to divergent r eadings as to their precise stance.71 While Deianeira frames her query about t he plan in terms of its morality, it is to the issue of effica cy that the chorus turns in their response. Despite their youth and apparent naivete,72 these women carefully weigh up the relative values of Nessos' advice, Deianeira' s own faith and the knowledge that only exper imentation can provide. The repetition of variants of K\u0086RL\u0099\u008a at ll. 586, 589 and 592 highlights this interplay of shades of thinking, seeming and judging in the dialogue of ll. 582-94.73 Some scholars find in the chorus' words a note of warning74 or caution75 against the use of the m ysterious love charm, although as Lloyd-Jones and Wilson point out, this warning could easily have been made more emphatic, if this is t he sense Sophokles intended.76 The ancient scholia AJP 106 (19 85), 490-6; W. B. Burton, The Chorus in Sopho cles' Trage dies (Oxford, 1980 19 90), p. 163; Dav ies (1 991) on line 592; East erling (1982) on line 58 2-93. 72 The naivete of the cho rus is perhap s over-played by Winni ngton -Ingra m (1980), p. 79. 73 Easterlin g (1982) o n line 5 90. 74 Solmsen (19 85), 491. 75 Easterlin g (1982) o n line 5 82; L.

Solmse n, too, con cedes thi s point: Solm sen (198 5), 495. 159are similarly divided on the nat ure of the chorus' advic e here,77 and indeed the ambiguity may be intentional. While scholars both ancient and moder n have disputed the meaning of the chorus' words, Deianeira is clear ly consoled by their exchange, for she resolves at ll. 594-7 to us e the anointed robe, and quickly and unwaveringly requests secrecy of the c horus. Interrupted as they are by the arrival of the herald, the chorus give no further indication of their supposed disapproval. In a si milar predicament in the Medeia , the chorus do not break their vow of secrecy,78 yet are very vocal in their disapproval of her murderous scheme.79 On the contrary, the chorus of Trachinian women sing in hopeful praise of the spell coming to frui tion in the second antistrophe of the second stasimon, ll. 655-62. In the dialogue that follows Deianeira expre sses grave fears about the nature of the love charm, and the chorus lends suppor t to her earlier decision to use the substance.80 In the chorus' willing collus ion with Deianeira, and certai nly in the heroine's words at ll. 596-781 one can see a clear expres sion of the popular motif of women's inborn penchant for scheming and deception. Euripides in particular favours thi s theme, and has both female and male characters testify to its truth in his Hippo lytos, Iphigeneia in Tauris ch orus pledge s secre cy without kn owing fully what Medeia in tends: Eur., Med. Med. 811-13 818. 80 Trach . 665, 668, 723 -4. 81 See p. 156 a bove. 160Androm ache and Medeia .82 Plato too gives explic it voice to this received idea in his Laws : '...the female race, tha t part of hu manity which is much more stealthy ( zH\u0089\u0088HP\u0086\u0099\u008dL\u0088\u0086\u0084 ) and cunning (LQ\u0087PRz\u0086\u0087\u008a \u0099\u008dL\u0088\u0086\u0084 ) by on account of its weakness ...'83 Themes of deception, secrecy and conc ealm ent run richly throughout the play, even as Deianeir a is being c haracterised as a faithful wife to Herakles. Throughout the Trachiniai Deianeira is characterised as duly occupying her pr oper space, the oikos .84 Her only self-conscious traversing of this threshold occur s at l. 531ff, where she shares her most recent feelings about Iole, and her thoughts on Nessos' love spell, with the chorus members. Her efforts to justify this encroachment upon the threshold of public space indicate t hat even this is anomalous behaviour for her. As discussed above, this exchange between De ianeira and the chorus is quite secretive and exc lusive in nat ure, and so should be distinguished from tr uly public int erruptions such as those of Clytemnestra or Medeia.85 Indeed, even her most momentous deed - the 82 Eur., Hipp. 480-1 (Phaid Laws 781a. Ann L. T. Bergren fi nds that fema le spe ech through out the Gree k tradition swin gs at will bet ween truth an d falsity: 'Languag e and th e female in e arly Gree k thou ght', Arethusa 16 (198 Foley (199 1b), 157-9 85 Clytemnest ra cho oses h er own p artner in favour of her hu sband, a nd uses the wealth from Agame mnon's oikos to con solidate her o wn power in Ae sch., Ag., and Medeia forms h er own political alli ances, an d steps b eyond t he feminine (and ind eed h uman) sphere as something of a deus ex m achina at the en d of Eur., Med. 161giving of the anointed robe to He rakles at ll. 598-812 - is enacted indirectly, with Lichas unwittingly play ing the part of her intermediary. These two public engagements, su ch as they are, and their consequences are consistent with patte rns of female transgression in much ancient drama, where female action in the public sphere functions overwhelmingly as a catalyst for change, or a source of (usually destructive) conflict.86 So much for the destructive resu lts of Deiane ira's rare public interruptions. It is, however, in the solitude of the marital oikos which she keeps for the absent Herakles that the destructive plan is brought into being. Unlike Phaidra in the Hippolytos, Deianeira is not persuaded by another to use magical m eans to achieve the desired union. Irresolute and lacking initiative though she may appear to moder n commentators,87 Deianeira demonstrates considerab le forethought concerning Ness os' love charm and her marriage to Herakles. She herself relates that she remembered and carried out all of the c entaur's instructions for the potion when she encountered him as the young bride of the hero.88 The narrative of this event is highly embellished, emphasising Deianeira' s care to ma ke the spell effective.89 Her calculation and composure on this occasion ar e striking, and lend an enigm atic and troubling richness to an 86 M. Shaw, 'The female intruder : women i n fifth-centu ry drama', CPhi l. 70 6; Froma I.

This same quiet resolve and initiativ e is to be found in her pres ent-time behaviour, for even before she seeks the chorus' approval Deianeir a has already applied the substance to Herakles' robe.90 Thus it is that the deadly potion is propelled into action by Deianeir a (and the passions that drive her91) from the solitude of the oikos . The privacy, and arguably the femininity, of this operation are underscored by the text, in Deianeir a's narration: '...(he told) me to keep the MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084 away from fire , always untouched by warm ray, in the inmost chamber (LQ\u0084 \u0081\u008bJ\u0086P \u0005 ), until such time as I apply it, new ly rubbed, onto something.

A su ggestion of this pre meditati on and p reparation may al so be d etecte d in Deianeira' s word s to Lich as at 492 -5. cf. Easterlin g (1982) o n lines 492-5. 91 Eros (444 ) and the Persu asion of Ne ssos (710), and over and ab ove them both s (1278). 92 Soph., Trach femininity93 of Deianeira's domain.94 Rather than being a creative space, and a symbol of familial unity, this oikos nurtures the destructive agent of Nessos' vengeance in its private confines. Thus Deianeira is both a creative and destructive symbol of the home. Herakles, too, stands as a di vided sy mbol of culture and society in this play in his near-desertion of his own oikos , and the fact that his own basic passions and the bestial forces with which he does battle work to alienate him from the very culture which he protects and epitomise s through his civilis ing L abours.95 Dependent as she must be upon her husband for her continued livelihood, Deianeira responds to Herakles' perversion of his fated, beneficial absenteeis m with an inversion of her own proper domestic role. With this secretive perversion of her prescribed nurturing role, Deianeira reflects anxieties felt by masculin e society regarding the status and functions of women in Greek mari tal relations . In observance of fifth- century ideals of feminine behav iour, Deianeira's life and death are both played out in silence, at least as far as public speech is concerned.96 A corollary of esteemed female silence, though, is its proximity to secretive 93 On the con ceptual align ment of the inte riors of hou ses and wome n see Ruth 'Makin g Spa ce Speak', Winkler and Zeitlin 336-6 5, esp. 344; Ruth Pa del, 'Wome n: model for po ssession by Gre ek daemon s' in Came ron and Kuhrt (1 983), 3-1 9, esp. 8; Goul d (1980 ), 48, n . 72; Susan Walker, 'Women and Housing in Classical Gree ce: the a rchaeological evidence' in Came 3), 81-91.

The duplic ity inherent in silence is succinctly conveyed by Deianeira's own behavi our. Disapproving as she is of secrecy,97 Deianeira conceals Nes sos' poisoned blood,98 plans to act under cover of darkness,99 covertly addresses the chorus,100 secretly anoints Her akles' robe,101 and watches, hidden, while Hy llos prepares a litter for Herakles,102 before killing h erself, alone in their marriage bed .103 Deianeira's own weighty silence is echoed elsewhere by those of the artful Kypris,104 and also Herakles, on the subject of his love for Iole.105 These destructive silences lie in star k contrast to two poigna nt silences exec uted by Iole and Deianeira in turn . Iole is silent throughout the period she spends ons tage (ll. 225-334) . Prompted by Deianeira's sympathetic and humane attention to her individual plight, Lichas disclos es that Iole has not in fact spoken since being taken from her native land.106 Iole's silent dread and la mentation echo Deianeira's behaviour before her own marriage to He rakles.

Deianeira's innocence and piteousness ( LQzLP\u0084\u0086\u0099\u0084 ) are reiterated in a subsequent choral ly ric, where she is likened to a calf bereft of its mother ( \u0087\u0086\u0099\u0088\u008dP \u0005 LQ\u0088O\u0099\u0081H ).108 Like e when Hy llos recounts how Herakles succumbed to her anointed robe, then curses her and calls the Erinyes down upon her for her role in his downfall.109 This sile nce too, is made emphatic in the stage acti on, particularly by the exas perated words of the chorus: 'Why do you creep away, silent? Don't you know that / by being silent you second the accuser?'110 Such silenc es could never be constr ued as neutral in the context of ancient Athenian soc iety, which es tablished strong connections between the power of speech, civic identity and power.111 These two instanc es of complete refusal to speak may best be interpreted as mute protests against the twists of fate faced by t hese women. Iole's silenc e is the protest of the powerless against a syst em that makes w omen objects for 107 Iole's bea uty destroys he r life: 463-7; a y outhful Dei aneira fea rs that her own bea uty will cause her suffering: 24-5. 108 Deian eira describe s aneira in rms: 52 749-8 20. 110 813-4. 111 On the manif old (often ne gative or dang erous) uses o f silence in Greek society see Montiglio (20 00).

Upon learning the (relatively) benevolent intent of Deianeira's potion, Hyllos defends his mother from th e dishonour that her own silent departure invited, in his address to Herakles: 'For things stand thus (with De ianeira) that si not be fittin \u0084 112 who give s meanin g to Iole's silence, as she pon ders the vacillati ons of fate, and the forme r lives of the enslave d women: 24 2-3, 293-3 21. 113 Segal (19 77), 125; cf. p. 1 55-56 above. 114 Having first i ntrodu ced the enslave d Oichalian s as the prop er and fine spoil s of war (244-5), Lich as sho ws compassio n for Iole (322 Soph., Ant. 1244-5, Oed.

Female uses of silence in literat ure and philosophy are dom inated by these two disquieting themes, which can in turn be read as a revelation of masculine anxiety wit h respect to women's action. The response to this anxiety was, ironically , to prescribe silenc e for women.121 Deianeira is largely exculpated from blame in Sophok les' of the several myths synthesised in the Trachiniai . Within the tex t this exoneration is carried by the words of both Hyllos and the chorus, who each refer to the innocence of her in tent. In an impa ssioned defence of Deianeira (whose maternity he had earlier rejected) before Herakles, Hyllos explains: 'I have come to tell you about my mother - in what condit ion she is now / and how she erred completely.'122 This sentiment is undersco red by reiteration: 'She erred thoroughly in the matter , with the best of intentions.'123 121 Montiglio (2 000), pp. 290 -1. 122 1122-3. 1136. 168In an effort to assuage their mistre ss' fears about al ready implemented love charm, the chorus had earlier advised Deianeira: '(But) concerning thos e who are tr ipped up not of their own doing, wrath is softened, and you should benefit from this.'124 The legal underpinnings of such defence pleas are made explic it in Hyllos' initial condem nation of Deianeir a in the final mom ents of her life, and the chorus' subsequent comments: Hyllos : '...You are convicted, mother, of making these plots against my father, / and carryi ng them out, for which may both avenging Justice / and Erinys punish you. And if it is just, I curse you. / And it is just, sinc e you have shown what is right to me ...' Chorus : '...Don't you know that / by being silent you second the accuser?'125 The use here of legal terminology sets Deianeira up as a defendant at her own (largely posthumous) trial.126 It is the chorus, in a mournful ode, who divide responsib ility for the h ouse Nessos, Deianeira, Herakles for his siege of Oichalia, and moving behind all these 124 727-8. Both Kamerb eek and Faraon e simil ar (and succe ssful) defen ce made in a l ate classical la wsuit involving acci dental p oisoning with a love philtre: Kamerbee k (1959), 233; Faraon e (1994 a), 11 8 and n. 22. 125 807-1 0, 813 -4. 126 Easterlin g (1982) o n lines 807-8, 814. 169figures towards the ful filment of the fateful prophecy - Aphrodite.127 Deianeira's acquittal on the basis of innocent intention is supported by Athenian law, which observes a distinction between planning and implementing misdeeds.128 The Aristotelian Magna Moralia preserves a paralle l case of an accidental (or so it is claimed) killing with a love potion. The acquittal of this defendant on t he basis of her harmless intent indicates that innocenc e of planning could ev en overrule one's guilt at killing anot her person.129 That this recorded ac quittal is intrinsically linked with an admission of having used magi c reminds us that Greek law did not rule against the use of (let alone define) magic per se . Where alleged users of magic did rec eive a legal sent ence, it was usually under the laws governing impiety ( HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH).130 127 821-6 1. 128 This di stincti lannin g (I\u0086\u008b\u0099zL\u008b\u008cP\u0005 ) and cf (=[A rist.] 1188b3 0-38).

It was suggested in Chapter One t hat magic was overwhelmingly characterised as a set of privat ely exercised, self-seeking and unsanctioned ritual practices in the literature of the classical period.1 Chapter Three examined how activities whic h were necessarily private, such as domestic cookery and women's medicine, were marginalised and perceived as closely akin to magic. The notion of cookery in particular was believ ed to lend itself to magi cal subv ersion in a context of evil ambition.2 In the previous chapter it wa s demonstrated that Deianeira's decision to use a love philtre on Hera kles - certainly for personal gain - revolved around her ability to ensure the collusion of the chorus and to carry out the procedure undetected.3 The private, secret actions of Deia neira and the destruction they wrought are held up to public scrutiny in the closing s cenes of the Trachiniai . At this point in the drama, the dialog ue assumes a form reminiscent of the language of criminal tri als.4 The woman is defended by her own son, Hyllos, who affirms that although De ianeira did kill her husband, she 1 Chapte r one, pp. 34-35. 2 See Chapte r three. 3 Deian eira admonishe s the herald fo r his own furtive wrong doing (Trach. 383-4, 4 68-9), but then beg s the cho rus to conceal h er own pl ans from public vie w and sh ame (596-7).

Sealey, Wom en and Law Classical G reece (Chapel Hill: 1990 ), 48-9. 171acted with innocent intent.5 This invites speculation as to how magic was dealt with in the reality of Athenian law. Thus far, this thesis has concer ned itself primarily with lit erary and mythologic al explorations of the use of magic. The present chapter aims to elucidate whether and how the formal, legal mechanisms of the Athenian polis construed and policed magic. The purpose of this endeavour is not to reconstruct social behav iour - degrees and extents of obedience and deviance among the populat ion - from the evidence of law. Law, being conc erned with the ex ceptional and difficult aspects of social life, rather than with t he ordinary, does not permi t such extrapolation.6 As such, laws cannot simply be equated with norms, and used as a basis for ascertaining popular sentiments.7 Laws are, rather, strategies for dealing with difficult pr oblems. As such, a logical line of questioning is exactly whose strategies does Athenian law implement?8 The modern western ideal of law, according to Lin Foxhall's formulation, is that it should gover n people's behavi our, and that it should serv e as an impartial standard against wh ich norms are established.9 However it may be disputed whether or not the Athenian courts were primarily concerned with jurisprudence - the implem entation of justice in its highest 5 See previou s chapte r, pp. 166-69. 6 L.

The present chapter will a pproach the question of whether this ideal is in fact applicable to Athenian law, and will attempt to identify other functions which Athenian la w may have fulfilled. In the Greek language, at least, laws are equated with norms. The term \u0084\u0086\u0099\u0081\u0086\u0005 in fact i ncorporates a range of ideas, stretching from the strictly legal senses of 'law' or 'ordi nance' to the more informal 'custom' or 'usage '.10 Martin Ostwald theorises that this pairing of the ideas of 'law' and 'custom' was a conscious political tactic on the part of the architects of the Athenian radical democracy.11 The equation of these two notions served to underscore the normative pot ential of law. The mores of the KO \u0081\u0086\u0005 from which jurors w ere selected of course played a critical role in dictating outcomes of trials in democratic Athens. However, in the present chapter I hope to draw att ention to other im portant factors - factors embedded within Athenian social and political p rocesses - which influenc ed the perception of sorcerers and sorceresses in legal cont exts. The subject of inquiry of this chapter is Athenian law, not Greek law more generally. This narrow line of inquiry is dictated, in part, by the availability of evidence. Athens is the source of virtually all literary evidence for Greek legislative processes, and of much of the papyrological12 and 10 As per the le xicon of Lidd ell, Scott and Jon es rding to Ostwald, Kleisthen es intro n ew denotation for legal statu tes.

There are undeniable similarities between the laws of Athens and thos e of other Greek ci ty-states.14 Howev er, the fact that in Greek st ates laws had an organic relationship with their social and political contexts15 means that practical differences between times and places will have been considerable.16 The presen t chapter will commence with a survey and examination of the surviving evidence for magic in a legal context. Our knowledge of classical legal procedures is heav ily based upon orators' speeches for either defence or prosecution, wh ich introduc e unique interpretative issues.17 I will then move on to the structure of the Athenian lega l system, an d its implications for the construction of ma gic users and purveyors as threats to law and order. Unlike Rome, Athens seems to have had no specific legislation against the deploy ment of magic.18 In light of this c ontrast Fritz Graf has suggested that the democratic polis was comparatively lenient on the 13 IJG com plies spe cifically j uridical texts.

Howev er, Mar garetha Debrunner Hall has s hown that in reality Athenian punishments were in gene ral no more or less humane than those of other contem porary Greek city-states.23 Perhaps, though, the emphasis placed upon Plato's care fully and specifically worded legislation, and the Atheni ans' own assertions distract us from the positive evidence that exists for legal restrictions against the use of magic in the classical period, at Athens and elsewhere in the Greek world.24 19 Fritz Graf, Magic in the An cient World , transl.

A late piece of evidence from Aelian s upports the thesis that the Areopagos was called upon to try cases of murder by magical MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH often enough to have set procedures. Aelian records that, contrary to 'normal' practice, a convicted MH\u0088\u0081HRP\u0099\u0005 was given a stay of exec ution until after the birth of t he child she was carrying at the time.32 On the other hand, Gordon point s out t hat in practical terms it would be difficult to apply this law. The proble m lies in the fact that the prosecution must persuade the jury of the murderous or malicio us intentions of the accused.33 This is bec ause Athens' homicide laws were among its oldest,34 and retained the Drakonian emphasis upon intention, as opposed to the later focus upon evidence of damage done.35 Thus it is that the Ari stoteli an author of the Ethika Megala recount s a case in which a woman who gave a man a MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084 , which proved to be fatal 30 Dickie (2 001), p. 55; Collins (2 001), 487; Gord on (1 999), 24 8-9. 31 On the plagu e see T huk. 2 .48.2.

Where a person was suspected or a ccused of a magical attack which amounted to less than murder, but ra ther damage to another person or their property, a damages charge ( IzH\u0099IO\u0005 KP\u0099RO ) may have been brought ins tead.38 In The shape of Athenian law , Todd attests to the remarkable flexibility of this charge,39 which could be implem ented in cases of breach of contract,40 unusual material damage such as flooding of land,41 as well as more ill-defined forms of damage.42 Indeed, Todd suggests that the charge of IzH\u0099IO\u0005 was especia lly useful in cases where ill-defin ed or non-material dama ge or loss was bein g alleged, making it particularly relev ant to accusations o f magical similar story, in which Areth aphila trie s to poison Ni kokrates , the tyra nt of Cyrene.

T hat thi s charge constituted a very real threat to those who practised with MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH is perhaps indicated by a hostile stat ement i n the Hippokratic On the sacred disease , that magical healers often re frained from prescribing any MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH or baths, lest they be held to account in the event their patient died.44 Like a charge of de liberate murder, though, a IzH\u0099IO\u0005 KP\u0099RO would theoretically have been difficult to win, with the onus being on the prosec ution to provide evidenc e or persuade the KPRH\u008c\u008dHP\u0099 of the strength of their case.45 The absence of any evidence or witnesses in Antiphon's speech Agains t the stepm other may bear testimony to the di fficulty with whic h cases of murder or damage by magical means could be prosecuted effectively.46 On the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that, as difficult as a charge of damage by sorcery was to prove, an accusation invoked substantial fear in the accused. A sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone at Knidos provides us with two Hellenistic e xamples of RH\u008dH\u0099KL\u008c\u0081\u0086P ,47 issued by women who have been accused of 44 Hipp., OTSD 2; cf.

One stands accused by a man of administering MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH to her husband. It is cl ear that the woman has become estranged from her husband on account of the allegations of this third party.48 The second wo man stands accused of giving a MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084 to a certain Asklapiadas, or of hiring a (wise- )woman to do so.49 Both publis h self-imprecatory statements as a weak strategy to prove their innocence.50 Desperation is implicit in the actions taken by these women, who apparently lacked the means and influence to ensure that they escaped conv iction by formal means.51 It would seem that whether a person accused of us ing malicious sorcery was convicted or not depended upon other factors besides solid ev idence. For instance the relative status of the two litigant s often proved to be relevant to the outcome of a trial, as did various forms of stereotyping. Before returning to this point, we shall first complete our survey of possible avenues for the pursuit of magic in the Athenian legal system. The case of Theoris of Lemnos is critical for any discussion of the treatment of magic under classic al Atheni an law. The earliest account of the successful prosecution and execution of this woman, is preserved in Demosthenes' speech Against Aristogeiton .52 The prosecution asserts that Theoris, a Lemnian woman, was convicted for the crime of being a 48 DT no. 4a = I.

This is our only ancient evidence that it was a criminal offence to simply be a sorceress, and there are reasons for doubting the veracity of the statement. If, for instance, Theoris really was put to death because she was a MH\u0088\u0081HRP\u0099\u0005 , then Eunomos, the m an who then took up her business, along with the many ritual practitioners of whom Hippokrates, Plato and others speak s hould logic ally fear for their own lives at Athens. However the ancient s ources rather indicate that ri tual healing procedures and minor ity religious observances53 flourished from the eighth century world of Homeric epic through to the fourth century and beyond, apparently unimpeded by criticisms from t he intellectuals of the classical period.54 In a study of socio-relig ious sanctions on magic in Greece and Rome, C. R. Phillips III remarks upon the frequency of unsanctioned activity in the source s, and the infrequenc y of legal action taken against such activity. He finds , as a result, that where offenders are prosecuted, special (often political) circumstances rather than societal revulsion were frequently involved.55 We shall return to this suggestion later in this chapter.56 52 Dem., Against Aristogeiton 25.77-9.

The principal reason for the author to in clude details about Theoris is to blacken the names of both Arist ogeiton and his brother Eunomos by virtue of their association with her . Aristogeiton, the De mosthenic writer tells us, is a state-debtor and a convicted sycophant59 who now faces the death penalty. In an e ffort to have the complicatin g testimony of Eunomos disregarded, the prosecut ion constructs a detailed and unsavoury profile of the man and his past. It is claimed that Eunomos acquired T heoris' store \u0005 LQ\u0087\u008a\u0012KH\u0099\u0005\u0019\u0013) was put to death with her entir e family, and that he professes to cure epileptics by means of charms and tricks ( \u0081HNNH\u0084L\u008b\u0099LP RHP ML\u0084HRP\u0099aLP\u0019\u0014), despite being sufferer of epilepsy himself. The speaker is thus describ ing Eunomos in sim ilar terms to the charlatans whom the author of On the sacred disease identifies and derides. This would indicate that elite arguments against such practices were well-established and developed ac ross an array of literary genres. It also suggests that negative stereotypes about traditional healer s were 57 Todd (1 993), pp. 54-5. 58 Thoma s (1989); Colli ns (2001 ), 477. 59 See Dem. 25 .38 for Aristo geiton' s past conviction for sykop hancy.

As a result it is difficu lt to determine from this single hostile source whether or not Eunomos is genuinely a practitioner of religious, traditional or magical healing. What is clear is that the prosecution includes this detail along with other 'dirt', in an attemp t to discredit the man's moral character.62 The idea conveyed by the orator is that if Theoris was a sorceress and was put to death for it, then Eunomos , who follows in her footsteps, is equally execrable and does not deserve the jury's attention. Later sources for Theoris provide inconsistent corroborati on of the Demosthenic version of events. A f ourth century source, the historian Philochoros, identifies Theoris as a seer ( \u0081H\u0099\u0084\u008dP \u0005), and recounts that she was executed, along with her family, after being found guilty of HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH .63 This source assumes hitherto unknown details - that Theoris was a \u0081H\u0099\u0084\u008dP \u0005, and that the charge laid against her was one of HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH . Collins suggests t hat Philochoros, using Demosthenes as his source, inaccurately paraphrased the speech.64 Howev er, given Philoc horos' precision as to Theoris' social loc ation and the charge against her , it seems more appropriate to assume that the more or less contemporary historian had other sources at his disposal. Collins concedes that this is not improbable.65 62 Collin s (20 01), Collin s (20 01), 490. 183According to Plutarch, Theoris was priestess ( PL\u0099\u0088LPH ) was prosecuted by Demosthenes and executed for teaching slav es to deceive,66 which further complicates our pict ure of the trial. To account for this identification o f Theoris as a priestess, Collins h ypothesize s that Plutarch read the Demosthenic account and took it to be genuine, but that he then conflated the case of Theor is with that of a second executed woman, named Ninos.67 Ninos was a famous priestess, whom Demosthenes mentions several time s, and with whom Theoris was often compared.68 Such an error on Plutarch's part could account for the identification of Theoris as a prieste ss, although there is no indic ation in any of our sources for Ninos69 or for Theoris that either woman was accused of or charged with teaching sl aves to deceive. Collins ' theory must therefore be deemed unsatisfactory. Given that Plutarch's account of the charge against Theoris, and of the woman's location in society differ markedly from those found in the Demosthenic speech, we must accept the possib ility that the writer had another s ource at his dispo sal, perhaps one belonging to the same tradition followed by Philoc horos.70 It is conceivable that if, as Philo choros asserts, Theoris was a \u0081H\u0099\u0084\u008dP\u0005 of some kind, Plutarch c onfused (or oversimplified) the matter and substituted the title of one kind of ritual figure - \u0081H\u0099\u0084\u008dP\u0005 - for another - PL\u0099\u0088LPH . These two roles are not, of course, 65 Ibid. n. 87. 66 Plut., Dem . 14.4. 67 Collin s (20 01), 491-2. 68 Nino s in De m. 19.281, 39 .2, 40.9.

A prieste ss was usually formally appointed, and she performed specific duties for particular temples in fixed locations. A seer, on the other hand, c ould be an itinerant figure,71 but could also have a more secure location and role in soci ety. This ambiguity in the social location and religious functions of t he seer, and 'sacred' persons more generally, along with Roman cultural in fluences, may explain Plut arch's identification of Theor is as a priestess. The source of Plutarch's assertion that Theoris was guilt y of teaching slaves to deceive is more difficult to understand, unless it is based upon an interpretation of the Demostheni c account . In the speech the prosecution explains that Eunomos, himself in bondage to the state of Athens, obtained MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH and LQ\u0087\u008a\u0012KH\u0099P from Theoris through the agency of the exec uted woman's maidservant. On the basis of this text Plutarch ma y have concluded that Theoris was guilty of teaching her own and perhaps other slaves to deceive by magical means.72 Versnel accepts and attempts to combine both versions of the case, finding that Theoris was a priestess who was charged with both practising magic and teaching slaves to deceive.73 As has already been pointed out , though, the Demostheni c prosec ution was primarily concerned with discrediti ng the testimony of Eunomos. As such, it probably only mentioned Theoris' maid servant in order to link the man 71 Collin s (20 01), 491. 72 Collin s (20 01), 492. cf. L.

While accounts of the charges laid against Theoris vary greatly between our sources, Philochoros' assertion that Theoris was executed on a count of HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH is particular ly compelling. Unlike Demosthen es' version of her crime, HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH is a recognis ed charge in Athenian law.75 The punishment to which the woman was subjected - exec ution - is also consistent wit h the punishment meted out to those found guilty of extreme or socially inflammatory crimes of impiety.76 By virtue of its hazy definit ion and the deat h penalty which it attracted, the charge of HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH was also a useful way of disposing of politic al or personal rivals.77 Since one source asserts that Ninos, too, w as found guilty of concocting love-philtres for use on young men,78 we shall devote some space to her in the present discussion. This wo man was exec uted in the mid-fourth century B.C.E. for deeds in connecti on with her participation in Bacchic rites - an activity whic h was already associated with \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P by the 73 H.

It is unclear whether Ninos was found guilty of conduc ting initiations into the foreign cult of Sabazios80 or of mocking the mysteries.81 Both c rimes would fall under the larger rubric of HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH , although only Josephus is explic it on this point. A further va riation is the suggestion that Ninos was involv ed with the manufacture of love potions. This claim comes from a single ancient commentator, whos e source and accuracy cannot be verified.82 However, the apparent conf lict between the charges laid against Ninos, in the various source s, are less glaring than would first appear. For as Versnel points out, prophets and professionals of foreign cults were commonly associated wit h sorcery throughout classical antiquity.83 This association operates in tandem with the tendency to view all perceived magic as foreign.84 I would suggest, then, that as the leader of a foreign mystery cult , Ninos may have been particularly vulnerable to claims that she made ill icit use of ritual power - magic.

There is one final piec e of informati on at our disposal - a fable from Aesop85 - which is relevant to our discussi on of the charge of impiety as it relates to the use of magic. The fable tells of a female magician (N\u008b\u0084O \u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 ) who proclaim ed herself to be expert ( LQ\u0087\u008a\u0012KHP\u0099 ) and the calming ( RH\u008dH\u0099\u0089L\u008cP\u0005 ) of divine wrath, and profited greatly thereby. She was put to death for innovating in matters divine ( RHP\u0084\u0086\u0099\u008d\u0086\u0081LP\u0084 ) according to an early version of the fabl e, while a later recension identifies the charge against her as HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH .86 In support of the use of such a source, the earliest known collection of Aesopic fables was made near the end of the fourth century by t he Athenia n Demetrios of Phaleron, and Athenian elements have been detected in other parts of the older recension of the fables.87 Dickie points out that the use of certain Attic terms relevant to impious actions ,88 along with the references to the Athenian procedure against HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH ,89 in conjunction with the 85 Aesop, no. 1 12 Halm = 56 Hau srath = B.

On th is cha rge see furthe r Versnel (199 0), pp. 123ff. 188claims made by the woman90 all suggest that this fable belongs to the fourth century Demetrian collection.91 The fable does not elucidate exactly what it was th at this N\u008b\u0084O \u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 did to be accused of impiety. It cannot be concluded t hat it was the practi ce of magic in itself that drew the charge, and in fact this is most unlikely considering the apparent prevalenc e of such ritual prof essionals. It seems more likely that her use of magic to placat e the gods was considered impious because it was perceived to be som ehow innovative or non-traditional.92 While we c annot be absolutely c ertain, on the basis of the available evidenc e, of the crimes for which T heoris and Ninos were convicted and exec uted, HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH seems the most pr obable charge in both cases.93 If our sources seem lacking in consistency as to the precise offences of the two women, then it should be pointed ou t that Athenian law devoted scarce attention to the def ining of crimes , or tor ts. La ws were rather more concerned to dictate how a crime should be purs ued.94 While we do not have any documentation for the law about 90 By claiming to be able to calm the wrath of the gods Aesop' s N\u008b\u0084O bes as and as pokratic a uthor of On the Sacred Disease scorns tho se who profess supe rior knowledge of, and cont rol over, the g ods: Hipp., OTSD 1. 91 Dickie (2 001), p. 52. 92 As prop osed by Dicki e (20 01), p. 52.

Colli ns con cedes that a charge of HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH cannot b e ruled o ut entirely. Ninos f alls largely ou tside the scope of hi s discu ssion: Co llins (200 1), 489-91, 493. 189HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH , it has been suggested, by both Todd and MacDowell, that it probably resembled the law against \u008b\u0099I\u0088P\u0005 .95 This law, quoted by Demosthenes, declares that any entitled Atheni an may submit a N\u0088HMO\u0099 against anyone who treats another with \u008b\u0099I\u0088P\u0005 .96 Demosthenes quotes the text of the law at some length, yet at no point is an act of \u008b\u0099I\u0088P\u0005 actually defined. The law against impiety would thus be framed along the lines of: 'If somebody commits HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH , let (entitled per son/s) submit a N\u0088HMO\u0099 \u001a against him /her. David Cohen, in his ow n disc ussion of the repression of impiety, makes the point that this lack of definitions of crimes is a feature that Athens' legal system shared with most p re-modern statutory schemes.98 Plato under takes a careful and lengthy discussion of the varieties of and punishments for HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH in his Laws , and so one may be tempted to extrapolate Athenian legal def initions and practices from his writings. Saunders, however, warns against this methodology, arguing that we cannot confidently apply his definitions and procedures to Athenian legal reality in this instance. This is because most of the known historical c ases of impiety are concer ned wit h acts of religious impropriety that, it is feared, would endanger the wider community by arousing divine 94 MacDowell (1978 ), p. 199; Todd (19 93), p. 60. 95 MacDowell (1978 ), p. 199; Todd (19 93), p. 310. 96 Dem. 21.47. 97 This term refers to a particular legal action used to try those a ccused of committ ing publi c offences at Athen s. cf. Todd (19 93), p. 307 -10. 98 David Co hen, 'The pro secution of impie ty in 105 (198 8), 698. 190wrath and spite. The Platonic god s, on the other hand, are wholly righteous, and so according to Saunders, they would not punish an entire community for the disrespec tful actions of th e few.99 In a ctual fact, Plato states that those who em ploy the services of persons who specialise in impious rituals call down the wrat h of the gods upon themselves, and indirectly upon the whole city.100 This error notwithstanding, Saunders is correct to a ssert that P lato's main interest lies with improving pub lic morality through educ ational punishm ents, w hereas the Athenian city- state was more concerned about the need to allay div ine anger. In the absence of formal definitions, the validity of an accusation of HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH will have been at the discretion of the jurors, on the basis of their own sensibilities and assumptions as to the nature and meaning of the crime.101 Cultural assumptions were thus entrenched in the Athenian stat utory system. Aristotle ventures a definition for HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH . For this philosopher, impiety is: '...an offence concerning the gods or daimones or about the dead 99 Plato law is, con sequently, little concerned with offe nces against ritual, the rev ealing of mysterie s, or the intro duction of ne w god s, but is verbo se on the subje ct of he retical opinio ns about the existen ce and nature of the gods. His p rimary concern i s that such impiou s peo ple will pollute the thought s of others: Saunde rs (1996), 91-2. 100 Plato, Laws 910b 3-6. 101 For Co hen, ' definition s of offence s were simply those inherent in the coll ective consciousness of the com munity as ma nifested throu gh the 500 o r more jud ges who happ ened to be sitting on a particula r day to hear a p articul ar case': Cohen (198 8), 698. 191or the parents or the fatherland.'102 This well-known phrase is both remarkably broad and vague, and consistent with the wide range of cases known to have been pursued in the name of impiety. A further di scussion of t he precise definition comes to us through one of Plato's Sokr atic dialogues. When pressed by his companion, Euthyphro offers as a definition of HQ\u008cL\u0099 ILPH : 'that which is not pleas ing to the gods'103 which, as Sokrates points out, is unhelpf ully v ague. Such definitions, we may conjecture, went some wa y towards expressing popular understandings of impiety, which were perhaps rarely articulated. The absence of firm definition for a relig ious crime such as impiety is justifiable, given that Greek re ligion (and indeed scienc e) was governed by no central authority.104 In such a society, what is true or untrue of the gods and of the world necessarily remains unfixed, and subject to the influenc es of the 'highest political instances', to adopt Gordon's phrasing.105 True to its vague terminology, the HQ\u008cL\u0099 ILPH law was successfully applied to such divers e offences as the maltreatment of 102 Arist., Virt.

We h ave already noted that Athenian law was little concerned to def ine its own terms. Crimes such as \u008b\u0099I\u0088P\u0005 and HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH (and many others besides) were allowed to remai n undefined, to be interpreted by individual KPRH\u008c\u008dHP\u0099 . The Athenian legal system was instead concerned to prescribe and govern the ways that crimes w ere to be handled. Or to state the matter in different terms, it was overwhelmingly concerned with matters of procedure at the expense of matters of substance. Roman and modern legal systems, in contrast , both place matters of substance (one's rights, for instance) ahead of procedural concerns.111 To use the example of the previous section, an eligible member of the Athenian 106 Demo sthen es accu sed Midias of HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH after the man hit him when he was a J\u0086\u0088ON\u0086\u0099\u0005at the Dionysi a: Dem., Ag.

In this it contrasts Rom an law, and the mod ern legal sy stems which develo ped out of Ro man law. Wh ere a Roma n lawyer would look first to what o ne's ri ghts ('the rule s') woul d first disce rn what mean s of red ress were available to re ctify their perce ived grievan ce. Todd ade quately 193demos accusing other s of using magical MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH could charge them, variously, with murder, IzH\u0099IO (for damage, wilful or otherwise), or HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH , such was the degree of overlap between possible charges.112 Furthermore, the penalty faced by the accused, if found guilty , would be either compensation for damage, imprisonment or execut ion, depending on the sub-class of legal action chosen by the plaintiff, withi n each of the above charges.113 Taken in c onjunction with the lar gely un-codified natur e of Athenian legislation,114 this abundance and overlap of procedural law, and dearth of substantive law meant that it was (and is) i n fact difficult to discern what 'the law' was on any given issue.115 Where laws were in place to govern particular types of behaviour, t hey did not carry the binding force that modern laws do. Instead, they functioned as a form of evidence, to be introduc ed by orators as a tool for persuasion.116 Proof, in a court case, consisted of persuasion through performance, rather than rebuffs objections to this u nderstan ding of the shap e of Athenian la w: Todd (199 3), pp. 64-7. 112 There was demonstrable overlap b etween the charg es of HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH and PL\u0088\u0086\u008c\u008bzP\u0099H : Dem. 24.177, 22 .69, and se e David Cohen, Theft in Athenian La w (Muni ch, 19 83), ch. 3.

Criminal trials are best viewed as being part of a larger social proc ess, in which alliances and disputes were public ly expressed ( and perpetuated) by male community members. In a society that revolved around competition between indivi duals and groups for prestige, litigation was an arena in which relativ e reputations could be negotiated.121 It is quite plaus ible to say that conflicts coul d be and were created specifically so that they could be played out in t he agonistic context of the lawcourt.122 That is, legal procedur es were aimed at dispute perpetuation as often as 116 A.

In such a system, a trial is a contest between two parties, with the judg e or jury deciding who has a better ca se. In the contrasting inquis itorial system, the judge is more directly re sponsible for interrogating witnesses and discov ering the truth.126 With no true police force and a very circumscribed role for magistrates,127 most legal actions were privately prosecuted.128 The system was thus extremely conducive to the playing out of personal, politic al129 or kin rivalries. 122 Foxhall (19 96), 137. 123 Todd (1 993), p. 153. 124 Foxhall (19 96), 133. 125 Isokrate s complain s of juries' bia s against elite litiga nts at 7.50-4.

Indeed, the auth or of Athenaion Pol . 196 Insofar as acceptable behaviour was negotiated and shaped through legal discourse, then, women had no active role to play in the establishm ent or enforcement of l aws in democratic Athens, although the norms expressed through laws were imposed upon them nonetheless.130 A woman's own legal interest s were represented through her kyrios . Laws conc erning marriage and adultery regarded women as property, rather than active parties to a misdeed.131 That said, Aristotle arguably oversimplifies women's legal dis ability somewhat by describing them as perpetual c hildren.132 Ideally, women were to remain aloof fr om the public as pects of litigation. David Schaps has shown that litigants w ent so far as to avoid identifying women of their acquaintance by nam e in their speeches, even where their identities were relevant to the case.133 Two significant exceptions to 9.1.

It remaine d at the discretio n of males of the oikos which conflicts were to be pursu ed in the cou rts, and how such con flicts we re to be frame d, proce durally. 132 Despite Arist otle's statem ent about wo la ck of delibe ration a t Pol. 1.1260a9-1 4, wome n could assert prope rty rights, pro vide eviden ce for litigation, and in turn b e charged with such offen ces as m urder: Sealey (19 90), Schap s, 'Th e woma n lea st mentione d: etiquette and wome n's n ames', CQ 27 (1977), 32 3-30. 197this rule are women allied with one's opponent,134 and women of questionable reputation,135 who are identif ied and named without hesitation.136 To name a woman in the ma sculine space of the court i n almost any context effectivel y undermined her respectability.137 For a woman to actually stand accused of crimi nal activities was quite rare, as it ran counter to the interests of bot h women themselves and the men with whom they shared their social identities and reputations .138 Given that the Athenian legal system was far from syste matic in its implement ation of justice, and that the society tolerated much recourse to unsanctioned ritual or magi c, the prominenc e of women as sorceresses in legal disput es is most striking. It has already been not ed that there is generally more evidence for the use of magic, and the offering of magical services, by males than females, yet it is women who are more strongly associated with magic use in Greek thought and literature.139 Athenian legal practice consisted of a loos e conglom eration over time of the publicly professed norms140 of the active citi zen body, weighed again st the urgings of a given speaker before a parti cular group of jurors. Where 134 As at Isaios 3; Dem. 42.2 7. 135 Demo sthen es happily na mes Neai ra and the seve n girls she e mploys as p rostitutes at Dem. 59; similarly two prostitutes n amed Sinope a nd Phano strate: Dem. 22.5 6, along with the disgrace d figure s of Theori s (Dem . 25.79) a nd Nin os (De m. 39.2, 19.281, 40.9). 136 Other wome n are de emed 'namea ble' if they are dead at the time of the spee ch, or if their identitie s are critical to t he su ccess of a case: Schap s (19 77). 137 Schap s (1977), 327. 138 Foxhall (19 96), 141.

See p. 19 9 belo w. 139 See my chap ter one, pp. 1 -5 above. 140 These publi cly professed norm s should not be confu sed with dem onstrated behavio urs; see pp. 172 -73 above. It h as also be en shown that in the competiti ve environ ment of Athenian society, one m ay publicly deplore ce rtain behavio urs, yet 198jurors were interested in the compos ition of a speech, and not merely its factual content,141 speakers had much to gain from playing to the prejudices of their audience. As such, it is unsurprising that bias against women should also be expressed in the masculine, public sphere of litigation, consistent with that of the literature. The law court speeches, which are at least as literary as they are documentary,142 may reasonably be viewed as an extension of this literary topos . As su ch, M. Shaw's observations that women function in drama as catalysts for change and sources of conflict in the public spher e have some relevance to the legal speeches.143 By their very appearance in the public sphere of law court speeches, women are out t heir proper place in the oikos , away fro m public attention.144 And because of this unwelc ome intrusion into public life, accused women are treated particul arly b rutally in the speeches of their opponents, being presented with re ference to the worst feminine stereotypes available.145 In the bulk of surviving legal text s where defendants ar e presented as involv ed in nefarious magical activities , the allegations of sorcery are not well-defined or supported. This is certainly so of the Demosthenic discussion of Theoris in his speec h agai nst Aristogeiton. The exec uted covertly empl oy the very same strategie s and b ehavi ours one self: cha pter on e, p. 29 n. 118; cf.

But introducing Theoris, Demosthenes is able to suggest that E unomos consorts with convicted crim inals, and that he too deals in the worst kinds of m agical charlatanry. It was shown earlier that Theoris, a metic,146 was more likely to have been convicted of HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH for undisclos ed improprieties in her position as a ritual professional, than for the sorcery charge that the or ator alleges. In his role as persuasive advocate for the prosecu tion, though, the speaker is under no obligation to prove what he insinuat es. The existing topos of woman as covert dabbler in potions would help to bols ter the speaker's claims on this point. In the case of Ninos, too, it is quite clear that the woman was a priestess, and reasonably certain that she w as a priestess of a foreign cult. Her magical dealings, on the other hand, are far less apparent. The involv ement of Ninos and Theoris in non-civic or foreign ritual practices alone may have been sufficient to secu re their convictions, given Athenian distrust of alien cultur es and private ritual practices.147 145 As observed by Foxhall (1 996), 14 1. 146 Collin s has tentatively con cluded that Theori s belonged to the \u0081L\u0099\u008d\u0086PR\u0086\u0005 comm unity, on basi s of her Lemnian d esignation, and the fact that she wa s form ally tried for her crime (a privile ge which slave s did not enjoy): Collin s (2001), 490. cf. Gordon (1999), 25 0; contra Dickie, who find s Theoris to be a citize n, sin ce she i s subject to Athenian la ws abo ut impie ty: Dickie (20 01), p. 51. Again st the latter interpretati on, a group of Deli ans were ch arged with imp iety against the Athenian Amphiktyon es, despite being n on-At henia n. 147 On the perce ived con nection between f oreignness and magi c-wo rking see n. 8 3 above. For the identification of private and no n-civic ritual pra ctices with ma gic see the discu ssion of definition s in cha pter on e, p. 16-7; chapt er two, pp. 60 -2. 200Given that both of these women were figures of some standing148 and the subjects of notorious court cases, yet outsiders to A thenian civic cult, it has been suggested that their separate convictions for HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH - with suggestions of misuse of ri tual power - may have been politically motivated.149 A scholiast to Demosthenes 19.2 81 tells us that Ninos' conviction was secured by a certai n Menekles, who is identified as belonging t o a group of men who were in the habit of making such accusations. That is to say, Ninos and her alleged activ ities may have been offensive not to all, but only to a certain element of the elite, active 'litigating class'.150 Where magic is invok ed in legal c ontexts, there is frequently a strong sense that the defendants' reputations are simply being manipula ted and blackened by their opponents in litigati on. None of the allegations of sorcery in a legal cont ext whic h hav e been surveyed in this chapter seem to have been supported by witness statem ents or other solid evid ence (consistent with modern definitions), although these forms of evidence do feature elsewhere in Athenian lit igation.151 In the case of trials for HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH , at least, material evidence was not a high prior ity, 148 Theori s had a female se rvant in her em ploy, which sugge sts that she was more than a simple, po or wise-wom an. After Ninos' exec ution, her son b rought a suit aga inst the man wh o had her co nvicte d, indicatin g that the family enjoyed som e standi ng an d wealth in Athenian society: Dickie (2001 ), p. 54 . Nonethele ss, the wealth or so cial standing of these wome n proved in sufficient to en sure that they escape d capital puni shme nt. 149 On the use o f the charge o f HQ\u008cL\u0099ILPH for pol itical end s see p. 186 abov e. 150 While the Athenia n legal system p urported to offer e quality of justice, in reality the wealthi est five or ten pe rcent dominate d litigation, privileged a s they were with a rheto rical edu cation, lei sure to particip ate in lengthy legal processes an d the wealth to cover legal c osts: J.

Wasp s 963-6; And. 1.14, 1.18, 1.69. 201and so was open to abuse when brought by political or personal opponents.152 Litigants' relative status so cial status (in conjunction with popular stereotypes) seem to have been rather more relevant in determining the outcomes of trials. The prosecution in Ant iphon's speech Agains t the stepmother argues that two men who died after dining together were poisoned by the prosecution's own stepmot her. The plaintiff clai ms that his stepmother induced a concubine to give the two men a poisonous draught, foolin g the woman into thinking it was a love potion.153 A charge of murder by MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH was probably leveled at the woman.154 There has been some controversy as to the aut horship and authenticity of this speech, although Maidment argues c onvincingly for its authenticity .155 Significantly, the prosecution adv ances neither evidenc e nor witnesses to support his allegations . Instead, he presents a highly rhetorical picture of the alleged schemes of the two wo men. He imagines the two men sacrificing, and contrasts their piety with the murderous conspiracy of the two women.156 At 1.28 th e prosecuti on attacks his brother for championing the woman's innocence, stating that naturally she would appear to be innocent, having conc ealed her scheme from everyone 152 Cohe n and Garn sey hav e argu ed the case that Sokrates was convicted of hol ding impiou s belief s about the gods, rat her th an the more tangibl e crime of publicly teachi ng and en couraging su ch impi ous b eliefs: Cohen (198 8), 699; but agai nst this opi nion see MacDo well (1 978), p. 311. cf.

Women were effectively excluded from political power, which was accessed through public speech. This exc lusion, in turn, became a source of some anxiety, which finds expression as much in the poetic 157 It is worth no ting that the woma n in qu estion was heavily depend ant upon thi s son to defend h er in court.

In any case, Di ckie seem s also to unde restimate the ex tent to which thi s 'reality' is so cially constructed. 160 Athens' pen chant for spect acular public work s and la rge festivals i s an expre ssion of this civ ic focus. 161 Xenopho n's advice to me n to avoid sp endin g too much time at h ome, in the interest s of maintainin g a good rep utation amon g their pee rs, is the cle arest articulation of this social expe ctation. See 57-60 fo r di scussio n. 203literature as in the legal speeches.162 In Antiphon's speech Against the stepm other, for instance, the socially pre scribed sile nce and invisib ility of women is invoked as evidenc e of surreptitious evildoing. This serves to highlight the double bind imposed upon Athenian women of the cl assical period concerning acc ess to a public vo ice, and the political author ity that speech offered in the polis. Antiphon's speech constitutes evidence of one way in which women, who traditi onally liv ed more or less conce aled lives, could suffer a negative impact of the bias inherent in the Athenian justice system. Residents who lacked citizen status si milarly lack ed a politic al voice in classical Athens. As such their actions , and especially their ritual practices and beliefs we re vulnerable to attack under Athenian law. Accusations or formal prosecutio ns against the unsanctioned ritual practices which came to be marked as magical frequently imply that such arts threatened social cohesion. When magic was pursued through the court syste m as a form of impiety, for instance, it wa s credited with the capacity for inviting div ine displeas ure upon a whole community. Such damaging activities, it was argued, ought not to be tolerated to exis t. Dominated as it was by the concerns of elite, citizen men, the Athenian justice system tended to target non-civic ritual and marginalis ed groups, insofar as these were viewed as a c hallenge (albeit a relatively weak one) to the hegemony of thi s powerful minor ity. Where practices whic h were arguably magical served to reaffirm the status quo , on the other hand, the 162 On this tensi on between silence as femi nine prop riety and sile nce as suspici ous, 204legal system did not construct su ch pr actices as in any way problematic.

Critics of magic and self-defined practitioners of the art alike tended to subscribe to and promulgate the notion that the lore, rituals, language and paraphernalia of magic were sourced from distant locales. While some sources indi cate that magic was indigenous to Thessaly, a geographical outpost of Greek ci vilisation, the majority locate magic, as it is variously defined, in the non-Greek east of the Mediterranean world. Against these claims, there are indications that st atements that magic belongs to the far reaches of the world were much more (and much less) than statements of known facts. In order to gain an un derstanding of the role and validity of statem ents about the exotic orig ins of magic, one needs first to investigate the Greeks' various attitudes towards foreign cultures and distant lands in t he classical period. The present chapter ai ms to address two issues which were the subjects of important discourses, par ticularly in classic al drama and philosophy, namely magic and foreigners. The promi nence of magic and magic users in classical lit erature has already been el ucidated. It has been shown that the idea (and language) of magic came into existence and evolved rapidly in 205meaning over a relatively brief period of time, between the archaic and the Hellenistic periods, as illustrat ed through cla ssical literature.1 The focus on these particular centuries of Medite rranean civilisation as pivotal for the formation of the concept of magic is not meant to imply that the idea attained any real stability by the Hellenistic period. On the contrary, it will be demonstrated that by i ts very nat ure ancient magic was amenable to innovation, incorporating i ndigenous marginal religious practice as well as elements of 'alien' wis dom, and shaped by the social and politic al concerns of the literate, leisured cl ass. For the purposes of this study, though, it will suffice to examine how the concept of magi c came into being, and what this concept implied during the classical period. At the same time that magic was emer ging as a recognisable set of beliefs and practices, as constructed and pres ented by the literary elites of the classical period, the Greek city-sta tes were being forced to acknowledge, interact with and defend themselves agai nst an unparalleled foreign power - Persia. The aftermath of the Persi an Wars coincided with an increase in representations of foreigners and foreign settings in literature, and especially in drama.2 Edith Hall argues that, more importantly, the per iod following the defeat of the Persian forces saw a dramatic shift in the way that such non- Greeks were portrayed.3 She observes, for instanc e, that earlier literature 1 On whi ch see cha pter on e, 14-19 ab ove. 2 Hall (1989), p. 1. 3 Ibid., passim . 206does not appear to differentiate the Greek heroes from their foreign foes in any fundamental way. In Homeric epi c particular Trojans, like their Greek foes, are si ngled out from the acti on, and represented as demonstrating bravery, mi litary prowess and intelligence.4 Epic convent ion dictates that Trojans speak in language indistingui shable from that of the Greeks,5 and indeed they worship identical gods. That Greek and non-Greek ri vals are not presented as polar opposites of each other does not indicate that this mode of thought - that of polarity and analogy - was yet to influence early Greek thought.6 If polar opposites of Helleni c culture are sought in archaic literature, they are to be found in the mythical gynaecocratic Amazons and the violent, anarchic Kyklopes.7 That such polarising tendencies are not discernible between Greeks and non-Greeks at this point has been taken to indicate that there was only a limited s ense of Pan-Hellenism in the archaic period, and certainly no conver se sense of 'Pan-Barbar ism'.8 Indeed, the term IH\u0099\u0088IH\u0088\u0086\u0005 is not recorded until the ear ly fifth century, during the Persian Wars.9 Other, smaller units of group identity - one's family, 4 Ibid., pp. 21ff . 5 duBois (198 2), p. 79; G.

In this work, Persian ethnic vices are outlined, and serve as a foil for Greek virtues.12 Emphasis is repeatedly placed upon the wealth and luxur y of the Persians,13 along with their deference to despots,14 their nonsensical language,15 and most of all, their disorderly fighting style. The numeric ally smaller Greek forces advance in unison with speed and confidence,16 whereas the Persians show terror (M\u0086\u0099I\u0086\u0005 ),17 and soon flee in disorder ( H\u0099R\u0086\u0099\u008c\u0081\u008a\u0005 ).18 Aischylos is partially credited with the creati on of a new, pol arisin g way of viewin g 10 The heroe s of the Gree k contin gent in the Iliad are i dentified with referen ce to their parentage a nd their pa rticular area of ori gin.

Greeks, by contrast, were invested with the cardinal virtues of moderation ( \u008c\u008aM\u0088\u0086\u008c\u008b\u0099\u0084O ), and wisdom (\u008c\u0086MP\u0099 is consistent with pattern s of ethnic stereot yping in other cultures, ancient and modern, that Pers ians as a group were invested with opposite qualities to all those the Greeks, or more accurately, the Athenians, upheld in their own culture. 23 Further, all other non-Greek easterners were 19Aischylo s was clearly not the sol e creat or of this topo s.

Pan- Hellenism was not, of course, a self-e vident fact. Greek communities were geographic ally scattered and politically diverse throughout the classical period. Citizens of a particular city -state saw themselves as fundamentally different to strangers, termed L\u0099\u0084\u0086P , from other parts of Greece.26 Commonalt y among Greeks lay, for Herodot os at least, with similar ities in language, religion and customs27 rather than any active political unit y. Pan- Hellenic unity was largely a figm ent of Athenian po litical propaganda, promulgate d in the interests of maintain ing the complia nce of its allies in the 24 Beginning in the late sixth centu ry, and in creasingly in the fifth century, image s of Amazo ns were cre ated wit way all 'others' we re conflate d and thus be came gener ically b arbarian: H.

The fact that they were also consider ed to be masters of magical lore gave the issue of magic a power ful political dimension in Greek thought. In their manipulation of stereotype, fifth century writers betray an awareness of the artificiality of the polarity of Greek versus barbarian. Aischylos presents a Greek woman, Klytemnestr a, conforming somewhat to the emerging barbarian stereoty pe. His Klytem nestra is masculine, ambitious, and powerf ul in relation to Aigisthos and Agamemnon,29 which is co nsistent with Greek images of eastern women as transgressive of the 'normal' hierarchy of men over women.30 In his Andromache Euripides explores the validity and subjectivity of these two categories. Euripides has Hermione insinuate that Andromache, true to her eastern origins, has used sorcery to render her infertile.31 However, he then turns this stereotype around, using barbarian imagery to under score the metaphorical bar barism - the 28 Hall (19 89), esp. pp. 16 -7.

His enslaved Tr ojans, on the other hand, are presented in a very sympathetic light, and devoid of any such barbarian imagery. Euripides us es the same technique elsewhere in his extant works, to barbaris e other flawed Greek characters.32 Euripides and other writers apply popular ethnic stereotypes figur atively, to comment upon Greeks' capacit y for categorically 'un-Greek' behaviour, and foreigners' corresponding capac ity for virtue and dignity.33 Given the polar opposition of Greek versus Persian bar barian during the classical period, it is signific ant fo r the development of both concepts that eastern cultures in general and Persia in particular were credited with special expertise in magic. The tendency am ong Greeks to identify the distant east as the source of mysteriously power ful substances, lore and practitioners certainly predates the classical period. It was noted in chapter one that the most potent of Homeric MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH are sourced either from deities, or less often from the distant east of the world.34 The substance used by Kirke to transfo rm her capti ves into swine and the drug which Odysseus uses to reverse its effect are of divine origin. The strange and remarkable effects of these substances are thus r endered understandable. Helen's chos en substance, \u0084O\u0087L\u0084\u0089O\u0099\u0005 , on the other hand, is said to have originated in the distant but mortal land of the Eg yptians, given to her by a local woman 32 cf. the repre sentation s of Hele n in Tro. 997 an d in the Orestes, Klytemnestra in El. 998- 1003. 33 Hall (1989), 34 Chapte r one, p. 15. 212named Polydamna. The poet adds that Egyp t is the source of a great many such herbs, some beneficial, some ha rmful, and that the people of that land have the greatest knowledge of medicine of all human cultures.35 That powerful MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH in this period are a ttributed to distant or divine sources sugges ts that even at early period, there existed a tendency to 'locate' what would become magic beyond the boundaries of the local, the mortal, the knowable. While thes e subs tances are credited with the power to produce as tonishing outcomes contrary to what one might normally expect of nature, and are somewhat distanced by t heir provenance, it is important to point out that Homeric MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH are not yet understood to belong to a category corresponding to 'magic' in t he archaic period. At this ti me the use of MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH had not yet developed the association with powers to control the dead and coerce the liv ing, or with susp ect initiations and purification s which wo uld later be come so marked. By the same token it is not possible to pinpoint the moment at which the category of magic described above36 came into exist ence, although the concept clearly had a well-developed and distinctive form by the time that Plato and the Hippokratic author of the treatise On the sacred diseas e writing.37 35 Kirke's MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084: Homer, Od. 10.388ff; Helen's MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HR\u0086\u0084: Od 4.221; cf Scarbo rough 357. 36 See previou s page. 37 Plato refers to a cla ss of ri tual expert w ho pro mised purification s to divine ange r: classical period dramatic and scientif ic writers remained more or less in agreement that the mo st abundant, powerful and terrible MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH and ritual procedures were of eastern origin. In his scientific work the History of plants Theophrastos assesses traditional medical lor e, with a greater degree of obj ectivity than many of his medical contemporaries.38 He confirms that the calming drug \u0084O\u0087L\u0084\u0089O \u0099\u0005 is obtained from Egypt.39 Using statuary evidenc e, Guido Majno has identified this ancient substance with some certainty as opium, a substance which was plentiful within the confines of Greec e. Majno concludes that the Egyptian origin ascribed to \u0084O\u0087L\u0084\u0089O \u0099\u0005 was probably inv ented to help market the product, as the effi cacy of eastern MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH was already a commonplace among Greeks by the classic al period.40 Theophrast os also cites Tyrrhenia, Latium, Ethiopia, Skythi a and Thrace as plentiful sources of herbal substances.41 According to Herodotos, a whole African race of people are sorcerers ( N\u0086\u0099O\u008dL\u0005 ).42 He is somehow more sceptical about the claims of the Neuri, that t hey practi se magic and can shape-shift into werewolves.43 In classical drama, too, there is a strong emphasis upon the categorical 'otherness' of magical substances . The poisonous subs tances used by 38 cf. chapter three, pp. 84ff. 39 Throphr., HP 9.15.1. 40 Majno (1 975), p. 144. 41 HP 9.15.2-3; cf. chapte r three, p. 88. 42 Hdt. in Sophok les' Trachiniai and Kreousa in Euripides' Ion are both located outside of ordinary human experie nce, in the realm of the divine and mythologic al. Deianeira's potion contai ns the blood of the Hydra, and was a gift from a second fantastic creature - the centaur Nessos.44 Kreousa, for her part, has in her possession two drops of dead Gorgon's blood, also a gift, in this i nstance fro m Athene.45 Besides suggesting mythologic al sources for MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH , classical drama also hypothesised exotic origins for magical expertise. Ari stophanes finds Thess aly - a relatively marginal region of the Hellenic world to an Athenian-bas ed playwright - to be a place where magic is much pr actised, and with great effectiveness.46 An ancient commentator on Euripides tells us that the practice of `\u008bHN\u008aNP\u0099H originated in Thes saly. In his Androm ache , Euripides has Hermione suspecting and accusing the 'barbarian'47 namesake of the play of hostile sorcery. Hermione accuses her 44 Soph., Trach . 572-5. 45 Eur., Ion 1010ff. Much emphasis i s placed, in this Euripidean account, upon the dual nature s of the twin dropl ets of blood, one of wh ich is a mira culous healer, the oth er a dea dly poison. The twin natu res of MH\u0099\u0088\u0081 HRH with t heir ability to harm a nd he al equally was the su bject of much reflection in di scussio ns of magic.

In his Orestes , Euripides involves another Phrygian slave in a short discussion about magic. Confounded at the sudden disappearance of Hermione, the slave's fi rst response is to consider whether or not the feat was achieved by means of potions or sorcery (MH\u0088\u0081H\u0099R\u0086P \u008cP\u0084 OD \u0081H\u0099N\u008a\u0084 ).49 The idea that magic was a foreign art, and a profession dominated by foreigners had a great deal of currency among fifth and fourth century dramatic writers. While Greeks might on occasion be accused of using magic, the same practices were generously attributed to barbarian c haracters and locales. The figure of Medeia once again provides us with a clear example of the representation of magic as exotic in origin. Indeed, Euripides ' play betrays a keen awar eness of contemporary discour ses on Greekness and foreignness. As discuss ed in chapter four, emphas is is repeatedly and increasingly placed, in Euripides' Medeia upon the heroine's geogr aphical dis placement. Medeia has come to Greece from the distant east, beyond the Symplegades (in modern southern Russia).50 In the course of the play her cultural otherness becomes apparent. E uripides ac hieves this effect by multiple positive light by compa rison with his G reek characte rs in this play, betraying a st rong awareness of the new pol arising view of Gree ks and Others. 48 Eur., Andr . 32, 157, 355. 49 Eur., Or. 149 7. 50 Eur., Med. 1-2, 1263. Ro stovtzeff 121. 216means. He presents his Medeia as forthright and masculine in her persuasive speech and manner. Visual evidence from the period s uggests that his Medeia switched from convent ional Greek costume to a striking, orientalis ed costume towards the gruesom e climax of the ac tion. In doing so, he was making use of new conventions surrounding the perceiv ed binary opposition between Greek and Barbarian.51 Euripides' Medeia is depicted as lacking the Hellenic virtue of moderation ( \u008c\u008aM\u0088\u0086\u008c\u008b\u0099\u0084O ) in her anger, her grief and her passion. Her natural propensities for excess,52 crue lty,53 cunning tricks54 and unwomanliness55 are all consistent with representations of barbarian foes in fift h century art and literature.56 Euripides' Medeia is also quick to opt for a cunning plot involving deadly magic as soon as her security and status in Iolkos beco me endangered. Medeia co nfides in the chorus that s he plans to kill her enemies by means of MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH , then calls upon her favoured deity Hekate to assist her in 51 Sourvinou-Inwood (1997), 291. cf. chapter five, pp. 121ff. for relevant references. 52 elty'. 54 While fooli sh barba rian characters are some times contraste d with intelligent Greeks (e g. Aristoph., Nub. 492; Eur., IT, Helen , Rhesos 763-9), barb arians are often instea d invested with the vice of excessive cunning. Egyptians were known as a cunning race (e g. fas cinated by allege d ascend ancy of Persia n prin cesse s and q ueens: Hall (1 989), p. 95.

Indeed, these associations developed in stages, and through layering th e different versions of her myth. In earlier versions, Medeia's origins had been variously divine, distant and Kolchian.59 See, however, Johnston's s uggestion that there seems to initially hav e been two distinct Medeia figure s, one familiar from the Argonauts story, the other being a deity worshipped in Korinth and Thessaly at least as early as the eighth century. This second figure was displaced by the Olympian cult of Hera Akraia, and wa s only then cast into the rol e of outsider.60 Johnston's theory goes some wa y to explaining the marked change undergone by Medeia's characte r between the eighth and fourth centuries. In the mid- sixth centur y, Hesiod made a specific connection between Medeia and the Medes (whom the Greeks saw as synonymous with Persians).61 More specifically, Hesiod pr esents Medeia's son Medeios (or 57 Eur., Med. 384-9 8. 58 Tragi c writers, like Hero dotos and Hom er before the m, conventio nally rep resented foreign ers as observing the Gree k god s, or at most sa w foreig n god s as exoti c names for familiar Gree k deitie s. For example, He rodot os identifies a Syrian godd ess a s Aphro dite Urania (1.105 ); Egyptian Ammon, Babyloni an Baal -Marduk, and th e Persi an gre at god as Zeus (2.42; 1 .181, 3.158; 1 .131). cf.

In Hesiod as in the eighth century Korinthian cultic evidence, there is no indication that Medeia possessed any negativ ely marked magical talents. Any powers which she holds must instead be understood as perta ining to her divinity or divine ancestry.63 Like Hes iod, Herodotos makes a connection between Medeia an d the Medes, stating that thi s eastern p eople nam ed themselves after Medeia, after she journeyed to their land following her fli ght from Athens.64 By the time Herodotos was writing, though, magic had begun to emerge as a clear attribute of Persians and of figures such as Medeia. From her origins in two very old Greek traditions - a cult in Korinth and Thessaly, and a distant princess in the Argonaut cycle - Medeia seems to have gradually grown in otherness, becoming progressiv ely mo re outcast and sinister, foreign and magical in the course of the classica l period. Having ear ly been marked as an outcast, transgressive woman, Medei a inc reasingly operated as a foil for the developing sense of Greek ci vic and political identit y, progressively becoming marked with features with whic h Greeks contrasted themselves. 62 West (196 6) on line 10 01. 63 In an early Korinthia n version of the myth, Medeia attempts to imm ortalise he r childre n. Her attem pt is un successf ul, and in any case is relian t upon the intervention of Hera, and so it cannot be classified a s a 'magical' act: Joh nston (1997), 63. 64 Hdt. 7.62. 219We have seen above how foreigners became viewed as a negative projection of Greeks. Through this pr ocess of 'othering', little understood foreign ritual practices were viewed as an inversion of 'pious ' Greek religious observanc e. As with Greek (male) r epresentations of women, though, this tendency to see the world as a relationship or conflict between opposing qualities yielded far from a simple 'bla ck and white' view of fixed, opposing pairs of ideas. Women, being more ' natural' and primitiv e than men, could be characterised in some contexts as bestial by comparison with their male equivalents , but in other contexts as being close to divinity and mystery, with men being related to mortality and reas on. This contradictory view of women stemmed, in p art, from the fact that ' primitive' encompassed ideas of both savagery and utopian simplicity and piety. By the same structural logic, 'primitive' foreign ritual practices were at times constructed as cruel, strange and impious, while at other times fore ign ritual experts were hailed as especially pious, pow erful and truthful.65 Plato asserts, for instance, that Carthiginians consider human sacrifice to be sacred and lawful, while Greeks find such sacrifices reprehensible.66 Herodotos tells us that the \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P of Persia gladly kill living th ings with their bare hands whereas Greek priests revere all life. A furt her contrast is Herodotos' claim that 65 Hall relate s the Gre eks' 'schi zophrenic' view of barb arian spiritu ality to their idea that civilisatio n is both a rise fro m animality and a fall from a golde n age: Hall (19 89), pp. 4, fr. 12 6.2-3 which restate s that human sacrifice is a ' barbarian' cu stom. Plato's as sertion ce con stitutes a in the fifth centu ry middle ea stern religio ns di d indee d carry out this pra ctice: Hall (19 89), pp. 147 -8. 220\u0081H\u0099N\u0086P choose to be mauled by birds and dogs at death, rather than being buried.67 On the other hand, foreign mantic figur es were very much revered by the Greeks for their moral integrity and t heir accurate foresi ght. Kassandra's integrity in Aischylos' Agamemnon is in sharp contrast to the depravity of her Greek captors. Amphi araus, and t he Egyptian prophets Proteus and Theonoe further exemplif y the stereotype of t he noble barbarian seer.68 Mystic wisdom is commonly present ed as being foreign to Greece, and originating in civilisations which pre-date Greek culture. Egypt was particularly prominent as a source - r eal or i magined - of primeval wisdom, in the work of Plato and elsewhere.69 Thrake was firmly connected with mystery religions and s hamanism. Orpheus was certainly consider ed to be Thrakian, and Dionys os was believed to be variously Thrakian or Lydian.70 The Thrakian warrior Rhesus turned into a prophet of Dionys os upon his death.71 A lost tragedy describes prophecy as a Lydian art.72 67 Hdt. 1.140. 68 Amphiara us d piou s: Aisch., Sept. 610; Proteus i s the most \u008c\u008a\u0099M\u0088\u008a\u0084 man i n the worl d: Eur., Hel. 47; Theon oe is virginal an d far-seei ng: Eur., Hel. 100 0. 69 Hall (19 89), p. 149; Arnal do Momigli ano, Alien Wisd om: the lim its of Helleni sation (Cambridge, 1975 ). 70 Eur., Hek. 1267 call Dionysos the 'T hrakia ns' p rophet'; Eur., Bacc. s as foreign import; Ais ch.

The examples of Dionysos and Medeia prom pt us to ask w hether rituals which were categorised as 'magical' in the classi cal were genuinely non-Greek in origin, or whether they too were labelled as such because they also eluded neat categorisation, or were seen to be transgr essive or contrary to Greek virtues and values. 73 E.

Giv en that Greek theories and terminology concerning hepatoscopy have marked resemblances with those of both Etruria and Assyria, Burkert theorises that a single 'sch ool' of liver augury spread by diffusion throughout the Medi terranean world, originating in the near east.79 Burkert goes on to point out similarities between the Greek practices of purification (of both ph ysical and moral blights) and summoning and controlling the spir its of the dead, and their near eastern parallels in Mesopotamia and Akkadia.80 For Burkert, the transmission of these 77 See espe Christo pher A. Faraon e, 'M win e and mutilated ani mals: sympatheti c magic in n ear eastern and early Gree k oath ceremo nies', JHS 113 (1993), 60 23 (1994 ), 187 -97; M. L.

At no point in his monograph, however, does he make clear hi s definition of t he term 'magic', despite making frequent use of it in his analy sis. Indeed, the use of this term is anachronistic and unhelpful, given that his is a study of archaic Greek and non-Greek practices, and t hat there did not then ex ist a category of or terminology for magic. It is of course clear that the Greek worl d adopted some of the specialist ritual traditions of its eastern neighbours, and vice versa . It is equally apparent that many of these practices were subsequently categorised as magical, both in the literature of t he fifth and fourth centuries, and in the repertoires of self-defined magicians. However, to conclude from this that the Greeks imported most of their m agical beliefs and practices wholesale from their near eastern neighbours is overly simplistic. The use of Ephesian letters, or the Ephesia gramm ata in Greek apotropaic amulets helps to illustrate the dangers inhere nt in seekin g out individual 81 cf. West's fin ding that theo ries of natu ral philosophy a cross the Me diterrane an and nea r easte rn worl ds were pa rticularly mobile during the six th centu ry and until Persi a emerged a s a threat to Greek culture: We st (19 71), passim , esp. pp. 226-7. 224exotic features as evidence for the essential foreignnes s of magic. The Ephesia grammata are a series of six 'words', allegedly inscribed on the statue of Artemis at Ephesos, which were believed to be effective in warding off perils when worn as an amulet.82 The earliest reference to the power of these words dates to the fifth centur y, where an inscription gives thanks for the vengeance wrought by means of Ephesia grammat a.83 A fourth century comic poet, Anaxilas, refers in passing to the carrying suggesting that this type of amulet was well known to his audienc e. The poet describes the am ulet as being carried by a foolis h and backward country dweller, with the im plication that only ignorant folk believe in s uch things. Our earliest ev idence for the text itself dates to the fourth century,85 with all other examples dating to the early centuries C.E. Anecdotes preserved in late evidence sugges t that the Ephesia gra mmata were believ ed to be of a genuinely Asia Minor origin and langu age, and had been successfully used by Kroesos and an Ephesian boxer.86 The words themselves, however, are not known to be meaningful in any non-Greek Mediterranean or near eastern language. Indeed, they resemble no 82 The text of which read s: 'askion kataski on lix tetra x damnameneus aision G.

This example should caution one against t he error of relying too heavily and literally upon the accuracy of the anci ent sources as regards the ori gins of magic.

The literary evidence thus offers littl e positive evidence to justify the representation of magic as categorically non- Greek.

The Romans of the late second century B.C.

Rat her than simply accepting all such claims at face value, one should be prepar ed to consider the possibility that assertions about the foreignness of magic are tied up with ideas about cultural boundaries. Follo wing the structural theo ries of Levi-Strauss, anthropologists have found that magic is invariably identified with that which is marginal, liminal, unstructured and pr otean. For all this appare nt chaos, magic is cross-culturally a very ri gidly organis ed realm. The suppo sed spatial dis location of magic effectivel y justifies the pres ence of unexplainable elements within a culture's belief syst em.

The supposed affinity between Persia and magic was bolstered in the Greek mind by the fact that one of the earliest and most important terms used to ident ify magical pr actitioners - \u0081H\u0099N \u0086\u0005 - is firmly connected with this particular civilis ation. The term itself seems to be a genuine Persian loan-word, as a close homonym appears in the sixth century Behistun inscription.106 In its true sens e, the word refers to a member of the elevated M edian caste of fire-priests , representatives of the Persian nat ional religion. Its use by Herodotos, Pseudo-Aristotle and others indicates that this original meaning, devoid of any magical knowled ge, was known to educated Greeks.107 Our earliest uses of the word \u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 occur in th e works of Greeks who liv ed or originated in the colonies of Asia Minor, namely Herakleitos and 104 cf. the work of Mary Dou glas on the id ea that things remain sacre d in culture s by virtue of keeping thei r place. That whi ch escape s its prope r place may be v iewed as e specially polluted o r powerful (wheth er neg atively or positively marked ): Dou glas (196 6). 105 Gordo n (1987), 59-95. 106 A. D. Nock, ' Paul and the Magu s', in Z. Stewart (ed.), Essa ys on Religion an d the Ancient World (Oxfo rd: 1972), 30 8-30, esp. 309; J. M. Cook, The Persian Empire (Lon don, 1983 ), pp. 50-2; cf. chapter o ne, Plato, Alk. 122a; Pseu do-Aristotle gene Laertius, Prooem . 8; see n. 109 dotos on the \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P . 230Herodotos.108 It is of course quite natural that Ionian Greeks should have been pivot al in the coining of the word , given their geographical proximity to the encroaching Persian civilisation. Herodotos dutifully characterises \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P as a priestly tribe, responsib le for interpreting dreams, making sacrifices and reading omens, all of which were inoffensive activities in the eyes of most Greeks.109 Dream interpretation was an accepted part of medicine for some Hippokratic writers,110 the reading of omens was wides pread, and sacrifice was a crucial element of polis life.111 On the other hand, Herodotos informs us that these \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P are also able to calm storms by means of sacrific ial vic tims and incantations,112 thereby hinting at the manipulations of nature that so-c alled m agic worker s of the classical period would lay claim to.113 It is worth remarking that Herodotos, at least, did not draw a firm line between religion and magic when it was another culture's customs he was discussing. He could comfortably charac terise Persian priests as expert in state religious functions as well as arts more akin to what Greeks considered sorcery. This is interesting in light of modern debates surrounding the 108 Hera kleito s was a Milesi an, while Hero dotos was originally from \u0081H\u0099N . 111 e chapte r three, on ambivalen ce toward s and d angers inhe rent in the act of killing and cooking anim als. 112 Hdt. 7.191.

However, one may propose that Herodotos is inst ead implicitly conceding here that individual Greeks had no objective criter ia by which to differentiate a religious ritual fr om a magical one.115 Such distinctions were instead culturally determined on the basis of i nherited understandings of the relative centrality or marginality of a given rit ual practice. Herakleitos gives a more simplistic and unambiguous ly pejorat ive account of the actions of \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P. For this author , \u0081H\u0099N \u0086P are guilty of the same errors of judgment or mo rality as bacchants, maenads and mystai .116 West speculates that Median \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P would have emigrated to the west coast of the Persian empire, to S amos or Mi ltos, after Cyrus subjugated their people circa 549.117 Positive evidence for such a diaspora is weak, for the Greeks of these cities seem to have had only a perfunctory knowledge about the functions of this priestly class. Herakleitos was supposedly interested in the natural philosophic al theories of Persian religion, however his understanding of and sympathy for t he Persian priesthood is most 114 See my discussion in chapter one, 5 -13. 115 See chapte r one, 6-1 3 with notes fo r schol arshi p pertaining to this argument. 116 Hera kleito s, DK 12 B 14; cf. chapte r one, p. 17. 117 West (197 1), pp. 240-1. 232circumscribed.118 Herakleitos' account of \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P is testimony to the immediacy with whic h the word \u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 in its original Median meaning diverged with the derivative word, which wa s wholly Greek in conception. In its secondary meaning, \u0081H\u0099N \u0086\u0005 expands to incorporate purveyors of any dubious ritual arts.119 When Herakleitos speaks of \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P in the Greek cities of Asia Minor in the late sixth century he associates them not with Zoroastrian belief s but with the Greek institution of m ystery initiations.120 Tieresias, too, is referred to reprovingly as a \u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 despite the fact that he is a Greek practising div ination, an art familiar to the Helle nic world from at least the archaic period. In both cases, identification with \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P expresses not a statement of or igins, but a specific attack on validity or value of the pers ons and acts involved. The exact process by which this Pers ian priestly class became the standard- bearers of magic by virt ue of a shared name is unclear, although s ome inferences can be made. Simple cu ltural misunderstan ding - wilful or otherwise - seems to have been a prominent factor.121 A. D. Nock points out that the Greeks t ended to be poor observers of strange religions, 118 On debate s surro unding Herakl eitos' philo sophy see referen ces in We st (19 71), pp. 165-70. In light of Herakleito s' un the term '\u0081H\u0099N \u0086\u0005', such kno wledge on hi s part se ems u nlikely. 119 See my preliminary re marks in chapter one, 17-19. 120 Dickie is ri ghtly skeptical a bout wh ether genui ne Iranian fire-prie sts really filtered into the Gree k world. He su ggests that people m ay instead h ave simply passed them selves off as easte rn ad epts. That is to say, they use d exotic origi ns as a marketing tool: Dickie (2 001), p. 41. 121 Mary Boyce and Frantz G renet, A History of Zoroastrianism , Vol. 3 (Leide n, 199 1), p. 513. 233drawing hasty conclusions, and holding such religions in either utter contempt or uncritical awe.122 The prominenc e of \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P in the entourage which Xer xes led into Greece in the early fifth century will a lso have figured largely in the classic al constr uction of this priestly class. From a Greek perspective the \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P were authorities of a religion which was alien, dangerous, and demonstrabl y opposed to existing cultic practices.123 In light of the eventual repulsi on of the Persians from Greece, \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P could als o be seen as proponents of a subordinate belief system to that of the Greeks.124 As Gordon points out, the status of \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P thus had much in common with the elite, respectable opinion of practitioners of indigenous ritual observance in fifth century Athens.125 The use of 'magical' MH\u0099\u0088\u0081HRH , talismans, incantations are derided as variously foreign, d angerous, impious and ineffectual in the elite, literary sources of the peri od, despite their evident popularity.126 By linking Greek popular traditions, or fo lk-traditions, with the religious leadership of the Hellenic world's most dangerous ene my, these traditions became inc reasingly m arginalis ed with the passage of time. 122 A. D. Nock, ' Paul and the Magu s', in Z. Stewart (ed.), Essa ys on re ligion and th e ancie nt world (Oxford : 1972), 308 -30, esp. 31 1, 318. 123 This opp osition of Persi an and Greek religion was a concl usion to be dra wn from the Persi ans' destruction of G reek shrines in the cou rse of their invasi on. 124 Gordo n Boyce and Gree ks m agic constituted an in vasion from beyond, much like the infiltra tion of Hella s by Xerxes' army: G 229. 126 This ten sion betwe en mag ic as d angerously po werful, and magi c as ineffectu al remaine d unresolved throug hout G raeco-roman civilisation. co ction is mmon to other cultures' vie c: Claude L evi-Strauss, Structu ral Anthro pology, trans G rundfest Schoe pf (Lond on, 1 963), ch. 9. For Go rdon, para dox is itself cent ral to the meanin g of magic: G ordon (1987), esp. 61. 234This process of identific ation and marginalis ation of folk practitioners as \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P has two distinct facets, which goes some way to accounting for the contradictory views of magic i n the literary evidence of the period. For those belonging to the intellectual 'cent re', it was considered desir able to regulate or rationalis e the multiplic ity of traditional root-cutting, divinatory and purificatory practices on offer in the spiritual marketplace.127 While it was known in at least some educated circles that Persian priests did not practice magic, as defined by Greeks, the two ideas c ould readily be linked by virtue of their etymology if this was desirable. From the perspective of the centre, then, the transferral of undesirable indig enous practices to a genuinely alien system effectively delegitimised and marg inalised such beliefs and rituals. Practices identified as magical were t hereby distanced by their ethnic and geographic al othernes s, in addition to their pre-existing social and psychological distancing from establis hed, sanctioned r eligious observanc e.128 While the intellectual and political cent re embraced the idea of marginal practitioner as allied with Persian \u0081H\u0099N\u0086\u0005 , those operating at the margins of the society were equally qui ck to exploit the etymological linkage between these ideas. Used without the implications of charlatanry or impropriety, the term imbued such pr actices with religious authority and 127 This is a central con cern for Plato in his con struction of an ideal, orderly, morally upright society. 128 Boyce and G renet (199 1), p. 514. 235power and exotic ism. That is to say, accusations by the centre helped to enhance and justify the peri pheral position of adherents of marginal ritual practice.129 It is from this point onwards , too, that we begin to see the emergence of ritual experts who self-i dentify as magical practitioners, and style themselves with reference to the stereotype, to take advantage of the power that it offered.130 From this beginni ng, a learned, literary, philosophic al magic would emerge more fully in the Hellenistic period, especially upon the basis of Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha.131 Having gained some legitimacy throu gh associat ion with the learning of the Persian \u0081H\u0099N\u0086P , this strand of magic gradually became a more respectable, and also a more male-dominated art.132 In the preceding section the historicity of Greek claims as to the foreign, and specifically eastern origins of m agic was questioned and assessed. We shall now turn to the signific ance to this thesis of the nexus of ideas concerning Persia, magic and women in Greek thought. It has been shown that Greeks tended to apprehend their world through the dichotomising criteria of polarity and analogy.133 It was only with the emergence of the Persian empire as a threat to Gr eek autonomy, though, that particular attention was devoted to the identifi cation of contrasts between Greek and 129 Gordo n (1987), 66; Boyce and Grenet (1991 ), p. 515 . 130 Dickie (2 001), p. 40. 131 On whi ch see esp ecially Boyce and G renet (19 91), p. 515. 132 Ibid., 515; Gordo n (1987), 73. 133 See Lloyd (1992); chapter one, pp. 24ff. cf. duBoi s, who finds that by the fourth century, hiera rchies had pro gressiv ely repla ced polarity as th e central orde ring p rinciple of Gree k thought: duB ois (1 982), p. 5. 236Persian morality and way of life. The ri se of this new threat and the need for Greek speakers to unite in a common cause gave rise in Athens to intensified discussions about cultural identity . Theories and debate s about Greekness and its opposites find ex press ion, mostly implicit,134 during the fifth and fourth centuri es in dramatic and philosophical works alike . Given that these works are author ed almost entirely by elit e, citizen, Athenian men, it should not surprise us to find that Gr eek selfhood is implicitly de fined by its freedom from servitude,135 and its reasoning intellect (by which we should understand an elite, rational educ ation) . Greeks are also collectively praised, in the polarising rhetoric of the post-Persi an wars period, for their moderation in temperament and ambiti on. Persians, by contrast, are understood to be prone to slavery and subservience to despots,136 and either na\u00efve or cunning, rather than intelligen t. Persians are denigrated for their tendency towards exc esses of cruelty , sorrow, luxury and ambition.137 The feminine quality of barbarian, eastern lands is confirmed by the power that women of these cultur es were thought to wield.138 Greek myth makes 134 duBois ma kes the point th at the clearest assu mption s of a given a ge are u nspoken, buttressin g every argum ent, and forming someth ing of a shared ba ckgroun d: duB ois (1 982), p. 18. 135 The 'barbari ans' with wh om Gree ks ha d most conta ct were slave s capture d in war: Hall (1989), p. 19 6. Most citize n Gree k wom en, though, were si milarly l acking in p ersonal freedo m, and so we re not f ully covere d by this definition of 'Gree kness'. 136 The Gre eks asso ciated d espotism with inordin ate lusts for b oth power and sex.

The existence of the warlike, self -sufficient Amazons is the clearest illustration of the tendency towa rds gender inversion among barbarian peoples.139 The wives of the Persian despots were under stood to exercise a great deal of control over the runn ing of the vast Persian empire.140 Medeia, with her heroic pride, ambition and rage is similarly pr esented as a somewhat masculine figure, especially in Eur ipides' play bearing her name.141 Lydian Omphale, too, was able to dominate Herakles and effect a reversal of proper c onjugal and gender roles .142 This mythological barbarian woman is invoked in s everal play s in connec tion with gender inversion or conflict. Klytemnestra's us urpation power in the Agamemnon and Deianeira's femininisation and destructi on of Herakles by means of a 'love philtre' in th e Trachiniai are both accompanied by references to the transgressive Omphale.143 The Greek writers' projection of self hood is thus consistent with the Greek notion of masculinity, while Persi an mores are constructed as being consistent with negative feminine traits.144 This constructi on of Gree k:male as Persia:female signified, for agonist ic Greek culture, a state of permanent 139 duBois (198 2). The even tual defeat of the Amazo ns by the race of men sug gests the eventual subj ugation of thi s barba oth er: Zeitlin (1996 c), 94. 140 Sancisi -Weerdenburg find s that the notoriou s, powerful women of the east a re a literary conceit rath er than a demo nstrable fac t: Sanci si-Weerdenb urg (1983), 32. 141 Michael Sh aw, 'The femal e intrude r: wo men in fifth-century drama' , CP 70 (197 5), 255 - 66, esp. 26 3. 142 Pseudo -Apol lodoros 2.6.3; Diodo ros 4.3 1; cf. Zeitlin (1996 1040-41; Soph ., 86; Sancisi -Weerdenburg (1983), 27. 238animosity. The existence of such a polarity also impl ied that the two categories must exist in a hierarchic al relationship with each other.145 The categorisation of Persia as feminine ju stified, and was in turn reinforced by the fact of the Greek st ates' eventual defeat of its Persian aggress ors. Women, being necess ary for proc reation, but deficient in \u008c\u008aM\u0088\u0086\u008c\u008b\u0099\u0084O and reason, needed to be kept under the control of males. It was understood that without such necessary controls, women's passions would be a grave threat to their indiv idual \u0086PQ\u0099R\u0086P and on a broader scale upset the whole order of society by installing gynaecooc racy, which was equated wit h anarchy.146 By the same token, the dangerous but categorically inferior Persians wer e subjugated, in the course of the fifth century, in the interests of achiev ing peace, and maintaining the 'rightful' hierarchy of Greek over Persian. Persia is feminine in Greek thought. Magic is similarly deemed to be an especially feminine art in the literature of the classical period. That Persia is a key source of magic is thus consis tent with the cognitiv e categorisations that shaped ancient Greek thought. Magi c was believ ed to flourish at the periphery of the known world, and at the boundaries of experience, and magic itself was conceived of as a so rt of confounding of the polarities of powerful versus powerless, beneficent versus sinister, and traditional versus 145 duBois (198 2), p. 196. 146 The murderous deeds of t he Lemni an women are illustrative of this fear and belief: Choe . 631-6. Su ch is also at Eur., Or. 933-37. cf. Zeitlin (1996 c), 89 - 94. 239innovativ e.147 This capac ity for transgressing physical and conceptual boundaries rendered magic all the more effective and dangerous.148 Both women and Persian civilisation c ould be viewed, from the perspec tive of Greek citizen as geographi 'imminent others'.149 Citizens' wive l to the perpetuation of the \u0086PQCR\u0086\u0005 and yet were also strangers in their conjugal family's home. Persian culture, too, w as at once utterl y forei gn to the Greek way of life, yet was also the Greek world's immediat e neighbour. This juxtapos ition of apparently opposite q ualities - the fam iliar with the unfamiliar - cha llenged the binary structures upon which much of Greek thought was founded. Negative v alence bec ame attached to women and to Persian culture for their comparable capacity for transgre ssing normal boundaries. The boundary- crossing capabilities of both women and Persians contributed to their categorisation as cons anguineous with magic - th e transgressive art par excellence according to elite, classical ideology. 147 Gordo n (1987), 61. 148 Dougl as (19 66). 149 Hall (19 89), p. 60. 240Conclusions: the feminisation of magic in classical Greek ideology In their depictions of the use of magic, writers of the cla ssical period betray a keen awar eness of the ability of this art to disrupt what were considered to be the normal and rightful hierarchies which preserved t he order of the world. What made magic at once marv ellous and fearsome was its capacity to disturb the or dained order, the status quo , in relationships between deities and humans, between Greeks and their cu lturally inferior neighbours, and between men and women. T he category of magic could thus be invoked to help to make sense of the marvel lous and the seemingly impossible.1 Magic was thought to allow a person to achieve outc omes whic h were normally impossible in accordance with divine, human and natural laws. By magically cajoling the gods into obedience,2 for instance, a person could impiously seize and manipulate divine power for hi s or her own disreputable purposes. It is this impious usur pation of divi ne power which forms the basis of a number of elite, philo sophical attacks upon magic.3 We saw in chapter three that ar ts which had the power to work transformations between one state and another such as cookery, midwifery 1 Gordo n (1987), 59-95. 2 In magical rit ual, maste ry over the god s is freque ntly thro ugh de ception of the gods . In the PGM spell te xts deities are freque ntly roused to acti on agai nst th e target person by fal sely claimi ng that that person ha s slandered the g ods, eg. PGM IV.2471-92, IV.2622-2 707. cf. Winkler (1991 ), Especi ally Hi pp., OTSD 4.1-16. 241and metalworking wer e viewed with some ambivalenc e. The labelling of such practices as magical he lped to ma ke sense of their ability to confound the boundaries between the cat egories through which the Greeks comprehended and ordered their world. The idea that magic possesses the fearful abilit y to disrupt rightful hi erarchies and distinctio ns is perhaps nowhere more apparent than in the imagery and themes surrounding the use of love magic in class ical literature. In such scenarios, women's perceived proficiency with magic al arts was bel ieved to enable them to gain mastery over men, their 'natural' superordinates. In tragedy love magic is invariably performed by women, and aimed at securi ng the affections of men, although papyrologic al and epigraphical ev idence tends to contradict this gender stereotype.4 This incongruity among the classical sourc es invites speculation as to why women's use of erotic magic upon men should be such a focus of concern for elite philos ophic al and literary writers. In order to grasp the implic ations of the literary portr ayal of practitioners of love magic, several remarks first need to be made about the Greek notions of erotic and conjugal love, which constitute a marked departure from modern Western constructions of love. In Athens sexual relations hips, reflecting the rigid soc ial structures of broader society, we re conducted along 4 Winkl er (199 1), 227 an d nn. 73-5 poi nts out t hat the gende r bias in favour of wo men as practitione rs of erotic ma gic strongly co ntradi cts the papyrol ogical and inscri ptional eviden ce: Spells which are issued by a man, aimed a t attracting a woma n: 2; DT 100, 227, 23 0, 231, 264-7 1, 304.

That is to say, res pectable male sexuality was characterised by the ability to cont rol, rather than expres s, desires.8 Understood thus, uncontrolled s exual pas sion was considered to be more in keeping wit h feminine behaviour t han proper masculine comportment.9 Further, strong passion, sexual or ot herwise, was frequently characterised as an illn ess or an attack by invasive forces.10 These points need to be taken into consideration when appr oaching beliefs about erotic magic. 5 David M.

In this play, which was explored in chapter five above, Deianeira is initially repr esented as epitomising proper femi nine behaviour, by her cloistered lifestyle , her chastity and her devotion to \u0086PCR\u0086\u0005 and husband. Herakles, on the other hand, is an extreme polarisation of masculine behaviour, bei ng an heroic warrior who has little contact with the domestic sphere.11 However, once Deian eira puts into action a magical scheme to ensure He rakles ' continued affection for her, these gender polarisations under go a striking inversion. Herakles is reduced by the destructive force of the deadl y charm to 'girlish' pleas for pity12 and complaints13. Herakles is at pains to point out that his shameful transformation and demise was the work, not of an equal - a beast or fellow warrior - but a woman: 'A woman, a female - not the nature of a man - has destroyed me, without a sword.'14 Deianeira lives up to her own name as a 'destroyer of men' , then kills herse lf in a strangely masculine manner - with a sword.15 Rathe r than 11 Davies (199 1), p. xix; Foley (1981 ), 157-9; Nicole L 11 5-35, esp. 127; Lo raux (198 7), p. 14. 244reinvigorating the love bet ween the two, then, the MP\u0099z\u008d\u0088\u0086 \u0084 effectively masculinis es Deianeir a while it femi nises Herakles, before leading to the utter destruction of both figures. Herakles ' past enslavement to the Ly dian queen Omphale is invok ed, in the course of the play, to underscore De ianeira's transgres sion of proper gender hierarchies .16 For the Greeks Omphale was an archetypal exemplar of gynaecocr acy, requiring as she did that Herakles wear women's clothing and perform women's work in an exag gerated expression of the unmanly indignity of slavery itself.17 According to Plutarch , the comic poets of the classical period referred to Aspasia as a 'new Omphale', as well as a 'Deianeira'.18 Such labe ls, with their implicatio ns of the use of love magic by Aspasia, were applied in an effort to justify P erikles' unseemly displays of affection towards the woman.19 Later, it was reported (most probably by Octavian and his supporters) that Mark Antony was similarly enslav ed by the aphrodis iacs of Cleopatra.20 Such allegations had a double, normative function. They attacked the unusual prominence and political influence enjoyed by women such as Aspasia in Athenian society as being the work of reprehensible sorcery, and they chal lenged particular prominent citizens' manliness and fitness for public duties. Such accusations of the use of 16 Soph., Trach . 45, These us 6.6.

While it is Medeia's m astery and use of magic that capt ured the attention of poets and visual artists, and their audiences, the heroine's m agical pr owess in this myth proved to be no match for the erotic magic of Jason.23 Interestingly, only oblique an d passing reference is made to Jason's use of Aphrodite's PD\u008bN wheel against Medeia in Euripides ' play.24 This use of a love charm to gain the affection of the eastern princess has des tructive results, consistent with the damage wrought by the love potions of women. However, Jason's magical strategy is not subject to extended treatment, and there is only a limited suggestion of transgression of proper c odes of conduct. Jason's access to 21 On the (un stated) a ccepta bility of lying i n publi c for private advanta ge se e espe cially J. du Boulay, 'Lies, mockery, an d family int egrity' in Jean G .

For a man to be placed under the control of a woman, and to be compelled by a strange, illicitly mobilised forc e to abandon the virtue of \u008c\u008aM\u0088\u0086\u008c\u008b\u0099\u0084O , on the other hand, threatened t he order which underp inned the society. In the literary tradition, erotic magic performed by women involves a direct confrontation between sanctioned ma sculine authority and covert feminine schemes of subversion. As such, ideas of anarchy and inversion of the divinely ordained order of the world loom large in images of its use. On the rare occasions where males engage in love magic whic h is targeted at women, ideas of gender inversion and disr uption of the order of the world do not figure so prominently. The gender distortions which are so prominent in literary treatments of women's use of love magic against men provide some of the clearest evidenc e for fears and bel iefs about the use of magic, and about women, more generally. ******* The assess ment in this thesis of repres entations of purveyors of magic in the classical lit erary tradition, with its emphasis upon women as magical adepts, 25 Eur., Med. 526-3 1; Pind., Pyth. 4.217-9 . 247rests upon the premise that m agic itself is an artificially constructed category of activity, rather than a self-evident fact. Wh ile attempts have been made by some scholars of ancient history to positively define magic in the terms used by the ancient Greeks themse lves, and to identify the boundar ies between magic and sc ience on the one hand, and magic and religion on the other, the results of such proj ects are not convincing. It is maintained throughout this thesis that the complex and unresolved state of modern scholarship on Greek magic is lar gely due to problems of definition. Scholars s uch as Dic kie ask their reader s to accept the premise that ancient conceptions of magic were more or less consistent with modern understandings of magic. Such oversi mplifications do not help further our knowledge of the past. Stat ements of this nature also obscure the fact that modern conceptions of magic are as variable between individuals as their ancient equivalents, being shaped by a plethora of cultural, religious and social factors. In addition to the apparent conflict between ancient and modern conceptions of magi c, there also seems to be some contradiction between the ancient Greeks' own declar ed opinions about magic (as per the literature of the period) , and their actual practices (as gleaned from non- literary sources). In the course of this thesis, an attempt has been made to determine how and why the literary images of magic deviate so sharply from actual, known practice . 248Philosophers and writers am ong the Greeks claimed that magic attempted to impious ly force the will of the gods, while religious practices were associated with piety. In chapter one, though, it was shown that the surviving evidenc e for prayers and incant ations betrays no su ch sharp distinction. Orthodox prayers and 'magical' incantations both tend to exhibit a classic tripartite structure, and the apparent attitude of the performers equally ranges from forceful to submissive.26 One general distinction that can be observed is that rituals whic h are labelled 'magical' s how a preference for Chthonic over Olympian deities. Given that the Atheni an religious calendar placed greatest emphasis on the newer Olympian order, an associated distinction is that private devotions were susceptible to being identified as magical in a way that civic rites were not.27 Private offerings to t he Chthonic aspect of Hekate, for instance, were increasingly c onstruc ted as magical in the course of the classical age at Athens.28 Claims by rationalising scientific writers of the Hippokratic tradition as to the distinction between sc ientific healing and magical healing are similarly fraught with inconsist encies. Rather than proving that science and magic were based upon contrasting theoretica l frameworks, Hippo kratic invective against the practice of magic needs to be viewed as a competitive strategy 26 See chapte r one, pp. 5-1 1. 27 Con sider the fact that privately issu ed RH\u008dH\u0099KL\u008c\u0081\u0086P were cla ssed a s magical acts, while ci vic curse s - such a s provisi onal foun dation cu rses simila rities in form: see chapter chapte r two, passim . 249within a varied ancient medical marketpl ace. Indeed, magical traditions and the classic al scientific tradition were alik e in the sense that they constituted specialised technologies which prof essed to allow people to obtain predictable outcomes in their dealings with a more or less mysterious cosmos. While attempts to contrast magic with religion on the one hand, and science on the other have not been especially successful, ancient discussions about what did and did not constitute magi c do approach consistency on several points - that magic has the capacity to enact marvellous transformations, and to bring about the seemingly impossible through morally dubious approaches to divinities (and particularly to Chthonic d eities). In literature of t he classical period, women are strongly and consist ently associated with expertise in magical ar ts. Some scholars, most rec ently Matthew Dickie, have taken such poetic im ages to be more or less accurate documents of social reality. Taken at face value, the literary evidence tends to support the theory that magic as a practice was monopolised by women of low social s tanding, and was invariably aimed at inflicting harm upon others. The present writer, however, sees such literary images as simultaneously both much more, and much less than stra ightforward social docum ents. Keeping in mind the complex artistic, political and social aims (either explicit or implicit) of public artworks at A thens , it seems simplistic to presume that 250these should offer unbiased and unadulterate d insights into community life. In artistic w orks, the topos of magic is arguably invoked as a way of exploring and delineating the boundaries of that which is ordinary/extraordinary, pious /impious, normal/abnormal and sanctioned/ unsanctioned within the communally focused polis life. Magic, being symbolic of all that is troubli ng and unk nowable in life, was readily appropriated for normative, moralising purposes. Rather than seeking to uncover t he realities of women's access and recourse to magic in classical Greek society,29 then, the purpose of this thesis has been to identify a collection of activities and mythologic al episodes around whic h women's deployment of magic is particularly focused in ancient discussions. In separat e discussions about the interconnections of women and magic in relation to Heka te worship, the arts of cookery and traditional medicine, and in literary portrayals it has been observed that a reasonably consistent set of communal and masculine concerns presents itself. For instance, the associat ion of women as a category with the mysterious (from a mal e pers pective) and potentially polluting transformations surrounding childbirth and death helped to strengthen their connection with magic in popular ideology. 29 Dickie's rece nt monog raph constitutes the most com prehensive a nd up to date attempt at asse ssing the realities of th e use of magi c in ancient G reek society. As noted ab ove, though, some of the author' s conclusions seem to pla ce too much fa ith in the relia bility and accuracy of the an cient so urces: Dickie (2001). 251Despite attacks in the literary trad ition on the validity and piety of p ractices that were identified as magical, non- literary evidenc e suggests that their broad-based popularit y with both sexes did not wane. This discrep ancy between the literary and non-lit erary evidenc e regarding the status of magic serves to further remind us that the liter ary evidenc e is as much a source of misinformation as of information. As i ndicated in chapters six and seven, the problematisation and delegitim isation of this particular class of ritual as magical seem to have been the province of the elite, educated, leis ured, politic ally active minority, rather than the broader populace. In the absence of a single source of religious aut hority, or indeed an ac cepted body of scientific 'facts', the validity and t he moral acceptability of beliefs and practices were determi ned in the e lite-dominated, comp etitive arena of politic al debate. In the closing remarks of chapter tw o it was pointed out that among the superordinate class in Athenian s ociety (which is to say leisured, adult, citizen males), the concerns of public li fe enjoyed a far more elevated status than other, less civic-orient ed areas of existence. Indeed, reluctance on the part of citizens to parti cipate fully in public lif e was positively disc ouraged, being pres ented as un-citizenlik e and pos itively threatening to the wellbeing of the polis. The Athenian politic al body establis hed its identity and confirmed its pre-eminence in political , social and ritual matters through the process of contrasting its own values and behaviour wit h that of outsiders to 252the regime. Artistic and philos ophical works were a site for exploring various formulations of selfhood and otherness. In matters of politics, for instance, Persia, Sparta and the institution of tyranny were invok ed as opponents of the Athenian ideal of democracy. In matters of rit ual, non-civic and unsanctioned forms of religious obse rvance came under attack as running counter to the communal aims of civic cult. The association of unsanctioned, privately performed ritu al with magical or other wise nefarious deeds in classical lit erature thus played an important normative role.30 Despite the negative public image of magic, i n practice it continued to be widely practised, doubtless with r enewed concern for maintaining secrec y. In classical Greek (and especially At henian) society, women's access to official sources of political power was extremely circumscribed. The degree of unofficial influence to which they had access is very much contested in modern scholarship on the subject, and in any case no doubt varied greatly between individuals and social classes. In a near co mplete inversion of the proper plac e for citizen males, women of citizens' oikoi were properly relegated to the private sphere of family lif e. While this public invis ibility was presented as the highest ideal of femi nine behavio ur, it proved nonetheless to be a source of some anxiety. In a society which tend ed to distrust and 30 The dupli citous, ago nistic nature of an cient Greek society meant that morally d ubiou s comp etitive strategie s - including covert ritual ope rations - re main ed popul ar, de spite their professed unacceptability. 253delegitimis e the private dealings of its (male) members, proper female comportment was especially vulnerable to criticisms and accusations. Tensions s urrounding women's acti vities may be referred to the paradoxically central and marginalised pos ition they occupied in classical society. We know that women we re profoundly disempowered by Greek political and social traditions. Howe ver, in a system which was heavily reliant upon the exchange of women fo r the making of alliances between males, the continued c omplianc e of women in their own subjugation was critically im portant. Women, being t he objects of marita l exchange, standing outside establis hed power structures , but also capable of making independent choices, were perceived and constructed as the point of maximum vulnerability in the Gree k system of social alliances. The society's response to this perceived threat was to limit women's choices, movements and access to a public voice. Their enf orced silenc e was, in turn, construed as a tendency towards secretive, dec eptive behaviour, thereby helping to perpetuate the stereotype of woman as expert in arts with destabilis ing potential. The classic al poets' preference for representi ng magica l arts as the particular province of women can al so be related to the principle of 'otherness'. This category of thought is present in many societies. Its function is to permit the definition of the slippery notions of selfhood and 254social belonging by contrast with t hat which is clearly outside the group conscious ness. Ancient Greek though t, whic h showed a marked preference for the use of opposing prin ciples , made heavy use of the idea of alterity in its poetic explorations of civic identity. In the course of this thesis we have seen how classical literature works to construct selfhood with reference to t he opposing qualit ies of such 'others' as divinities, beasts, foreigners and xenoi and women. The construction of such categories as distanced 'other' presupposes a very narrow sense of selfhood, limited in fact to Greek, citiz en, adult males - that is to say, the profile of those who were in a posit ion to produce liter ature and exert some influenc e on the politic al, cultural and religious developments within their society. In literature, magic is frequently alig ned with one or more often a combination of the above categories of otherness. Medei a's sorcery, for instance, is to be understood as pertaining to her exotic origins, her divine ancestry and her femi ninity. The love potion of Deianeir a was the product both of feminine nature and of the worl d of mythologic al beasts. Magic in myth and poetry thus comes to be imbued with multiple categories of otherness - not-human, not-Gr eek, not-male. Literary works both respond to and help to construct such unders tandings of the place of magic in the society. 255Certain forms of ritual observance were open to being categorised as magical by virtue of their variously unsanctioned, unseemly, mysterious or transformative nature. In accordance with the philos ophical dualis ms first known to us from the Pythagorean tr adition, that which is boundles s, mysterious and sinister is implicitly aligned wit h that which is feminine, hence the tendency to view magic as an inherently feminine art. 256Bibliography Primar y source , 1st edn.
