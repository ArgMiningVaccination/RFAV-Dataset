The virus has plunged the industry into its worst-ever crisis, costing airlines an estimated US$510 billion in lost sales last year. Participants in the pilot scheme will need to take pre-departure Covid-19 tests, and will be able to view their results and whether they are confirmed to fly on the app. They will need to show their confirmed status in the app to check-in staff before their flight. Several other airlines, including Air New Zealand and Emirates, have signed up to trial the app. "}
