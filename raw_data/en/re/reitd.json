[Manage stress](/health/stress/manage-stress/) Bruises result from injuries to muscles and body tissues Bruises are a form of mild internal bleeding. They are caused by the release of small amounts of blood into the soft tissues of the body, specifically the connective tissue (under the skin) and muscles. They usually result from minor injuries such as: Tissue injured in these circumstances causes blood to leak from damaged [capillaries](/health/circulation/circulation-problems.php), and occasionally, small veins called venules. Blood seeps into surrounding tissue, dispersing into the connective tissue just under the skin. Blood lying close to the surface may become visible through the skin. Initially, bruises will have a purplish colour but with time, and as the collected blood is removed from body tissue by the [immune system](/health/immune-system/the-immune-system.php), the discolouration changes to yellow or green and finally disappears. More severe damage to body tissue may be accompanied by a greater degree of bleeding. This may lead to a more discrete collection of blood, discernable as a swelling in the body tissues - either just under the skin or in muscles. This is called a haematoma. Serious injuries can lead to more extensive loss of blood or internal bleeding - examples of this are seen in accidents such as falling from a height, severe falls from a bicycle or with the involvement of similar forces. These injuries of course, should be attended urgently by a doctor. Most bruises are mild, painless and do not require treatment as they will disappear and resolve spontaneously. However, some injuries can give rise to bruises which cause pain and discomfort. Examples of these are: In these circumstances, treatment as soon as possible following the injury will prevent more extensive bruising, helping the resolution of the injury as well as the bruise.

There are, however, a number of situations where bruises can be an indication of a more serious medical condition.
