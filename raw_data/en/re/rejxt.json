Core vaccinations are vaccines recommended for all horses living in the united states no matter of age, athletic use, or location. In horses these include Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis (EEE), Western Equine Encephalomyelitis (WEE), West Nile Virus (WNV), Rabies, and Tetanus. Three of theses diseases (EEE, WEE, and WNV) are severe life-threatening neurological diseases transmitted by insects such as mosquitoes. Because these diseases are transferred by insects' horses should receive their yearly booster before insects emerge in the spring. Often these vaccinations are combined with the other core vaccinations in one shot and is given as part of spring vaccinations. Foals and horses with no previous vaccinations should always receive an initial series of core vaccines followed by yearly spring boosters to be fully protected. Risk based vaccinations are recommended only for certain horses based on location, age, or exposure and should be discussed with your veterinarian prior to administration. Common risk-based vaccinations in Ohio include Equine Influenza (Rhino), Potomac Horse Fever (PHF), Botulism, and Strangles. Flu and Rhino are the most commonly given risk-based vaccines and are often combined in one shot. Flu/Rhino booster vaccination is recommended every 6 months (Spring and Fall) for horses who are less then 5 years old, live on a breeding farm or with pregnant mares, traveling/leaving farm premise, showing, or who are living at a farm with horses who are traveling or showing. Mares should receive more frequent herpesvirus vaccines through their pregnancy to protect against abortions caused by the herpesvirus. PHF vaccination is recommended in Ohio in the spring/early summer as most cases of the disease occur in the late summer and fall. Botulism vaccination is protective against only one type of botulism infection and is recommended only for horses who live or travel to certain areas or are fed high risk forage. Strangles vaccination is recommended for young horses with a high chance of exposure or for horses with low immunity to strangles and who have a high chance of exposure. Testing adult horse's titers to confirm low immunity before vaccinating is always recommended to reduce the risk of a severe strangles vaccine reaction. Vaccinations are recommended to be administered by a license veterinarian because vaccinations are effective against diseases only if stored and administered properly. To support this many vaccine companies, offer money to cover testing and treatment of any horses contracting diseases only if the horse has been specifically and appropriately vaccinated against the disease from a licensed veterinarian.
