Successful teams will support and engage with policymakers and/or implementing partners who are responsible for preventing and controlling cholera. Scheme at a glance - Career stage: - Early-career researcher, Established researcher, [Leading a research programme](/grant-funding/research-careers/stage-leading-a-research-programme), Mid-career researcher, [Postdoctoral research](/grant-funding/research-careers/stage-postdoctoral-research), Returning to research - Where your administering organisation is based: - Anywhere in the world (apart from mainland China) - Level of funding: Up to \u00a32.5 million - Duration of funding: Up to 5 years If you are disabled or have a long-term health condition, [we can support you with the application process](/grant-funding/guidance/disability-related-support-for-applicants). About this call Cholera is a disease which, if not controlled early and ideally prevented, can lead to large outbreaks and epidemics. Wellcome wants to fund research and support policy-making that will help affected communities prevent infectious diseases from escalating out of control - now and in the future. The tools to control and prevent cholera exist: surveillance; safe water, sanitation and hygiene; vaccines; and case management - but resources are limited and so more evidence is needed to help decision-makers decide where and how to deploy resources to the greatest effect. The oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is a vital part of the toolkit to both react to and prevent outbreaks, but there is a severely constrained supply, and effectiveness can vary across different populations and settings. The [Cholera Roadmap Research Agenda](https://www.gtfcc.org/cholera-roadmap-research-agenda/), launched in 2021 by the [Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC)](https://www.gtfcc.org/) with support from Wellcome, outlines many important priorities for research. This funding call aims to generate more evidence on three prioritised and connected areas: - defining hotspots to help target OCV campaigns, - the impact of different OCV dosing schedules: one dose, two dose and different dose intervals, and - the subsequent duration of protection provided according to age and pre-existing immunity. Given the importance of open and timely data sharing for evidence-informed responses to outbreak diseases, successful applicants will be required to share research findings and data relevant to any cholera outbreak or cholera vaccination campaign regularly during the lifetime of the grant and as widely as possible. This is in addition to Wellcome's standard grant conditions and policies on publication and open access. About your proposal Before applying Preliminary applications are not required but to help us select appropriate experts to review the application, please email [e.preparedness@wellcome.org](mailto:e.preparedness@wellcome.org) with the name of the country/countries where you are proposing to conduct the research study. No other information is required, and this doesn't commit you to submitting a full application. Please email us before 21st April 2023. Your application - what we're looking for and how it will be assessed The maximum word count for the project description in the application is 3,500 words. To help countries plan future preventative OCV campaigns, we need to strengthen cholera hotspot mapping and the evidence on the impact of one dose, two doses, and dose intervals. We are looking to support a range of studies in different settings so that we can build a clearer picture of how this impact and the subsequent duration of protection may change according to a community's history of exposure to cholera or OCV. The focus of the funding call is to generate useful and useable evidence for decision-making on the impact of OCV. To ensure the evidence reflects global and national context and needs, proposals must include activities to support policy engagement and research uptake. See the [research uptake](#ResearchUptake) section for specific requirements and expectations. Proposals must: - Generate evidence on the effectiveness and/or impact of OCV. - Include children under 5 in the study participants. - Measure the duration of protection, ideally including data from 3-5 years post vaccination. - Measure direct and indirect protection (population immunity). - Describe and justify the choice of study location and population and how this relates to the funding call priorities. - Include a risk mitigation plan. - Describe how the proposal aligns with and will feed into National Cholera Control Plans. - Include a description of how the study will engage with communities likely to be impacted by the research. - Include a dedicated section on the research uptake plan, with a dedicated budget allocated to this activity. If needed, your budget can include hiring a staff member where a proportion of their time will be dedicated to research uptake. [Guidance on developing a research uptake plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-uptake-guidance)is available from the FCDO. For example, a research uptake plan should include: - an initial mapping of relevant stakeholders and the local/national/global context - an assessment of internal and external research uptake capacity - an initial communication plan for regular and timely data and evidence sharing throughout the lifetime of the project - an initial outline of research uptake objectives and metrics. Successful proposals will be given additional support to further develop and tailor their research uptake plan at the start of the project to account for any changes to the global or national context that may have occurred between submitting an application and starting the study. Proposals may: - If appropriate, begin with or include hotspot mapping and transmission research that will generate data to support applications for future preventative vaccination campaigns. Proposals should demonstrate how this research is linked to the OCV research objectives. - Evaluate the impact of one or two doses of OCV. - If evaluating the impact of two doses, assess any time interval between doses. - Collect and analyse data from any previous, ongoing, or planned OCV study or campaign (reactive or preventative). It is anticipated that projects will start in 2024 but we recognise that the nature of outbreaks and supply constraints for OCV may make it challenging to plan certain research study designs at this time and in the future. If suitable, please include this in your risk mitigation plan. If needed, we will work with successful applicants on adjusting the plan if OCV supply and/or cholera epidemiology changes. - Use any study design suitable for generating robust evidence on the funding call priorities. - Be a new study or build off a pre-existing study. - Assess immunological responses as well as incidence. - Be based in one or more locations/countries. - Explore other complementary research priority questions outlined in the [Cholera Roadmap Research Agenda](https://www.gtfcc.org/cholera-roadmap-research-agenda/)from any Pillar (not limited to OCV). Proposals cannot ask for funds for the implementation of vaccination campaigns. Research uptake Wellcome expects successful applicants to design and conduct their research in collaboration with policy and/or implementation actors in order to be responsive to global/national/local needs and increase the likelihood of policy influence and research uptake. By policy or implementation actor, we mean those who can influence policy or decision-making around how vaccination campaigns are conducted. This includes but is not limited to the following: - policymakers - policy advisers from national or local government - national task forces - national or global non-government organisations (NGOs) - advocates - affected communities - the wider public. These actors can either be involved as coapplicants who are core members of the research team and commit a minimum of 20% of their time (see criteria for coapplicants in the [Eligibility section](#eligibility-and-suitability-79ec)), or collaborators that are essential to the delivery of the project but where there is no minimum time commitment. The research partnerships should be underpinned by equitable partnership principles. Learn more about equitable partnership principles from the [UK Collaborative on Development Research (UKCDR)](https://www.ukcdr.org.uk/guidance/equitable-partnerships-hub/). To further support research uptake, successful applicants will be: - invited to a workshop at the start of their grant to further develop and tailor the research uptake strategy (Wellcome will pay costs associated with attending the workshop and applicants do not have to cost this into their proposal) - invited to present or participate at relevant GTFCC meetings - asked to submit details of their project to the open access [GTFCC Research Tracker](https://www.gtfcc.org/cholera-research-tracker/) - required to submit a mid-project report on their research uptake strategy. Applicants can and should allocate budget specifically to research uptake activities. See ' [What we offer](#what-we-offer-a3bb)' for more information. Assessment criteria Applications will be reviewed by a panel of experts who will consider a series of criteria, including: - Strategic importance, approach, and methods - 50% - Which evidence gaps the study will address and the value of these for different locations. - The timeliness of the opportunity in the current cholera epidemic context and likely impact on decision-making. - Suitability, quality and feasibility of the study design and methods, including the proposed timeline for the study. - The choice of location/s. - How it aligns with the priorities set out in the GTFCC's Cholera Roadmap Research Agenda and the overall Ending Cholera Roadmap strategy. - The extent to which the proposal involves applicants and stakeholders from a cholera-affected country in the research, the communication, and the use of data and evidence. - The team, skills and experience - 25% - The research skills and experience of all team members, relative to their career stage and role. - Prior experience engaging with policy/implementing partners. - Research uptake skills or skills for translating research and evidence into accessible and actionable formats. For example, the ability to understand the decision-making context, or facilitate engagement with policy and practice stakeholders to support a dialogue between research and implementation. - The transdisciplinary nature of your research team and whether it contains the right combination of expertise. - Team structure and project management plans. - Research uptake, research capacity and capability strengthening - 25% - Quality and suitability of the research uptake plan. - Appropriate budget allocated. - The added value of any in-country research capacity strengthening and/or capability strengthening.

There is no minimum time commitment for collaborators. Collaborators There is no limit to the number of collaborators an application can have but the added value must be clear. Time spent away from research and part-time working You can apply if you've been away from research (for example, for a career break, maternity leave, or long-term sick leave). We'll allow for this when we consider your application. Lead and coapplicants can be part-time. There is no formal minimum, but part-time working needs to be compatible with delivering the proposal successfully. Who can't apply You cannot apply if you intend to carry out activities that involve the transfer of grant funds into mainland China. Restrictions if you are applying for or hold other Wellcome awards You can only be an applicant on a maximum of two applications to this funding call: - You can only be lead applicant on one application (but can be a coapplicant on one other), or - You can be a coapplicant on a maximum of two applications. You must be able to demonstrate that you can dedicate enough time and resources to both projects if funded. If you already hold other active awards with Wellcome from previous funding opportunities: - An early-career researcher can be a lead applicant on one Wellcome award and a coapplicant on one other Wellcome award. - A mid-career researcher can be a lead applicant on one Wellcome award and a coapplicant on two other Wellcome awards. - An established researcher can be a lead applicant on two Wellcome awards, one as the sole applicant and one as lead applicant for a team, or both as the lead applicant for a team. They can also be a coapplicant on two other Wellcome awards. What's expected of the administering organisation Your administering organisation can be a: - higher education institution - research institute - not-for-profit or government body. The lead and coapplicants must all be based at eligible organisations that can sign up to our [grant conditions](/grant-funding/guidance/grant-conditions) and [grant funding policies](/grant-funding/guidance/grant-funding-policies). We expect organisations based in the UK to meet the responsibilities required by the [Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers](https://researcherdevelopmentconcordat.ac.uk/) for institutions, managers and researchers. Any organisation which receives Wellcome funding that is based outside the UK is expected, at minimum, to follow the principles of the Concordat. We also expect your administering organisation to: - Give you, and any staff employed on the grant, at least 10 days a year (pro rata if part-time) to undertake training and continuing professional development in line with the Concordat. This should include the responsible conduct of research, research leadership, people management, diversity and inclusion, and the promotion of a healthy research culture. - Provide a system of onboarding, embedding and planning for you when you start the award. - Provide you with the status and benefits of other staff of similar seniority. If your administering organisation receives core funding from Wellcome, this award should not replace or lead to a reduction in existing or planned core support. What we offer - Duration of award: projects of any duration up to 5 years. The project must start within one year of the Award Letter being issued. - Level of funding: projects of any budget up to \u00a32.5 million. You should ask for a level and duration of funding that's justifiable for your proposed research. What we don't offer See 'Other costs' for costs we will and will not provide. We don't fund overheads unless they're eligible under our [overheads policy](/grant-funding/guidance/overheads-policy). Costs associated with implementing vaccination campaigns will not be supported. Lead applicant If you are based in the UK or the Republic of Ireland, you cannot ask for your salary. You can ask for a contribution to your salary if you are based in another high-income country (not UK or ROI) or a [low-and middle-income country (LMIC)](/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries) and hold a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract that states that you have to get your salary from external grant funding. The amount we pay will be proportionate to the time you contribute to the award, for example if you contribute 30% of your time to the award we will fund 30% of your salary. You will have to contribute at least 20% of your research time to this award. Your administering organisation must confirm: - that your employment contract states you must get salary recovery from external grant funding - that they will underwrite the salary and post for the period of time that you will be working on the grant. Coapplicants If any coapplicant employed on your grant holds a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract that states that they have to get their salary from external grant funding, you can ask us for a contribution to their salary in your application. The amount we pay will be proportionate to the time they contribute to the award, for example if they contribute 30% of their time to the award we will fund 30% of their salary. They will have to contribute at least 20% of their research time to this programme. Your administering organisation must confirm: - that the coapplicant's employment contract states they must get salary recovery from external grant funding - that they will underwrite the salary and post for the period of time that the person will be working on the grant. Coapplicants can also ask for salary where they: - Are employed by a charity, social enterprise or commercial organisation. The amount they request must be proportionate to the time they will spend on the grant. - Don't have a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract and they: - Will spend 80% of their time on this grant. They can ask for their full salary. Their post does not need to be underwritten and can be contingent on the application being successful. - Will spend less than 80% of their time on the grant. They can request a salary proportionate to the time they will spend on the grant. The administering organisation must guarantee space and salary support if they cannot get it from other sources for the period of time they are working on the grant. Their post cannot be contingent on the application being successful. - Are employed on the award as postgraduate research assistants. If they are to spend 100% of their time on the award, their post does not need to be underwritten by the administering organisation and can be contingent on the application being successful. Alternatively, coapplicants may get their salary through employment on another grant. Staff working on your programme We will cover the salary costs of all staff, full or part-time, who will work on your grant. Staff members may include: - research assistants or technicians employed on your grant - specialist service staff, for example data analysis, fieldwork and clinical studies - project manager, if you have multiple applicants on your programme - support if you or a member of staff employed on your grant is disabled or has a long-term health condition - see 'Disability-related adjustment support'. Teaching buyout If you're a humanities and social science researcher, you can ask for funds for research or teaching replacement to cover the cost of a temporary replacement lecturer. You must retain at least a 10% commitment to teaching. Costs: - can cover up to 33% FTE of your contracted time - are usually for a person at a more junior level than the postholder - can be spread across the full period of the grant. If you already get buyout costs from another grant (funded by Wellcome or elsewhere), you can ask us for this cost, but only for the period of time on your award when you won't receive buyout costs from another grant. You must provide a letter from your employing organisation, confirming that your contract includes a teaching commitment. You should include this in your grant application. PhD fees We do not provide studentships on this award. But if applicants employ a research assistant or a technician on the grant, they can ask for the costs to cover their Research Masters or PhD fees. Each applicant can ask for fees for one research assistant or technician at a time on the grant. We will only pay the international student fee rate for low- and middle-income nationals who are registered to study for a Research Masters or PhD in a high-income country. In all other situations, we will pay home student fees. Staff salaries should be appropriate to skills, responsibilities and expertise. You should ask your host organisation to use their salary scales to calculate these costs, which should include: - basic salary - employer's contributions, including any statutory obligations (for example, National Insurance contributions if you're based in the UK) and pension scheme costs - Apprentice Levy charges for UK-based salaries - any incremental progression up the salary scale - locally recognised allowances such as London allowance. You should allow for salary pay awards during Year 1. If the pay award is not yet known, applicants should use the International Monetary Fund inflation rate, selecting the 'inflation, average consumer price' option as indicator. From Year 2 onwards, you should use your organisation's current pay rates. We'll provide a separate inflation allowance for salary inflation costs. Read about the [responsibilities of grantholders and host organisations for people working on a Wellcome grant](/grant-funding/guidance/people-working-wellcome-grant). If you have named people on your grant whose salaries will be funded by Wellcome, you can ask for visa or work permit costs to help them take up their posts at the host organisation. You can also ask for: - visa costs for the person's partner and dependent children - essential associated costs, such as travel to attend appointments at a visa application centre or embassy, and essential English language tests - Immigration Health Surcharge costs for the person, their partner and dependent children if they will be in the UK for six months or more. If you or a member of staff working on your grant is disabled or has a long-term health condition, you can ask for adjustment support to help you carry out your project. Costs can include, but are not limited to: - additional costs for staff to help with day-to-day activities related to your project - assistive technology to help use computers, research equipment or materials - for example, text to audio software - care costs for assistance animals if you need to travel. We will not pay for capital or building costs, such as access ramps. You can ask for these costs if your government and/or employer: - does not cover any of the costs - only covers some of the costs (if they do, we will only meet the shortfall). The costs we provide must not replace the support you may get from the government or your organisation, who are responsible for providing these costs. If you don't know what these costs are now, you can [ask for them after we've awarded your grant](/grant-funding/guidance/disability-related-support-for-grantholders). You can ask for costs to cover the following types of training. Continuing professional development and professional skills training You can ask for a contribution towards these costs. Types of training can include: - research leadership, professional and people management skills - career development support - responsible conduct of research - diversity and inclusion - promotion of a healthy research culture. We expect your host organisation to provide and fund this training. However, if these types of training are not available, or the quality is inadequate, you can ask for up to \u00a3500 a year for you and each member of staff employed on your grant who will be: - in a post of 12 months duration or more, and - working on the grant for at least 50% of their time. You will need to justify these costs in your application. Research skills training You can ask for costs to cover training for the technical and research skills you need to deliver your proposed research. You can ask for whatever research skills training you need for you, and each member of staff employed on your grant, who will be: - in post for 12 months or more, and - working on the grant for at least 50% of their time. You will need to justify these costs in your application. Research uptake skills training You can ask for costs to cover training for the skills needed to deliver the activities in the research uptake plan. This could include knowledge brokering/knowledge translation courses or other training/courses aimed at research staff to better enable them to engage with policy and/or practice actors to facilitate the use of research evidence. You can ask for whatever research uptake skills training you need for you, and each member of staff employed on your grant, who will be: - leads on the research uptake strategy, or - who will be both: - in post for 12 months or more, and - working on the grant for at least 50% of their time. You will need to justify these costs in your application. We will pay for the materials and consumables you need to carry out your project, including: - laboratory chemicals and materials (for example, reagents, isotopes, peptides, enzymes, antibodies, gases, proteins, cell/tissue/bacterial culture, plasticware and glassware) - project-specific personal protective equipment (PPE) that is above the standard expected for the setting - printing associated with fieldwork and empirical research - associated charges for shipping, delivery and freight. You can ask for funds to buy animals if they are essential to your project. We will also fund the charge-out rates for animal house facilities if your organisation uses full economic costing methodology. These costs include: - running costs (including animal maintenance, any experimental procedures, licences and relevant staff training) - appropriate estates costs - cage and equipment depreciation costs, but not building depreciation costs. We may not pay the full charge-out rate for an animal house facility if we've provided significant funding towards the infrastructure and/or core support of the facility. If your organisation does not use full economic costing methodology to establish charge-out rates for animal house facilities, you can ask for funds to cover: - the cost of buying animals - running costs (including animal maintenance, any experimental procedures, licences and relevant staff training) - staff costs, for example, contributions towards the salaries of animal house technicians. We will not provide estates or depreciation costs. Equipment purchase You can ask for basic items of equipment that are essential to your research project. Costs may include purchase, delivery, installation, maintenance and training, where necessary. We will cover VAT and import duties if: - the usual UK exemptions on equipment used for medical research don't apply - you're applying from a non-UK organisation, and you can show these costs can't be recovered. You can also ask for specialised equipment if: - it is essential to the success of the proposed research project - it is not available at your host organisation or through collaboration, and - you'll be the main user and have priority access to the equipment. If a complete piece of specialised equipment costs \u00a3100,000 or more, we expect a contribution of at least 25% of the total costs, including maintenance, from the host organisation or another source. In some cases, we may expect a larger contribution. We'll discuss this with you after we've assessed your application. Contributions can include benefits in kind, such as refurbishment or the underwriting of a key support post. Multi-component items must not be broken down into component parts to avoid this contribution. Equipment maintenance We will cover maintenance costs for equipment if: - you are requesting it in your application - it is existing equipment that is: - funded by us or another source - essential to the proposed research project - more than five years old - cost effective to keep maintaining it. We won't cover maintenance costs for equipment if there is a mechanism in place to recoup these costs through access charges. Computer equipment We will cover the cost of one personal computer or laptop per person up to \u00a31,500. We won't pay for: - more expensive items, unless you can justify them - installation or training costs. You can ask for the cost of access to shared equipment, facilities or services if they're essential to your project. These may include materials and consumables, plus a proportion of: - maintenance and service contracts - staff time costs for dedicated technical staff employed to operate the equipment or facility. We don't cover the costs of: - estates and utilities - depreciation or insurance - other staff, for example, contributions towards departmental technical, administrative and management staff time. If the facilities or equipment were paid for by a Wellcome grant, you can only ask for access charges if: - the grant has ended - any support for running costs and maintenance contracts has ended. You can ask for overheads if your grant will be based at a: - university outside the UK or the Republic of Ireland - research organisation that does not receive core funding for overheads - charitable or not-for-profit organisation - small or medium-sized commercial organisation. You can also ask for overheads on any part of your grant that is sub-contracted to any of the organisations listed above. If you're based at a UK university, you can't ask for overheads for sub-contracted activity if your university will include the sub-contracted funding in its annual report to the UK Charity Research Support Fund. Overheads can include: - estates, for example, building and premises - non-project dedicated administrative and support staff - administration, for example, finance, library, and room hire. The total cost for overheads should not be more than: - 20% of the direct research costs if you're based in a low- or middle-income country - 15% of the direct research costs if you're based anywhere else. These costs must directly support the activity funded by the grant. How to apply for these costs In your grant application, you must: - give a full breakdown of costs (you can't ask for a percentage of the research costs) - explain why these costs are necessary for your research - include a letter from the finance director of your host organisation, or the sub-contracted organisation, confirming that the breakdown is a true representation of the costs incurred. Conference attendance You can ask for a contribution towards the costs of attending scientific and academic meetings and conferences, including registration fees and the costs to offset the carbon emissions of your travel. The limits are: - Grantholder - \u00a32,000 a year. - Research and technical staff on your grant - \u00a31,000 each a year. We provide costs to cover caring responsibilities if you or any staff employed on your grant attend a conference. This includes childcare and any other caring responsibility you have. We will pay these if: - Wellcome is providing the salary - the conference is directly related to the research - the caring costs are over and above what they'd normally pay for care - the conference organiser and their employing organisation are unable to cover the costs. You can ask for up to \u00a31,000 per person for each conference. Collaborative travel You can ask for travel and subsistence costs for collaborative visits for you and any staff employed on your grant. You'll need to justify each visit and its duration. Other travel We will pay for other essential visits, for example to facilities, for sample collection and for fieldwork. You can include subsistence costs. Carbon offset costs This applies to all types of travel costs Wellcome provides. You can ask for: - Essential travel costs, even if the low carbon option is more expensive (for example travelling by train instead of flying). - Project-related resources or activities that provide an alternative to travel, such as video conferencing, communication and file-sharing software. - Costs to offset the carbon emissions generated by the essential travel. If carbon offsetting for travel is not part of your organisational sustainability strategy, you can ask us for a similar level of support for other sustainability initiatives. Your organisation must get our approval before submitting an application. We won't pay for the core infrastructure that your administering organisation should provide, unless you're eligible to ask for these costs under our [overheads policy](/grant-funding/guidance/overheads-policy). Examples of these costs include: - organisation-wide video conferencing packages - high-speed broadband - HD screens. See our [carbon offset policy](/grant-funding/guidance/carbon-offset-policy-travel) for travel for information on what you and your organisation need to do. Subsistence costs If you're away for up to one month, you can ask for subsistence costs. These include accommodation, meals and incidentals (for example, refreshments or newspapers). If your administering organisation has a subsistence policy, use their rates. If your administering organisation doesn't have a subsistence policy, please use the [HMRC rates](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/expenses-rates-for-employees-travelling-outside-the-uk). If you're away for more than one month and up to 12 months, we will pay reasonable rental costs only, including aparthotels. You should discuss appropriate rates with your administering and host organisations, or Wellcome, as appropriate. We expect you to choose the most economical options, booked in advance where possible. If you're from a low- or middle-income country and will be working in a high-income country for more than one month and up to 12 months, you can also ask for up to \u00a310 a day to cover extra costs, such as transport and incidentals. If you're away for more than 12 months, we will pay the costs of your housing. You should discuss your needs with your administering and host organisations. The allowance we provide will be based on family and business needs. We will set the maximum allowance we pay for each location. This will be based on current market data or, where data is unavailable, in consultation with your administering organisation, using equivalent market rates. Please [contact us](/who-we-are/contact-us/funding-enquiry) if you need help calculating the costs. We will cover the direct expenses you have to pay to find and rent a home. We will not cover the cost of utilities or any refurbishment. Overseas research If you or any research staff employed on your grant will be doing research away from your home laboratory, we'll help with the additional costs of working on the project overseas. Please see the 'Overseas allowances' section for details. If you or any staff employed on your grant will be spending time in another country, we'll help you with the additional costs of working on the project overseas. Our overseas allowances are: - a contribution towards the personal cost of carrying out research overseas, to ensure that you are not disadvantaged - provided on the assumption that you'll be paying income tax, either in your home country or the country you will be working in (your personal tax is your responsibility). - provided on the understanding that you or your partner will not receive equivalent allowances from elsewhere - determined by the amount of time you will spend away from your home country. Carbon offset costs We expect the people we fund to choose travel that has a lower carbon impact, where practical, even if it's more expensive (for example travelling by train instead of flying). You can ask for costs to offset the carbon generated by the travel as part of your overseas allowances. If carbon offsetting for travel is not part of your organisational sustainability strategy, you can ask us for a similar level of support for other sustainability initiatives. Your organisation must get our approval for other sustainability initiatives to be included in applications. See our [carbon offset policy](/grant-funding/guidance/carbon-offset-policy-travel) for travel for information on what you and your organisation need to do. If you will be away more than 12 months, we will provide overseas allowances for your partner and any dependants if they are travelling with you. If you will be away for 12 months or less and can justify why your partner and dependants must travel with you, we may provide overseas allowances for them.

Your inflation allowance is based on your total eligible costs and the duration of the award. We will use an inflation allowance that reflects the inflation rate of the country where the host organisation is based using data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). You'll receive the following allowance if the costs in your application are in pounds sterling. |Award duration (in months)||Inflation allowance| |0-12||0.0%| |13-24||1.19%| |25-36||2.41%| |37-48||3.64%| |49-60||4.89%| The costs in your application must be based on current known costs, excluding inflation. You should allow for salary pay awards during Year 1. These should be based on pay awards already agreed; if you don't know what the pay award is yet then use the IMF rate for the currency your award will be made in. If your organisation receives [open access block grant funding](/grant-funding/guidance/open-access-guidance/open-access-funding), you can ask them to cover your open access article processing charges. If you're at an organisation that does not receive block grant funding, we'll [supplement your grant](/grant-funding/guidance/supplementary-grant-funding) when your paper has been accepted for publication. You cannot ask for these charges in your grant application. If you need to carry out clinical research using NHS patients or facilities, we will cover some of the research costs. Annex A of the [guidelines for attributing the costs of health and social care research and development (AcoRD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-attributing-the-costs-of-health-and-social-care-research) sets out the costs we cover, and which costs should be funded through the Department of Health and Social Care in England, or its equivalent in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
