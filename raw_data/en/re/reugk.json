However, CSC's chiropractors provide essential healthcare services for the spine, joints & sports injuries. Contact our center today to get treated by our award-winning chiropractor today! What Chiropractors Do And Are They Doctors Or Therapists? Chiropractors attend graduate-level university degree programs similar to medical doctors, podiatrists, and dentists. However, chiropractors are doctors of chiropractic and not medical doctors. The chiropractic profession is separate similar to dentistry. Chiropractors are best known for their ability to diagnose and treat spine, joint, and sports injuries. Chiropractic was discovered in 1895 by D.D. Palmer. It has grown tremendously! Today chiropractic is one of the fastest-growing fields in healthcare. The growth of chiropractic is attributed to their treatments for [neck pain,](https://www.mychiro.com.my/spine/neck-pain-treatment/) [back pain](https://www.mychiro.com.my/spine/back-pain-treatment/), and joint problems. Chiropractors think of themselves as doctors, not as medical doctors, but as doctors of chiropractic. Doctors of chiropractic use initial D.C. (Doctor of Chiropractic) and not MD (Medical Doctor) or MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery). Both the MD and the MBBS initials belong to the medical profession. The MD initials are more common in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia. MBBS is primarily used in the United Kingdom and the commonwealth nations. Are Chiropractors Physicians? Doctor of chiropractic or D.C. is an educational degree program specific to chiropractors. MD & MBBS are degrees for medical doctors and surgeons. Physicians are doctors of medicine and surgery. Some physicians are family doctors, general practitioners (GPs), surgeons, pediatricians, cardiologists, psychiatrists, EENTs, dermatologists, pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, and gynecologists. In most countries, including Malaysia, chiropractors are not classified as physicians. In some countries like the United States, chiropractors use the term \"chiropractic physician\" or \"doctor of chiropractic\" to distinguish them from medicine, surgery, and the medical profession. Do Medical Doctors Accept Chiropractic? Most medical doctors accept chiropractic care. Some are chiropractic patients. In the old days, there were lots of animosities towards chiropractic. These resentments were the results of turf wars. Historically, medical doctors have a dislike for any alternative care system. The resentment of chiropractic among some healthcare fields is because most are unaware of the profession and really don't understand how chiropractors help their patients. Some have a dislike for any profession that treats the ill. In recent times this has changed. The change results from published studies demonstrating the effectiveness of [chiropractic treatments](https://www.mychiro.com.my/chiropractor-malaysia/chiropractic-treatment/) for the spine and joints. A Guide To Doctor Of Chiropractic Since our inception, we have treated thousands who suffered from [spine joint and sports injuries](https://www.mychiro.com.my/services/spine-joint-rehabilitation/). Our clinical successes in treating spine and orthopedic conditions have propelled our centers to greater heights of prominence in Malaysia and beyond. Our Doctor of Chiropractic has treated royalties, dignitaries, business people, and patients from all walks of life. Consequently, we treated patients from all over the world. Patients have come to us from Africa, Europe, the Middle East, China, and India. Those who have sought our help wanted an effective alternative to drugs and surgery. Most noteworthy, in almost all cases, we succeeded in superseding their expectations. For most, the art and science of chiropractic were new. The most common question we get concerns chiropractic practice and a chiropractic doctor's qualifications (chiropractor). And it has resonated with us, and we have decided to shed some light on this subject for better understanding. There are approximately 100,000 chiropractors in practice in the world today. Over 70% either practice or have received their education in America. Therefore, we have decided to provide educational and qualification backgrounds about chiropractors that practice or are educated in the United States. Who Discovered Chiropractic? Daniel David Palmer discovered chiropractic and established the first school of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. Over 40 colleges and universities currently offer educational programs towards the Doctor of Chiropractic degree, with the vast majority being in North America (approximately 23 higher learning institutions). Like other healthcare professions, the practice of chiropractic and the educational requirements have become stringent. The most common degree in chiropractic today is the doctorate, Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.). In the United States, the Doctors of Chiropractic (D.C.s) have some of the strictest licensing and educational requirements. As a result, the curriculum includes a minimum of 4,200 hours of classroom. In short, the average D.C. program has classroom hours that are equivalent to Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) school curricula. The U.S. Federal Medical Program and almost all states designate Doctors of Chiropractic as physician-level providers. The essential services that D.C.s provide are also available through the U.S. federal health delivery systems. They include those administered through Federal Workers' Compensation, Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, U.S. Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, Medicaid, and all state workers' compensation programs. So, Chiropractors and the profession of Chiropractic have thoroughly been proven helpful. It has been two times more effective than the traditional allopathic models of care. The Typical Chiropractic Education (The Doctor Of Chiropractic Degree From The U.S.) A typical chiropractic college applicant has a four-year degree (Bachelors) before commencing their doctorate in Chiropractic. The requirements get even more demanding after the student has gained acceptance into an accredited chiropractic college. The standard is four or five academic years' worth of professional study. Due to chiropractic practice having a hands-on nature and the intricate adjusting techniques that need to be learned, clinical training takes up a significant portion of the total study time. A rigorous education in all healing scientists is received by chiropractors, similar to what medical doctors get. So, in areas like public health, nutrition, rehabilitation, physiology, radiology, and anatomy, chiropractors have a more rigorous educational requirement. Like many other primary health care doctors, chiropractic students spend a great deal of their curriculum time studying clinical subjects related to evaluating and caring for patients. Typically, professional training includes completing a clinical-based program of a minimum of one year that deals with actual patient care. The total curriculum consists of a minimum of 4,200 hours of classroom, laboratory, and clinical experience. An accrediting agency that the U.S. Department of Education recognizes approves the course of the study. This has been true for over 25 years. The Doctor Of Chiropractic Is Better When It Comes To Spine, Joint & Sports Injury Treatments. Educational and Qualification for a Doctor of Chiropractic is stringent and rigorous: Making them the Best Non-Surgical caregivers for the Spine and Joint Disorders. The National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) governs the licensure and certification of U. S. Chiropractors. The U.S strictly governs chiropractic education in the United States of America. One such governing entity is the [Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE)](https://www.cce-usa.org/). Their sole responsibility is to ensure that Universities teaching Chiropractic meets or exceeds the U.S. Government requirement for a Chiropractic Physician. Chiropractic doctors must pass their board exam given by the [U.S. National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE)](https://www.nbce.org/). Each practicing Doctor of Chiropractic must obtain a license from their respective state in the United States. Chiropractors must meet annual continuing education requirements to maintain their licensure. Strict Laws & Regulations Govern The Practice & Licensing Of Chiropractic The education, licensing, and scope of practice for chiropractors vary throughout the world. Today, over 100 countries recognize chiropractic care as a useful alternative for musculoskeletal disorders and injuries. In Malaysia, the profession is experiencing rapid growth. In 2011, IMU launched a bachelor's degree program that is similar to the Australian requirements. Regardless of the level of education, chiropractors have proven to be the most effective alternative care providers wherever they practice. The techniques, skills, and knowledge of a chiropractor have improved the lives of so many.
