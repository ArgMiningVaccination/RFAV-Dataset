Recent in vitro studies su ggest that the concentration of thim erosal, and subsequently ethyl m ercury, present in vaccines is not cytotoxic. A paucity of studies done specif ically with thim erosal has led lawm akers to base regulations on the toxicological profile of methyl m ercury. However, recent in vivo studies show a m arked difference in the to xicolog ical profiles of ethyl m ercury, a thim erosal, and m ethyl m ercury. Neither in vitro nor in vivo stud ies, then, im plicate th imerosal as a toxic agent at the con centratio ns presen t in vaccine s. Epidem iological studies have been conducted in various countries assessing if a causal relationsh ip exists between autis m and thim erosal-con taining vac cines. Thou gh that the ethyl mercury in thim erosal m ay cause neurotoxicity, which m ay lead to autism , large scale epidem iological studies have not be en able to support this claim . In 2004, after critica l review of major epidem iological stud ies, ittee rele ased a report s tating that a r elationship between autism and m ercury was not found. The m edia, however, (m ainly sm all, local sources) have disp roportionately covered stories supporting a link, taking ad vantage of the desperation felt by those personally affected b y autism in o rder to incre ase sales. This, in tu rn, has caused m any parents, especially parents of autis tic ch ildren, to be hesitant to v accinate thei r children. In order to address th is, thim erosal was rem oved from all vaccines in the US m arket. While not justified in term s of r educing th e risk of autism, the rem oval of th imerosal was ju stified in tha t it ensures that m islead parents will continue to vaccinate th eir ch ildren. 1Autism is a neurological disorder that is char acterized by deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication, social interaction, and repetitive behaviors or interests. Autism technically consists of five disorders with varying seve rity\u2014term ed autism spectrum disorders\u2014and is now estim ated to affect as m any as on e in every 166 children. W hile research continues to investigate this disorder, which was first identified in 1943, as of now there are no known causes of autism and no consisten t findin g as to the changes that o ccur in the brains of autistic patients . Because of this, diagnosing and treating autism are challenging endeavors.1 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Mode rnization Act of 1997 prom pted a review of m ercury-containing drugs by th e FDA. This review lead to a co ncern for th e usage of thimerosal-containing vaccines, re vealing that certain vaccines used since 1991 contained ethyl mercury lev els that, for a six -month-old infant, were higher th an the Environm ental Protection Agency (EPA) standard set in 1995. Due to th e neurotoxicity known to be caused by m ethyl mercury,2 a concern aro se for the p ossibility of a causal relationship between ethyl m ercury poisoning in children under two years of age who wer e receiv ing thim erosal-containing vaccines.3 This has raised concern among the general population for the potential of thim erosal- contain ing vaccines as b eing instru mental in producing the developm ental defects observed in autis tic children. However, given the low doses of m ercury present in vaccines, s ubsequent in vitro, in vivo, and epidem iological st udies not corroborate ry of Thimerosal and Its Toxicolog ical Mechanism The m ercurial com pound added to vaccines is so dium ethylm ercurithiosalicy late, also known as thimerosal. The structure of thim erosal is shown in Figure 1. Thim erosal is first m etabolized to 2ethyl m then inorganic m ercury. The inorganic m ercury is found to preferentially build up in the brain and kidneys of anim als and humans at high doses. When added to vaccines, thim erosal is found to Figure 1: Thimerosal4 challenge the grow th of bacteria and fungi. A review artic le written by Leslie Ball nice ly outlin es the history of thim erosal use in childhood v accines.5 Ball claim s public hea lth d isasters in the early 1900s confirm ed the need for preservatives in vaccines. In 1916 the adm inistration of T yphoid vaccin e, contam inated with the bacteria Staphylococcus Aureus , led to four fatalities and 60 cases of morbidity in South Carolina.6 In 1928, vaccinations with diphtheria toxi n-antitoxin vaccine, contam inated with Staphylococcal , resulted in 12 of 21 children given the vaccine from the sam e vial dying. In light of these and other events, th e United State s introdu ced thim erosal as a prese rvative in m ulti- dose vials o f vaccine in the 1930s. Few high-d ose toxicity studies were done before the m ass distribution of thi merosal-infused vaccines. Th e studies were conducted in rabbits, rats, m ice, dogs, and guinea pigs.7 The anim als were given a 1% intravenous dose of thimerosal and observed for seven days. The m aximum tolerated doses w ere found to be 20 m g/kg in rabbits and 45 m g/kg in rats. A utopsies of the dogs rev ealed no m ajor tissue changes. The guinea pigs underwent severe pain after adm inistration of a 0.1% dose, but no pain was seen with 1/4000 and 1/8000 dose dilutions. No control anim als were lis ted in the study. The s ubject was revisited in 1971, when Fisher rats were give n doses of thim erosal between 30 and 1000 \u00b5g/Kg for one year. The dosed rats were found to exhibit a dose-dependent in cidence of bronchopneum onia. However, quantitative data were only collected in the high-dose range. Studies attempting to define the toxicity of thim erosal at low doses are a recent phenom enon, and theref ore data is still sparse. Current health regulations are based on the toxic 3effects of methyl m ercury, a rela ted com pound with a supposedly si milar toxicological profile as ethyl m ercury. The differences between m ethyl and ethyl mercury uptake and m etabolism highlight the need for m ore research to be done on ethyl m ercury so that thim erosal can be regulated m ore effectively. A study done in 1985 on the com parative toxicology of methyl and ethyl m ercury in anim als demonstrates that th e metabolism of ethyl mercury, a m etabolite of thim erosal, leads to higher concentrations of inorganic m ercury in th e blood, brain, and kidneys of rats than does an equivalent dose of m ethyl m ercury.8 W eight loss and nephrotoxicity (renal dam age) were greater in rats dosed with ethyl m ercury. Howe ver, the neurotoxic effect s of ethyl and m ethyl mercury were sim ilar at high-doses around 10m g/kg. The study also showed that clearance rates of ethyl m ercury were faster th an m ethyl m ercury; thus, the to tal time cells were exposed to mercury was less in the case of ethyl m ercury. A newer study, done in 2004 at the National Ins titutes of Health, sugg ests a sign ificant difference between the pharm acokinetics of methyl and ethyl m ercury and different routes of administration.9 Less of the dose containing ethyl m ercury or thim erosal reach ed th e brain than did the dose of containing m ethyl m total m ercury concentration in the bl ood, brain, and kidney as com pared to oral administration...The percent of m ercury that r eached the brain was significan tly less in th e mature anim al as compared to the young.\" Co mparing oral m ethyl m ercury exposures to intram uscular ethyl m ercury exposures, then, m ay not be perm issible. An in vitro study exposing hum an neurobla stom a and glioblastom a cells to 2.5 - 20 \u00b5M/L of thim erosal produced results sim ilar to a study exposing neural cells to m ethyl m ercury, suggesting a sim ilarity in m echanism at the cellular level.10 The st udy, com pleted at th e University of Arkansas, proposes that th e intracellular defense again st ino rganic m ercury is 4glutathione (GSH), a molecule m ade of cystei ne, glycine, and glutam ic acid. The sulfhydryl group on cysteine binds the inorga nic m ercury and prevents it fr om binding to sulfhydryl groups on cellular proteins. It is thought that cytotoxi city results from inorganic m ercury binding to proteins and decreasing their stab ility. Neural cells do not synthe size cy stein e becau se they do not have the key enzyme cystathionine gamm a lyase, which is instrum ental in the production of glutathione. Thus, neural cells depend on the liver for producing cysteine. If levels of GSH ar e low, the unbound inorganic m ercury is free to engage with proteins. Incu bation of glioblastom a and neuroblastom a cells with thim erosal show a decrease in cell vi ability with an incre ase in dose, from 2.5 to 20 \u00b5M. A dose of 10 \u00b5M thim erosal resulted in 50% cell viability in comparison to control cells. Neuroblastom a cells we re found to be m ore sensitive to thim erosal than glioblastom a cells. Overall, this study co nfirm ed the sim ilarity between m ethyl m ercury and ethy l mercury in n eural cells at the c ellular level. The concentration s of thim erosal us ed in the study were significantly hi gher than those used in vaccine s, therefore th e study did not investigate the effect of low-doses of thim erosal on neural cells. A study done at Baylor College of Medi cine shows the effect of nanomolar concentratio ns of thim erosal on human co rtical neuronal cells and hum an fibroblasts.11 After six hours of incubation with 2 \u00b5M of thim erosal, 11% of the cortical ne urons had com promised cellular m embranes, and after si x hours of incubation with 250 \u00b5M of thim erosal, 100% neurons had comprom ised cellular m embranes. Cells with com promised cell m embranes were also found to have DNA da mage (m easured using a TUNEL assay). Incubation tim e was increased fro m six hours to 24 hours for concentr ations below 2\u00b5M. No DNA da mage was seen at concentrations of thim erosal below 1\u00b5M (1 25, 250, and 500 nM) after 24 hours of incubation. Apoptotic m orphology, assessed under a fluorescent m icroscope qual itatively, was seen after six hours of incubation in 2\u00b5M of thi merosal and af ter of in thim erosal. 5Caspase-3, a m arker of apoptosis, was also present in 20% of the cells incubated in 2 \u00b5M and 97% of the neurons incubated in 250 \u00b5M of thimerosal. Overall, this study implicates concentrations of 1 - 250\u00b5M of thim erosal in neural toxicity. Howe ver, the study does not extend incubation tim e beyond 24 hours. Just as the toxic effects that were seen at 2\u00b5M of thimerosal after six hours were not seen at the two-hour m ark, it is possible that neurons incubated with concentrations of thim erosal belo w 1 \u00b5M may need to be incubated for m ore than 24 hours to observe cytotoxicity. In vivo studies show that ethyl m ercury is able to cross cell mem branes and get converted to inorgan ic mercury intracellularly.12 The buildup of inorganic m ercury occurs preferentially in the brain and kidneys. A study done at the NI H shows the differentia l uptake in m ethyl-, ethylm ercury, and thim erosal in postnatal m Table below).13 This da taset has s everal implication s. Firs t, it shows how the di stribution of inorganic mercury in the postnatal m ouse varies. Secon d, it dem onstrates that oral adm inistration of methyl mercury results in m uch greater accum ulations of m ercury than does th e intram uscular administration. Additionally, it is evident that once m ercury reaches the tissues, it is cleared at a 6very slow rate. Finally, the data confirm previous f indings th at mercury s ituates itse lf mainly in the kidneys and brain. This dataset also varies from that of adult m ice, suggesting that the uptake and m etabolism of m ercury differs in adu lt and postnatal m ice. These results have s trong implications for the regulation of thim erosal in v accin es. This stu dy focuses on m ercury distribution, and does not exam ine the effect of low doses of thim erosal on developing m ice. No extensiv e toxicolog ical studies have been done using hum ans. Cas es of accidental methyl m ercury poisoning in Ir aq, Japan, and the Ferroe Islands suggest that high doses of mercury are toxic to hum ans. \"Maternal m ethyl m ercury exposure in these epidem ics was associated with neuro logical abno rmalities, su ch as delay s in m otor function, am ong child ren exposed in utero.\"14 However, the differences between m ethyl m ercury and thim erosal and the differences between oral and intr amuscular do ses m ake it difficult to ex trapolate from such case- studies to th e effect of vaccines c ontaining thim erosal on you ng child ren. Overall, the toxicological data from in vitro and in vivo st udies suggest th at thimerosal and ethyl m ercury, at th e concentrations found in vaccines, are not toxic. The in vitro study don e at Baylor College of Medicine im plicated 1 \u00b5M 250 \u00b5M (101m g/l) of thim erosal as inducing toxic effects, such as com promised cell m embranes and apoptotic m orphology.15 However, during vaccin ation, e most 403 \u00b5g of thim erosal, which is equivalen t to (thim erosal is roughly 49% ethyl m ercury). At the 5th, 50th, and 95th% of female weight at birth, the Ba ylor group contends that 200/3. 81 = 52 \u00b5g/kg, 200/5.22 = 38 \u00b5g/kg, and 200/6.27 = 32 \u00b5g/ kg dose of m ercury is adm inistered, respectivel y. The 1 \u00b5M dose is claim ed to be \"less than four tim es higher than some of these estim ated concentrations.\" Few other studies have sought to determ ine the eff ect of thim erosal at low doses because m ost cellu lar changes were o nly seen at higher do ses. Thus, the studies focused m ore on m echanis ms than determ ining a safe threshold. 7The in vivo studies sho w the distrib ution of mercury in animal bodies. T he accum ulation of inorganic m ercury in the br ain and kidneys has been confir med by several in vivo studies. Similar to the in vitro studies, few in vivo stud ies have been done to study the safe threshold level of thim erosal in anim als. Hum an cases of methyl m ercury poisoning s how that toxic effects occur at 3m g/kg. However, given the differences in m ethyl m ercury and thim erosal ber has little sig nificance to the issue of childhood v accinations. Although to xicolog ical data have not yet been able to determ ine a conc rete thre shold level, b elow which no toxic effects occur, it is most likely true that the concentrat ion of thim erosal found in vaccines is not toxic accord ing to data p resented thus far. Epidem iological data also suggest that the levels o f thimerosal found in vaccines do not contribute to toxicity. Epidemiolo gical Studie s Following the discovery that the ethyl m ercury dos e in certain th imerosal containing vaccines administered to infants exceeded th e 1995 EPA sta ndard, th e scien tific community followed suit by perform ing various epidem iologi cal stud ies. The up roar in the concern for thim erosal- contain ing vaccines and their possi ble associatio n with autis m was due to a link m ade with the neurotoxic effects of anothe r mercurial com pound, m ethyl m ercury. However, major studies with varying population sizes, designs, controls, and locations have not been able to show that a causal relationship exists. In 2003, an ecological study was released by Madsen et al. evaluating the incidence of autism from 1971 to 2000 from Danish population ba sed data, where vaccine coverage has been greater than 90% since 1979. Th imerosal-containing vaccines adm inistered to children were 8Figure 2. Results of Madsen et al. study Graph removed for copyright reasons. Figure 1 from Madsen et al. used in Denm ark from the 1950s until 1992. Fr om 1961 to 1970 th e thim erosal-containing diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine was adm inistered in four doses at ages 5, 6, 7 and 15- months; this m eans that each child who wa s adm inistered all four doses receiv ed 400 \u00b5g of thimerosal (200 \u00b5g of e thyl m ercury). From 1970 to 1992 the thim erosal-containing whole- pertussis vaccine was adm inistered in th ree do ses at ages 5-weeks, 9-weeks, and 10-months; thi s means that each child who was admini stered all three doses received 250 \u00b5g of thim erosal (125 \u00b5g ethyl m ercury). The hypothesis of the Madsen et al. study is that if thim erosal-containing vaccin es and autism are correlated, then the incidence of autism among the population of in terest would decrease following the removal of thim erosal-containing vaccines . The cases observed (958) are obtained through the Danish Pediatri c Central Research Register an d consist of children between the ages of 2 and 10-years- old diagnosed with autism .16 The study m easures the annual incidence of au tism by differentiating by age and gender. The f irst da y that sym ptoms of autism were rec orded is referred to as the point time for each autistic case. Each ca lculation of incidence was done by ta king the num ber of people with their first diagno sis of autism in each age band for each year (s ee Figure 2) and divided by the total 9number of people in Denm ark within that age band and year. A tim e series analysis of incidence of autism per 10,000 people of the population at risk was generated and com pared with the ke y dates con cerning thim erosal usage.17 The results of the study (see Figure 2) revealed interesting findings. During the period of 1970 to around 1990, when thim erosal vaccines were adm inister ed throughout the country, the incidence of autism remained relatively constant. The incidence began to rise around 1991 and continued to do so even after the gradual rem oval of thim erosal-con taining vaccines after 1992. As Madsen et al. discus s, the increase in incide nce m ay be attributable to a shif t in the crite ria requirem ents for diagnosis of autism, from the In ternational Classificati on of Diseases (ICD)-8 to the m ore recen t ICD10 as well as a growing aw areness for autism . Moreover, Madsen et al. recognize that incidence rates m ay have shown an increase after 1995 because the methodology of the ecological study does not account for th e inclusion of outpatients (prior to 1995, only inpatients w ere included in the registry) who were labeled as \"first diagno sed\" for a certain year but actually were probably di agnosed outside of the regi stry earlier than that.18 A prospective study w as released in 2003 by Hviid et al. that included the entire population of Denmark born from January 1, 1990 until Dece mber 31, 1996 in its study attem pting to determ ine if a causal relationsh ip exists between thim erosal-con taining vaccines and autism . The study consists of a total population size of 467,450 people. The aim of this particular study was to determ ine the rate ratio of autism cases am ong two cohorts: one Table 1. Results of Hviid et al. study Table removed for c opyright reasons. See Hviid et al. 10consisting o f receiv ed the thim erosal-con taining whole-cell pertuss is vaccine and the other co nsisting of child ren who receiv ed the same vaccine but w ithout thim erosal. This particular ty pe of study is possible because of the whole-cell pertussis vaccinatio n history of Denm ark. Until late M arch 1992, all th ree doses of the whole-cell pertussis vaccin e com bined contained 250 \u00b5g m ercury), and afte r this the thimerosal-f ree version of the vaccine was used until January 1, 1997. Hviid et al. also attem pts a dos e-response analys is in child ren with respec t to thim erosal by com paring cohorts differentiated by the number of doses of whole- cell pertus sis vaccine actual ly received by the children.19 The Hvi id et al. study consists of a tota l sam ple size of 467,450 people. Inform ation on the autistic spectrum disorder diagnoses was obtained from the Da nish Psychiatric Central Register. The researchers breakdow n of the popul ation acco rding to who received the whole-cell pertuss is vaccine and which type, and the num ber of thim erosal-con taining vaccin ations received can be viewed in Tab le 1. The resu lts of the st udy did not reveal a sign ificant dif ference in the rate of autism a mong a population o f children w ho receiv ed the thim erosal-con taining whole-cell pertussis vaccine and those who di d not. The rate ratio fully adju sted for age, calendar period, child's sex, location of birth, birth weight, etc (see Table 1) was 0.85 ( 95% CI: 0.60-1.20) and other auti stic spectrum disorder s, respectively. In addition, a trend was not observed that revealed a dose-response relationship between autism and thimerosal (which was calcu lated as th e increase in the rate ratio per 25 \u00b5g increase in ethyl mercury). Hviid et al . also found a statistically significant increase in the incidence of autism and other autistic spectrum disorder s from 1990 to 1996, with rate ratios of 1.24 (95% CI: 1.17-1.31) for autism and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.16-1.27) for other autistic spectrum disorders.20 The study evaluated various biases that m ay have affected the outcom e of the study. After read justing the pe riod for which the whole-cell pertussis vaccin e was considered to be free 11of thi merosal to correct for any stray th imerosal-con taining vaccines that m ay have been administered after thim erosal wa s \"officially\" rem oved from vaccine s, the rate ratios for bo th autism and other autistic spectrum disorders did not change m uch; 0.87(95% CI: 0.61-1.23) and 1.15 (95% CI: 0.90-1.47), dose res ponse was again not observed. Furtherm ore, the study attem pted to increase its robustness by using a more hom ogenous sam ple cohort by limiting the study to children bor n between 1991 to 1993. Again, sim ilar rate ratios resulted, and no dose-response relationship was observed.21 There are a few notable factors that m ay have affected the outcom e of this study. It is important to note, as with the Madsen et al. stud y, the different criteria used to clas sify autism throughout the study period. Fr om 1991-1993, the IOD8 wa s used, and from 1994 t o 2000, the IOD10 was used by the child psychiatrists who made the diagnosis o f each autism case. I n addition, the date of diagnosis of autism for each case m ay vary significantly from the actually onset of symptom s because of the len gthy process involved in diagnosing autism . The W akefield et al. study of 1998 brought much attention to autism among both the academ ic and general population with its suggestion o f an association between \"autistic entero colitis\" and the MMR vaccine. Though th e MMR vaccine nev er contained thim erosal, the study of its relationship with auti sm is very sim ilar to that of thim erosal-containing vaccines and is im portant in trying to determ ine if causality exists be twee n vaccines and autism in genera l, since epidem iological s tudies for th imerosal an d autism have not shown causality. Wakefield et al. proposed causation of autism by the adm inistra tion of live m easles viru s. Though conclusions made by the W akefield et al. study received m uch attention from concerned parents (sim ilar to that of the thim erosal and autism situation), th e study has not been supported by the m ajority of epidem iological studies that followed by it. In addition, though the Wa kefield et al. study discusses much about possible links between au tism and gastrointestinal diseases, it did not 12mention explic itly whe re or how MMR vaccines f actor into this, on ly that \"th e onset of behavioural sym ptoms was associated, by the pa rents, with m easles, m umps, and rubella vaccination in eigh t of the 12 ch ildren.\"22 An im portant note to m ake is that 10 of the 12 original authors of the W akefield et al. pub lication retracted thei r claim s in the article: We wish to m ake it clea r that in this paper no causal link wa s established between MMR vaccine and au tism as the data were insufficient. How ever, the po ssibility of such a link was raised and consequent events have had major im plications for public health. In view of this, we consid er no w is the appropria te tim e that we should together form ally retract the interp retation placed upon these findings in the paper, according to p receden t.23 Studies following the publication of the W akefiel d et al. study suggest th at the tim ing of the MMR vaccination and the onset o f autism are m erely a coincid ence, and the relationsh ip suggested in the W akefie ld et al. study has not been supported.24 In June of 1999 The Lancet published an epidem iological study by Taylor et al. The main goal of the study was to analyze the trends in the incidence of autism before and after the introdu ction of the MM R vaccine in October of 1988. The results of the study su ggest that a \"step-up\" in incidence of autism did not occu r after the introduction of the MMR. The study consisted of the evaluation of 498 cases of autism , and the experim ental subjects were children with autism born since 1979, from eight health distri cts of North Thames, UK. The 498 cases were identified as core autism (261), atypical autism (166), or Asperger's syndrom e (71). The autis tic diagnosis of each case was checked agai nst th e criteria s et by the ICD10 for the ages between 18-months and 3-years.25 The evalu ation of the v ariables in th e study consisted of a Poiss on regression of autis m cases from 1979 to 1992 to analyze trends in th e tim e series of cases. The second analysis consisted of com paring the age of diagnosis for autistic children w ho did receive the MMR vaccine and those who did not. Th is was done by splitting the cas es up into th ree catego ries 13(with the effect of each birth cohort contro lled for): child ren who received the MMR vaccine before the age of 18 m onths, children who did no t receive th e vaccine, a nd children who received the vaccin e after 18 m onths of age. As a corr ection factor for this analysis, the M MR vaccine coverage was shown to not diffe r significantly between the cases eva luated and th e entire birth cohort of the North East Tham es re gion. The third analysis consisted of a case-series m ethod, which does not involve a control group. Three va riables were analyzed in order to assess a possible temporal association between autism and the MMR vaccination : the age of diagnosis of autism , the recorded age of parental concern, an d the onset age at reg ression (th e point at which behavioral retardation begins). The tim e series analysis revealed a statisti cally significant upward tr end in core autism and atyp ical autism and a \"nearly s ignifican t\" trend for Asperger's syndrom e. A \" step-up\" in autism cases was not evident in or after 1987. The study also did not find a significant difference of age at which diagnosis occurred upon evaluatio n of autistic children who were vaccinated before 18 months (233/346 cases ), who were never vaccinated (64/356 cases) and who were vaccinated after 18m onths of age (5 9/356). Co ncerning the onset of autism within 1 or 2 years after vacc ination of MMR, ther e was no temporal ass ociation detected, with the re lative incidence being 1.09 (0.79-1.52) and the c ontrol being 0.94 (95% C.I: 0.60-1.47) There were two m ajor lim itations to the st udy. The first was that there was wide variation in the quality of the c linical notes involved with each di agnosis of autism , which lim its the accuracy of the stud y. Taylor et al. used these clinical n otes to evaluate the point reference signifying the tim e of diagnosis. Another lim itation of the study is that it does not determ ine whether prevalence of autism increased over the period of study, though it does suggest an increase in incidence.26 14The epidem iological studies con ducted fo llowing the FDA review of thi merosal- contain ing vaccine s have not sho wn that a c ausal rela tionship exis ts with autis m. A critic al analysis of autism and thim erosal studies by the Institu te of Medicine (IOM) r esulted in th e release of the eighth and final report in 2004 sta ting that no causal rela tionship exists between thimerosal-contain ing vaccines and autism . In addition, a causal relationsh ip between th e childhood MMR vaccine and autism has not been supported by epidem iological data as well, supporting further th at som e environ mental agen t outside of vaccines is perhaps the cause for th e notable increase in incidence of autism over th e years. H owever, it is im portant to note that inciden ce measurem ents of autism may be on the rise due to better awareness of autism and therefore higher rates of diagnos is over tim e. Though these epidem iological studies have thus far strongly favored that a cau sal relationship does not exist between thim erosal-containing vaccines an d autism , the concern of parents of autistic ch ildren on this is sue has not waned over the years, largely due to influen ces of the m edia and the lack of knowledge of the actual causes of autism . Media Coverage and Public Opin ion In an online survey conducted in F ebruary of 2005 by MSNBC, over 88,000 people voted for what they considered to be responsible for the recent rise in autism cases. From the choices, which included, a mong others, \"m ore awareness,\" \"b etter diagnosis,\" and \"genetics,\" \"childhood exposure to m ercury or other toxins,\" making it the second m ost popular selection behind only \"a com bination of factors.\"27 Despite the ep idemiologica l evidence just discussed that s uggests otherwise, a large portion of the population (or at least a large portion of the population that would be looking at MSN BC's online autism coverage\u2014 arguably parents and other pers ons affected by autism ) believe s that m ercury exposure is 15responsible for the rise in autis m cases. If the evidence suggest s that there is no connection between m ercury and autism , how and why are the people m ost affected by autism believing otherwise? To answer this question one m ust look at th e media coverage of the autism epidem ic. There are two purposes a m edium can choose to fu lfill: inform ing its audience or m aking as large a profit as possible. Recognized national m edia sources tend, m ore times than not, to provide objective views of issues by presen ting all the facts. These sources , however, have such strong reputations that perhaps they do not need to con cern th emselves as m uch with profits. Sm aller sources, on the other hand, such as local newspapers, obviously have to focus m ore on m aking profits, and their purpose, therefor e, may not always be to provide the most inf ormative stories but ra ther to provide the stories th at will se ll best. With this said, both of thes e types of media have covere d the issu e of autism and its possible link to m ercury; with the num ber of autism cases soar ing within the past couple of decades, au diences h ave been in trigued by this mysterious syndrom e and have demanded m edia coverage. T he contrasting ways by which the two types of m edia sources have covered the issue are strik ing. Recognized national m edia sources such as CNN and MSNBC have covered stories of autism in a relatively o bjective m anner. MSN BC's recen tly aired sp ecial on autis m featured a specific s egment on Nightly News with Brian Williams addressing m ercury's potential cause- and-effect relationship with autism . The segmen t featured two scientists who held contrasting views\u2014Dr. Marie McCorm ick of Harvard Univer sity, whose research strongly suggests that there is no link, and Dr. Richard De th of Northeastern Universit y, who believes that a link does indeed exis t. Both s ides of the argument wer e pres ented. Since the scien tific community, however, is not split 50-50 on th is issue, th e segment also emphasized that scientif ic evid ence 16strongly points to there not being a connection between m ercury and autism .28 The purpose of this m edia coverage was clearly to infor m. Smaller m edia sources, on the contrary, ha ve disproportionately covered stories suggesting a link between m ercury and autism desp ite the overall belief of the scientific and medical communities. This is because s tories again st connections between illnesses and supposed causes are not nearly as interestin g to the general public as stories supporting connections. W hile there are an infinite num ber of things that do not cause a particular illnes s, something suggesting that a spec ific agent causes an illness is rare and therefore captivating. Moreover, the m ain market in terms of autism coverage is the parent s and other relatives of autistic c hildren. This audienc e is not only inte rested in there being a connectio n between autism and a specific agent, they are in som e ways desperate for a conne ction. As of now there are still no known causes of autism; in fact, the scientific and m edical communities still lack a basic understanding of the syndrome itself, let alone its cause or causes. This alm ost com plete lack of knowledge has left parents with m any ques tions for which there just are not any answers at this tim e. Many, therefore, are practically begging for stories that claim to provide an answer...an y answer. This is where profit-driven m edia com e in. The m edia know that people whose lives have been affected by autism are tired of being le d to dead ends and are instead anxious to hear possible answers. This is why m ainly sm aller media sources often cover stories supporting a link between m ercury and autism . For exam ple, the Joplin G lobe, a local newspaper of Joplin, Missouri, featured an article on the f ront p age of its Sunday edition on October 24, 2 004 telling the story of Alan and Lujene Clark, who fir mly believe that m ercury in a f lu vaccin e trigg ered their son Devon's autism. The Cl arks, according to th e article, are now de voted to spreading awareness o f mercury's cause-and-ef fect rela tionship with these \u2014stories 17that offer answers\u2014are the ones that people are eager to hear about and are therefore the ones that will draw the largest profits (hence its placem ent on the front page of the Sunday edition). Woo et al. addressed the influence m edia coverage has on the public perception of autism 's causes, particularly th e perception of parents with autistic children. Woo com pared questionnaire responses by parent s participa ting in the Vac cine Adverse E vent Repor ting System (VAERS) with responses by parents in the gene ral population. VAERS, which wa s established in 1990 and is jointly m anaged by the Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention (CDC ), receives reports from a va riety of sources concerning the effects of vaccines. Woo a nd her colleagues s earched VA ERS and designed b y Gellin et al.,30 Wo o questioned VAERS reporters about their im pressions of vaccines.31 The study's results strongly suggest that pare nts of autistic children have less trust of vaccines than the general populatio n. Only 38% of VAERS respondents ag reed that they are \"more likely to trust v accines that have been around for a while\", com pared to 88% of the general pop ulation. In addition, o nly 7% of VAERS respondents ag reed that \"v accines are always proven to be very safe before they are approved for use\", compared to 71% o f the general population. The results also suggest that the media m ore easily influe nce persons personally affected by autism . In response to the open- ended question, \" What made you think that ___'s symptoms might be related to a vaccination? \" 24.2% of VAERS respondents said m agazine or newspaper and 19.4% said web or internet, m aking these the second and fourth m ost common reasons, respectively. Woo and colleagues disc ussed the implications of their findings: Faced with such a serio us diagnosis as autism , parents n aturally look for explanatio ns in events, su ch as vaccin ations, o ccurring just before the o of autistic s igns a nd symptoms...These f indings illustrate that the media and the internet influence parental percep tions of vaccine s afety and reinforce the need to develop fair and effective ways to communicate with the p ublic abou t the benefits and risks of v accines.32 18 Parents' desperation leaves them not only su sceptible to unproven explanations but also susceptible to unproven treatm ents. As a side effect of the medi a's often unbalanced coverage of the autism epidem ic and the potential link be tween autism and mercury, a m arket has been created for \"detoxification treatm ent\". Mary An n Block, an osteopath in Hurst, Texas, and Dr. Kenneth Bock of the Rhinebeck Health Center in Rhinebeck, New York, for exam ple, are treating au that bind to m etals and allow them to be rem oved from the body through the urine.33 While the treatm ent is FDA approved for lead poisoning, no published clinical studie s show that chelation is effective a t treating autism . Bock, however, asserts that \"there may be a subset of children that are m ore susceptible to m ercury and therefore re act this way in term s of the autism spectrum ,\" and these ch ildren, he claim s, will respond to chelation.34 With no scientific evidence supporting the supposed effectiveness of the treatm ent, what is know n is that chelation has serious side effects, including liver and ki dney problem s. Moreover, chel ation is not ch eap: initia l assessm ents alone cost thousands of charges $2500), and then treatm ents and supplem ents end up cos ting fam ilies even m ore. Additional m ethods of detoxification include saunas, which som e parents even have installed in their homes (such is the case of the Cravens, who spent $3,500 to install an in-hom e sauna to help remove metals fr om their two autistic sons).35 But parents are willing to ignore scientific data (or the lack thereof) if they are led to believe by convincing enough sources that what they are doing m ay help their sick children. Kacey Dolce, whose au tistic s on H ank is one of Block's chel ation p atients, said, \"We don't know enough yet to say no...I'll do anything to help our child.\"36 Clearly, som e parents require sufficient d ata disproving a tre atment bef ore they will stop considering it, as opposed to 19requiring su fficient data supporting a treatm ent before they will start cons idering it. This allow s many peopl e to capitalize on m edia coverage and profit from parents' desperation. So long as the causes of autism rem ain a my stery, parents' desi re for answers will continue to leave them easily impressionable. Capitalizing on heresy, m isleading m edia sources will inev itably continu e to prof it from parents' susceptibility and by doing so will continue to shape public opinion. Governmen t Regulations Although ethyl m ercury is the form contained in thim erosal, no gui delines exist specifically for ethyl m ercury exposure. Rather, guideline s for m ethyl m ercury, which has different toxico logical m echanisms, as was previously d iscussed, are used for ethyl m ercury as well. The EPA has set a lim it of 2 parts of m ethyl m ercury per billion parts of dr inking water (2 ppb); the FDA has set a m aximum perm issible level of 1 p art of m ethyl m ercury p er million parts of food (1 ppm ); and the Occupational Safety and Health Adm inistration (OSHA) has set lim its of 0.1 milligram s of organic m ercury per cubic m eter of workplace air (0.1 mg/m\u00b3) and 0.05 m g/m\u00b3 of metallic m ercury vapor for 8-hour sh ifts and 40-h our work weeks.37 The EPA's guideline, which is the m ost conserva tive, is designe d to serve a s a warning to trigge r addition al investig ation , while the FDA guideline is de signed as a safe lim it for long-term consum ption of food contam inate d with m ticularly fish).38 Each of thes e regu lations was in place prior to when the supposed asso ciation betw een m ercury in vaccin es and autism was discovered, and none address the issue of intram uscular exposure. When the FDA's Center for Bio logics Evaluation and Resear ch (CBER) began reassessing the safety of m ercury in vaccines in April 1998, they determ ined that th imerosal was 20present in o ver 30 licen sed vaccines in the US. Looking at cum ulative exposure over the first six months of life, an infant who receiv ed all r ecomm ended vac cines on sch edule could be exposed to up to 187.5 \u00b5g of mercury. Adjusting for average weig ht at various percentiles in infants between birth and six-months of age, this exposure exceeded the EPA guidelin e for m ethyl mercury.39 The EPA guideline, however, is base d on oral exposure, which has different toxicological effects than expos ure through vaccination, as was di scussed. Nonetheless, this prom pted more research, which eventually led to the releas e of a joint Am erican Academ y of Pediatrics /US Public Health Se rvice statem ent on thim easure\u2014that thim erosal oved from vaccines. Th e sta tement m entions, however, th at the risk associated with th e diseas es th at vaccines are designed to pr event is m uch higher than the risk a ssociated with thim erosal, so until th imerosal is re moved f rom all vacc ines parents sho uld still v accinate the ir child ren.40 At this tim e, with the e xception of influenza vaccines (th imerosal-free influenza vaccines are a pproved for use in children 6 to 3 5 months of age),41 all routinely recommended pedi atric vaccines that are m anufactured for th e US m arket contain no thim erosal or contain signifi cantly reduced am ounts (e .g., trace am ounts) of thimerosal.42 In order to rem ove thimerosal, single-dos e vials, as opposed to the previously used multi-dos e vials, are now used to sto greatly redu cing erosal from vaccines and the production and single-dose vials are Because the toxicological and epidem iological data strongly suggest that ther e is no link between thim erosal in vaccines and autism , the auth ors of this paper feel that th e precau tionary m easure of Takin g into accou nt, however, the effects that m edia coverage hav e on the public, particularly pa rents of autistic ch ildren, not rem oving thim erosal m ay have resulted in parents refusing to v accinate their children, as was s uggested by the responses in the 21Woo et al. study. Sin ce it was plausib le fo r thimerosal to b e removed from vaccines manufactured for the US m arket, the authors agr ee th at the m easure was justif ied in that it ensures that parents will conti nue to vaccine their children. For countries in which the rem oval of thim erosal would be too great a financial burden, the authors feel that the rem oval is not justified. Persons living in countries that cannot afford alternatives to thim erosa l are most likely not as frequently exposed to the m edia as citizens of the US. This m eans that they are less likely to no t vaccinate their ch ildren because o f misleading media coverage, which is the only reason the aut hors f eel th e measure wa s justif ied in the US. Conclusion Upon review of m ercurial-cont aining drugs by the FDA in 1997, the discovery that certain thimerosal-containing vaccines adm inistered to infants contained more ethyl m ercury than the 1995 EPA standard was m ade. This becam e an issue of concern and interest to the scientific and medical communities because of th e studie s that have link ed m ethyl m ercury to neurotox icity and its pos sible ass ociation with autism . Th e scientif ic and m edical communities quickly responded by conducting a num ber of toxicological and epidem iological studies to possible causal nship between thim erosal -containing vaccines and autism . All these studies sugg est that the low doses of ethyl m ercury presen t in the thim erosal of vaccines are no t toxic and th at vaccin ations contain ing thim erosal do not correspond with increases in autism . Nonetheless, parents and other relatives of autisti c children, all desperate for answers, have m ade media coverage supporting a causal link m arketab le. This m edia coverage, in turn, has influenced public op inion, leav ing m any parents weary of vaccin ations. Because of this, the measure of rem oving thim erosal from vaccines in the US was justified. The rem oval, however, 22was not necessary for the prevention of autism , so nations that cannot afford to rem ove thimerosal from their vaccines should not m ake this process a priority. 1 Strock, M.
