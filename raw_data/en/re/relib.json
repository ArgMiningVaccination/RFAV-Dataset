Davies-Heerema, PhD Clinical Associate Professor, Medical Sciences & Education Biography Dr. Davies began her tenure at BUSM in the Department of Biochemistry over 30 years ago. After receiving her PhD, she was very active in the Department and went on to do research in the field of Alzheimer's disease investigating the role of platelets and the blood brain barrier in amyloid deposition. More recently she has served as Assistant Director of the MA in Medical Sciences program, and now Director of the Oral Health Sciences program. In 2018, Dr. Davies assumed a new role in Graduate Medical Sciences, the graduate arm of the medical school first as Assistant Dean for Graduate Affairs and more recently expanding her role to include oversight of all Master's programs. She oversees Marketing & Recruitment, and Student Affairs along with directing the MS in Oral Health Sciences program. Dr. Davies has been teaching in the Biochemistry course MD512/OH751 Dental Biochemistry for more than 18 years, is Co-Course Manager for GMS MS 640, Introduction to Biomedical Information and recently developed three new courses Evidence Based Dentistry, Infectious Diseases: Pathogens & Clinical Manifestations and Fundamentals of Head and Neck Anatomy. Dr. Davies has helped to develop a novel mobile application in collaboration with the Department of Family Medicine, the Alumni Medical Library, and the Virtual Integration Group on Evidence Based Medicine. The BUSM Finding Information Framework (BUSM FIF) app can be found in the app store. Two recent publications demonstrate the success of the OHS pipeline program. First in 2019 - We show the success of the OHS program in increasing the preparedness and diversity of dental school applicants from under-represented groups to dental school and in 2020 - How alternative predictors of success may help to reduce intrinsic bias among applicants from underrepresented groups during the admissions process.
