Our team of board-certified plastic surgeons and medical specialists guides our patients through every step of the tummy tuck/abdominoplasty process to ensure the best results possible. Is a Tummy Tuck Right for You? An abdominoplasty will tighten the abdominal muscles/fascia, which may have become stretched out over time. This procedure can dramatically aid in the reduction of a prominent abdomen. Abdominoplasty can be done in conjunction with a [buttock/thigh lift.](http://surgery.med.umich.edu/plastic/patient/adult_procedures/btlift) Best Candidates A tummy tuck is best for patients who are otherwise in good health without active diseases or serious, pre-existing medical conditions. If you plan to become pregnant or to lose a significant amount of weight, you should discuss these plans with your doctor before surgery. Abdominoplasty is not a treatment for obesity or a substitute for proper diet and exercise. The Procedure Typically, the surgeon will make two incisions. The first is a long incision from hipbone to hipbone, just above the pubic area. A second incision frees the navel from surrounding tissue. In a mini-abdominoplasty, the first incision is much shorter and the navel may not be moved, although its appearance may be slightly altered. After the incisions, the surgeon separates the skin from the abdominal wall all the way up to the ribs, then lifts a large skin flap, revealing the vertical muscles in the abdomen. The surgeon then tightens these muscles by pulling them close together and stitching them into their new position. This provides a firmer abdominal wall and narrows the waistline. A complete abdominoplasty can take from 2 to 5 hours, depending on the extent of work required. A mini-abdominoplasty may take 1 or 2 hours. Alternatives During your initial physical examination, your plastic surgeon may find that you would be a good candidate for less invasive procedures that would still allow you to meet your appearance goals. Alternative procedures may include a mini-abdominoplasty, liposuction or a panniculectomy, a procedure that reduces hanging skin in the abdominal area. View all of our body contouring surgeries. Your Consultation If you're interested in a tummy tuck, we'll first have you come for a personal consultation with your plastic surgeon. You will have the opportunity to discuss your goals and the results you would like to achieve. Your surgeon will work with you to reach an understanding about what you can expect from this procedure and the long-term benefits. Every patient is different, and your surgeon will choose the surgical technique and treatment plan that is right for you. During your initial consultation, you should expect to: - Provide a complete medical history. Include information about any previous surgical procedures; past and present medical conditions; and all medications or herbal supplements you are taking. - Have your surgeon examine your abdomen, including the quality of your abdominal skin; the location of any existing scars; the amount and location of any excess fat; and the status of the underlying muscles. - Discuss the procedure's possible risks and complications. Surgery Preparing for Your Surgery After your consultation and decisions about surgery, we will give you pre-operative information that explains everything you should do and know before your procedure. Your surgical team will instruct you on how to prepare for surgery. You should arrange for someone to drive you home after your surgery. You also may want to make arrangements for someone to help you for a day or two while you heal. Anesthesia We use general anesthetic so that you will sleep and remain comfortable throughout the procedure. Recovery It's very important that you follow your surgeon's instructions. This will promote healing and improve progress towards your new physical appearance. Also, it's important that you attend all follow-up appointments so that your surgeon can assess your long-term results and answer any questions or concerns.
