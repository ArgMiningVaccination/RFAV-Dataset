INTRODUCTION Sthaulya is described by Acharya Charaka in (Dhatwagnimandya) in the etiopathogenesis of Sthaulya. In modern medical science Sthaulya is compared with Obesity. Obesity is a state of excess adipose tissue mass. Obesity should not be defined by body weight alone, as muscular individuals may be overweight by arbitrary standards status and risk of disease is the body mass index (BMI), which is equal to weight/ height2 in kg/m2. [3] A person with a BMI of 30 or more is generally considered obese [4]. Obesity in India has reached epidemic proportions in the 21st century, with morbid obesity affecting 5% of the country's population [5]. According to ICMR-INDIAB study 2015, prevalence rate of obesity and central obesity are varies from 11.8% to 31.3% and 16.9%-36.3% respectively. [6] Guru & Aptarpana Chikitsa & Shodhana is mentioned as line of treatment for Sthoulya in Ayurveda alongside varied formulations like Udwartana, Basti [7] A present article about a case study of afemale patient of sthaulya was treated with madhutailik basti and Udvartana got relief within 15 days. 2.

DISCUSSION Acharya Sharangadhra has mentioned madhutailik basti is mentioned disease like gulma, medovrudhhi, krumi, pliha and udavarta. Basti is not only best for Vata disorders it also equally effective in correcting the morbid Pitta, Kapha and Rakta. [9] Charaka has considered, Basti therapy as half of the treatment of all the diseases, while some authors consider it as the complete remedy for all the ailments. [10] Sushruta describes that Udvartana helps to restore the deranged Vayu of the body to its normal condition. It liquefies Kapha and Meda, [11] gives smoothness and cleanness to the skin and imparts firmness to the limb. Triphala also having Medakaphahar properties along with it enhances agni and ultimately it helps in increasing lekhan and dhatwagni so the samprapti is broken for further meda preparation. 8.
