CooneyAAEP News September 2018 III The directive of your Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee (PC&EC) is: To review and analyze ethical issues facing the AAEP membership; to formulate and review recommendations relative to AAEP position statements as they pertain to ethical practice; to develop and conduct a review procedure for evaluating complaints and allegations of unethical practice by AAEP members; and, to recommend disciplinary action to the board regarding membership privileges. The AAEP occasionally receives questions about the activities of the PC&EC and its processes concerning ethical infractions of the membership. All of this infor- mation can be found in the AAEP's Resource Guide and Membership Directory or online at aaep.org/ ethics/ethical-guidelines. Limits to disciplinary action It is important to remember the AAEP has no regulatory authority and can exercise oversight only as it pertains to members of our association. Disciplinary action against a member for ethical infractions is generally limited to the denial or suspension of their AAEP membership. Examples of when disciplinary action may be taken can include: Action against a member, in relation to the practice of veterinary medicine, by any racing jurisdiction; organi - zations governing shows, sales and equine events; or breed associations/registries Action against a member, in relation to the practice of veterinary medicine, by any state licensing authority Failure to report any of the above actions when applying for AAEP membership or renewal Acts of fraud, misrepresentation, deceit or animal cruelty Violation of the AAEP ethical guidelines as recom - mended by the PC&EC based upon application review or a complaint submitted by another member in good standing or by the executive director Any other reason that the PC&EC believes, at its discretion, warrants denial or cancellation of membership or other disciplinary action Ensuring fairness The PC&EC typically becomes aware of disciplinary action against a member either by contact from a regulatory body or industry organization, or through the public posting of such action by these same bodies. It is important that the AAEP await any rulings from a regulatory body or industry organization before proceeding with the review process by the PC&EC. This ensures that (1) all information related to the incident/case has been investigated and is complete and (2) the PC&EC has all the information necessary to proceed in a fair and unbiased manner. The PC&EC can also receive a written complaint against a member(s) from another member in good standing. This is referred to as a member-on-member complaint. The adjudication process Once the committee is made aware of any final regulatory ruling or receives a member-on-member complaint, the following process ensues as explained in the AAEP bylaws. The member/applicant is contacted in writing with an explanation of the reason for the contact. This person then has 30 days to provide a written response. If no response is received within 30 days, the information that has been provided to the committee is considered to be true. Any additional investigation into facts related to the proposed action can be exercised by the association. The response and any additional information are then reviewed by the PC&EC. The committee has 60 days to respond to the member/applicant. The committee, by majority vote, can dismiss the complaint, grant an extension or refer to a hearing. If the case is referred to a hearing, the member must be provided with at least 60 days' notice. Most hearings are conducted at the AAEP's annual convention; however , there are allowances such that hearings may be granted at other locations and timelines. If a hearing is granted, the member/ applicant can have legal counsel present, have other witnesses testify on their behalf and provide any additional information/evidence related to the case. Following the hearing, the committee reviews all of the information and How AAEP takes disciplinary action after ethical infractions By Debbie Lamparter, VMD, and Kenton Morgan, DVM Dr. Lamparter is chief state veterinarian for the New Jersey Racing Commission and a member of the AAEP's Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee.

This request originated from Thoroughbred sales companies out of concern that these products were being used inappropriately in juvenile horses entered for sale at public auction. A task force was formed, and the group reviewed the available scientific literature and gathered anecdotal information from many within our profession: equine veterinary orthopedic surgeons; racetrack, sport horse and sales practitioners; and regulatory and laboratory veterinarians. The following issues were considered: Off-label use of bisphosphonates and the resulting potential negative consequences for the health and welfare of young horses. Development of testing for bisphosphonates farther out than what is currently available. Research to examine the effects of administration to young horses on bone as they are exposed to training and racing. Education of AAEP-member veterinarians regarding the ethical and legal insurance ramifications of off-label use. Provision of leadership for all industry stakeholders and development of a rational, non-political-based approach to this issue. It became apparent that there is a considerable lack of scientific literature about the use of bisphosphonates in young horses, and that many in the industry (buyers, owners, veterinarians and regulators) would benefit greatly from new research and testing procedures. This examination of bisphosphonates is a work in progress, and while efforts are made to press forward in our understanding of this category of drug, the AAEP board of directors has approved the following statement: In the absence of research to refute the anecdotal observations of deleterious effects of bisphosphonates on immature skeletons, the AAEP recommends that veterinarians follow the manufacturer's labeling recommendations for administration, particularly with regard to age. (Note: Bisphosphonates are currently approved for the treatment of navicular disease in horses that are four years old and older.) testimony presented and will, by majority vote, render a decision in the form of a recommendation and provide this in writing to the AAEP board of directors. The recommen- dation can include taking action against their membership status, censure or other disciplinary sanction. The board of directors then has up to 90 days to vote on whether to accept the recommendation of the committee findings. This decision is then provided to the member(s)/ parties within 30 days of the board of directors' decision. Following this decision, the member(s) have the option to an appeal process to the AAEP officers. Following the appeal process, the resulting decision is final. All discussions by the PC&EC, officers and board of directors related to any case are kept strictly confidential. Although the process as outlined here is in an abbreviated form, it is apparent the AAEP has a very fair and thorough process in place by which any and all ethical infractions are evaluated.Recent cases brought before the PC&EC include a veteri - narian who left lay people in charge to make diagnostic and treatment decisions while out of the country; a veteri - narian charged with falsifying medical records; a veterinari - an fined for submitting a treatment record and testing of the horse found no such drug; and a veterinarian charged with dispensing loaded syringes to trainers in violation of racetrack rules. The AAEP has long prioritized ethical behavior for its members. In a time when other veterinary associations are no longer administering the ethical oversight of their members, the AAEP continues to take this aspect of membership very seriously. The AAEP provides extensive educational material on this topic through our website as well as educational programming during our convention. Again this year in San Francisco, there will be a half-day panel discussion on ethics in equine practice on Dec. 3. If you have questions, feel free to reach out to our officers, executive director or the PC&EC chairperson.How AAEP takes disciplinary action after ethical infractions, continuedAAEP News September 2018 V ETHICSASSoCIATIon In the July issue, we discussed what to do if you are being harassed and, in the April issue, what employers should do if they receive a complaint of harassment. But what happens if a vendor or client is the harasser? For example, a veterinarian could be harassed by a farm manager or farm owner, or by a salesman who supplies medications to the practice. While state law varies, the following are general tips for employers and employees when faced with this very common issue of harassment from third parties. How should an employer respond to an employee complaint of harassing behavior from a client? Although state law varies, in general, employers can be liable for known harassment from third parties. This means that if an employer knows that a client is harassing the employer' s employees, then the employer can be legally responsible to prevent the harassment. How can an employer prevent harassment from a third party? Clearly an employer cannot \"discipline\" someone who does not work for him/her. A vendor may be easier for an employer to address because vendors are seeking business from the practice. Clients, on the other hand, are bringing money into the practice. However , there are ways that an employer can protect an employee from harassment from clients. For instance, the employer could: Investigate the complaint promptly Talk with the client or client's human resources representative about the harassment and tell him/her that it must stop Move the employee away from the client without negatively affecting the employee' s job Terminate the relationship with the client Implement other preventative measures depending on the circumstances The employer's duty is to take prompt action that is reasonably likely to prevent the harassment from occurring again. In taking remedial action, the employer should guard against unlawful retaliation. For instance, the employer cannot take any kind of action that would negatively impact the employee who complained, such as moving an employee to a less favorable position in order to stop harassment from a client. This may be considered unlawful retaliation. To stop harassment from vendors or clients, employers need to make sure they have a harassment policy and that the policy includes a complaint procedure for harassment from vendors or clients. Employers need to have the same zero-tolerance policy with vendor- or client-caused harassment as they do with employee-on-employee harassment. Should an employee complain about harassing behavior from a vendor or client? What if you are the victim of harassment from a vendor or a client? As mentioned, employers may have duties to prevent harassment from clients if they know or reasonably should know about it. Employers cannot remedy a situation unless they are aware, or should be aware, that it is happening. As a result, it is very important for those suffering from harassment from clients or vendors to report the misconduct to their employers promptly . In addition, because some employees do not feel strong enough to report harassment, it is vitally important for all witnesses to the harassment to report it. Depending on the facts of the particular case, the victim of harassment by a vendor or a client may also press criminal charges or file a civil lawsuit against the third party for assault or battery. #MeToo and veterinary practice: How to stop harassment from third parties By Sharon Gold Sharon Gold is an employment attorney at Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs in Lexington, Ky. VI AAEP News September 2018 Kindred Biosciences joins AAEP Educational Partners Program Kindred Biosciences, Inc., a publicly traded (NASDAQ: KIN), commercial-stage biopharma- ceutical company that develops therapeutics for companion animals and horses, has become the 11th equine health corporation in the AAEP's Educational Partnership Program. \"KindredBio's partnership with the AAEP brings together two organiza- tions that share a passion for improving equine wellness,\" said Denise Bevers, co-founder and chief operating officer, KindredBio. \"Our company is focused on addressing the numerous unmet medical needs that equine veterinarians encounter daily.\" KindredBio's drug development pipeline is focused on cats, dogs and horses. Equine products in development include a product for control of pyrexia (fever) in horses, which is currently under review by the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine. The company's team also has experience supporting equine-specific products in the marketplace by partnering with equine veterinarians. KindredBio has supported the AAEP and its educational opportunities as both an exhibitor and sponsor of key events at the association's Annual Convention. At the upcoming convention in San Francisco, KindredBio will be the Health and Wellness Initiative sponsor, will underwrite a Sunrise Session, and will have a large presence in the exhibit hall.Associ Ation Performing a routine dental float is among the skills expected of a new veterinary school graduate in equine practice.

Touch Point: Electronic examination wellness form available for use with clients The examination is the cornerstone of the veterinarian-client-patient-rela- tionship. Our patient may not talk, but they can \"speak\" to us through a well-performed exam. When done properly, the examination transforms information into insight and builds trust between the owner or trainer and veterinarian. If we think of the examination solely as a clinical tool, however, we miss the opportunity to create stronger rela- tionships with our clients. Our clients value how we treat them just as much as they value our medical treatment of their horses.The AAEP surveyed over 6,000 horse owners and trainers and found that relationship factors are as important to client satisfaction as your ability to provide veterinary care. Your clients want you to: Take your time with their horse during each exam or visit. Explain your diagnosis and treatment recommenda - tions in terminology they can understand. Demonstrate sincere compassion for the horse. Value your client's opinion. As a practitioner, you can use the examination to deliver all of these important client satisfaction drivers, plus excellent veterinary care. The principles of a relationship- focused examination can be performed during any type of examination, in any type of equine practice. New for you is a wellness examination form template that can be modified for your use with your clients.

Meeting registration opens Oct. 1.AAEP News September 2018 XIInDUSTRY The A VMA House of Delegates (HoD) summer session, held July 11-12 in Denver, Colo., in conjunc - tion with the 2018 AVMA Convention, featured consider - ation of three resolutions and one bylaws amendment, along with discussion of action plans for student debt and two other Veterinary Information Forum (VIF) topics of importance to delegates and their constituents. While the resolutions likely have limited impact on AAEP members, they are issues we monitor closely for precedent that may be set in future discussions that could involve policies that affect equine practice. Resolutions passed by the HoD included one in support of federal emphasis on policies to protect the domestic livestock industry from Foot and Mouth Disease and another seeking collabora - tion within small animal practice between the AVMA and breed associations to enhance health-conscious breeding practices to minimize inherited diseases in cats and dogs. The final resolution was referred to the board of directors for clarification on revision to the position of canine devo- calization. The bylaws amendment, which concerned minimum standards for HoD representation among Constituent Allied Veterinary Organizations, was tabled until a task force could be appointed to examine the situation. The VIF topic discussions have become an important component of the HoD session format and, this summer, covered globalization, student debt and license portability . The globalization discussion brought an emphasis for AVMA staff to create a communication plan that educates members about the societal needs impacted by veterinary medicine, with member involvement in international activities and development of tools to assess these oppor- tunities. This is an area well known to AAEP members as equine competitions span the globe and create the need for biosecurity advocacy and protections. Meanwhile, student debt discussions resulted in the HoD suggesting the AVMA board of directors investigate: (1) methods for financial advisors to help undergraduate and veterinary students, (2) strategies that help private practi - tioners assist with the debt incurred by recent graduates, (3) development of a sustainable low-interest loan program, and (4) development of advocacy strategies to help state VMAs assist locally with the student debt crisis. Finally, a brief discussion occurred on license portability related to jurisdictions affected in areas of temporary veterinary disaster relief, which has been experienced in many areas of the country and associated territories in recent years. The HoD session also saw the election of AAEP members Dr. John Howe as AVMA president-elect and Dr. Grace Bransford as AVMA vice president. We welcome these leaders and look forward to their service in coming years. Dr. Rebecca Stinson and I appreciate the privilege of repre - senting you as AAEP's delegates to the AVMA HoD.

XII AAEP News September 2018 InDUSTRY The Unwanted Horse Coalition (UHC) has launched the Equine Welfare Data Collective, a collaborative effort to accumulate, analyze and apply data to enhance program - ming for transitioning and at-risk horses. Funding partners are the AAEP Foundation, The Right Horse Initiative and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Whereas the equine industry largely works off anecdotal data when it comes to rescue horses, the collective seeks to gather current and firm numbers to determine the effectiveness of programs in place to help horses transition safely to new homes. Data collection is expected to begin this year with baseline data from rescues and sanctuaries such as: current capacity of rescues and sanctuaries, age, sex, breed of horses in their care, number of horses taken in each year and similar. All data collected will be aggregated so no individual organization is identified. Data will be used to help develop programs and solutions to fill any gaps in current programming, as well as measure progress in current initiatives.

Highlights of recent clinically relevant papers Colic incisonal infections This prospective cohort study by Casja Isgren and colleagues in the UK aimed to investigate the bacterial isolates present on equine midline incisions during and following exploratory laparotomy. A total of 31 horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy due to signs of colic at The University of Liverpool Equine Hospital during a 12-month period were included in this study. Swabs from the ventral midline of all horses were collected for culture and sensitivity immediately after clipping, after aseptic preparation for surgery, after closure of the linea alba, after closure of the skin, immediately after recoveryfrom general anaesthesia and every 48 h post-surgery at the time of abdominal bandage changes. A wide range of bacterial species were cultured both intraoperatively and immediately following recovery. Following aseptic preparation of the surgical site a positive culture was obtained from only one horse. Of the 22 horses that underwent an enterotomy or anastomosis, 16 (73%) had a negative culture immediately following incisional closure. Seven horses (22.6%) developed surgical site infection (SSI) but a positive culture from an intraoperative swab or immediately following recovery did not predict the development of SSI. The prevalence of a positive bacterial culture result increased over time even in the absence of SSI, likely due to bacterial recolonisation of the skin. Incisional contamination alone is unlikely to cause SSI in horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy. Equine sepsis scoring In this study, D.M. Wong and colleagues in the USA evaluated updated sepsis scoring systems and systemic in flammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and their association withsepsis in equine neonates. The original equine sepsis score provided a method of identifying foals with sepsis. In this study, which included 273 sick foals and 25 healthy control foals, the authors evaluated the sensitivity and speci city of two updated sepsis scores and the SIRS criteria in regard to detecting sepsis in foals. The original sepsis score and two updated sepsis scores were calculated from historical, physical examination, andclinicopathological ndings. SIRS criteria were also evaluated. There were 126 septic foals and 147 sick-nonseptic. Theoriginal and updated sepsis scores were signi cantly higher in septic foals than in sick-nonseptic and healthy foals. Thesensitivity and speci city of the updated sepsis scores to predict sepsis were not signi cantly better than those of the original sepsis score. The original SIRS criteria were met by 127/273 (46.5%) foals and 88/273 (32%) foals. The original SIRS criteria had similar sensitivity and speci city for predicting sepsis as did the three sepsis scores in the study. The authors concluded that the updated sepsis scores did not provide improved ability in predicting sepsis. Ful lling the original SIRS criteria provided similar sensitivity and speci city in predicting sepsis as the modi ed sepsis score and might serve as a diagnostic aid in identifying foals atrisk for sepsis.Large intestinal thickening This retrospective study by Elizabeth Biscoe and colleagues in the USA aimed to describe the clinical features and outcome of horses with severe large intestinal thickening diagnosed with transabdominal ultrasonography. Medical records of horses that had undergone transabdominal ultrasonography over an 8-year period were reviewed which identi ed 25 horses with the wall of the large intestine 9 mm thick in any of six abdominal zones. The median age was 13 years (range 3 -28 years) and the reasons for the initial examination were colic, diarrhoea, inappetence,weight loss, lethargy, fever, or haematuria. Severe large intestinal thickening (range 9 -46.6 mm; mean /C6s.d., 18.8 /C66.8 mm) was the primary ultrasonographic nding in all horses. Thickened large intestine was more likely to be detected in ventral vs. upper (i.e. combined paralumbarand intercostal) abdominal zones and in right vs. left zones. Of the 25 horses, 11 survived and had resolution of clinical signs, including one horse treated surgically for colon torsion; one horse survived but continued to have intermittent colic; 10 horses were subjected to euthanasia or died, including three horses with neoplasia and three with colitis; and three horses were lost to follow-up, including one horse with a caecal mass and one with hepatosplenic lymphoma. The severity of thickening and the number of zones affected were not signi cantly different between survivors and nonsurvivors. The authors concluded that in horses undergoing transabdominal ultrasonography for a variety of conditions, large intestinal wall thickness 9 mm may be detected. Ultrasonographic examination of all abdominal zones washelpful to determine the extent of thickening and identify additional ndings that helped prioritise differential diagnoses. Hindlimb computed tomographic contrast tenography The aim of this prospective, anatomical, pilot study by Rachel Agass and colleagues in the UK was to describe the anatomy of the equine hindlimb digital flexor tendon sheath using tomography (CT) and computedtomographic contrast tenography in clinically normal limbs. Ten pairs of cadaver hindlimbs with no external abnormalities were examined from the level of the tarsometatarsal joint distally. Limbs initially underwent noncontrast CT examination using 120 kVp, 300 mAs, and 1.5 mm slice thickness. Using a basilar sesamoidean approach, 60 mL of ioversol iodinated contrast media and saline ( nal concentration were injected. The computed tomographic contrast tenography examinationwas then repeated, before the specimens were dissected to compare gross and imaging ndings. The combined CT and computed tomographic contrast tenography examinationsprovided excellent anatomical detail of intra-thecal structures. The borders of the super cial and deep digital flexor tendons, and the manica flexoria were consistently identi able in all limbs. Detailed anatomy including that of the mesotenons, two of which are previously undescribed,and the plantar annular ligament were also 10.1111/eve.12979identi able. Dissectionof all 10 pairs of limbs revealed there to be no pathology, in accordance with the imaging ndings. The authors concluded that the combination of CT and computed tomographic contrast tenography may be useful adjunctive diagnostic techniques to de ne digital flexor tendon sheath pathology prior to surgical exploration in horses. Equine idiopathic haemorrhagic cystitis In this retrospecitve study, Fauna Smith and colleagues in the USA document haemorrhagic cystitis as a novel cause of stranguria and haematuria in horses. This syndrome may be difcult to differentiate from bladder neoplasia because they share several clinical features. This cohort study included 11 horses with idiopathic haemorrhagic cystitis and seven horses with bladder neoplasia. Haemorrhagic cystitis was detected on cystoscopy of affected horses, with haemorrhagic and thickened apical bladder mucosa. Clinical signs and endoscopic appearance of the bladder resolved within 3 -8 weeks. Histopathology of bladder mucosal biopsy in three horses with haemorrhagic cystitis, yet the horses experienced complete resolution, indicating that small biopsy specimens obtained by endoscopy can be dif cult to interpret. Horses with bladder neoplasia had lowerhaematocrits, were older, more likely to be female, and more likely to have a mass detected on ultrasonographic examination of the bladder than horses with haemorrhagic cystitis syndrome. The authors concluded that haemorrhagic cystitis represents a novel differential diagnosis for horses with haematuria, and is associated with a favourable prognosis. Although histopathology may suggest a neoplastic process, affected horses should be monitored cystoscopically, because complete resolution of haemorrhagic cystitis occurs. The cause of this disease is unknown, and warrants investigation. Longitudinal tears of the DDFT In this knowledge summary, UK-based veterinarians Daniel Castillo and Neal Ashton address the question: \"In horses with longitudinal tears of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) within the digital flexor tendon sheath, is surgical repair as effective as tenoscopic debridement alone for returning toprevious level of performance? \" The authors found that current literature on the ef cacy of surgical repair or tenoscopic debridement is limited. Criteria to de ne and evaluate performance outcomes is not uniform and confounded with multiple variables, merely representinglow quality evidence that is dif cult to draw meaningful conclusions from. However, the literature suggests tenoscopicdebridement alone has been associated with improved outcomes. A more de nitive conclusion cannot be made until higher quality evidence is made available on this topic.Environmental survival of S. equi In this study, Andy Durham and colleagues in the UK and USA investigated the environmental survival of Streptococcus equi subspecies equi. S. equi was inoculated onto wood, the rubber sole of a shoe, cotton overalls, inside a nasogastric tube, dental rasp,wet plastic bucket and onto an outdoor fence post. Samples were taken from all surfaces at 24-h intervals for the rst 5 days, 48-h intervals until Day 23, followed by bi-weeklyintervals until no viable bacteria could be cultured from two consecutive samplings. The protocol was carried out during both summer and winter months. Bacterial growth and vigour was higher in wet conditions and during the winter. In winter, the longest period over which successful cultures of S. equi were obtained was 30 days from the wet bucket. In contrast, the longest periodover which successful cultures were obtained in summer was 7 days, from the nasogastric tube. These ndings suggest that S. equi is likely to survive for longer periods in wet, humid, and cold conditions and couldsurvive for longer than previously thought. S.

Keywords: horse; acupuncture; rectal paralysis; traditional herbal; tail block Summary An 8-year-old Appaloosa mare with rectal paralysis due to a cosmetic ethanol 'tail block 'was treated with traditional Chinese veterinary medicine treatments includingacupuncture and herbal medicine. Her rectal and tail tone gradually improved after the treatment. At 4 months after initial presentation, the mare was able to produce faecal piles on a regular basis, and manual evacuations were no longer needed. Signi cant improvement was within 30 days of beginning treatment. At 8 months, the owner indicated thatthe mare had normal defaecation, was able to swish the tail from side to side and lift the tail to urinate, and had no evidence of straining to defaecate or colic. Case history and clinical ndings An 8-year-old Appaloosa mare was given a cosmetic 'tail block ', which involved injection of ethanol into the dorsal muscles at the base of the tail. The next day the mare was unable to defaecate due to rectal paralysis and was alsonoted to dribble urine without posturing to urinate. The referring veterinarian managed these clinical signs for 2 days by administration of mineral oil and magnesium sulfate via nasogastric intubation and manual removal of manure from the rectum. A rectal tear was detected 2 days later and she was referred to the Large Animal Hospital at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine for de nitive treatment. At presentation, the mare was bright, alert andnormothermic. Heart rate was normal (42 beats/min) and respiratory rate was normal (12 breaths/min). A full neurological examination was performed and there was no tail, anal or rectal tone up to 30 cm orad from the anal sphincter. Although there was evidence of a moderate sensory response at the perineal body and vulva, there was no skin sensation at the level of the anus. The rectum was lled with impacted faecal material, which was evacuated manually. A 3 cm grade 1 rectal tear, located in the dorsalrectal wall, 25 cm cranial to the anus, was palpated and visualised via speculum and endoscopic examination. Only minimal blood was collected on the sleeve following rectal examination. Treatment Flunixin meglumine (250 mg i.v. twice daily) therapy was initiated and her feed was switched to a complete, extruded product (Purina Equine Senior pellets1; initially 5.7 kg per day,calculated to be 75% of her daily requirement, and thenincreased to 7.5 kg over a 5-day period) supplemented with corn and mineral oils (0.24 L of each) three times daily. Sixty- two grams of table salt (NaCl) were added to the feed daily. She was also hand grazed three times daily. Every other day, 3.8 L of mineral oil and 248 g of magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) with 6 L of water were administered via nasogastric tube to help soften faeces. Because of the lack of potential therapies, a protocol of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine (TCVM) was initiated, which included acupuncture (AP) and herbal therapy. With evaluation of the AP points prior to beginning therapy, she was noted to be sensitive at: BL-27, BL-54, BL-18 (right), CV-4, CV-6 and generally in region. The initial therapy included: Dry Ba-jiao 4 (R) and Ba-jiao 1 (L) to Ba-jiao 4( R ) . Aqua-AC (the mare 's own blood from jugular vein): GV14 (10 mL), BL20 (5 mL), BL 25 (5 mL) and Ba-jiao (10 mL). The same acupuncture procedure as on Day 1 ( Fig 1 ) was repeated on the following day. The third day after admission she was treated with electrostimulation using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) because she was becoming increasingly recalcitrant to needle insertion. The following protocol was used: Day 3: TENS- sacral min). Day 6: TENS - sacral region min). Defaecated during treatment. After the rst 3 days of therapy, mild-moderate anal tone was noted and the mare began to posture normally to urinate. However, the rectum remained atonic and manual removal of faeces was necessary three times daily. Over the rst week of hospitalisation, it was noted on rectal examination that both anal tone and rectal tone were \u00a92016 EVJ day starting AP therapy, moxibustion (MOXA) therapy was added toher protocol and BuZhong YiQi2 was and CV-2/3/4/5 in the morning TENS: afternoon the same asfor Day 9 Day decreased totwice daily from Day 4toDay 10and thenonce daily from Day 11toDay 17.Subjectively, the rectal tear became less and less prominent and the presence of blood on sleeve was infrequently noted after rectal evacuations were decreased toonce daily. OnDay 11the mare Flunixin meglumine administration was also reduced to250mg once daily. On Day 12, she produced several small manure piles inaddition toindividual faecal balls and moderately strong perianal, anal, and distal rectal tone was noted during rectal examina tion. Reduced rectal tone persisted cranially. Itwas judged that she was passing approximately 25% ofher faecal volume without assistance.

OnDay 23and 24,theAPpoints were changed sothat the following treatment was stillnotailmovement. On Day 30,the herbal supplementation was changed from JuPiSan By Day 31, overall rectal tone had improved by approximately 50% since presentation and anal sphincter tone was normal. Minimal tailtone was present, butthemare was able tomake small movemen tsofhertailonoccasion. Small piles offaeces were produced several times throughout theday. Feedings and herbal supplementation remained the same until discharge atDay 42. Atthe time ofdischarge, she was producing multiple small faecal piles daily and rectal evacuations were performed once every 72h.Moderate rectal tone and peristaltic waves were present during rectal palpation. Anal tone was strong and themare was able tomove hertailfrom side toside. During evacuations, noblood had been evident onrectal sleeves and therectal tear appeared tobehealed. Recommended home care included twice weekly manual evacuation bytheprimary veterinarian, with thesuggestion todecrease thefrequency ofthese visits dependent onanal tone and manure production. The owners were asked to monitor the mare daily for sudden drop inmanure Fig1:Themare receiving electroacupuncture treatment. \u00a92016 EVJLtd461 8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201production, signs of colic or straining to defaecate. Suggested feeding included pelleted feed and grazing throughout the day, with hay introduced slowly over 3 weeks. At 4 months, the owner noted that the mare was producing faecal piles on a regular basis. The owner described a return to normal defaecation without need for manual evacuations. There had been no reports of straining to defaecate or colic. Tail movement was reported to be 85% normal, with the mare able to move the tail from side to side and lift the tail to urinate suggesting improved caudal nerve function to the sacrocaudalis dorsalis and ventralis muscles. She returned to training and competed successfullyat her previous level. The owner was contacted 8 months after discharge and reported that the mare 's defaecation and tail tone was essentially normal. Discussion Tail blocking with ethanol results in partial paralysis of thetail. It is a procedure used in some performance horses to prevent them from moving or wringing the tail during competition, which is generally considered a vice and may result in point reduction. It is usually achieved by injecting ethanol into the tail close to major nerves (Tozzini 2003). The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) endorses the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) position on \"Tail Alteration in Horses \"which states: \"The AAEP condemns the alteration of the tail of the horse for cosmetic or competitive purposes. This includes, but is not limited to, docking, nicking (i.e. cutting) and blocking. When performed for cosmetic purposes these procedures do not contribute to the health of the horse and are primarily used for gain in the show ring ...\"(AVMA Welfare Statement). The most common result of this technique is an inability to lift the tail to its normal height. However, post-mortemexaminations on horses that have been injected with ethanol consistently show areas of brosis in the muscle (Cobb 2004). In some individuals, the tail will be offset to the side orcrooked (Cobb 2004). Return to function is unpredictable and may take a long time (Cobb 2004). In a case series describing complications associated with alcohol tail blocks in three horses, all three horses were subjected to euthanasia because of signi cant neurological de cits, including rectal paralysis in two of the cases (Stewart et al. 1990). The adverse result of rectal paralysis appears to be rare, but is potentiallya very serious outcome. In one of the cases described by Stewart et al. (1990), clinical signs had not improved over 9 months following the injection. The pudendal and caudal rectal nerves arise from the ventral branches of the third and fourth sacral nerves. Thesenerves innervate the urinary bladder, urethral rectum, the internal and external anal sphincters, and the skin of the anus (Stewart et al. 1990). In some individuals, the alcohol injection may diffuse cranially in theepidural fat to affect nerves supplying motor innervation to the bladder and rectum and sensory innervation to the skin surrounding the tail and anus (Stewart et al. 1990). Recent studies suggest that acupuncture can repair nerve damage (Li et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2015). In these studies, using rat models, evidence of nerve repair was present after7-10 days of therapy. In the case presented here, acupuncture treatments may have enhanced nerve repair toeventually allow the mare to defaecate normally. Acupuncture points were chosen for calming effect ( Bai-hui and GB-21), local stimulation 20, 23, 25, GV-5, GV-4, GV-2, GV-3, GV-14, Qi-hai-shu). Acupuncture is often de ned as applied stimulation at discrete and speci c points in the body in order to cause a therapeutic effect. These discrete and speci c locations on the body are called acupuncture points or acupoints. There are various stimulation methods or acupuncture techniques. In the perspective of TCVM, a classical acupuncture technique is dry needling or conventional needling. In modern times, constant manual stimulation of the needles has been replaced by low current electrical stimulation (called EAP). EAP is more commonly used for pain management and nerve damage. EAP stimulation is strong and some horses will not accept it. In this scenario, for safety reasons, TENS can be applied at the acupoints for stimulation instead of EAP. TENS is a milder stimulation and may be tolerated more readily by some horses. Another treatment modality in TCVM is herbal medicine. Three herbal recipes were used orally in the case presented here. Bu Zhong Yi Qi is often used for faecal incontinence in veterinary cases (Song et al. 2010). Double P II (modi edDa Huo Lou Wan ) is used for the central nerve disorders including spinal cord injury (Luo et al. 2010; Zheng 2001). Ju Pi San is used to treat colic or gastrointestinal disturbances in horses(Ferguson 2010). Herbal formulae are usually palatable and can be top dressed on the patient 's feed, particularly when the dose is small (e.g. 15 g). However, because this case did not readilyeat the herbal formulae (perhaps in part because the dose was 30 g), each dose was mixed with water and administered using a dose syringe. Tail blocking procedures are generally cosmetic, unnecessary and, in fact, condemned by the AAEP and AVMA. It is imperative that owners are aware of the risks and potential complications that may result from this procedure. There is little information regarding successful treatment of this condition in the literature and what is available indicates that the prognosis is generally poor to grave. In the case presented here, the use of TCVM appears to have resulted in the reversal of rectal paralysis. Because we report on a single case, it is impossible to know how the mare would have fared without TCVM modalities, which is a signi cant limitation of this report. However, we believe it is important toconsider TCVM therapeutic options, particularly for those cases for which western veterinary medicine therapies are limited.

Morresey Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital, Lexington, Kentucky, USA. Corresponding author email: pmorresey@roodandriddle.com The case report in this issue (Sleeper et al. 2018) details the treatment of rectal paralysis, secondary to administration of an alcohol tail block, with traditional Chinese veterinary medicine (TCVM). The use of alcohol to paralyse the movement of the tail is not sanctioned by the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP). As stated within the report '...The AAEP condemns the alteration of the tail of the horse for cosmetic or competitive purposes ...' rendering the practice unethical. However, this practice continues due to the perceived bene t from having the tail of certain show horses rendered less likely to move inresponse to noxious stimuli. Regrettably, complications of the procedure while relatively rare can be devastating as noted within the case report and the literature (Stewart et al. 1990). In human medicine, ethanol sclerotherapy has several therapeutic applications. Ultrasound guided injection of alcohol is frequently used in the treatment of neuroma (Pasquali et al. 2015), ligamentous structures to control pain (Dagenais et al. 2006) and intravascularly with the aim of sclerosing abnormal vascular structures (Lee et al. 2003; Qiu et al. 2013). Neurological structures can also be targeted as in the desensitisation of the coeliac ganglion to curtail emesis and pain caused by peritoneal in flammation and abdominal neoplasia (Collazos et al. 1996). However, numerous complications have been reported due to leakage ofalcohol from the intended site of application even with the guidance of ultrasonography (intravascular, intralesional). Complications include skin necrosis and brosis of tissue (Prasetyono and Kreshanti 2010). Regionally dissipatingalcohol led to damage to adjacent peripheral nerves either through direct nerve toxicity or ischaemia. In the horse, conventional treatment options for complications of alcohol tail blocking are limited. As detailed in the report, supportive care (faecal softeners, fluids) with manual evacuation of rectal and bladder content is all thatis available to alleviate faecal impaction and urinary retention. Anti-in flammatories and, where tissue necrosis occurs, antimicrobials with possibly surgical debridement mayalso be required. None of these management procedures or therapies can be considered restorative in any way, either of structure or neuromuscular function. In TCVM, the underlying philosophy is to bring the patient back into a state of normal function by restoring balance between the agents or processes causing dysfunction, and the physiological homeostasis of the patient. Organ systems and their interrelationships are modelled upon theories of hierarchies and interactions observed in the natural world. Disease is considered the result of 'external pathogens '. Pain or loss of function is considered to result from disruption to, orstagnation causing cessation of, Qiflow. A restoration of normal function was therefore dependent upon relief ofstagnation of Qi. Application of both physical and nutrienttherapies is used to achieve and maintain this restoration of balance. In the horse that is the subject of this case report, TCVM would seek to address stagnation of Qiflow inherent in the loss of function of the caudal gastrointestinal tract andsupporting perineal tissue. As the gastrointestinal tract, neurological system, and musculoskeletal system are affected, the organ systems in which Qiflow would be 'tonied '(restored to normal and hence balance) would include spleen ( Qiproduction and flow, passage of solid and liquid wastes, muscle function), kidney (central nervoussystem i.e. spinal cord structure and function, water balance), and liver (maintenance of Qi flow, connective tissue integrity). Complicating the understanding of this concept, inTCVM, the organ systems are not necessarily of physical form, and do not necessarily relate to established anatomical concepts. Both systemic (constitutional) and local treatments would be co-ordinated in an overall plan involving the various modalities noted (dry needle, electroacupuncture, aqua-acupuncture and moxibustion) in this case report. Dry needling and electroacupuncture have been detailed in the report. Aqua-acupuncture used autogenous blood to chronically stimulate the acupuncture point in this case report, however any tolerated liquid can be used. Moxibustion applies heat to the acupuncture point, similarly prolonging the effect while promoting Qi flow. Herbal therapies are considered useful to continue the stimulatory effects detailed above, in a more tolerable fashion over an extended treatment period, by directly addressing the same deciencies. In human medicine, with respect to colonic function, electrical stimulation has been shown to have bene cial effects. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation was shown toimprove by increasing the myogenic response to distension (Bouguen et al. 2014). Interestingly, in patients suffering constipation, electrical stimulationexperimentally over an 8-week period caused enhancement of parasympathetic nervous system activation leading to improvement in clinical signs (Chen et al. 2013). While reports of the effectiveness of TCVM techniques on equinegastrointestinal motility de cits are rare, considerable research in laboratory species is supportive of its use. Gastricmotility and emptying, and duodenal motility, have been shown to be improved by electroacupuncture (Ouyang et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2008; Yin and Chen 2011). While this case was approached using TCVM principles, there are physiological foundations that may indicate that amore conventional understanding of effects is possible. Acupuncture has been shown to cause supraspinal analgesia at a segmental level by inhibition of ascending pain bres by both presynaptic and postsynaptic methods (Anderson andHolmgren 1975), endorphin release 2003, \u00a92017 10.1111/eve.12709Most importantly, in this report involving neuronal degeneration, in contrast to the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system retains the ability to regenerate axons to supply target tissues (Deumens et al. 2010). Close approximation of the damaged portions is required, however,to achieve timely and appropriate target tissue reinnervation (Ray and Mackinnon 2010). Surgical techniques facilitate approximation and limited guidance of regenerating axons towards their target. Electrical stimulation has been demonstrated to promote neuronal regeneration and expression of growth-promoting genes (Geremia et al. 2007; Alrashdan et al. 2010). While regeneration of axons is randomly directed, electrical stimulation has variably demonstrated the ability to improve the functionality of reinnervated tissue by neurologically connecting it in a manner more closely approximated to that prior to denervation (Elzinga et al. 2015). Both duration and frequency of stimulation are important, as prolongedstimulation, or that of an unfavourable frequency, has been shown to curtail or misdirect regenerating axons compromising the functionality of the reinnervated tissue when compared to more suitable electrical pro les (Chan et al. 2016). Therefore, a physiological basis for the application of electroacupuncture exists in situations of traumatic denervation. In summary, the use of TCVM to promote a return of function such as in this case is a valid technique, and above all, seems not to have the potential to add further harm tothe affected neurological structures. It is a useful adjunct to those limited techniques currently available, which are, essentially, merely supportive. In addition to the usefulness of TCVM for pain management, regeneration of axons can be promoted by electroacupuncture as demonstrable effect has been proven experimentally. Cauda equina syndrome leading to perineal analgesia, loss of rectal tone and urinaryincontinence as in this case report can in some cases lead to complications precipitating euthanasia of the horse, and in others, chronic dysfunction impacting welfare and utility. Rectal paralysis such as in this case report is easily preventable: veterinarians should not practice the technique, and should strongly counsel lay people who they have the opportunity, and responsibility, to advise not to attempt it.

Archer\u00b6 Dubai Equine Hospital, Zabeel, Dubai, UAE;Institute of Veterinary Pathology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Switzerland;\u00a7Department of Pathology, University of Liverpool, Neston, UK; and\u00b6The Philip Leverhulme Equine colon; colitis Summary Five horses with a primary surgical lesion of the small (descending) colon were diagnosed with eosinophilic colitis based on visual and histopathological examination. These were evident as visibly striking, hyperaemic, focal lesions of the small colon, with serosal petechiation, oedema and marked thickening of the intestinal wall at the site. Areas of focal necrosis were also evident. The gross appearance of the lesions were considered to be sufciently severe in all cases to merit resection, due to concerns about intestinal necros is and septic peritonitis. An inability to fully exteriorise the affected portion of intestine to perform a resection and anastomosis necessitated intraoperative euthanasia of one horse. A total of three horses survived to hospital discharge. Eosinophilic colitis lesions are a rare cause of severe small colon disease, but should be considered in cases with similar visual characteristics. Introduction Focal and multifocal idiopathic eosinophilic lesions are an uncommon but important cause of gastrointestinal disease in the horse. They have been previously described as causes of acute abdominal pain (colic) as a result of either lesions in the large colon, described as segmental eosinophilic colitis lesions (Bertone et al. 1986; Edwards et al. 2000) and as idiopathic focal eosinophilic enteritis (IFEE)lesions of the small intestine (Scott et al. Southwood et al. 2000; Stanar et al. 2002; al. 2003; Archer et al. 2006; Perez Olmos et al. 2006). Focal eosinophilic inltration of the small colon has been brie fly reported in the literature (M \u20acakinen et al. 2008; de Bont et al. 2013), but there have not been any detailed reports of the clinical and histopathological features, nor of the outcome in these cases. Primary lesions of the small (descending) colon account for a relatively small percentage (2.8 -4.2%) of colic cases requiring surgical treatment (Edwards 1992; Mairand Smith 2005). Eosinophilic colitis lesions affecting the small colon represent a small proportion of these, having been identi ed in 6% (5/84) of horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy for treatment of colic which wasdue to a primary lesion of the small colon in one study (de Bont et al. 2013). The aim of this study was to detail the clinical and histopathological features of focal, idiopathiceosinophilic colitis of the small colon.Case details Signalment A total of ve horses, where a surgical and histopathological diagnosis of eosinophilic colitis of the small colon as theprimary cause of colic was made, were identi ed in case records at the Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital, betweenAugust 2004 and August 2010. The signalment, clinical and clinicopathological ndings of all horses are summarised in Table 1 . There was no evidence of age, breed or sex predisposition when compared with the general hospitalpopulation. None of the horses had a history of previous colic signs and there did not appear to be any characteristic presurgical ndings indicative of an eosinophilic colitis lesion. The median age was 11 years (range 7 -21 years). The decision to perform an exploratory laparotomy was based on abnormal rectal and ultrasonographic ndings, clinical parameters and/or persistent pain despite the administrationof analgesics. Abdominocentesis was not performed in any of the cases prior to surgery, due to other clinical ndings indicating that exploratory laparotomy was required. Surgical ndings At exploratory laparotomy the lesions were evident as visibly striking, hyperaemic, focal lesions of the small colon with serosal petechiation ( Fig 1 ) and considered to be the primary cause of abdominal pain. There was evidence of oedemaand marked thickening of the intestinal wall at the site. Other ndings included gaseous distention of the small colon, oedema of the mesocolon and impaction of ingesta orad tothe lesion. Due to the degree of mural thickening and evidence of focal necrosis already developing at the site, leaving the affected portion of colon in situ was considered likely to result in a poor prognosis for survival, due to the risk ofdeveloping septic peritonitis. Resection was therefore undertaken in four horses and a two layer hand sewn end-to- end anastomosis performed (Rakestraw and Hardy 2012). Examination of the resected portions of intestine revealed a green appearance to the mucosa and submucosa, consistent with tissue necrosis. The length of resection ranged from 15 to 180 cm. One horse (Horse 5) was subjected to euthanasia intraoperatively due to the extent of the lesion and an inability to suf ciently exteriorise the affected portions in order to expose healthy tissue margins. Histopathology The lesions represented a focal severe eosinophilic and granulomatous Mucosal regions mixed cellular inltrates ofplasma cells, lymphocytes, macrophages and often mild of (Fig2a).Moderate inltrates of neutrophils with ofneutrophils. there multiple foci ofhomogenous eosinophilic nally these foci were associated tracts extending between muscle layers, coalescing with follicular lymphoid aggregates (Fig2c).Serosal regions wereintensely ofsmall using standard (haematoxylin and eosin) stains. Outcome Following aninitial good recovery from surgery, Horse 1 deteriorated rapidly 11days post-operatively and developed marked abdominal pain that was nonresponsive toanalgesia. The owner did not want repeat laparotomy tobe performed and the gelding was subjected to euthanasia onDay 12.Post-mortem examination revealed multiple adhesions between the small intestine and small colon anastomosis site resulting inasmall intestinal obstruction. Asmall 3-4mm defect was evident inthe anastomosis the adhesions had been dissected. Horses uneventfully and were discharged atamean of10.33 days post-operatively (short- term survival ofhorses recovered was 75%). Horse 2was subjected toeuthanasia 184days post- operatively due torecurrent colic episodes, nopost- examination was performed. Horse 3was stillalive atthe time ofwriting, with no 4was subjected toeuthanasia 257days post-ope ratively following an acute injury and fracture associated with thecubital joint. Discussion This study isthe rst to describe the clinical and histopathological features ofaseries offocal eosinophilic lesions ofthe small colon. The lesions were visibly striking in appearance and should be considered asarare, but possible cause ofsimple obstruction ofthe small colon, when there isno evidence ofaprimary intraluminal obstruction, which may necessitate intestinal resection. There are both similarities and differences between the clinical and histological features offocal eosinophilic lesions ofthe small colon, when compared with those previously described inboth the large colon (Edwards etal.2000) and small intestine (IFEE; Archer etal.2006).TABLE 1:Case signalment, preoperative clinical parameters and outcome ofthevehorses with focal eosinophilic colitis lesions ofthe small colon Case number 1 2 3 4 5 Age (years) 7 11 7 18 21 Gender Gelding Gelding Mare Gelding Gelding Breed TBX Cob Pony WB Cob Bodyweight (kg) 508 484 365 500 562 Stereotypical behaviour No No Crib biter No No Duration ofcolic signs (h) * 75 ** 4 Preoperative diarrhoea No No No No No Preoperative abdominal distention No Yes * No Yes Temperature (\u00b0C) 37.6 37.9 * 37.9 38.2 HR(beats/min) 48 88 68 46 60 PCV (%) 37 30 35 27 40 TP(g/l) 75 62 62 70 78 Lactate (mmol/l) ** 1.4 1.7 2.5 Resection length (cm) 15 30 60 180 N/A Survival days 12 184 >2000 257 0 Cause ofdeath Colic-rela ted identi ed demonstrating the degree of serosal hyperaemia and petechation evident, together with focal areas ofmural necrosis. \u00a92016 EVJLtd467 8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201The lesions inthe current series were evident asvisibly striking, focal, hyperaemic lesions with serosal petechiation, oedema thickening afocal and granulomatous colitis. Eosinophilic colitis lesions identi edinthe large colon have been reported to have marked thickening and oedema ofthecolon wall, with variable serosal changes from petechiation, orerythema to discrete, well dened areas ofserosal necrosis and abnormalities ofvarying swelling (Archer etal.2006). In contrast lesions, serosal necrosis has not been described asacharacteristic ofIFEE lesions. Aclear demarcation between affected and normal bowel edge ofthesegmental lesionsidenti edinthe small colon and those affecting the small intestine (Archer etal.2006). The lesions described inthe current study had several similarities tothose occurring inthelarge (ascending) colon. Inaseries ofhorses with eosinophilic colitis ofthelarge colon, partial colon resection was performed in16/22 (72%) cases, where the external appearance ofthe serosa and transmural necrosis indicated lack oftissue viability (Edwards etal. 2000). Large colon resection was considered unnecessary invecases where the appearance ofthe intestine was relatively normal and luminal occlusion was minimal, buttheauthors considered that there was ariskof progressive intestinal necrosis post-operatively incases that did not undergo resection (Edwards etal.2000). survival (dened asdischarge from was previously considered necessary and undertaken in10/12 cases inone series, with 50 mixed cellular inltrate (few eosinophils), with extensive loss epithelial lumen. b)H&E AE short-term survival to discharge of 83% (10/12) and 58% survival at 13 months post-operatively (Archer et al. 2006). However, a separate study suggested that theselesions could be left in situ, with resection and anastomosis only performed in 1/28 cases of IFEE in which 100% of cases survived to hospital discharge (Perez Olmos et al. 2006). In the authors 'hospital, IFEE cases now routinely undergo manual decompression only and are not resected unless intestinal viability or severe luminal obstruction is a concern. This suggests that IFEE lesions would appear to have different characteristics with regard to mucosal barrier function and progression of lesion necrosis when compared with eosinophilic lesions of the small or large colon. Resection of the affected portion of small colon was performed in four out of ve of the horses in this series. Due to the degree of mural thickening and concerns about focalnecrosis already developing at the site, leaving the affected portion of colon in situ was considered likely to result in a poor prognosis for survival. Several factors should be considered when undertaking resection of small colon including the frequent large amounts of adipose tissue in the mesentery making vessel identi cation and ligation more difcult and the need to ensure that the mesenteric portion of the anastomosis is secure to prevent leakage occurring (Rakestraw and Hardy 2012). High concentrations of collagenase and bacteria within the bowel, along with the mechanical stress endured by movement of hard faecal balls within the lumen post-operatively may also result in thepotential for leakage of the anastomosis to occur (Rakestraw and Hardy 2012). In man, small colon bacterial populations are rich in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and contain a high level of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), with abnormal upregulation of MMPs and disturbances in the extracellular matrix identi ed in patients with anastomotic leakage following colorectal surgery (Stumpf et al. 2005). Complications following enterotomy or resection and anastomosis of the small colon in horses, however, are rare, being reported to occur in just under 5% of cases (Prange et al. 2010), including dehiscence of part of the anastomosis which occurred in one case in the present study. Mediansurvival times following small colon resection have been reported at just under 3 years, which is lower when compared with horses with a primary lesion of the small colon not requiring resection, reported at just under 8.5 years (de Bont et al. 2013). The histopathological ndings reported in focal eosinophilic lesions affecting the large colon (Edwards et al. 2000), are similar to the lesions of the small colon described inthe present case series, but there are some contrasting ndings compared with histopathological features of focal lesions affecting the small intestine. Necrotic mucosa in thesmall colon cases contained neutrophils and eosinophils, with bacterial colonisation on the surface of devitalised mucosa, consistent with similar lesions in the large colon (Edwards et al. 2000). In contrast, IFEE lesions typically had a moderate diffuse in flammation of the lamina propria of the mucosa, with mild to moderate changes associated with the lamina epithelialis mucosae, represented by short, stubby or shattered villi and focal necrosis or erosion of villous tip epithelial cells (M \u20acakinen et al. 2008). In the latter lesions, lymphocytes dominated the in flammatory in ltrate, followed by macrophages, eosinophils, plasma cells and neutrophils indecreasing numbers (M \u20acakinen et al. 2008). The submucosalregions of the large colon lesions reported by Edwards et al. (2000) were again similar to the lesions of the small colondescribed in the current study and were characterised in ltrates of varying intensity. In addition, variable features included small numbers of neutrophils, submucosal broplasia and granulation tissue formation (Edwards et al. 2000). In contrast, the transmural inflammatory in ltration within the submucosa of IFEE lesions was dominated by eosinophils and macrophages, withsmaller numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils (M\u20acakinen et al. 2008). Diffuse oedema and hyperaemia was often noted, with occasional focal areas of necrosisrepresenting degenerate eosinophils (M \u20acakinen et al. 2008). The muscularis of the large colon was generally wellpreserved in eosinophilic colitis lesions with variable focal necrosis, oedema and brinous exudate (Edwards et al. 2000). The transmural in flammatory in ltration within the muscularis of IFEE lesions was dominated by eosinophils and macrophages (M \u20acakinen et al. 2008), similar to ndings in the muscularis of the small colon in the current series. In addition,swelling, vacuolation and necrosis of the muscularis was evident in IFEE lesions (Archer et al. 2006). Histologically, the serosal surfaces of large colon lesions were hyperaemic,oedematous and in ltrated by variable numbers of eosinophils (Edwards et al. 2000), again similar to the lesions described in the current study, which were intensely hyperaemic. Focal in flammatory in ltrates were reported to often, but not always, extend to the serosal layer of IFEE lesions (M \u20acakinen et al. 2008). The cause of the focal lesions in the current series and those affecting the large colon (Edwards et al. 2000) and small intestine (Archer et al. 2006, 2015; M \u20acakinen et al. 2008), remains unknown and requires further research. There was no evidence of a primary cause for the eosinophilic in ltrate in the current series based on histopathological examination.Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease (EGID) is uncommon in man and characterised by either focal or diffuse eosinophilic inltrate within the gastrointestinal tract, without evidence of known causes of eosinophilia including parasitism, drugreactions and malignancy (Rothenberg 2004; Sheikh et al. 2009). Gastroduodenal involvement is most commonly seen, with cases rarely affecting the colon (Sheikh et al. 2009). Indeed, eosinophilic colitis represents the least frequent manifestation of EGID, irrespective of whether or not other segments of the gastrointestinal tract are involved (Guajardo et al. 2002). The disease has been classi ed into mucosal, submucosal (transmural) and serosal forms, based on thepredominant eosinophilic in ltrates (Klein et al. 1970; Talley et al. 1990). Gastrointestinal obstruction is uncommon and associated primarily with the transmural form of the disease, manifesting as gastric outlet or duodenal obstruction and intestinal thickening (Sheikh et al. 2009). The transmural form has also been associated withintussusception, volvulus and perforation (Fraile et al. 1994; Box et al. 1997; Velchuru et al. 2007) and may therefore be most similar to the lesions seen in the small and large colons in horses. The serosal form is distinguishable by the presence of eosinophilic ascites, with up to 88% eosinophils seen on fluid analysis (Kravis et al. 1982). Peripheral eosinophilia has also been reported in up to 80% of cases (Khan and Orenstein 2008). Mucosal predominant disease results in mucosal dysfunction and manifests clinically as protein-losing \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd469 EQUINE malabsorption and diarrhoea (Okpara et al. 2009). Eosinophils were reported in peritoneal fluid in 4/6 (67%) of horses presenting with IFEE (Southwood et al. 2000). Eosinophil levels were not measured in the peritoneal fluid in this series. Since eosinophils are not normally identi ed in the peritoneal fluid of healthy horses or horses with simple or strangulating intestinal obstructions, it would be interesting to see whether peritoneal fluid analysis could be used to predict the likelihood of the presence of a focal eosinophilic lesion. Conclusions The visual and histological features of focal eosinophiliclesions of the small colon causing intestinal obstruction are similar to those previously described in both the large colon (Edwards et al. 2000) and small intestine (Archer et al. 2006; M\u20acakinen et al. 2008). However, the primary difference between lesions in the small and large colons and those thatoccur in the small intestine appears to be in the degree of mucosal and serosal necrosis. Eosinophilic colitis lesions are rare but should be considered as a potential cause of obstruction of the small colon, which may progress to development of septic peritonitis. Surgical resection of these lesions can result in a successful outcome. The underlying cause of focal eosinophilic lesions affecting the equine small intestine, large and small colon has not been determined and further research is required.

Schumacher* and R. Legere Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, USA. *Corresponding author email: schumjo@auburn.edu Keywords: horse; eosinophil; intestine Summary Eosinophilic intestinal diseases of the horse are not commonly reported. Similar diseases are reported in man, but for either species, these eosinophilic diseases, are poorly understood. Eosinophilic intestinal disease may be accompanied by eosinophilic disease of other organs, or eosinophilia may be restricted to the intestine. When in ltration of eosinophils is restricted to the intestine, horses have a good prognosis forresolution of clinical signs, even though the treatment may include celiotomy with intestinal decompression or resection and administration of a corticosteroid. When eosinophilic intestinal disease is accompanied by in ltration of other organs, such as skin, pancreas, lungs or liver, the horse 's prognosis for survival is very poor. Inltration of the equine intestine with eosinophils is known to be caused by endoparasitism (French et al. 1996; Love et al. 1999; Headley et al. 2008; D ez de Castro et al. 2016) ,or, rarely, Pythium insidiosum (Allison and Gillis 1990; Morton et al. et al. 1994), but in ltration of eosinophils into the equine intestine is also frequently an idiopathic condition. An understanding of intestinal disease of the horse characterised by idiopathic in ltration of eosinophils is somewhat hampered by nomenclature. Saying that a horse has eosinophilicenteritis seems akin to saying a horse is brown; not much information is conveyed by that description. Until the aetiologies of eosinophilic intestinal diseases are determined, we believe that the terms eosinophilic colitis, eosinophilic enteritis and eosinophilic enterocolitis, which may have different meanings to different clinicians, should not be used. Instead, we believe that terminology used in recent reports of eosinophilic intestinal disease in the horse, as shown in Fig 1 , should be used when describing idiopathic, eosinophilicintestinal disease. Classi cation of equine idiopathic eosinophilic intestinal diseases is currently based primarily on the clinicopathological characteristics displayed by the affected horse. A major grouping of these diseases distinguishes systemic eosinophilic disease (i.e. multisystemic eosinophilic epitheliotropic disease or MEED) from idiopathic eosinophilic diseases con ned to the intestine (EDCI). The clinical presentation and the course of disease of horses with EDCIdiffer from that of horses with MEED. In addition to having eosinophilic in ltration of intestine (usually large colon), horses with MEED have eosinophilic in ltration of the liver, pancreas, oesophagus, skin, blood and oral cavity (Lindberg et al. 1985; Nimmo Wilkie et al. 1985; Gibson and Alders 1987; La Perle et al. 1998). Horses with MEED are often presented for weight loss, lethargy, subcutaneous oedema and skin disease, and,rarely, respiratory disease, whereas horses with eosinophilicinltrates con ned to the intestinal tract are usually presentedfor signs of abdominal pain (Scott et al. 1999; Edwards et al. 2000; Southwood et al. 2000; Swain et al. 2003; al. 2006; Perez et al. 2006; Makinen et al. 2008; De Bont et al. 2013, 2018; Archer et al. 2014). Horses with MEED almost never survive, whereas the prognosis for survival for horseswith EDCI tends to be favourable, even though the treatment may include celiotomy with intestinal decompression or resection and administration of a corticosteroid. A salient feature of horses with MEED is protein-losing enteropathy, whereas horses with EDCI are unlikely to have substantial changes in the serum concentration of protein. Eosinophilic disease of horses con ned to the intestine has been further categorised into diffuse eosinophilic enteritis(DEE) and idiopathic focal (or enteritis(IFEE). Horses are diagnosed with IFEE during celiotomy, performed because of signs of abdominal pain, when circumferential mural bands or plaque-like constrictions are found in the small or large intestine. These grossly visible lesions are considered by some to be pathognomic for IFEE (Scott et al. 1999). Of the intestinal diseases characterised by in ltration of eosinophils, DEE is the most poorly described. Gross intestinal lesions of horses with DEE were not described in a report that proposed characterising DEE as an eosinophil-dominated, idiopathic, in flammatory condition affecting intestinal segments, not associated with systemic in ltration of eosinophils (Makinen et al. 2008). Clinical signs displayed in horses with DEE were similar to those displayed by horses withIFEE, and thickened intestine was found during ultrasonographic examination of the abdominal viscera, palpation of intestine per rectum, or celiotomy (Archer and Southwood Parente 2014). Some horses with DEE may have signs similar to those with MEED. Four horses with diarrhoea and weight-loss reported by Pass and Bolton (1982) were assumed by other researchers to have DEE (Archer et al. 2006), but Pass and Bolton (1982) believed the four horses tohave MEED when comparing case details with Nimmo Wilkie et al. (1985), who reported clinical details of ve horses with MEED. Whether horses with DEE sometimes develop diarrhoeais not clear from a review of the literature, but like horses with MEED, horses with DEE may experience weight loss and develop a low concentration of plasma protein (Archer and Southwood Parente 2014). An intense focal in flammatory in ltration of eosinophils involving the submucosa and disrupting the architecture of the muscularis externa was seen during histological examination of the grossly visible focal lesions in intestinal tissue harvested from horses with IFEE (Makinen et al. 2008). Results of that study showed that IFEE is a focally exacerbatedinflammatory reaction in horses with DEE, indicating that IFEE and DEE may be manifestations of the same disease. Edwards \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd472 al. 22 with eosinophilic colitis (SEC) characterised by in ltration of eosinophils into the mucosa, submucosa and muscular layers of a segment of the left dorsal colon slightly aboral to the pelvic flexure. De Bont et al. (2013) described a similar condition occurring in the descending colon of ve horses. In many cases, necrosis of the descending colon was grossly evident. These investigatorsrecommended excising oedematous, hyperaemic segments of colon with serosal petechiation because, even if these segments appear viable, they may become necrotic as the disease progresses. Idiopathic focal eosinophilic enteritis, DEE and SEC (in the ascending or descending colon) are probably all manifestations of the same disease (Kerbyson and Knottenbelt 2015). The pathogenesis and aetiology of systemic eosinophilic disease of horses, as in man, are poorly understood. Authors ofsome reports speculate that the cause of MEED may be abnormal proliferation of type 2 helper T lymphocytes that overproduce eosinophilopoietic cytokines, such as interleukin 5 (La Perle et al. 1998; Singh et al. 2006). Some human patients affected with systemic hypereosinophilia have populations ofphenotypically abnormal, activated T lymphocytes that produce eosinophilopoietic cytokines, particularly interleukin 5, whereas other patients affected with a systemic eosinophilia syndrome have underlying neoplasia (Tefferi et al. 2010). Idiopathic eosinophilic disease con ned to the gastrointestinal tract is also reported in people where the syndrome is often referred to as eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder (Rothenberg 2004). Diagnostic criteria for this syndrome is based on symptoms of gastrointestinal malfunction and eosinophilic in ltration of the gastrointestinal tract in the absence of known causes for eosinophilia, suchas drug reaction, parasitic infections, and malignancy (Rothenberg 2004). Human eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease is thought to be an allergic response with a genetic component, and treatment usually involves administration of a corticosteroid and reduction of exposure to antigens; focal regions of obstructive or ischaemic intestine, however, are often resected to restore function (Yun et al. 2007).Although the concentration of eosinophils in intestinal tissues is typically increased in response to infection with helminths, the in flammatory cellular pattern seen in diseased intestine of horses with IFEE makes helminth infection a highlyunlikely cause of IFEE (Proudman and Kipar 2006). Results of an epidemiological study demonstrated that the burdens of nematodes and cestodes in horses affected with IFEE were low and not statistically different from those burdens found in randomly selected normal horses (Archer et al. 2008). Denitive ante-mortem diagnosis of MEED is possible without intestinal biopsy obtained by celiotomy; diagnosis can be made based on clinical signs combined with histological evaluation of tissue obtained by biopsy from affected organs, such as skin, rectal mucosa, liver or lung (Lindberg et al. 1985, 1996; McCue et al. 2003). De nitive diagnosis of EDCI is more dif cult, because celiotomy is necessary to obtain tissue for histological examination.Provisional diagnosis of EDCI is made while horses are undergoing exploratory celiotomy performed because of abnormalities found during examination of the abdomen per rectum or during ultrasonographic examination, abnormal appearance of peritoneal fluid and/or signs of signs of unremitting abdominal pain (Edwards et al. 2000; Archer et al. 2006; Makinen et al. 2008; De Bont et al. 2013, 2018). Horses with IFEE have been treated by resecting affected small intestine during exploratory celiotomy (Scott et al. 1999; Archer et al. 2006) but rapid resolution of clinical signs may occur when small intestine is merely decompressed (Perez Olmos et al. 2006). When the ascending colon is observed to be affected with SEC during exploratory celiotomy, resectionof the diseased segment may not always be necessary but nevertheless is advised because eventual necrosis of affected colon is likely (Edwards et al. 2000). Resection of affected colon is also likely to be necessary when SECinvolves the descending colon (De Bont et al. 2018). Medical treatment of horses for MEED or EDCI generally involvesadministering a corticosteroid, even though the ef cacy of corticosteroids for treatment for EDCI is not proven, andexcept for rare cases of MEED and Alders intestinal disease MEED IFEE DEESECAscending and descending colonEDCILikely all the same disease with different manifestations, partly depending on DEE = Diffuse eosinophilic enteritis IFEE diseases confined to the intestineSmall intestinesegment of intestine involved Fig 1: Current terminology and classi cation of eosinophilic intestinal diseases in the DEE, diffuse eosinophilic enteritis; EDCI, idiopathic eosinophilic EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201McCue et al. 2003), treatment with a corticosteroid provides only short-term improvement (Lindberg et al. 1985). Based on the similar histopathological lesions of horses with substantial eosinophilic in ltrates apparently restricted to the small intestine (IFEE, DEE) (Makinen et al. 2008) and ascending and descending colons (Edwards et al. 2000; De Bont et al. 2013, 2018), IFEE and DEE might have a similar aetiology and pathogenesis. The aetiology and pathogenesis of MEED probably differs from that of IFEE and DEE, and unquestionably, horses with MEED have a worse prognosis for survival than do horses with EDCI. Until the aetiologies of eosinophilic intestinal diseases are determined, a combination of clinical and morphological diagnoses must sufce to guide management and prognosis of horses with these diseases.

J. Tannahill* School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol, Langford, Bristol, UK. *Corresponding author email: victoria.tannahill@bristol.ac.uk Summary Background The sphenopalatine (SP) sinuses communicate with the caudal maxillary sinuses and are in close apposition to the ethmoturbinates and cranium. Multiple pathologies of the SP sinus are reported, but pathology in this location can be challenging to diagnose. Radiographs of the region are difcult to interpret due to the superimposition of multiple structures. Recently, computed tomography (CT) hasbecome preferable for detailed diagnosis of sinus disorders. Surgical access to the SP sinuses is limited and therefore accurate diagnosis can in fluence treatment options and improve outcomes. Search strategy A PICO (population-intervention-comparison-outcome) questionwas constructed: in horses with sphenopalatine sinus disease (P), is computed tomography (I) more useful than radiography (C) in attaining a diagnosis (O)? The CAB Abstracts database was searched using the following terms: \u0081(horse* OR equine) AND sphenopalatine OR equine) AND sinus AND (computedtomography OR CT) Quantity of evidence Screening of the search results identi ed ten relevant papers. One was a combined observational and retrospectivestudy, ve were retrospective studies and four were case reports. Quality of evidence Only Manso-D /C19azet al. (2015) compared radiography with CT for all types of SP sinus disease. One further article by Tucker et al. (2016) included all cases of SP sinus disease, but only CT was performed on clinical cases. The remaining papers onlyaddressed radiography, or compared radiography with CT for one particular SP sinus pathology. Manso-D /C19azet al. (2015) discussed the role of equine head CT. A total of three of 18 horses (17%) diagnosed with SP sinus disease on CT also had a positive radiographic diagnosis. In their cadaveric study, Tucker et al. (2016) compared CT images, plain radiographs and contrast radiographs of 10 heads. The SP sinus was readily identi able on CT images, but not on plain radiographs. Following instillation of contrastmaterial, the borders of the SP sinus were appreciated radiographically, but retrospective analysis of the plain radiographs still failed to identify the SP sinus. Notably, in 14 clinical cases of SP disease, CT was unable to differentiate between SP sinus pathologies on the basis of attenuation.A study of 277 horses with sinonasal disease (Tremaine and Dixon 2001) identi ed a soft tissue opacity in the area of the ethmoturbinates or SP sinus in 12 of 21 cases (57%) withprogressive ethmoidal haematoma (PEH) of the SP sinus. Similarly, Gibbs and Lane (1987) documented one case of PEH involving the SP sinus, but it was not identi ed radiographically. A signi cant limitation of these two studies is the quality of lm radiographs compared with modern digital systems; if the studies were repeated nowadays, the sensitivityof this modality may be greater. In the study by Textor et al. (2012) of 16 horses with PEH, the SP sinus was involved in six cases. A mass was identi ed radiographically in 15 cases, but in ve of these the anatomic location determined by radiography was incorrect. Also, bilateral disease was only diagnosed in two of eight horses in which it occurred; half of the undetected cases involved the SP sinus. Cissell et al. (2012) identi ed a mass on radiographs of all 15 cases of sinonasal neoplasia, but the accuracy of mass location varied by sinus compartment, with radiographs being least sensitive for the SP sinus (0/5 cases). The authors also commented that contrast-enhanced CT in two horses helped to differentiate the tumour margins from sinus fluid and normal adjacent soft tissue. In three of the case reports (Smith and Perkins 2009; Kafarnik et al. 2014; Federici et al. 2015), radiographic ndings underestimated the extent of the lesion and failed to identifyinvolvement of the SP sinus, which was subsequently diagnosed by CT. Behrens et al. (1991) documented two cases of SP sinus disease, one of which was diagnosedradiographically. Can this evidence be applied to my clinical scenario? In summary, the sensitivity of radiography in diagnosing SPsinus disease ranges from 0 -57%, whereas the sensitivity of CT is 100%, although it cannot distinguish the exact pathologypresent. No false diagnoses were made in any of the papers appraised, therefore the speci city for both radiography and CT may be assumed to be high. Clinical message Based upon the evidence available, it is concluded that CT issuperior to radiography in the diagnosis of SP sinus disease. It should be considered in all cases of sinus disease as the SP sinus is often involved secondarily and its involvement may reduce the prognosis (Textor et al. 2012). Radiographs are a useful screening tool for the presence of sinus disease (Cissellet al. 2012), but they often underestimate the extent of lesions, their true location and the presence of bilateraldisease (Smith and Perkins 2009; Textor et al. 2012; al. 2014; Federici et al. 2015). Contrast-enhanced CT may offer an advantage for outlining sinus masses (Cissell et al. \u00a92017 EVJ may be indicative of PEH (Textor et al. 2012), further work is required to validate the attenuation of speci c SP sinus pathologies (Tucker et al. 2016).

Veterinary examination of the sore back used to be limited to manual palpation with diagnosis conrmed empirically by response to treatment. Today, due to advances in imaging, there are multiple methods for evaluating the pathology of the horse 's thoracolumbar (TL) spine. Radiography, ultrasonography, nuclear scintigraphy,thermography and algometry all play a part in developing a better understanding of equine TL problems. Despite this progress, de nitive diagnosis can still be problematic. There is a lack of objectivity in understanding the implications of thepathology detected and its effect on the horse. It is dif cult to determine the degree of pain experienced by individualhorses and how that interferes with their performance and welfare. This paper emphasises the importance of a systematic clinical examination to identify the presence of pain that can be supported by recognition of pathology using a range of diagnostic aids. These will also be reviewed to assist the clinician in understanding the tools available to evaluate a horse with a sore back. Introduction A review of thoracolumbar (TL) problems was published over thirty years ago (Jeffcott 1979a). At that time, diagnostic protocols and therapies were limited. Radiography of the horse 's spine was dif cult to perform and ultrasonography in veterinary medicine was new and had not been applied tothe horse 's back. Nuclear scintigraphy in horses had only recently been reported (Ueltschi 1977). Veterinarians relied onthe use of manual palpation, range of motion (ROM) andresponse to treatment to evaluate and treat horses with back pain. In thirty years, signi cant advances have been made in understanding the biomechanics and pathology affecting the equine TL spine. Despite this, diagnostic techniques remain in the hands of specialists and the implications of back pain are often confusing. There is a need for research to improve our understanding of TL pain in horses. The only standardised method to objectively assess the degree of TL pain experienced by the horse was reported by Haussler and Erb (2006a,b) using the algometer. This tool applies pressure via a small device and measures the horse 's response. Most veterinarians do not have an algometer or the training to useone and so rely on digital palpation. This results in a subjective assessment and affects the ability to objectively determine a response to treatment.The establishment of practical and objective criteria to quantify TL pain is required to aid the clinician in assessing a horse for back problems (Jeffcott 2010). We have increased our ability to recognise pathology in the horse 's TL spine with radiography, nuclear scintigraphy and other techniques, but these techniques are not readily available to the general practitioner. However, it is possible for a veterinarian in the eld to identify and assess a horse with TL pain and determine if further diagnostic evaluation is warranted. This review will highlight the literature currently available to help practitioners develop a better understanding of equineTL pain and its effect on performance. Back pain and functional anatomy The functional anatomy of the horse 's back is a major consideration in the evaluation of equine TL pain. The accepted biomechanical representation of the equine back is the concept of the string and bow arrangement suggested originally by Barthez 1798 ( Figs 1 and 2). The bow section is the TL spine and the epaxial muscles, including thelongissimus dorsi and multi dus muscle, providing stability as well as locomotion. The muscles involved in tensing the bow are the hypaxial muscles that lie ventral to the transverse processes of the vertebrae: the psoas major and minor quadratus lumborum . The sternum, the transverse abdominus , the rectus abdominus and the two oblique muscles make up the string of the bow (Slijper 1946) and are involved in flexing the back. The psoas muscles have also Epaxial musculature of and STRINGBOW abdominal muscles Abdominal viscera Fig 1: Bow and string diagram of the biomechanics of the horse 's back (Jeffcott 10.1111/eve.12623been identi ed as having a flexing effect, but primarily affect the pelvic and lumbosacral regions (Van Weeren 2009). The epaxial muscles consisting of the strong longissimus dorsi and the smaller multi dus muscles lie dorsal to the transverse processes of the vertebral bodies (Kidd 2009). Research performed by Robert et al. (2001) analysed the effect of treadmill speed on the kinematics of the horse 's back. With an increase in the activity of the muscles in the horse 's trunk, there was a restriction in back movement and a stabilisation of the spine. This is re flected in the work done by Hyyti \u20acainen et al. (2014) in determining the muscle bre types in the deep epaxial muscles of the horse. Thelongissimus dorsi muscles have a high proportion of fast twitchbres, suggesting a predominantly locomotory role. The multi dus muscle contains a mixture of fast and slow twitch bres, indicating both a stabilising and locomotory role. When activated, the multi dus muscle resists the flexion caused by the abdominal muscles, thereby increasing stabilisation or stiffness of the spine (McGowan et al. 2007). The multi dus is also believed to be involved in proprioception and posturalcontrol (Stubbs et al. 2006). Using the string and bow concept, the vertebral column with its associated musculature is maintained as a relatively rigid structure with less than 10 \u00b0of flexion at each intervertebral joint. There is even less ROM in the extensionof the spine. Lateral flexibility is greater in the mid-thoracic spine, with up to 10 \u00b0of movement, than in the lumbar spine, where there is only 3 -5\u00b0of lateral flexibility (Townsend et al. 1983). Limb movements also affect the horse 'sT L spine. Retraction of the forelimb and protraction of the hindlimb have a flexing affect on the back (Van Weeren 2009). The head and neck of the horse also factor into thespinal kinematics as lowering of the head will cause tension in the nuchal ligament and forward rotation of the cranial thoracic vertebrae (Berner et al. 2012). This action will also flex the TL spine, just as raising the head will result in tensing of the back muscles, causing reduced ROM (Rhodin et al. 2005).In 1980, Jeffcott quanti ed the types of pathology seen in the back of the horse by evaluating the records of 443 casesreferred for back problems to the Equine Research Station of the Animal Health Trust, Suffolk, UK. He found that the two most common causes of back pain were soft tissue damage (38.8%) and bony lesions (38.6%). The most common bony lesion was overriding dorsal spinous processes (DSPs). The most common soft tissue condition was muscle strain, with sacroiliac strain also prevalent (Jeffcott et al. 1985). Since Jeffcott completed this work in 1980, ultrasonography andscintigraphy have improved the ability to identify more spinal issues and it would be interesting to repeat this study today, using current diagnostic techniques. Stubbs et al. (2010) examined 22 racehorses that were subjected to euthanasia for problems other than back conditions. All horses had mild to moderate osseous pathology in the areas of the spine examined. In 17/22 horses, active new bone formation was noted, indicating severe spinal pathology. The prevalence of severe osseous pathology was greatest in the lumbar area, but all horses had some degree of bony pathology in their thoracolumbar spine. Improved understanding of functional anatomy has enabled recognition of aberrant movement patterns in the horse. It is important to realise that there are many more causes of pathology than there are methods for horses to alter their way of moving (Van Weeren 2009). Detecting changes in a horse 's pattern of movement can be dif cult. There are, however, many other factors to consider whendetermining the level of TL pain in a horse. Equine thoracolumbar pain Pain occurs when noxious stimuli affect a tissue or organ and the unmyelinated nociceptor nerve bres are stimulated. Nociceptive bres are speci c high threshold sensory nerves programmed to respond only to noxious stimuli (Woolf 2004). These bres enter the spinal cord and travel to the brain via the lateral spinothalamic tract. The nerve bres end in the Epaxial musculature spine abdominal musclesAbdominal viscera Fig 2: Diagrammatic representation of the construction of the horse 's body axis (Jeffcott 1979a). \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201 478higher brain centres, where their impulses are perceived as pain. To complicate this process, there are opportunities along this 'pain pathway 'for intrinsic and extrinsic factors to affect the nature, degree and duration of the pain event(Zaki 2013). Pain causes measurable physiological responses that can be identi ed, but these responses tend to be indicators of a stress response rather than speci c for pain (Zaki 2013). Changes in behaviour as well as posture and facial expression have been postulated as indicators of pain in animals (Langford et al. 2010; Lesimple et al. 2012). Behavioural changes, abnormal or awkward posture, stiffness,positive response to palpation and reduced performance can all point toward a pain response. Pain assessment also involves quantifying how much pain an animal is experiencing. Pain scales and pain scoring systems are all used to try to identify the animal 's level of pain (Bussi /C18eres, et al. 2008; Wagner 2010; Van Loon et al. 2010). Pain can be adaptive or maladaptive. Acute pain is considered adaptive and is a response to tissue injury.Initiated by the in flammatory process, the response to the noxious stimulus is appropriate and re flects the degree of damage to the affected tissue. Pain becomes maladaptive when the painful experience continues despite the removal of the noxious stimulus. This type of pain is chronic, dif cult to evaluate and dif cult to treat, requiring a multifaceted approach. In horses, it is associated with conditions such as chronic laminitis and navicular disease and results inhyperalgesia, allodynia and spontaneous pain (Zaki 2013; Daglish and Mama 2016). In animals, maladaptive pain can result in behaviours dif cult for the veterinarian to assess or understand. Bucking under saddle, aggression while beinggirthed and 'cold-backed 'behaviour are often considered training or behavioural issues (Holmes and Jeffcott 2010;Jeffcott 2010), but evaluation for pain is essential to rule out chronic or maladaptive pain responses. Clinical diagnosis of back pain Horses with TL spine issues tend to present to the veterinarianfor evaluation of poor performance rather than for palpably painful backs (Jeffcott 1980a, 1999, 2010; Jeffcott et Denoix 1999). Performance problems due to TL conditionshave been evaluated in many sport horses including Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds (Thomson et al. 2014), Warmbloods (Gorgas et al. 2007) and endurance horses (Fraipont et al. 2011). There is a large variation in the severity of the responses between individuals, regardless of the degree of underlying pathology (Cauvin 1997). The technique of manual palpation, widely used and described in the literature (Allen et al. 2010; Cauvin 1997) has been correlated to pressure algometry in horses with sacroiliacdysfunction (Varcoe-Cocks et al. 2006), but algometry has not been adopted by the general practitioner as a way toevaluate equine TL pain. Thoracolumbar pain in the horse may arise as a primary condition, or may be secondary to another problem in the appendicular skeleton such as lameness (Jeffcott 2010). Changes in patterns of movement because of distal limb osteoarthritis can cause tightening and pain in the epaxial muscles. Also, many normal horses show quite dramatic reactions to manual palpation of the muscles of the back such as skin twitching or muscle fasciculation through todipping of the spine (Jeffcott 2010)). The concept of clinicallysigni cant back pain in the horse is also complicated by the fact that some horses with palpable back pain continue toperform at a high level. A third category of back problems must also be considered: that of the 'apparent 'painful back. These horses display what appears to be back pain, but this isa behavioural response related to their temperament or from a lack of tness or ability (Jeffcott 2010). Finally, there are some horses that roach or dip their backs when being girthedor when rst mounted. These horses are often referred to as 'cold-backed 'horses. This syndrome affects many young horses, particularly Thoroughbreds and Arabians and is characterised by transient muscle spasm and back stiffness during saddling or mounting. There has been little research into this condition, but clinically it does not seem to be related to TL pathology (Jeffcott 2010). Patient history and signalment As in any case presented to the veterinarian, a thorough history is required. Lameness is not a de nitive nding in horses with TL spine pathology (Landman et al. 2004; Haussler and Jeffcott 2014) and any horse with lameness as a primary presenting problem should be examined for joint and limb pathology. It is also important that any evaluation of the horse with a back problem should include a thorough examination of limbs and feet. The history will need to consider general information as well as more targeted questions ( Table 1 ). The horse 's use and athletic performance are important. For example, avaulting horse has a different training and working life than a TABLE 1: Questions to ask when assessing the history of a horse with TL pain General informationAge BreedGenderManagement -diet, housing, herd mates Owner informationPrepurchase examination informationLength of time with current ownerRider 's experience and level of ability Personality towards pain as per owner (stoic vs. sensitive) Career of horseType of performance or use Level of training Frequency and duration of exercise per week and per session Frequency and level of competitionType and t of saddle Current problemCharacter and onset of clinical signsDuration of clinical signsAny particular exercises or ridden work horse is having trouble with Any known traumaPrevious occurrence of conditionAny other physical problems or abnormalitiesAny current or previous lamenessProblems grooming or tacking upProblems rolling or lying downReluctance to lift one or more legs or problems with the farrier Treatment Any veterinary examinations or treatment undertaken and response Any alternative care treatment and responseAny rest periods undertaken \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd479 8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201racehorse and an understanding of the demands put on the animal need to be considered. Back pain can cause signi cant issues for a showjumper, who may show a reduction in jumping ability (Jeffcott 2010). It is also importantthat the owners 'concerns and their expectations for the horse are considered. In some cases, the horse may bepresented because it cannot reach the goals set by the owner, rather than because its performance has dropped. It is essential to determine that the horse has already been performing at the expected level, its performance has decreased and that the owner 's expectations are reasonable. Clinical examination at rest The clinical examination of the horse must form the basis for any diagnosis of TL pain or pathology. Since muscle spasm can occur after riding, the horse should be presented prior to any exercise that day, in a calm and quiet manner. It isimportant that the veterinarian examines the whole horse in a comprehensive way, starting from the hoof and working up, or from the head and working back towards the tail. Secondary back pain is common, as horses will use compensatory muscles to shift weight off one limb or another when adjusting their gait for lameness. If a problem is found in the horse 's limbs or joints, further evaluation of the horse 's back should be delayed by two or more weeks to allowcompensatory pain to abate. During the initial general clinical examination, the practitioner can focus on those areas that are not speci ct o horses with TL pain, but can complicate the clinicalpresentation. It is important to check the head and mouth to rule out dental problems and assess the flexibility of the neck. Any neurological signs should be noted and can be furtherevaluated during the assessment at work. An evaluation of hoof balance and shoe wear can also aid in evaluating the horse 's condition, with uneven shoe wear indicating the possibility of asymmetric patterns of movement. There are several published methods of examining a horse for back problems (Munroe 2009; Allen and Jeffcott 2014). Initially, the veterinarian should conduct a visual examination of the horse. The conformation, symmetry and body condition of the horse should be considered. Muscle symmetry from one side to another and on an overall basis is evaluated. Standing on an elevated platform behind the horse is one way of evaluating muscle symmetry. Manual palpation of the back is then performed. With the horse standing squarely, the veterinarian begins by evaluating the limits of flexion and extension of the back. This assessment can be performed by running the ngers down the back close to the DSPs, starting at the withers and moving through to the coccygeal area. This should cause the horse to move away from the pressure allowing evaluation offlexion and extension of the spine (Jeffcott 2010). Lateral flexion can be produced by stimulating the longissimus dorsi at about T16 -17 on either side to initiate muscular contraction and lateral movement of the TL spine. Palpation continues with an evaluation of the supraspinous ligament along the length of the back. Swellingand tenderness in the ligament may indicate desmitis. The tops of the DSPs and interspinal spaces are assessed for deformation and to determine the possibility of overriding DSPs, also known as kissing spines. Pressure is then applied tothe tops of the DSPs and, while not diagnostic, can be indicative of a problem deeper in the back (Munroe 2009). The muscles of the back should be examined for injury such as bruising or rhabdomyolysis. Usually these types of injuries will appear as acutely painful areas and the horse will show some signs of general distress (Keen 2011). Mild bruising can be dif cult to detect. Palpation of the TL muscles can also reveal areas of tension, tenderness and spasm (Hausslerand Jeffcott 2014). Palpation of the back muscles may inadvertently result in palpation of fascial tissues that should also be considered as a source of pain themselves. Fascial tissues are now considered to serve nociceptive and load bearing functions (Schleip et al. 2010). Fascial and myofascial pain syndromes are recognised in man and present as a complex diagnosticchallenge (Milekic et al. 2013). In horses, myofascial trigger points have been recognised as having a role in painevaluation; however, studies have shown they remain an unreliable indicator (Goff 2016). Clinical examination while exercising Examination of the horse in walk and trot in hand on a straight line, then all three gaits on the lunge in both directions will aid in ruling out lameness. Observing the horse under saddle or in harness should also be part of a work-up for TL problems and stiffness or reluctance to bend either direction can be reported by the rider. Horses with back pathology will exhibit stiffness in the TL spine, often have a shortened gait in the hindlimbs and be reluctant to turn in a tight circle. They may also resist backing up. Under saddle, they may roach their backs, show reluctance to move forward and show a lack of impulsion from their hindquarters (Jeffcott 1979a). In some cases, the use of a weighted surcingle might be used to evaluate a horse with load on its back if a rider is not available or it is considered too dangerous to put a rider on the horse (Allen et al. 2010). Examination of saddle, tack and rider The rst saddle is thought to have been invented in 365 AD by the Sarmations. Since then, man has created a whole variety of interesting things to put on horses 'backs to make them easier to ride or control. Harnesses for pulling ploughs, vaulting rollers and Western or English saddles have all come under scrutiny for their effect on the horse 's back, but it is the English style saddle that has received the most attention inthe literature. The main question is whether the pressures transmitted through the saddle from the rider cause pain to the horse 's back (Dyson and Greve 2015). An ill- tting saddle will result in localised pressure points under the saddle. Inthese areas, perfusion of capillaries can be disturbed resulting in decreased blood supply to the muscle. This leads to tissue hypoxia and a reduction or absence of sweat production, which can be recognised by the appearance of dry areas or saddle sores under the saddle (Von Peinen et al. 2010). In one study, 43% of 205 horses examined had ill- tting saddles (Greve and Dyson 2015a). The saddle should be assessed for contact under the panels. Jeffcott et al. (1999) found that the pressure under a saddle should be centred in the middle of the panels,tapering off both front and back and with no pressure through the gullet onto the horse 's spine. An even pressure along the whole of the saddle should occur and the gullet of \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201 480the saddle should not be too wide or too narrow for the horse (Meschan et al. 2007). A narrow saddle will sit too close to the spine on both sides and impinge upon the horse 's movements, while a saddle that is too wide will often come into contact with the dorsal spinous processes, potentially causing pain. Having saddles tted and regularly re tted professionally is important, as the horse 's shape changes often throughout its life (Greve and Dyson 2015a,b). There is also the rider to consider. A rider with stiffness in one side of the body can create uneven pressure loading on one side of the saddle, potentially exacerbating TL pain in the horse (Belock et al. 2013; Greve and Dyson 2015a). Instrumentation is now available to aid riders in becomingaware of their weight distribution on the horse (McGreevy et al . 2004) and physiotherapy for equestrians has become a popular practice. Saddle slip, uneven flocking and shims or pads under the saddle all contribute to the possibility of epaxial muscle pain and asymmetry, especially in the region of the wither (Von Peinen et al. 2010). Once the clinical examination at rest and exercise has been completed, the veterinarian must decide if further diagnostic testing is required. Radiology, nuclear scintigraphy, ultrasonography and thermography are all available to evaluate the horse with back pain. Infusion of local anaesthesia has been evaluated, as has algometry to assess their usefulness as diagnostic aids to evaluate back pain in the horse. Inltration of local anaesthesia as an aid to diagnosis It is tempting to use in ltration of local anaesthesia into the painful muscles of the horse 's back as a diagnostic aid. However, Holm et al. (2006) found that local in ltration of an anaesthetic solution in and around T16 to L2 results in a change in the function of the back in asymptomatic horses. Horses without perceived back pain showed increases in dorsoventral flexibility as well as lateral bending following infusion of mepivicaine along the spine. In fact, the localanaesthesia is thought to be blocking the stabilising effect of themulti dus muscles, allowing laxity in the TL joints (Stubbs et al. 2011). Research on horses 'backs has shown that in ltration of local anaesthesia into the sites of impingement can relievepain in cases of overriding DSPs (Jeffcott and Hickman 1975; Cauvin 1997). It can also aid in identifying which DSPs areaffected. Walmsley et al. (2002) describe the technique as part of the clinical work-up prior to surgery for resection of theDSPs. Radiography is also important in these cases. Radiographic assessment Radiography of the equine back used to be quite achallenge, often requiring general anaesthesia with all its accompanying dif culties. However, since 1979, imaging techniques have improved, as has our ability to understandthe pathology depicted on radiographs. Today, wireless plates and digital images have made radiography of the equine TL spine important in the diagnosis of pathology. While sedation of the horse for radiology is common, general anaesthesia is usually only required when taking ventrodorsal views of the TL spine of equine back require equipment with an output of >150 kV and mA of 250 -500 (Henson 2009). This generally means that most portable radiographic generators are not powerful enough for use on the back. This limits TL radiography to referral centres. The only part of the back that can be radiographed with a portable machine are the DSPs to allow examination for overriding. Adequate knowledge of the anatomy of the horse 's back is essential to correctly evaluate spinal radiographs (Henson 2009). It must also be recognised that the immature horse will have different radiographic ndings from a mature horse due to open growth plates and ossi cation centres (Haussler and Jeffcott 2014). One of the important conditions that can be seen radiographically is overriding of the DSPs, particularly from T10 -L3. This will be seen as a reduction of the interspinous spaces, local periostitis, sclerosis and areas ofradiolucency in the DSPs. A grading system for overriding of the DSPs was developed by Jeffcott (1979c) ( Table 2 ). There is, however, poor correlation between the grade of overridingDSPs and clinical signs (Jeffcott 1980b). The position of the head and neck also in fluences the apparent distance between the thoracic DSPs, confounding the issue (Berneret al. 2012). Radiographs can be taken of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs of T11 to L3 in the standing horse. In the thoracic area (T6 -T18), the lungs provide excellent contrast to the spine. The vertebrae can be evaluated for spondylosis, acondition that may contribute to equine back pain (Meehanet al. 2009). To visualise the articular facets of the vertebral bodies, several oblique views can be taken (Girodroux et al. 2009). Articular facet changes can often be visualised on radiographs. The usual radiographic signs are loss of joint space, bony proliferation around the joints and sclerosis of the joint margins (Henson 2009), although the clinical signi cance of these lesions can vary. When combined with a positive pain reaction, these lesions can be recognised as asource of discomfort for the horse and should be further evaluated with nuclear scintigraphy. Nuclear scintigraphic assessment Ueltschi rst described orthopaedic nuclear scintigraphy, or 'bone scanning ', in 1977 as a new diagnostic tool for equine lameness evaluation. Since then, it has become anestablished part of the clinical work-up for back and pelvic issues in the horse. Unfortunately, due to expense, the use ofnuclear scintigraphy is currently limited to large equine practices. As with any imaging modality, it is essential that TABLE 2: System for grading radiographic evidence of overriding dorsal spinous processes (Jeffcott Radiographic evidence 0 No impingement of the spinous processes 1 Impingement of the summits only 2 Impingement with signs of mild overriding, i.e. crowding 3 Overriding of spinous processes associated with periosteal reaction at sites of impingement 4 Severe overriding with periosteal reaction, pseudoarthrosis and misshapen dorsal summits EVJ Ltd481 8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201the images from a bone scan be evaluated in light of the physical examination of the horse. When evaluating scintigraphic scans for pathology, it is important to understand what is within 'normal 'limits. Nelson (2009) has produced an extensive table describing thescintigraphic appearance of the back and pelvis of normal horses. When pathology exists and more radiopharmaceutical is detected at a particular place on the horse, it is identi ed as increased uptake of radiopharmaceuticals, or IRU. Theappearance of IRU on the scintigraphy images usually indicates a site of increased bone activity. These sites are then evaluated based on the horse 's age, anatomical location and other diagnostic parameters, such as the physical examinationand radiography. A young horse, with open growth plates, will have uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in areas of bone growth and these must be recognised as normal artefact. Areas of thicker soft tissue, such as the pelvis, will result in lighter images than those of the lumbar spine (Dyson 2014). A limited amount of work has been done on evaluating bone scans of the TL spine. Studies of DSPs of the TL spine have shown that up to 73% of clinically normal horses showed mild radiographic or scintigraphic changes on examination (Erichsen et al. 2003, 2004). It has also been found that there might be mild IRU present in the summits of the DSPs innonpainful horses (Zimmerman et al. 2014). For this reason, it is important to acknowledge that mild scintigraphic changesmay be present in both painful and asymptomatic horses and the clinical examination must form the basis of anyevaluation of TL pain in horses. When the scintigraphic image and radiographic lesions of the painful back agree with the clinical examination, there can be a reasonably reliable indication of signi cant bony pathology (Gillen et al. 2009). Ultrasonographic assessment It is the ability to ultrasound the anatomical structures of theequine TL spine that is likely to put the diagnosis of back pathology into the hands of the general practitioner. While there is an advantage to having a large powerful machine with multiple transducers, most TL ultrasonography can be performed with a portable ultrasound machine and linear, curvilinear or sector scanners using frequencies between 2.5 and 7.5 MHZ (Lamas and Head 2009). The DSPs of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae can easily be examined with ultrasonography. Variations occur on the dorsal surface of the thoracic DSPs, with T3 -6 showing roughening while T7 -18 are smooth (Lamas and Head 2009). It is also possible to identify the spaces between the DSPs ofthe vertebra as an aid in diagnosing overriding dorsal spinous processes and associated remodelling on the bone (Fonseca et al. 2006). In some cases, even fractures can be identi ed with ultrasonography. Through the work undertaken by Denoix, it has become possible to ultrasound the articular facets of the TL vertebrae.The technique used for this type of imaging has been described (Denoix 1999; Lamas and Head 2009). When performing ultrasonography of the articular facets, it is useful to place the images of the left and right sides of each vertebra together. This allows a comparison of both joints from each vertebra, making bony changes easier to detect. Ultrasonography is the main way to evaluate the supra- and intraspinous ligaments (SSL and ISL). Ultrasonography of the SSL must be done in both the longitudinal and transverseplane. The ISL lies between the DSPs of the vertebrae andcan also be examined by ultrasound (Fonseca et al. 2006; Lamas and Head 2009). In a painful TL spine, damage to thesupraspinous ligament (SSL) is a possibility and ultrasound has been used to identify lesions in the SSL of the TL spine. It must be noted, however, that abnormalities of the SSL detected by ultrasound also occur in normal, nonpainful horses (Henson et al. 2007). In human medicine, ultrasonography is used to measure the cross sectional area (CSA) of the multi dus muscle on both sides of the spine. Asymmetric atrophy of this musclehas been identi ed as a reliable marker of associated spinal pathology. Stubbs et al. (2010) studied 22 Thoroughbred racehorses presented for euthanasia for reasons other than back pain. They identi ed an asymmetrical reduction in the CSA of the multi dus muscle occurring in the area of, or adjacent to, the site of bony pathology of the spine. Thermographic assessment Thermography has been used to examine the horse 's back in association with other techniques (Fonseca et al. 2006). Several types of thermographic cameras exist and it is important to obtain a camera within the spectral range of 8 - 14lm, which is the range for medical evaluations in man (Turner 2009). The camera measures the heat generated by the body and released through the skin. The heat from blood vessels affects skin temperature, so any evaluation of thermographic images must be undertaken with knowledge of blood flow patterns in the area under investigation. Like other imagingmodalities, thermography is affected by motion, artefact and extraneous radiation. Infrared thermography has been reported to represent the regulation of vasomotor tone by the sympathetic nervous system (Von Schweinitz 1999). Areas of acute in flammation appear as 'hot spots 'on examination while areas of chronic pain and pathology appear as 'cold spots '. While many veterinarians have tried thermography on their cases, it remains an infrequently used tool. As with anyof the other modalities, results from thermography must be considered in light of the clinical examination. Algometry as a potential aid to pain assessment The algometer is a small, hand-held tool initially introduced into equine back evaluations by Haussler (Haussler and Erb 2006a). It is an instrument used by human therapists to assess the level of pressure a patient can tolerate in a particular area, which is termed the mechanical nociceptive threshold (MNT) or pressure pain threshold (PPT) of that area. The algometer has been tested in several research studies in man as a method of objectively measuring musculoskeletal pain (Persson et al. 2004; Potter et al. 2006). The algometer has also been used in studies on the equine back and sacroiliac areas (Varcoe-Cocks et al. 2006; De Heus et al. 2010). The repeatability of the algometric measurements in horses has been tested with positive results (Haussler and Erb 2006a,b) and median MNTs were established ( Table 3 ). Palpation of the back by a clinician has been identi ed as one of the most important tests to determine if a horse is suffering from TL pain (Fonseca et al. 2006). As previously mentioned, however, manual palpationby a veterinarian or other therapist is highly subjective. A \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201 482pressure algometer records an objective measurement of a horse 's reaction to pain. It helps localise the pain and may be useful in evaluating response to therapy. This allowsclinicians to objectively evaluate the horse and compare results to those taken initially. The potential value of the algometer has not yet been fully realised and further research is needed to con rm its efcacy as a clinical tool for the evaluation of back pain in horses. Discussion A horse with osteoarthritis of the hock or suspensory ligamentdesmitis will almost always have accompanying radiographicor ultrasonographic changes. We can easily relate the pain, which manifests as lameness, to the diagnostic image and understand the pathological process. This is not straightforward when considering the horse 's back. While imaging of the TL spine has improved considerably over thepast thirty years and the diagnosis of changes to vertebral articular facets, DSPs and vertebral bodies are now being recognised, their relationship to pain and loss of performance is still relatively unknown. It is also recognised that multiple diagnoses are possible in the same horse, especially in chronic cases, making diagnosis and prognosis even more difcult (Jeffcott 1980b). Alternately, in some cases, signi cant osseous changes to the TL spine have been found onclinically normal horses that continue to compete successfully in their sport (Jeffcott 1979c; Stubbs et al. 2010). What does the general practitioner do when faced with a horse that has back pain? Compassionate owners nd it difcult to continue riding a horse with sensitivity in the back and well meaning friends will question their compassion and the lack of a diagnosis. Our own perception of back pain and its chronic and crippling effects induce a large amount of empathy in owners, trainers and bystanders and veterinarians need to be concerned too. Interpreting the implications of back pain in horses must be a paramount objective and would bene t from further study, including clinically based research. Case studies wouldalso help with furthering the understanding of equine TL pain. There are a variety of treatment protocols and rehabilitation programmes being developed for horses with back pathology and their effects also need further evaluation. It is necessary to determine which horses require treatment and which treatments to use. Currently, our knowledge of TL pain in horses is not evidence-based, is open to bias and furtherresearch is required. In practice, the veterinarian presented with a horse displaying pain in the back should always conduct a careful clinical examination in combination with a thorough history.This examination will provide evidence as to whether a primary, secondary or apparent back problem exists. Flexibility, conformation and symmetry of the muscles, ligaments and DSPs of the back can be evaluated. Following this logical sequence of examination at rest and at work, saddle evaluation and manual palpation, the veterinarian will be able to determine if further diagnostic evaluation should be pursued. It is also important for the veterinarian to be able to give the owner a guide to prognosis, even if a de nitive diagnosis has not been established.

Dunnett Equine Studies Group, WALTHAM Centre for Pet Nutrition, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire; andIndependent Equine Nutrition, fermenting, primarily grazing herbivore the horse has evolved with a specialised gastrointestinal tract capable of utilising a wide range of plant species, which are hydrolysed and/or fermented to yield energy and nutrients for bodily processes. Domestication has resulted in the horse often being fed and managed to suit human requirements rather than their own, which can lead to digestive, behavioural and clinical issues. Appropriate nutrition not only reduces the risk of a nutritional component being a limiting factor to performance, but it also supports the maintenance of health and appropriate behaviour. A basic understanding of the digestive processes therefore can be very valuable when deciding how to feed horses optimally for both health and activity. This article provides a general overview of the gastrointestinal tract from a nutritional perspective and points out a few key practical areas where knowledge of feeding practices can be helpful for veterinarians. Introduction Providing appropriate and adequate nutrition is afundamental component of managing horses and ponies. For the veterinarian, knowledge of the key principles of equine nutrition is essential especially when dealing with clinical cases. This is particularly important where nutrition has been shown to have an impact on either the disease process or recovery. However, it is also important where veterinarians are involved with the management of horses at their different life stages and in particular when they are being used for competitive purposes. The veterinarian is also often called upon to provide advice on the feeding and management of horses in their care and in particular the use of speci c 'supplementary complementary 'feeds colloquially referred to as supplements. As discussed in Geor and Harris (2013), appropriate nutrition and feeding management is both a science and an art. The science takes in feeding behaviour, the physiology of nutrient digestion and utilisation as well as the nutrient requirements of animals at various physiological stages and the composition, digestibility and safety of feedstuffs available for use in horse rations. The art recognises that there is considerable variability between horses and therefore there is not one single way to feed horses appropriately; feeding management needs to be tailored to the individual animal as well as the circumstances in which it is kept. This article is one in a series of articles dealing with nutrition in clinical practice. It is not intended to provide a comprehensive review of equine nutrition, nor to discuss feedrequirements, as these areas are well covered by books such as the National Research Council's Nutrient Requirements for Horses (Anon 2007; Geor and Harris 2013), but it will try to give rstly an overview of the gastrointestinal tract from a nutritional perspective and then secondly provide pointers onthe key aspects that need to be considered in practice under eld conditions. It will concentrate on the performance horse/pony although many of the principles will apply to allhealthy animals as well as those with clinical issues. Basic principles of gastrointestinal physiology as it influences nutritional practices Mouth The mobile equine lips enable selective grazing and, in some horses, the ability to sift out small particles in feed such as vitamin and mineral pellets. Horses only produce saliva (which is >99% water) when they chew and it containsvirtually no digestive enzymes (e.g. amylase 0.44 u/mL compared with 98 u/mL in pigs: Varloud 2006). Adult horses can secrete up to 35 -40 L/day of saliva which has a pH of 8.6-9.1 and its role is primarily as a lubricant and a gastric buffer. The dry matter (DM) content of any swallowed bolus depends on the physical composition of the feed and in particular the time taken for adequate mastication (Meyer et al. 1985, 1986). As rate of intake depends in part on the density and ease of comminution of the feed (Bonin et al. 2007; Cuddeford 2013) horses take longer to chew roughage and therefore the DM of the swallowed bolus is much lower (~11-15% DM) than when, for example, a pelleted complementary feed is fed ( ~35% DM). The chewing cycle is complex (Bonin et al. 2007) and helps not only to reduce particle size, thereby supporting optimal digestion, but also torelease soluble nutrient components that can then be digested precaecally (Merritt and Julliand 2013). Stomach The stomach of an adult 500 kg horse has a capacity of 8 - 15 L (Nickel et al. 1979) and naturally, in a trickle feeder foraging for the majority of the day, would never becompletely empty, with feed being retained for 85 -300 min postprandially. Horses, however, secrete hydrochloric acid ata variable rate even when the stomach is empty (Merrittet al. 2003) which increases the risk of gastric ulceration in this species especially if not regularly provided with forage(Luthersson et al. 2009). The size and composition of a meal is thought to in fluence the amount of saliva produced, as well as the amount of gastric acid secreted plus the nature and strati cation of the feed material within the stomach, thereby affecting the pH gradient within the stomach (Merritt and \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd486 10.1111/eve.12657Julliand 2013). Meal size and composition also in fluence the rate of gastric emptying: in general, although more work is needed in this area, liquids empty more rapidly than solids, larger meals have a greater rate of emptying than smaller meals and the higher the starch and oil content the longer the T1/2 value regardless of meal size (Geor et al. 2001; Wyse et al. 2001; Sutton et al. 2003; Metayer et al. 2004). There is a large diverse bacterial community present in the stomach even of fasted animals (Al Jassim et al. 2005; Varloud 2006, Varloud et al. 2007), although their main in fluence appears to be on starch digestion due to the high proportion of amylolytic bacteria; lactic acid then acetate being the main end products (Varloud et al. 2007; Merritt and Julliand 2013). The variation in dry matter, pH gradient, etc. obviouslyinfluences the intensity and effectiveness of intragastric fermentation. Pepsin and lipase are secreted by thestomach, but there is no information as to their speci c role in equine digestion, although they are potentially important toprotein and fatty acid digestion (Merritt and Julliand 2013). It is also possible that fructan can either be hydrolysed to some extent by gastric acid (Van Soest 1994; Ince et al. 2014) or fermented in the stomach. Whilst treatments are available to reduce gastric acid output and promote the healing of squamous and glandulargastric disease, in particular the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (Sykes et al. 2015), the use of such agents may not be without risk as there are potential adverse effects ofgastric acid suppression, for example, on barrier functionagainst bacterial colonisation (Javsicas and Sanchez 2009), as well as calcium balance and fracture risk. A recent study (Caston et al. 2015), however, showed no signi cant effect in horses of 60 days of once a day compounded omeprazoleadministration on total/ionised serum calcium, bone density or bone mineral content (measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography). Longer term effects as well as effects of potentially more prolonged/pronounced gastric acid suppression have not been evaluated. Although signi cantly lower gastric acid output and increased gastric juice prostaglandin E 2concentrations were reported when ponies were given 45 mL corn oil per osonce a day (Cargile et al. 2004); corn oil, re ned rice bran oil and crude rice bran oil (240 mL, once daily, mixed in grain)failed to improve squamous ulcer scores under experimental squamous ulcer inducing conditions in adult mares (Frank et al. 2005). Small intestine Relative to its body size the horse has a rather short smallintestine and the rate of passage of ingesta is therefore relatively quick and is in fluenced by the amount of food entering. The positioning of the bile and primary pancreaticduct means that there is an increased chance of re fluxing back into the stomach, especially an empty stomach (Kitchen et al. 2000) although any role of bile acids in gastric ulceration has not been elucidated (Widenhouse et al. 2002). Due to the absence of a gall bladder, bile is continually produced and bile salt excretion, important for fat digestion, depends on an intact enterohepatic circulation. Pancreatic secretion, ( ~pH 8 due to high bicarbonate content) is also apparently continuous (up to 25 L/day in an average sizedhorse [Kitchen et al. 2000; ]). The basic digestive processes are similar to those of other monogastric animals with dietarynonstructural carbohydrates and proteins being hydrolysedby the pancreatic and intestinal brush border enzymes (Kienzle and Radicke 1993; Dyer et al. 2002, 2009; Richards et al. 2004; Merritt and Julliand 2013). The transport mechanisms for glucose and fructose are also believed to be similar to those in other species, although the equid small intestine has a limited capacity to transport glucose compared with an omnivorous mammal such as the pig (Merediz et al. 2004; Woodward et al. 2013). Less is known about protein and fat assimilation (Cehak et al. 2013), although interestingly equine pancreatic tissue contains relatively high concentrations of lipase (Lorenzo-Figueras et al. 2007). The concentrations of amylase and trypsinogen within the pancreatic juice are, however, very low compared with other species (Kienzle et al. 1994). The horse, therefore, has a limited capacity to digest starch in the small intestine (due todigestive enzyme activity, transit time etc.). The exact limit does seem to vary with the individual and although feeding high starch diets may result in increased levels of amylase, the increases are not marked and do take time (Kienzle et al. 1994; Dyer et al. 2009). The amount of starch fed in a meal will, therefore, in fluence precaecal starch digestion leading to recommendations that intakes of not more than 2 g andmore recently 1 g starch/kg bwt/meal are fed (Potter et al. 1992; de Fombelle et al. 2004; Julliand et al. 2006; Harris et al. 2013). In addition, the extent of any nonstructural carbohydrate digestion in the small intestine will also depend on the feedstuff itself, availability to the digestive enzymes(e.g. the extent to which any outer husk or hull has been broken down), the ratio of amylose to amylopectin within the starch granule, nature of the starch granule as well as the effect of any processing, plus type and amount of forage in the diet (Meyer et al. 1993, 1995; Kienzle 1994; Kienzle et al. 1997, 1998; al. 2004; Harris et al. 2005a,b; Julliand et al. 2006). Thermal treatment of certain grains (e.g. corn and barley) in order to swell and gelatinise the starch isnecessary to improve foregut starch digestibility (Granfeldt et al. et al. 2000; Julliand et al. 2006; Vervuert et al. 2007). The duodenal microbiota is largely composed of Lactobacillus ssp. and Streptococcus spp. (Costa et al. 2015). The microbiota of the ileum is signi cantly less diverse than that of any region of the large intestine and compared withother compartments, has a greater relative abundance of Proteobacteria (Dougal et al. 2012), although the precise role of the microbiota in digestion within the small intestine is notclear (Merritt and Julliand 2013) it is likely they play a role. Hindgut The large intestine does not have mucosal enzymes and doesnot have any signi cant active transport mechanisms for hexose sugars. Digestion and absorption of residualcarbohydrates relies instead on microbial action and thenabsorption of the end products of microbial fermentation undertaken by a complex microbiota comprising mainly bacteria but also fungi and to a lesser extent protozoa (Daly and Shirazi-Beechey 2003; Dougal et al. 2014). Unlike the ruminant, this microbial fermentation obviously occurs afterthe 'monogastric-like' section rather than before, which has a great impact on how we should feed a horse. There is intensebrolytic activity in the hindgut producing short chain or volatile fatty acids (VFA), predominantly acetate, thenpropionate and then butyrate et al. 2003). \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd487 8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201Butyrate is key in supporting intestinal cell health whereas acetate and propionate are energy precursors (Geor 2013). The intensity of these processes depends on the amount and temporal in flux of fermentable material arriving from the small intestine (Hintz et al. 1971; Argenzio et al. 1974; Glinsky et al. 1976; Clarke et al. 1988; Merritt and Julliand 2013). Increasing proportions of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC: starch andwater soluble sugars) favour the production of lactate and propionate at the expense of acetate. These volatile fatty acids are absorbed by nonionic passive diffusion and a monocarboxylate/H +symporter in association with NaCl absorption and H 2CO 3secretion; water then passively follows the VFA and Na absorption (Shirazy-Beechey 2008; Nedjadi et al. 2014). The ileocaecal flow of dry matter, its composition and the rate of production and absorption of organic acidshave a marked effect on water balance in the hindgut and consequently plasma volume through the direction of the transmucosal movement of water (Clarke et al. 1988, 1990a, b; Merritt and Julliand 2013). Ingestion of excessive levels of starch may exceed the relatively limited amylolytic capacity of the equine foregutand the undigested starch, together with any resistant starch, will pass into the large intestine where it will be fermented, yielding less net energy than if absorbed as glucose (Geor 2013). Several studies have reported decreased caecal and/ or colonic pH in horses or ponies fed high starch diets (e.g. Willard et al. 1977; Radicke et al. 1991; Medina et al. 2002). Intracaecal lactate was signi cantly higher when rolled barley as opposed to micronised or extruded barley was fedto ponies as 50% of the ration (McLean et al. 2000). Dietary composition will also in fluence the composition of the large intestinal microbiota signi cantly (Medina et al. 2002; Merritt and Julliand 2013; Dougal et al. 2014). The small core micro floral population in the horse is thought to increase the risk of digestive upsets with dietary change (Dougal et al. 2013, 2014). The contribution of hindgut protein to the amino acid pool of the horse is a matter of some controversy (Woodward et al. 2010; Merritt and Julliand 2013) and currently precaecal protein availability is considered to be key. The majority of minerals and trace elements given to horses are absorbed in the SI, as are most of the dietaryvitamins (Coenen 2013; Zeyner and Harris 2013). Phosphorus, however, is absorbed mainly in the hindgut and high phosphorus intakes, especially in the form of plant phytates, may interfere with calcium absorption in the SI. Most of the water soluble B vitamins are synthesised in the large intestine of a healthy horse through the action of resident micro flora (Zeyner and Harris 2013). What does this mean in practice for veterinarians? Translating the science of digestion outlined above together with knowledge of feeds/nutrients and their interactions is key in developing rations that support optimal health and performance. Nutritional advice is available for horse owners from various sources, but in particular from within the commercial feed sector. However, many owners seek the advice of their veterinarian to present an independent viewpoint within a clinical context. In this section of the article, the authors hope to offer some essential practical information to help the veterinarian support their clients withnutrition related issues. Obviously clients are more likely toseek nutrition advice from their veterinarian where a perceived problem exists, which may vary from a simple 'failure to thrive ', through to loss of performance, or may encompass a speci c clinical issue. Regardless, an in context critical evaluation of the existing components of the diet is essential (Dunnett 2013). Whilst all aspects that should be considered cannot be covered in this article, a few key areas will be discussed. Forage Forage/roughages are high bre (structural carbohydrate) feedstuffs and should be the foundation of all horse diets. Formany horses no other energy providing feedstuff will be required, even for some high performance horses (Harris and Geor 2014). However, as they are typically not nutritionally complete, additional vitamins, minerals and trace elements will be required to be fed, plus for most nonlegume forages additional amino acids in order to provide an optimal intake of all nutrients (i.e. some form of a forage balancer see below). Practically it is important to check the actual weight and type of forage offered and consumed daily, as this can often be severely over or underestimated by owners or trainers. How much is enough? Forage intake is important not only for its nutritional contributionto the diet but also its role in gastrointestinal health and species speci c intake behaviour i.e. free-ranging horses perform 10 -15 individual feed bouts/day and forage for 12.5 /C62.5 h/day (Ellis 2010). In the literature, the recommended quantity of forage for a variety of circumstances is commonly described on a dry matter intake basis due to the low bre content of some very immature hays (especially alfalfa) and haylages/silages.Recent guidelines (Dugdale et al. 2010; Harris et al. 2013; Harris and Geor 2014) suggest that to ensure gastrointestinal andbehavioural health, under most circumstances forage (grass and preserved forages) should be provided at a minimum of15 g DM/kg bwt/day (and more ideally at 20 g DM/kg bwt/ day), even for horses with high energy requirements (in which case young, less mature high energy content forages should be considered). The minimal level suggested for animals undergoing restriction for weight loss purposes under veterinary supervision is 10 g DM/kg bwt/day and a suggested target minimum for elite level high intensity exercising athletic horses is 12.5 g DM/kg bwt/day (1.25% bwt/day). To facilitate this, ideally all forage should be sold with a basic analysis (including DM, protein and nonstructural carbohydrate [NSC]). In addition, owners/trainers, especially in large establishments, should be encouraged to routinely analyse any home produced forage so that their diet can be appropriately balanced for their forage ( Table 2 ). However, in practice, the majority of owners do not have a detailed analysis of their forage and thereforesimpli ed guidance can be useful based on an 'as fed 'basis for the average hay or haylage (partially wilted grass preservedutilising airtight conditions, but often without signi cant lactic acid fermentation and therefore little/variable reduction inwater soluble carbohydrate [WSC] content from that of the parent grass) ( Table 1 ). However, it needs to be appreciated that there will be variance due to differences in actual drymatter. An indication of the energy value of forage can be estimated according to its maturity, grass species etc., as well as the bodyweight and condition of the individual animal it is \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd488 8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201being fed to (taking into account the rest of the ration, health of the animal etc.); analysis is, however, required for a reliable value. Where haylage is fed (increasingly, for example, in Europe), it is not uncommon for owners to underfeed haylage (and therefore structural bre) especially when replacing on a weight to weight basis for hay. Underfeeding also typicallyoccurs when there are concerns with potential weight gain or behavioural issues due to its actual higher feed (energetic) value compared with hay. In these circumstances, if increasing the amount of haylage is not practical, even with a reduction in any other energy providing feed, then feeding hay with lower energy provision is advised. Guidance on forage intake is relatively straightforward for horses that are stabled or have limited access to pasture, but once access to grazing is considered the picture is much more complicated and only rough estimates can be made (Harris and Geor 2014). Grass intake of ponies can approach 5% bwt (as DM) when they have 24 h/day access, with up to 1% bwt consumed within 3 h of turnout (Longland et al. 2011a, Longland et al. 2015). Grass intake by horses, however, is generally reported as being lower (although this can vary according to the individual) at ~2-2.5% bwt/day on a DM basis (Cuddeford 2013; Chavez et al. 2014). Intake from pasture can perhaps be ignored in horses if only minimal turnout time is provided (i.e. 1 h/day) given the likely increase in energy expenditure associated with this activity.Otherwise, for normal body conditioned healthy adult horses,as a starting point, the authors would always offer in addition to a horse that has access to grazing, a proportion of the daily forage allowance recommended for a full time stabled horse (as below: adapted to individual circumstances and taking into consideration the herbage yield and quality). It is important that horses are as far as possible offered forage to satisfy appetite so that they do not spend large periods of time without forage. \u008124 h stable - 100% daily forage allowance \u00814-8 h pasture - 50 -75% daily forage allowance \u00818-12 h pasture - 25 -50% daily forage allowance \u008124 h pasture - 0 -25% daily forage allowance An adequate intake of forage can be dif cult to achieve in some horses in hard work, especially when under physiologicalstress. In this situation, offering multiple forms of forage may bebene cial to increase voluntary intake e.g. hay, haylage, alfalfa hay or chaff, dehydrated grass chaff (Goodwin et al. 2007). Whilst the addition of chopped/short bre i.e. chaff (e.g. alfalfa, dried grass and/or straw) can be bene cial to slow down the rate of eating (Ellis et al. 2005; Harris et al. 2005a,b; Cuddeford 2013) and to stimulate saliva production, in C.D.' s experience in fussy feeders the removal of chaff from the complementary feed may improve voluntary food intake. The chaff can still be offered in a separate bucket as part of the forage ration. The sudden introduction of a new batch of forage is a dif cult but necessary factor to manage with an 'in patient 'situation in a veterinary hospital due to a change in forage type or batch being a signi cant risk factor for colic (Hillyer et al. 2002) potentially due to effects on micro flora and the pH as well as DM of hindgut content (Muhonen et al. 2008, 2009). The authors recommend that especially when changingtype or maturity of the forage ideally adaptation should be made over an extended period of at least 7 -10 days. For the more extreme changes at least 2 weeks and possibly morethan 3 weeks adaptation period may be required (Muhonen et al. 2008). In terms of the quantity of forage it is always better to aim for the highest forage intake possible taking intoaccount individual circumstances. Table 1 provides guidance on both the minimum daily level of forage, which shouldalways be offered even to high performance horses, as well as a recommended target level of forage intake. Complementary feeds Complementary feeds (i.e. feeds fed in addition to forage) are available in various forms and the traditional view that they are always high in energy and rich in cereals is no longer valid. Complementary feeds currently deliver energy from a variety of sources ranging from high starch containing cereals and cereal byproducts to highly digestible bre sources e.g. soya husk/hull and sugar beet. Many complementary feeds aresupplemented with vegetable fat/oil from a variety of sources including integral oil/fat from cereals and pulses (e.g. oats, linseed, soya, rice bran) and free oil extracted from oil seeds. There is a wide range in the energy density of such feeds, but typically they range between 8 -14 MJ/kg DE. The vitamin andTABLE 1: Suggested minimum quantity and a recommended daily target intake of forage that should be fed even to animals in hard work 250 kg pony 250 kg pony 500 kg horse 500 kg horse Minimum Target Minimum Target 1.25 kg DM/100 kg bwt (1.25%) 2 bwt (2%) Dry matter intake per day (kg) 3.1 5.0 6.3 10.0 Forage type Typical dry matterIndicated amount on an as fed basis per day (kg) Hay 90 3.5 5.6 6.9 11.1 Haylage (dry) 70 4.5 7.1 8.9 14.3 Haylage (wet) 50 6.3 10.0 12.5 20.0 \u00a92016 EVJ AE / SEPTEMBER 201mineral premix contained within such feeds usually dictates a minimum recommended daily intake of about 0.5 kg/100 kg bwt to provide suf cient micronutrients to meet minimal requirements. This is important as many horse owners remainunaware that further vitamin and mineral supplementation is required if they feed below the manufacturer' s minimum recommended intake. Balancers are complementary feeds, fed to replace conventional complementary feeds, that provide aconcentrated source of protein (providing high quality protein, delivering essential amino acids such as lysine), as well as vitamins and minerals. Typically balancers are not provided as a signi cant source of energy, although they will contribute some calories to the ration depending on theirformulation. They are usually formulated to be fed at a much lower intake, typically 100 g/100 kg bwt. Many horses and ponies especially those in light to moderate work can be fed appropriately through forage (grass fresh or preserved) and a balancer. 'Straight 'feeding stuffs There are a variety of cereal grains, oil seeds, byproducts and vegetable oils often used in home-mixed rations, or to top dress an existing forti ed proprietary feed. These include cereals such as oats, barley and maize, as well as oil seedssuch as soya and linseed, and a variety of vegetable oils including soya or linseed oil. High bre ingredients such as sugar beet pulp and chopped alfalfa/lucerne are also usedin this context. A degree of knowledge is required to ensure the successful use of such straight feeding ingredients to provide a balanced ration. This is because most of these ingredients will only have what would be considered as a background level of trace minerals and the relative amounts of macro minerals such as calcium and phosphorus can be unbalanced. For example, cereals tend to be high in phosphorus and low in calcium, whereas sugar beet and alfalfa/lucerne is high in calcium and low in phosphorus. Whilst straight feeding ingredients potentially offer a certain amount of ration flexibility, their use can be problematic without suf cient knowledge or experience. Supplements As we learn more about the role of optimum nutrition in healthand performance, it has been suggested that traditional rations may not offer all the desired microcomponents, especially where high performance horses are concerned and that feed 'supplements '(classi ed in EU legislation. alongside more traditional feeds as complementary feeds) may be of bene t under some circumstances (Harris and Harris 2005; Harris et al. 2013; Williams 2013). Supplements, as they are used in practice i.e. as feedstuffs that do not form more than 5% of the total ration by weight(and are not items such as carrots, apples, mints etc.) can perhaps usefully be divided according to their core purpose: Fundamental dietary supplements These contain substances with established nutritional requirements and therefore include amino acids, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. These supplements are often used to balance the ration and thereby ensure that speci c dietary goals are attained. In many cases when fed as recommended their use can be supported e.g. appropriatedietary supplementation with vitamins and minerals is essential when the core diet does not provide adequate amounts. This is commonly seen when forage based or forage/cereal based diets are being fed or when the dietary intake is being restricted for speci c clinical reasons (e.g. obesity, laminitis etc.). Many forage balancers would fall under this category. Specialised dietary supplements In a review for the National Academies of Science (USA) (Anon 2009) on supplement safety the committee de ned an animal dietary supplement as 'A substance for oral consumption by horses, dogs, or cats, whether in/on feed or offered separately, intended for speci c bene t to the animal by means other than provision of nutrients regarded asessential, or provision of essential nutrients for intended effect on the animal beyond normal nutritional needs, but not including legally de ned drugs '. This de nition would include the various nutraceuticals and other nutrients that are commonly suggested to have highly supportive effects on health, performance and behaviour. For example, supplements may contain nutrients in amounts far greater than minimal nutritional requirements, but known to provide support at these higher levels (e.g. high doses of Biotin supporting hoof quality in some individuals), or conversely other components for which there is no scienti cally established dietary requirement (e.g. chromium, variousherbs, chondroitin sulphate, glucosamine). The market for such supplements is vast and horse owners are constantly offered products that claim to bene t their horses and are often marketed as offering support to speci c physiological systems such as the digestive system, respiratory system, joints and skeleton or muscles. Often the role of the veterinarian is to offer advice on the suitability, safety, ef cacy and especially for competing animals, legality of such products for horse owners or trainers,which can be a dif cult task. Whilst the gold standard may be for a supplement to be underpinned by species-speci c research to support the speci c supplement formulation, this is realistically rarely available. It is, however, the responsibilityof and a legal requirement (at least in Europe) for the company marketing the product to be able to provide the client or their veterinarian with evidence or justi cation to support any marketing claims. This may take the form ofresearch already in the public domain regarding the main active ingredients, or peer reviewed research on the speci c product formulation, or indeed in some circumstancesunpublished in-house trials. There are many aspects to consider when choosing or recommending a 'supplement ' (Harris et al. 2013), but below are some key areas that the authors believe should be considered when offering advice or recommendation regarding supplements: \u0081Ideally is species-speci c research available to support marketing claims, either on the product formulation, or onwell de ned and stated active ingredients? Or is research available in other species to support the supplement claimor function and can this be reasonably extrapolated to horses (absorption of active ingredients being one of the most likely barriers to transferred ef cacy)? \u0081Are the active ingredients clearly de ned together with the dose provided? \u0081Can the source of the active ingredient and the deliveryper dose be justi ed by quoted supportive research? Where there is the ability to do so the active ingredient \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd490 8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201may be quanti ed by analysis e.g. docosahexanoic acid (DHA), biotin or probiotic cfu/kg. \u0081Is there support that the feeding of the active ingredients at the level recommended to horses is safe? \u0081Are the active ingredients considered allowable by therules of competition or racing etc.? \u0081What are the contamination risks for prohibitedsubstances? See below. Analysis Complementary feeds should provide on their label anindication of the provided level of certain (but usually not all)nutrients but depending on the country and the legislative requirements the values given may represent maximums or minimums, or the actual analytical value may fall within set limits of the declared value. The information on the label, as well as any additional information on the manufacturer 's website for example, can give an indication of the suitabilityof this diet for its intended purpose but additional or con rmatory analysis may be required especially in complex cases. It is also important to note that individual nutrients suchas percentage protein or starch should always be viewed in the context of the amount being recommended to be fed. For example, a 30% protein balancer fed at 500 g/day to a 500 kg horse would deliver half as much protein in grams compared with a feed containing 10% protein fed at 3 kg/ day. The delivery of all nutrients within a feed should always be taken in the context of how much is fed and this is a concept that many horse owners do not grasp fully.Laboratory analysis of feeds may be required to assess thesuitability of the diet either in terms of nutritional content, stability or hygiene (see below). There are a number of analytical parameters that may be more important to consider under different situations ( Table 2 ). Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) content The NSC and WSC [simple sugars and fructan] [Harrisand Geor 2009]) content of complementary feeds can vary considerably, as can the source of starch and degree of processing, which will signi cantly affect precaecal digestibility as discussed above. per meal and <2 g/kg bwt per day have been recommended (Harris et al. 2013) in general as well as total rations providing <10% NSC on a dry matter basis for those animals prone to laminitis (Geor and Harris 2013). Althoughwe do not know de nitively which aspect is more important, the authors suggest that the overall NSC intake/day and number of meals per day, as well as the NSC load per meal should all be considered as potentially clinically relevant. Meal size is therefore another basic issue that should always be addressed due to the effect of meal size on consumption rate and digestive transit time. This in fluences precaecal starch digestion and therefore not only the glucose andinsulin response to the meal but also the pH of the hindgut. Table 3 gives an insight into meal size of various proprietary concentrate feed options required to remain on or below thecurrently recommended levels. Typical proprietary complementary feeds can range from 5 to 35% starch depending largely on the content of cereals TABLE 2: Examples of analysis that may be helpful to undertake for speci c purposes (adapted from Dunnet 2013) Rationale: undertake in order to understand Sample type Core analysisAdditional useful analysis that could potentially be helpful Nutritional contribution of pasture to overall rationor identi cation of issues such as low copper orhigh heavy metal contentPasture Full macro and micro mineral screen.DM, CP, O, CF, NDF, ADF, ash Nutritional contribution of hay to overall ration ortness to feed (respiratory) and or stabilityHay DM, CP, O, CF, ash, total moulds and yeasts at 25 and 37 \u00b0CMycotoxin screen and characterisation of moulds Nutritional contribution of hay to overall ration ortness to feed (respiratory) and or stabilityHaylage DM, CP, O, CF, ash, total moulds and yeasts at 25 and 37 \u00b0CFermentation parameters pH, VFA, lactic acid etc. Calculation of DE and or adherence to declaredanalysisComplementary feed DM, CP, O, CF, ash, copper, Vitamin EFull macro and micro mineral screen plus vitamins A & D Assessment of suitability for individuals with laminitisComplementary feed, hay or haylageStarch and total sugars, NSCFull macro and micro mineral screen plus vitamins A & D Calculation of DE and or assessment of Ca:P ratioof overall rationCereal grains e.g. oats Ca and P, DM, CP, O, CF, ash (or other parameters required for calculation of DE)Mycotoxin screen Stability and indication of oxidation of oilHigh oil feed e.g. vegetable oilPeroxide value Fatty acid pro le or omega 6:omega 3 ratio Assessment of supplement being t for purpose, or adherence to declarationProbiotic supplement Total viable count (CFU/ kg) DM, dry matter; CP, crude EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201and cereal byproducts. Due to the widespread use of cereal byproducts in so-called 'low energy 'feeds these feeds cannot automatically be regarded as being synonymous with'low starch 'or low NSC. Starch/sugar content is not unfortunately a required statutory declaration on packagingglobally and therefore a direct approach to the feed manufacturer may be required to establish the NSC content of the feed if it is not offered on ancillary information such as literature or a website. Ideally, evidence that the feed produces an appropriate insulin response in any target animal group should also be available. Effect of soaking forage on WSC Although soaking, especially at temperatures of around16\u00b0C or higher, may signi cantly reduce the WSC content of a hay (Longland et al. 2014), the extent of the reduction can be variable and nonpredictable (Longland et al. 2011b) and therefore this should only be an adjunct technique to choosing a low NSC hay if required medically. If it is necessary that a low NSC intake is achieved from the forage, the authors advise that the NSC content should be measured post-soaking. It is also important to note that soaking hay results in a small loss of dry matter which may not be important in ad libitum fed animals but can be key under weight loss scenarios (Longland et al. 2011a,b; Martinson et al. 2012; Argo et al. 2015). Soaking also results in loss of some water soluble protein and other nutrientsmeaning that a forage balancer will be required in most cases to balance the diet. Hygienic quality Feed hygiene covers all the measures that are necessary tominimise health risks due to physical, chemical or biological contamination of feeds and feedstuffs (e.g. as described in the EC Regulation on Feed Hygiene No 183/2005) and this also applies to forages. The hygienic (Wichert et al. 2008; Kamphues 2013) and nutritional quality of forage ( Table 2 ), as well as the quantity fed and the suitability of itsnutritional make-up, typically should be the rst area for investigation during any nutritional evaluation and inparticular where there is a generalised failure to perform or thrive and during investigations of digestive disturbances (including recurrent colic, gastric ulcers, or presence of abnormal droppings). This information is also essential where recurrent airway obstruction is suspected or weight loss is desired. In any hygienic investigation, whilst the look, smell and feel are obviously important, a macroscopic evaluation should beroutine to look for obvious moulds and the presence ofcontaminants such as sand/soil, weeds and various poisonous plants (Kamphues 2013). In addition, due to the importance of water in micro-organism growth, a follow-up DM determination can be very helpful. A guide to the types and acceptable levels of bacteria, moulds and yeasts in different types of forages have been previously determined (Kamphues 2013). Hay imported from warm climates can often provide a low mould option, as can well made haylage. Hay from Northern Europe can, however, be more problematic and it can be difcult to achieve a consistently clean supply. An effective reduction in total viable count and reduction in respirableparticles has been reported when hay is steamed appropriately (James and Moore-Colyer 2010), whereas prolonged soaking of hay signi cantly increases the mould and bacterial counts (Moore-Colyer et al. 2014). Recently, there has been more interest in the potential impact of mycotoxins on equine health, from forage orindeed other feedstuffs. Mycotoxins can be a systemic issue, affecting for example immunity, digestive health, reproduction and overall performance (Riet-Correa et al. 2013), although little data is available to give guidance onthe lower critical level of mycotoxin contamination signi cant for health and performance in horses. In addition, the signi cance of a raised mycotoxin result in hay or feed can be dif cult to interpret as the impact will depend on the relative intake of the contaminated material. There are, however, recommended acceptable upper levels of contamination and depending on the country, legal limits for certain mycotoxins (e.g. https://www.food.gov.uk/ business-industry/farmingfood /crops/mycotoxinsguidance/ animalfeed). Identi cation of mycotoxin contamination of forage or feed is also problematic, due to the dif culty in achieving representative samples and can be described as'looking for a needle 'in the proverbial haystack. However, there is now comprehensive mycotoxin screening availablet h a tc a ni d e n t i f yo v e r3 5m y c o t o x i n sw i t h i nas i n g l es c r e e n (Abdel-Wahhab and Kholif 2008). Mycotoxins are very chemically robust and therm ally resistant and so dif cult to eliminate where suspected or identi ed. Steaming of hay may not destroy mycotoxins, although washing of grains has been shown to reduce the contamination (Trenholm et al. 1992). Feed additives or mycotoxin binders may offer someprotection whilst they remain in the digestive tract (Raymond et al. 2003) and these are sometimes included in proprietary feeds or supplements, although thiswill depend on the legislation present in the country where they are being fed. Mycotoxin binders would, however, need to be fed several times a day to retain ef cacy andTABLE 3: Quantity of concentrate feed per meal, which equates to an intake of 1 or 2 g/kg bwt of total starch and water soluble sugar (NSC) for a 500 kg horse Feed (starch and WSC content as fed) Feed exampleAmount that could be fed and not exceed suggested thresholds (excluding chaff) 2 g/kg bwt (approx) 1 g/kg bwt (approx.) 10% Low starch feed 10 kg 5 kg 25% Competition feed 4 kg 2 kg 35% Traditional racing feed 2.9 kg 1.4 kg 40% Barley 2.5 kg 1.25 kg \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd492 8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201different binders have varying af nity for the variety of mycotoxins that exist. Much more work is needed in this area. Prohibited substances There is a risk of prohibited substance contamination fromforage, feed and supplements with respect to the rules of racing (e.g. BHA UK, http://rules.britishhorseracing.com/Home) or competition (http://inside.fei.org/fei/cleansport/horses/). In some instances, this may relate to a prohibited substance being an identi ed component of the product, for example, capsaicin from red peppers, or valerenic acid from valerian. It is important that veterinarians maintain their knowledge and understanding of the global rules of racing and competition (FEI or other body), especially with regards to any published lists of doping or medication substances in order to best advise their clients. In addition to this, there is also a risk from inadvertent contamination with naturally occurring prohibited substances, for which there are historical cases of contamination (see FEI vs. Paget and McNab). These substances are often analysed within a prohibited substance screen, which may form part of a quality system e.g. BETA NOPS (http://www.beta-uk.org/pages/feed-safety/beta-nops- scheme.php) designed to reduce the risk of inadvertent contamination of feed and or supplements. Typical components of a standard prohibited substance screen may include caffeine, theobromine, theophylline, hyoscine, hordenine, atropine and morphine, which have all been shown periodically to contaminate commonly used horse feed ingredients. However, there is also an additional identi able risk of inadvertent contamination with other plant, herbal or spice based ingredients that containnaturally occurring substances deemed as prohibited by the regulators ( Table 4 ). The risk of this latter contamination increases as more ingredients are sourced from countrieswhere recognised quality control procedures are less well established. Whilst it is not possible to eradicate the risk of contaminating prohibited substances, veterinarians can advise their clients to take a number of steps to reduce their risk of using a contaminated product by: \u0081Being fully aware of all ingredients within a product andwhether they comply with the relevant rules. \u0081Being fully aware of the quality control proceduresemployed by the manufacturing company to reduce riskfrom prohibited substances (see also http://www.beta-uk.org/pages/feed-safety/beta-nops-scheme.php). \u0081Encouraging riders, owners or trainers to maintain a feedand supplements log book to establish feeds used, batch numbers etc. and to also retain samples of each batch of product where practical for a relevant period of time e.g. 3 months. Conclusion Equine nutrition is a specialist subject area and it is unrealisticfor all veterinarians to have comprehensive expertise in this eld. However, there are a few key areas where nutritional knowledge is advantageous to clinical assessment as well as the health and welfare of the horses and ponies in their care. There is supporting nutritional advice available to veterinarians from veterinary nutritionists and other paraprofessionals, either inside or outside the commercial feed sector. However, it is worth noting that with the exception of the veterinary ECVCN diplomate quali cation, the term equine nutritionist is not a protected title in Europeand so some background knowledge as to the quali cations and experience of any specialist advisor is warranted asdiscussed in Harris (2016).

Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium is (dichloromethylene) salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form.INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS.WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of acci- dental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associ- ated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal im- pairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be mon- itored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some min- erals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and po- tassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skel- eton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphos- phonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lac- tating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the to- tal dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; how- ever, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the field study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, and hives/pruritus. Distributed by: Dechra Veterinary Products 866-933-2472 \u00a9 Dechra Ltd.

B. R. Balasuriya*, M. Carossino and P. J. Timoney Department of Veterinary Science, Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center, College of Agriculture, Food and Environment, University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA. the causative agent of equine viral arteritis, a respiratory and reproductive disease that affects the members of the family Equidae . The virus was rst isolated from the lung of an aborted fetus after an extensive outbreak of respiratory disease and abortion on a Standardbred breeding farm near Bucyrus, Ohio, in 1953. Since then, periodic outbreaks of equine viral arteritis have been reported in a number of countries around the world. This disease may result in signi cant economic loss to the equine industry due to the occurrence of abortion in pregnant mares,neonatal mortality, and establishment of the carrier state in stallions. This article provides an extensive review on equine arteritis virus, epidemiology, disease, pathogenesis, and prevention and control measures. Introduction Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a well-known reproductive and respiratory disease of horses and other equids caused by equine arteritis virus (EAV) (Doll et al . 1957a; McCollum et al. 1971; Cole et al. 1986; Timoney and McCollum 1987; al. 2013). Although the vast majority of EAV infections are subclinical, outbreaks of the disease do occur and are most importantly associated with abortion, neonatal mortality and establishment of persistent infection in stallions (Doll et al . 1957a,b; Cole et al. 1986; Timoney et al. 1986; et al. 1992; Del Piero et al. 1997; Balasuriya et al. 1999a; Hedges et al. 1999; Timoney and McCollum 2000). Persistently infected stallions play a centralrole in the maintenance, perpetuation, and evolution of thevirus in the horse population. An increase in the incidence of the disease has been observed in the past 20 years, associated inter alia with increased national and international movement of horses and shipment of frozen or chilled semen (McCollum et al. 1998; Balasuriya et al. 1999a; Hedges et al. 1999; Timoney et al. 2010; Broaddus et al. 2011a; Miszczak et al. 2012). This review article provides an update of the advanceson the causative agent (EAV), disease (EVA), pathogenesis, establishment and maintenance of the carrier state, and proper implementation of control and prevention measures to prevent disease outbreaks. Equine arteritis virus Equine arteritis virus is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is considered to be the prototypemember of the family Arteriviridae , genus Arterivirus (order Nidovirales ), a taxonomic grouping that includes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, simianhaemorrhagic fever virus, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus of mice, and the recently identi ed wobbly possum disease virus of free-ranging al. 2012). All arteriviruses share similar morphological and structural properties and replication and assembly strategies (Snijder et al. 2013). The EAV genome is approximately 12.7 kb in length and contains at least 10known open reading frames (ORFs) (Balasuriya et al. 2013; Snijder et al. 2013). The 5 0-end is occupied by ORFs 1a and 1b, which pp1ab). These two replicase polyproteins are further processed into at least 13 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-12, including nsp7 a/b). The remaining eight ORFs (2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, 6 and 7) are located at the 30-end of the genome and encode for the structural proteins of the virus (E, GP2, GP3, GP4, ORF5a protein, GP5, M, and N, respectively). The major envelope proteins (M and GP5) form a disul de-linked heterodimer, while the minor envelope glycoproteins (GP2,GP3 and GP4) form a heterotrimer in the viral envelope (Balasuriya et al. 2013; Snijder et al. 2013). The unglycosylated E and ORF5a proteins are minorcomponents of the viral particle. The reader is encouraged to refer to recent review articles by Balasuriya et al. (2013) and Snijder et al. (2013) for more details on molecular properties of the virus. Epidemiology and transmission As evidenced from serological surveys, EAV has a worldwide distribution primarily in domestic equine populations in North and South America, Europe, Australia, Africa, and various countries in Asia (Timoney and McCollum 1993). Other countries, such as Iceland, Japan, and New Zealand, are free of the disease (McFadden et al. 2013). Following the rst recognition of EVA in 1953, outbreaks of the disease havealso been reported from multiple countries including Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Italy, the UK, Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, Canada, the United States, and Argentina (Burki 1970; McCollum and Bryans et al. 1998; al. 1998; Echeverria 2003; Olguin Perglione et al. 2010). However, EAV seroprevalence varies between countries and between horses of different breeds and ages within the same country. In the USA, a very high percentage of adult Standardbred and Saddlebred horses are seropositive for EAV (70 -90% and 8 -25%, respectively), whereas the seroprevalence in the Thoroughbred populationis very low ( <5.4%) Bryans McCollum 1988, 1993; McCue et al. 1991; McKenzie 1996). The 1998 National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) equine survey showed that only 0.6% of the US American Quarter Horse population was seropositive to EAV (NAHMS 2000), but the extensive multistate EVA occurrence in the USA during 2006 -2007 has probably increased the seroprevalence within this breed (Zhang et al. 2010b). The seroprevalence in Warmblood stallions is also very high in several European countries, with some 55 -93% of Austrian Warmblood Moraillon al. 1992). Similarly, there is a high seroprevalence among mares and stallions of Hucul horses in Poland (53.2 and 68.2%,respectively) (Rola et al. 2011), and a recent study performed in a population of Spanish purebred horses demonstrated aseroprevalence of 17.3% (Cruz et al. 2015). Seroprevalence of EAV increases with age, indicating that horses may berepeatedly exposed to the virus during their lifespan. In addition, several studies have identi ed a correlation between the number of breeding mares and EAV seropositivity (Timoney and McCollum 1993; Cruz et al. 2015). Differences in the breed-speci c seroprevalence of EAV infection may re flect genetic differences that confer resistance to infection. Recent studies have suggested thatthere is a genetic difference between stallions that become long-term carriers and those that clear the virus from the reproductive tract shortly after infection (Go et al. 2012a). This trait was linked to the susceptibility of CD3 +T lymphocytes to in vitro EAV infection and a common dominant haplotype located in equine chromosome 11 (ECA11; position 49572804 -49643932) (Go et al. 2010, 2011a, 2012a). Thus, these studies suggest that those stallions withan in vitro CD3 +T lymphocyte susceptible phenotype are at a higher risk of becoming long-term carriers after EAVinfection than those that have a resistant one (Go et al. 2012a). Transmission of EAV between horses occurs through either respiratory or venereal routes (Doll et al. 1957b; McCollum et al. 1971; Cole et al. 1986; Timoney et al. 1986, 1987a; Timoney and McCollum 1993). Horizontal transmission occursthrough the respiratory route after aerosolisation of viral particles in respiratory secretions originating from acutely infected horses and is facilitated by direct and/or close contact between an infected and a na \u20acve horse ( Fig 1 ). Nasal shedding of EAV frequently lasts 7 -14 days during the acute phase of the infection, with viral titres ranging from 10 to>2910 3plaque-forming units per mL (PFU/mL) (McCollum et al. 1971, 1988; Balasuriya et al. 1999b). EAV can also be spread by aerosolised urine and other body secretions and excretions of acutely infected horses, aborted fetuses, and fetal membranes (McCollum et al. 1971, 1995; McCollum 1981; Burki et al. 1992; Glaser et al. 1996, 1997; Guthrie et al. 2003). It has been demonstrated that EAV is shed in faeces ofexperimentally infected stallions up to 8 days post-infection (Neu et al. 1988), and the virus is also present in the femalereproductive tract for a brief period after infection (McCollum et al. 1988). Furthermore, EAV may be transmitted indirectly by carrier stallions to seronegative, susceptible stallions bymasturbation (Guthrie et al. 2003). The venereal mode of transmission occurs exclusively via semen from acutely or chronically infected stallions (carrier stallions) during natural or arti cial breeding (Timoney et al. 1987a). Following infection, 10 -70% of EAV infected stallions become persistently infected and continuously shed virus in their semen for a variable and frequently extended period of time, ranging from several weeks to years post-infection or even life-long, despite the presence of high levels of neutralising antibodies in serum (Timoney et al. 1986, 1987a; Timoney and McCollum 1993) ( Fig 1 ). Currently, there are no means of estimating when the EAV carrier state is likely to be eliminated by a carrier stallion. Carrier stallions play a major epidemiological role since they constitute the natural reservoir for EAV and, thus, are responsible for the maintenance, perpetuation, and evolution of EAV in equine populations between breeding seasons (Timoney and McCollum 1988, 1993; Balasuriya et al. 1999a, 2001, 2004a; Hedges et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2010a; Miszczak et al. 2012). Several studies have shown that EAV carrier stallions are a source of genetic and phenotypic divergence for the virus, i.e. EAV evolves in the reproductive tract of carrier stallions resulting in the emergence of novel viral variants with neutralisation phenotypes that allow immune escape and which can lead to outbreaks of EVA (Balasuriya et al. 1999a, 2001, 2004a; Hedges et al. 1999). Most of the seronegative mares naturally or arti cially bred to carrier stallions become infected and seroconvert within 28 days (Timoney et al. 1987b; McCollum et al. 1988; Balasuriya et al. 1998). Infected mares may develop clinical signs of EVA; irrespective of clinical status, acutely infected mares can readily transmit the virus by the respiratory route to susceptible cohorts in close proximity and can rapidly initiate an EVA outbreak ( Fig 1 ). It has been demonstrated that EAV can be transmitted from donor mares inseminated with EAV-infective semen to na \u20acve recipient mares via embryo transfer (Broaddus et al. 2011a). Furthermore, congenital infection of foals following transplacental transmission of the virus in mares infected in late gestation can occur, and congenitally infected foals develop a rapidly progressive, fulminatinginterstitial pneumonia and et et al. 1992; Wilkins et al. 1995; Del Piero et al. 1997). Lateral transmission of EAV can also occur through contaminated fomites (e.g.personnel, clothing, vehicles and equipment such as arti cial vaginas and phantoms) (Timoney and McCollum 1988, 1993;Guthrie al. 2003). Equine arteritis virus is highly heat labile and its half-life progressively decreases with increasing temperature. The virus is readily inactivated by lipid solvents (such as ether and chloroform) and by common disinfectants and detergents. EAV remains infectious for 75 days at 4 \u00b0C, for 2-3 days at 37 \u00b0C, and 20 -30 min at 56 \u00b0C (de Vries 1994). EAV-infected tissue samples, tissue culture fluid, semen samples and embryos can be stored frozen ( /C070\u00b0Ct o /C080\u00b0C) for more than 6 decades without any signi cant loss of virus infectivity (U.B.R. Balasuriya and P.J. Timoney,unpublished data). The virus can also remain viable in tissuesamples stored at /C020\u00b0C for more than 5 years (McCollum et al. 1961). \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd498 8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201Clinical signs and thedisease The range and severity ofclinical signs displayed byEAV acutely infected horses depend onavariety offactors, including the genetics, age, physical condition ofthe horses, challenge dose, route ofinfection, viral strain, and environmental conditions (Vaala etal.1992; McCollum and Timoney 1998; Moore known is signi cant variation invirulence phenotype between EAV eld strains, and based on the clinical severity ofthe disease during natural outbreaks, EAV eldstrains could be segregated into viruses that cause Bucyrus strain ofEAV (VBS, which causes high mortality in healthy mature horses) and theassociated pathology isnot representative ofthat caused by eld strains ofthe virusisolated todate; itisbest regarded asalaboratory derived experimental virus variant. While the vast majority ofEAV infections are inapparent (orsubclinical), some acutely infected animals may develop awide range ofclinical signs. After anincubation period of 2-14days (6-8days after venereal exposure), EAV infected horses can develop awide combination ofclinical signs, including respiratory disease and reproductiv econsequences (Fig2). Acute infection Acutely infected animals may develop an influenza -like syndrome, with fever, depression, anorexia, dependent oedema (scrotum, mammary ventral and ocular distress, rash tothesides widespread), and less frequently Horizontal Transmission Venereal TransmissionNatural Reservoir of EAV No carrier state in mares, geldings Weak foals Congenital infectionsCarrier Stallion Stallions Colts Establishment of persistent infection Outbreak Pregnant and non-pregnant mares, geldings, <6 month-old foalsMare-Semen collection -Artificial breeding contact with virus placental fluids, secretions & tissues -Fomites -PersonnelHorizontal TransmissionRaw Collins The that can cause reproductive loss inpregnant mares. Abortions may occur either late intheacute phase orearly in the convalescent phase ofinfection, and frequently take place anytime between 2and >10months ofgestation with anattack rate ranging 1987; and McCollum 1993). though the abortigenic potential strains ofEAV has notbeen adequately compared, potential asthey dointhe severity ofthe clinical response toinfection. Additionally, venereal or respiratory infection ofsusceptible mares does notappear to result inshort- orlong-term infertility. Equine arteritis virus infected stallions can undergo a period ofsubfertility during the acute phase ofthe disease ranging from 6to11weeks after infection and associat edwith decreased libido, sperm motility, etal. Campos 2000). Carrier stallions continuously shed virus intheir semen foravariable and frequently extended period oftime that can range from several weeks post-infection (convalescent orshort-term carrier) tomonths, years orlife-long (long-term carrier), with apparently no alterations inthe semen quality despite viral shedding (Timoney and McCollum 2000). shedding insemen etal.1987a). (Little Campos etal.2014). Ithas been demonstrated that thecarrier state isandrogen-dependent, and that iswhy persistent infection has demonstrated geldings pathogenesis ofEVA has been studied inboth natural outbreaks and experimentally infected horses with different viral strains (Jones 1969; McCollum etal. 1971, 1998; McCollum fetal and neonatal infections, EAV infection ofhorses is a) c) e) f) 201seldom fatal (O 'Connor et al. 1993; Pronost et al. 2010). The numerous publications describing clinical signs and lesions caused by the experimentally derived highly virulent horse-adapted VBS of EAV re flect a severe fatal infection that is not representative of the disease caused by eld strains of the virus in circulation over the past decades. Following respiratory infection, initial viral replication occurs in alveolar macrophages and bronchiolar epithelial cells within 24 h post-infection (hpi) (Crawford and Henson 1973). During the initial 48 hpi, EAV rapidly localises in the regional lymph nodes, especially those associated with the respiratory tract (bronchial lymph nodes), and viral shedding in nasal secretions is initiated and typically lasts for 7 -14 days, although it can extend to up to 21 days post-infection (dpi)(McCollum et al. 1971, 1988). Within 72 hpi, a cell-associated viraemia develops, which frequently extends for 3 -19 dpi, and the virus is distributed throughout the body, replicating in macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells and causing a systemic panvasculitis (Bryans et al. 1957b; Prickett et al. 1973; Lopez 1996; MacLachlan et al. 1996; Del Piero 2000a; Balasuriya et al. 2013). Hence, the clinical manifestations of EVA re flect endothelial cell injury and increased vascular permeability. The characteristic histologic feature of EVA is a severe necrotising panvasculitis of small vessels. Affected muscular arteries show foci of intimal, subintimal and medial et Lopez al. 1996; MacLachlan et al. 1996; Del Piero 2000a). Recent ex vivo (i.e. mucosal explants) and in vitro studies to elucidate the early events in the pathogenesis of EAVinfection demonstrated that virus localises in CD3 +T CD172a+myeloid cells, and a small of IgM+B lymphocytes found in the connective tissue (Vairo et al. 2013a). Interestingly, the virus was not detected in epithelial cells from the upper respiratory tract during the early phase of infection (Vairo et al. 2013a,b). These studies have shown that the nasopharynx and tubal -nasopharyngeal tonsils play an important role as primary sites of EAV replication during early infection, and high viral titres were detected during the rst 7 dpi (Vairo et al. 2012). In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated increasedtranscription of genes encoding a) following EAV infection, suggesting that these cytokines are critical in determining the severity of the disease (Moore et al. 2003b). Recently, it has been demonstrated thatexperimental inoculation of horses with in vitro CD3 +T lymphocyte or resistant flammatory and vitroCD3 +T lymphocytes resistant phenotype tend to develop more severe clinical signs compared to the horses with CD3+ T lymphocyte susceptible phenotype (Go et al. 2012b). Equine arteritis virus infection of pregnant mares can result in abortion, and aborted fetuses are usually partially autolysed at the time of expulsion. Even though not fully understood, it is speculated that abortion occurs as a consequence of vasculitis of myometrial blood vessels, that leads to placental dysfunction and chorionic detachment (Del Piero 2000a). Aborted fetuses exhibit the serosal andmucosal surfaces of the small intestine (Del Piero 2000a). Even though microscopic lesions in tissues from aborted fetuses are only occasionally detected (Johnson et al. 1991), viral antigen can be detected in cells within glomeruli, rare tubular epithelial cells, and enterocytes by immunohistochemical staining (Lopez et al. 1996; Del Piero et al. 1997; Del Piero 2000a; Carossino et al. 2016a). With the exception of infected stallions, viral clearance usually occurs by 28 dpi and is coincident with theappearance and rise in serum neutralising antibodies (McCollum 1969a; Fukunaga et al. 1981). However, a recent study has reported that infectious virus could still berecovered from tonsils of experimentally infected animals by 28 dpi (Vairo et al. 2012). EAV exclusively persists in the reproductive tract of carrier stallions (mainly the ampullae ofthe vas 1988; Carossino al. 2016b). mechanism of persistence and cellular tropism of EAV inthe long-term carrier stallion remain to be elucidated. Immune response Natural and experimental EAV infections induce a robust and protective immune response. Even though the innate immune response has not been comprehensively characterised, recent studies have demonstrated that EAV inhibits type I interferon (IFN) production and, thus, subverts the innate immune response (Go et al. 2014). It has been shown that 3 nonstructural proteins (nsp1, 2 and 11) have thecapacity to block IFN synthesis, with nsp1 exerting the strongest effect. Following infection, both EAV-speci c complement- xing (CF) and neutralising antibodies (VN) develop (McCollum 1969b; Fukunaga and McCollum 1977) and provide long- lasting immunity and protection from reinfection with most (if not all) viral strains. Both CF and VN antibodies develop between 7 and 14 dpi, and peak either after 2 -3 weeks or 2-4 months post-infection, respectively (Fukunaga antibodies steadilydecline by 8 months post-infection, while neutralising antibodies persist for 3 years or more (Gerber et al. 1978b). Both structural proteins (GP5, M and and nonstructuralproteins (nsp2, nsp4, et al. 1998; Go et al. 2011b). GP5 contains 4 major neutralisation sites (A -D), and GP5-M heterodimerisation is essential for induction of antibody responses and protection (Balasuriya et al. 1995, 1997, 2002a). Despite the presence of high neutralising antibodies, EAV persists in the reproductive tract of carrier stallions (Balasuriyaet al . 2013, 2014). Therefore, viral evolutionary mechanisms take place during persistent infection in the reproductivetract, leading to the emergence of genetic variants with distinct neutralisation phenotypes due to amino acid substitutions in major viral neutralisation sites and, thus, conferring the ability of the virus to successfully escape humoral immunity (escape mutants) (Balasuriya et al. 1999a, 2001, 2004a; Hedges et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2010a; Miszczak et al. 2012). Foals born to immune mares are protected against clinical EVA by passive transfer of VN antibodies in \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd501 8 AE 201the colostrum. VN antibodies appear in the serum of newborn foals a few hours after colostrum intake, levels peak at age of 1 week, and titres decline to extinction at the age of 2-6 or, rarely, 7 months. The mean half-life of EAV maternal antibodies in serum from foals is 32 days (McCollum 1976;Hullinger et al. 1998). Even though Castillo-Olivares et al. (2003a) that EAV induces speci c cytotoxic CD8 +T lymphocytes and that their precursors may last for at least 1 year followingexperimental infection, there are no further comprehensive studies that describe the cell-mediated immune response (CMI) to EAV. Diagnosis Con rmatory diagnosis of EVA cannot be achieved solely based on clinical presentation, since clinical signs frequentlyresemble other infectious and noninfectious diseases of equids. Differential diagnosis should include other infectious agents such as equine herpesviruses-1 and -4, equine influenza virus, Leptospira interrogans, and several transboundary diseases to the Americas including Getah virus, African horse sickness virus and Hendra virus. In regards to noninfectious diseases, ) should be taken into consideration. Hence, it is imperative to con rm a provisional clinical diagnosis by laboratory means before implementing appropriate preventive and control measures (Balasuriya et al. 2013, 2014). Laboratory diagnosis of EVA is based on classical virus isolation (VI); detection of viral nucleic acid by standardreverse transcription -polymerase serological assays that demonstrate a speci c antibody response elicited by EAV as an indirect method to identify EAV infection (Hyllseth 1969; Senne et al. 1985; St-Laurent et al. 1994; Lopez et al. 1996; Del Piero et al. 1997; Gilbert et al. 1997; 1998; Ramina 2008; 2011; Hans et al. 2015; Carossino et al. 2016a,b). Clinical samples for laboratory diagnosis should be ideally collected from suspected cases in the acute phase of infection to con rm the aetiology of the disease. All clinical samples should be stored and submitted under conditions ofrefrigeration via overnight delivery for laboratory testing. Freezing whole blood samples is discouraged as it could potentially hamper viral recovery. Tissue samples from foals and aborted fetuses could also be submitted in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation. However, in such cases it is important to use an appropriate tissue: xative volume ratio (at least 1:10) to ensure proper xation. Suitable clinical samples to attempt VI or detection of viral nucleic acid include nasopharyngeal swabs or nasalwashings, conjunctival swabs, and whole blood (in EDTA or citrate). The use of heparin as anticoagulant is not suitable for laboratory diagnosis of viral infections; thus, its use is discouraged. During outbreaks of abortion, tissue samplesfrom aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and amniotic orallantoic fluid should be submitted for laboratory testing. Most frequently, a pool of samples including primarily fetalplacental membranes (allantochorion and/or amnion), lung, thymus, spleen, liver, and other lymphoid tissues (if available) is recommended to perform VI and detection of viral nucleic acid. In cases of neonatal foals that die as a consequence of developing interstitial pneumonia or the pneumoenteric syndrome, appropriate tissue samples should be submitted for VI and/or detection of viral nucleic acid. These samples should include lung, spleen, and other lymphoid tissues such as thymus, mesenteric and bronchial lymph nodes, and kidney. Serological diagnosis of EVA is considered an indirect method for identi cation of infected animals, and it is based on the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)-prescribedvirus neutralisation test (VNT). Thus, EAV infection can be demonstrated by a rise in neutralising antibody titres (4-fold or greater) in paired sera collected 21 -28 days apart as indicated previously. A competitive enzyme linkedimmunosorbent assay was recently developed and validated for the detection of EAV speci c antibodies, and could be considered as an alternative assay for the serologicaldiagnosis of EVA (Chung et al. 2013a,b, 2015; Pfahl et al. 2016). The approach for the diagnosis of EAV carrier stallions is currently dependent on the demonstration of neutralisingantibodies in serum and detection of virus in their semen(Timoney et al. 1987b; USDA-APHIS 2004; OIE 2013, 2015). Initial identi cation of carrier stallions is achieved by the detection of neutralising antibodies in their serum (seropositive, titres 1:4), and persistent infection is con rmed either by isolation of the virus from semen, test-breeding usingtwo seronegative mares (where seroconversion within 28 days after test-breeding indicates that the tested semen is infective) or detection of viral nucleic acid in semen. Semen samples submitted for virological assessment should contain the sperm-rich fraction of the ejaculate (Timoney et al. 1986, 1987a). Pre-ejaculatory fluids are inappropriate since presence of virus in this fluid is inconsistent. Currently, the VI and VNT are the OIE prescribed tests for international trade(OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals; OIE 2013). Even though VI is the gold-standard for the detection of EAV in semen and the OIE-prescribed test for international trade, the performance of certain RT-qPCR and a RT-iiPCR described in the literature have an equal or higher sensitivity when compared to VI in semen samples (Balasuriya et al. 2002b; Lu et al. 2008; Miszczak et al. 2011; Carossino et al. 2016b). In addition, the newly developed RT- iiPCR assay has been demonstrated to have a high sensitivity and accuracy when compared to VI in tissue samples derived from aborted fetuses (Carossino et al. 2016b). Therefore, molecular assays could be used as an alternativemethod for EAV diagnosis (St-Laurent et al. 1994; 2007; Lu et al. 2008; Miszczak et al. 2011; Hans et al. 2015; Carossino et al. 2016a,b). Treatment Even though antiviral compounds have been evaluated (van den Born et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2010b), there is still no \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd502 8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201known effective antiviral therapy for the treatment of EAV infected horses. However, most naturally infected animals recover without any complications. Severely affected horses can be treated symptomatically with nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs/antipyretics, diuretics, and supportive care to control the fever and oedema, with rest from trainingand breeding. There is no effective treatment of neonatal foals with interstitial pneumonia or the pneumoenteric syndrome other than antibiotic treatment to prevent secondary bacterial infections (Balasuriya 2014). Although several therapeutic approaches to clear the carrier state or eliminate semen infectivity have been explored (gonadotropin releasing hormone [GnRH] antagonists, anti-GnRH vaccination, antiviral compounds, and centrifugation) (Dowsett et al. Fortier et et al. 2005; Turkstra et al. 2005; Burger et al. 2006; Janett et al. 2009; Wenzinger et al. 2010; Morrell et al. 2013), none of them can guarantee clearance of persistent infection in stallions or complete elimination of semen infectivity. A pilot study by Burger et al. (2006) demonstrated vaccination of EAV carrier stallions twice 4 weeks apart with either Improvac 1or Equity1 stopped the shedding of EAV in semen 4 -6 months after the rst immunisation and from all subsequent semen collections. However, all vaccinated stallions had decreased libido, scrotal size, total sperm number, percentage of normal sperm, and motility. Other than these side effects, this study demonstrated that vaccination against GnRH mightrepresent a means of successfully treating EAV-shedding breeding stallions. However, further studies are needed to con rm these ndings. Because of the side effects of GnRH vaccination, there are no nonsurgical means currentlyavailable that are without potential adverse side effects for eliminating the carrier state other than surgical castration; this results in loss of the commercial value of the stallion as a breeding animal. Vaccination programme Routine vaccination of horses against EAV There is an attenuated modi ed live virus (MLV) vaccine (ARVAC/C226)1licensed for use in the USA and Canada. This vaccine is administered intramuscularly and has been widely used in the USA for the control and prevention of EAV infection since 1985. The MLV vaccine has been demonstrated to be safe and ef cacious, inducing protective immunity in vaccinated horses (McCollum 1969a,b, 1986; Harry and McCollum 1981). This vaccine elicits neutralising antibodies within 5 -8 days post-vaccination, with a peak in antibody titres observed between 7 and 14 dayspost-vaccination (Doll et al. 1968; McCollum 1969a,b, 1986; Harry and McCollum 1981; McCollum et al. 1988; Summers- Lawyer et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012). Neutralising antibodies may last for at least 2 years, and revaccination frequently boosts the serologic response, providing protective immunity for an extended period of time. It has been determined that neutralising antibody titres of at least 1:64 are necessary to ensure protection (Fukunaga et al. 1990). Annual revaccinations with the MLV vaccine are recommended asestablished in EVA control and prevention guidelines (USDA- APHIS 2004; OIE 2015). A small proportion of vaccinated horses may develop febrile reactions with transient lymphopenia, and the attenuated virus can be sporadicallyisolated from nasal secretions and buffy coat cells up to7 days post-vaccination but rarely up to 32 days post- vaccination (Harry and McCollum 1981; McCollum 1981; McKinnon et al. 1986; McCollum et al. 1988; Timoney et al. 1988, 2007; Summers-Lawyer et al. 2011). It has been shown that primary vaccination with the MLV vaccine provides efcient protection against clinical disease but does not consistently prevent reinfection of vaccinated horses (Zhanget al. 2012). Thus, EAV infection in vaccinated horses can still induce limited viraemia and viral shedding in nasal secretions(McCollum 1986; McCollum et al. 1988). Vaccination of pregnant mares with the MLV vaccine is not recommended, particularly during the last 2 months of gestation due to the high risk of abortion (Broaddus et al. 2011b). Similarly, it is not recommended to vaccinate foalsaged <6 weeks or dams with foals aged <6 weeks. Foals should be vaccinated at age 6 months or later whenmaternal antibodies decline, hence avoiding neutralisation of the vaccine virus by passively transferred antibodies. However, younger foals can be vaccinated in high-risk situations. Vaccination of foals prior to the onset of puberty is strongly recommended, as it provides protective immunity and, resistance to the development of the carrier state in colts. Even though early studies have claimed that there is a single serotype of the virus broadly neutralised by polyclonal antisera against the VBS of EAV, more recent in vitro studies demonstrated that neutralising antibodies induced post-MLVvaccination do not neutralise all EAV strains with the same efcacy (Balasuriya et al. 1997, 2004b, 2013, 2014; Zhang et al. 2010a; Balasuriya 2014). Nevertheless, the MLV vaccine has so far been proven effective in preventing outbreaks of EVA and establishment of carrier state in stallions. The MLV vaccine is not currently licensed in European countries or Japan. Instead, an inactivated EAV vaccine (Artervac /C226)1is licensed for use in several European countries including the UK, Ireland, France, Hungary and Denmark. Dueto its reduced immunogenicity compared to the MLV vaccine, a booster immunisation is required after 3 -4 weeks of primary vaccination with semiannual revaccinations.Although this vaccine induces neutralising antibodies, its efcacy in preventing EVA and establishment of persistent infection in stallions is substantially less characterised thanthat of the MLV vaccine. Vaccination of breeding stallions In the USA, it is recommended that seronegative stallions bevaccinated with the MLV vaccine (ARVAC /C226) at least 28 days before the breeding season, followed by an isolation periodof 28 days after rst-time vaccination during which the animal is not bred (naturally or by means of arti cial insemination) or in direct contact with other horses due to the potential risk of transient shedding of vaccine virus in the semen or in nasalsecretions (USDA-APHIS 2004). Even though vaccinated stallions usually do not shed vaccine virus in either semen or urine, very low levels of virus ( <1 PFU/mL) were reported in the semen of one stallion at 4 and 6 days post-vaccination inone experimental study (Summers-Lawyer et al. 2011). Annual revaccination before the start of the breeding season isimportant and highly recommended. In addition, as current serological tests cannot distinguish vaccinated from naturally infected animals, an EVA vaccination certi cate con rming vaccine willdevelop the carrier with this attenuated viral (Timoney Summers-Lawyer should bebred toseropositive mares resulting from either natural infection orvaccination against EVA (McCollum etal.1988).

Control and prevention strategies Current EVA control and prevention strategies are aimed at preventing EAV spread insusceptible equine populations, are based on appropriate quarantine and laboratory testing procedures. The management practices used to mitigate the riskofspread ofEAV include the identi cation ofcarrier stallions, arrivals, the segregation ofpregnant mares and foals from other horses, implementation ofbiosecurity enforcement ofvaccination programmes (NAHMS 2000; USDA-APHIS 2004; OIE 2015). Even though there isnoestablished domestic EVA control programme inthe USA, the minimum standards forcontrol, detection, and prevention ofEVA, aswell asminimum EVA requirements forthe interstate and intrastate movement of horses aredescribed inEquine Viral Arteritis: Uniform Methods Breeding a Mare to an EAV Shedding Stallion Test for neutralising antibodies to EAV at least 30 days prior to 1:4)* Seronegative Mares (Titer <1:4) Vaccinate* Vaccinate*Record vaccination Isolate the mare for 21 days and should not be bred during thisperiodVaccinate with the MLV vaccine f Can be bred to a shedding stallion (natural breeding) or inseminated with EAV-infective semen (artificial breeding)without being vaccinated Following breeding mares should be kept in isolation for 24 hrs to avoid possible indirect transmission of the virus Booster vaccination Annual booster vaccination againstEAV 21 days prior to breeding No isolation necessary following booster vaccination Subsequent breeding - no need to isolate the mare after breeding to a carrier stallion * Neutralising antibody titer of 1:64 is regarded as protective against EVA. *Modified live virus vaccine (ARVAC\u00ae)f Current MLV vaccine is not recommended for vaccinating pregnant mares (see text). Foals should be healthy and at least 6 weeks of age before its dam is vaccinated. After 21 days, breed to the shedding stallion (natural breeding) or inseminatewith EAV-infective semen (artificialbreeding) After being bred for the first time to a shedding stallion - isolate the mare for21 days Fig4:Guidelines and recommendations fortheuse ofEAV carrier stallions forbreeding purposes. These EVA control and prevention recommendations are based onUSDA and AAEP guidelines used intheUS.Other countries could follow these recommendations but need toadhere totheguidlines practice EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201and Rules from the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS 2004). In some European countries including the UK, Ireland, Germany, France and Italy, the Codes of Practice and guidelines on articial insemination are distributed as voluntary recommendations to aid in the control and prevention ofseveral equine diseases, including EVA (HBLB 2016). Furthermore, the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, and the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (OIE 2013, 2015) establish the international standards for EVA laboratory testing and movement of horses. The interested reader should refer to these documents along with the American Association for Equine Practitioners guidelines for more detailed information (www.aaep.org). In terms of the identi cation of EAV infected stallions, the vaccination history, serological status, and virological assessment of their semen is recommended prior to breeding or to the introduction of these animals into new premises to prevent EVA outbreaks both nationally and internationally. All stallions should be tested for the presence of neutralising antibodies in serum at least 60 days before initiation of the breeding season. If the stallion is determined to be seropositive (neutralising antibody titre 1:4) and has no certi ed history of vaccination against EVA or con rmation of seronegative status prior to the initial vaccination, virological assessment of their semen is required to determine their infection status and potential carrier state ( Fig 3 ). The OIE prescribed test for detection of EAV in semen samples (VI) should be performed on two semen samples from two independent collections that can be performed on the same day, consecutive days, or after an interval of several days or weeks, and should contain the sperm-rich fraction of the ejaculate. The turnaround time for this test is typically more than a week. Alternatively, the test breeding procedure constitutes another method for the identi cation of EAV carrier stallions. This method consists in test breeding twoseronegative mares twice, each on two consecutive days, for a total of four covers. The mares are kept in quarantine and tested for the presence of neutralising antibodies at 28 days after breeding. If the test is performed properly and strict quarantine is maintained, seroconversion in one or both mares bred to the stallion is evidence of EAV infection and, thus, indicates that the stallion is persistently infected (carrier stallion). Similarly, fresh, chilled, or frozen semen can also be tested by this methodology. Con rmed carrier stallions can still be used for breeding purposes provided that strict requirements are met (Timoney et al. 1987a,c; Timoney and McCollum 1993; Timoney 2000a, b). However, it should be considered that regulatory policiesfrom other countries might not allow the introduction of carrier stallions or their use for either natural or arti cial breeding purposes. Carrier stallions should be kept physically isolated from other horses and only bred to seropositive mares resultingfrom either natural infection or vaccination against EVA as indicated previously (McCollum et al. 1988). If semen is to be collected from carrier stallions, this should be performedseparately from other stallions in order to prevent contamination of collection equipment and other materials (fomites) that could be a potential source of lateraltransmission. In regards to embryo transfer, both donor and recipient mares should be vaccinated against EVA at least3 weeks prior to breeding and embryo transfer (Broaddus et al. 2011a). Furthermore, it is highly recommended to vaccinate horses that frequently travel to competitions or comingle with other horses coming from outside on a regular basis. The OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code establishes the general provisions and recommendations for the international movement of horses (stallions, mares, foals and geldings) and importation of equine semen, and readers are encouraged to refer to this code for more detailed information. In regards to the movement of horses other than stallions, it is required to maintain a quarantine period of 28 days during which no clinical signs of EVA should be observed and stable or declining antibody titres, or a seronegative status demonstrated between two serum samples collected at least 14 days apart before their introduction onto new premises. In the case of stallions, these should be kept under quarantine as indicated for other horses and their serological status determined. If seropositive, subjected to detection of EAV in semen samples as described previously and recommended in the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. In the event of an outbreak, the state veterinarian needs to be noti ed immediately, and the facilities placed under strict quarantine. Clinically affected and in-contact horsesneed to be isolated, and all animal movements suspended (http://www.aaep.org/info/guidelines). Furthermore, at-risk horses should be vaccinated and breeding activitiesinterrupted to prevent further spread. It is important to realise that during an outbreak of EVA, the respiratory mode of transmission facilitates the spread of EAV and attack rates can escalate fairly quickly (Olguin Perglione et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2010a). If facilities are not placed under quarantine, the infection can easily spread to other premises as well. Thus, immediate quarantine and segregation of affected horses should be pursued before laboratory con rmation in order to limit the risk of wider occurrence of EVA, associated abortions, and persistent infection in stallions.Diagnosis of EVA should always be con rmed by laboratory testing, and farm managers and veterinarians should submitappropriate samples immediately. Stalls and other equipment on affected premises should be decontaminated. Any disinfectant including phenolic, chlorine, iodine, and quaternary ammonium compounds is usually adequate to inactivate EAV. The quarantine will be lifted depending upon current regulatory policies that vary among countries; however, it is frequently discontinued when no additional EVA cases or serologic evidence of infection are observed for 3 -4 consecutive weeks after the last con rmed case. Signi cance to the equine industry Equine viral arteritis outbreaks have occurred around theworld, and there is suf cient evidence that clearly shows an increase in the global incidence of the disease in the pastyears (McCollum et al. 1998; Balasuriya et al. 1999a; al. 1999; Timoney Olguin Perglione et al. 2010; Miszczak et al. 2012). These outbreaks have had signi cant economic consequences in terms of direct nancial losses to the equine industry, as they can be associated with theoccurrence of widespread abortions in pregnant mares, fulminant disease in young foals, establishment of the carrier \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd506 8 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 201state in stallions, cancellation of equestrian events, and banning of horse movement (Balasuriya et al. 2013; Balasuriya 2014). The occurrence and spread of EVA hasbeen facilitated by the increasing volume of horse movement around the world for competition or breeding purposes, and by the trade of fresh or frozen semen and embryos (Balasuriya et al. 1998; Timoney 2000a,b; Broaddus et al. 2011a; Miszczak et al. 2012). The development of the carrier state in stallions directly results in reduction in the commercial value of these animals, higher costs required for breeding, and barriers in the national and international movement of persistently infected stallions and commercialisation of their semen and embryos. Control and preventive measures aimed at mitigating the repercussions of EVA are focused on prophylactic vaccination and the control of stallions used for natural or articial breeding by serological testing and subsequent virological assessment of their semen before initiation of eachbreeding season as well as during pre-export and import quarantines (USDA-APHIS 2004; OIE 2013, 2015). The implementation of strict EVA surveillance programmes capable of identifying carrier stallions could potentially lead to EAV eradication. However, considering the large value of international trade of horses, semen, and embryos between countries, the enactment of EVA eradication programmes will require joint international efforts towards the implementation of a universal code of practice. Concluding remarks, current challenges, and future directions Equine viral arteritis continues to be an important infectious disease of horses; its occurrence can be associated with signi cant economic loss to the equine industry due to abortions, neonatal mortality and establishment of the carrierstate. Even though outbreaks of the disease have not been reported in the USA since 2006 -2007, EVA is endemic in most European countries and is of concern for the internationalmovement of horses. There is suf cient evidence that the increase in the incidence of EVA in past years is associatedwith the movement of horses for breeding purposes and the commercialisation of semen. EVA prevention and control strategies are primarily focused on the identi cation of carrier stallions and, thus, signi cant efforts are being undertaken in this regard. Current OIE-approved diagnostic assays, including the VI and the VNT for detection of EAV and its antibodies, requiretrained and highly experienced personnel, extended turnaround times, high costs, and can present dif culties in standardisation between laboratories. In addition, handlingand processing of a large number of samples can be technically challenging. More contemporary assays of equal sensitivity should be accepted as alternative tests to current prescribed tests. Among these, RT-qPCR and a novel RT- iiPCR assay have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive and accurate for the detection of EAV in semen, other clinical samples, and tissues from abortions. Furthermore, modern serological assays that offer ease of standardisation among laboratories should be implemented for detection of EAV antibodies, such as competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or microsphere immunoassays (Luminex).Equine viral arteritis control prevention measures are primarily based on the identi cation of carrier stallions and the vaccination of seronegative horses, including stallions.Commercially available vaccines (ARVAC /C226and Artervac/C226) have been shown to be protective and can preventestablishment of the carrier state, although ARVAC /C226is better characterised than the inactivated product. It is not possible,however, to differentiate vaccinated from infected horses with current serological assays and available vaccines. Thus, development of second generation vaccines that would allow identi cation of infected and vaccinated animals could be highly bene cial for the equine industry, facilitating preimportation testing. Even though the mechanism and host factors that are determinant in the establishment and maintenance of EAV carrier state in stallions are not fully understood, current ongoing studies are focused on better understanding of the pathogenesis of the carrier state and further identifying host factors (e.g. genetics) associated with persistent infection. The results of this research could lead to the development of genetic or other tests to identify stallions that are more prone to establish EAV long-term infection and novel therapeutics to induce clearance of the carrier state other than surgical castration. In conclusion, EVA remains an important disease of equids and a major impediment to the international movement of horses. EVA can be a signi cant cause of abortion and, thus, horse owners, farm managers, and veterinarians should consider it in a differential diagnosis with other abortigenic agents such as equine herpesviruses. Future research focused on improvement of diagnostic assays, vaccines, and additional understanding of the EAV carrier state is of priority.
