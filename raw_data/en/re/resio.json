But is this assumption true? This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29085558) analysed liver tests before and following treatment with herbal Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in order to evaluate the risk of liver injury. Patients with normal values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as a diagnostic marker for ruling out pre-existing liver disease were enrolled in a prospective study of a safety program carried out at the First German Hospital of TCM from 1994 to 2015. All patients received herbal products, and their ALT values were reassessed 1-3 d prior to discharge. To evaluate causality for suspected TCM herbs, the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) was used. The report presents data of 21470 patients. ALT ranged from 1 \u00d7 to < 5 \u00d7 upper limit normal (ULN) in 844 patients (3.93%) and suggested mild or moderate liver adaptive abnormalities. A total of 26 patients (0.12%) experienced higher ALT values of 5 \u00d7 ULN 172.9 U/L, mean \u00b1 SD). Causality TCM herbs was estimated to be probable in 8/26 patients, possible in 16/26, and excluded in 2/26 cases. Compared with the large TCM study cohort, patients in the liver injury study cohort were older and contained a higher percentage of women, whereas the duration of the hospital stay was similar in both cohorts. The TCM herbs were rarely applied mostly as mixtures consisting of several herbs adding up to 35 different drugs during the patients' four-week stay. The daily dosage was 95 \u00b1 30 g and thus slightly higher than in the TCM study cohort. Among the many herbal TCM used by the 26 patients in the liver injury cohort, Bupleuri radix and Scuterllariae radix were the two TCM herbs most frequently implicated in liver injury, with variable RUCAM-based causality gradings. Most of the patients received one to six TCM drugs that were associated with potential liver injury as evidenced from the scientific literature, e.g., one patient (case 8) received six potentially hepatotoxic herbal TCM drugs during their hospital stay. The authors concluded that in 26 (0.12%) of 21470 patients treated with herbal TCM, liver injury with ALT values of 5 \u00d7 ULN was found, which normalized shortly following treatment cessation, also substantiating causality. In the discussion section of the paper, the authors comment that the use of TCM is widely considered less risky as compared with synthetic drugs, although data on direct comparisons are not available in support of this view. Populations using herbal TCM, drugs, either alone, or combined experience more drug-induced liver injury (DILI) than herb-induced liver injury (HILI), possibly due to a higher use of drugs. Valid data of incidence and prevalence of HILI caused by TCM herbs are lacking, and respective data cannot be derived from the present study. This study is most valuable, in my view. Its strength is clearly the huge sample size. Top marks for the authors for publishing it! Having said that, we need to take the incidence figures with a pinch of salt, I think. In reality they could be much higher because: - other settings will not be as tightly supervised as the unusual hospital setting; - in most other situations the quality of the Chinese herbs might be less controlled; - there could be [adulteration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12190885); - there could be [contamination](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11879681). The 'elephant in the room' obviously is the inevitable question about benefit. Like any other treatment, TCM cannot be judged on the basis of its risk but must be evaluated according to its risk/benefit balance. I realise that this was not the subject of the present study, but it is nevertheless crucial: do the benefits of TCM outweigh its risks? I am not aware that this is the case (but more than willing to consider any sound evidence readers might supply). More importantly, I am not aware of good evidence to show that, for any condition, TCM would be superior in terms of risk/benefit balance than conventional options. This is not a trivial issue: clinicians have the ethical obligation to apply the best (the one with the most positive risk/benefit balance) treatment to their patients. If I am right, then TCM should not be used in therapeutic routine in or outside hospitals. If I am right, the 'First German Hospital of TCM' should close asap; it would be violating fundamental ethical principles. If I am right, the debate about the risks of TCM is almost irrelevant because we simply should not use it. Or did I misunderstand something here? What "}
