I support Dr Sexton for the job. Here's my endorsement. I'll say why [below](#why). I support Dr Sexton as a candidate to lead the Green Party (England and Wales). [She said] \"The Green Party is a political party, not a lifestyle movement\". That's perceptive. For too long the Green party in the UK has been regarded as marginal, even as tree-huggers. That's the case despite their success in local government and in other European countries which have fairer voting systems. She continued \"We need to be serious about inclusion, serious about evidence, and serious about winning elections.\" They are all good aims. As somebody with [three degrees in mathematics], she's better qualified to evaluate evidence than just about any of our members of parliament, for most of whom science is a closed book. Her breadth of experience is unrivalled. As well as mathematics, she has excelled in music and has been a champion athlete. Winning is her speciality. I believe that she has what it takes to win in politics too. Here is her first campaign video. Why am I endorsing Dr Sexton? Like many people I know, I've been politically homeless for a while. I could obviously never vote Conservative, especially now that they've succumbed to a far-right coup. In the past, I've voted Labour mostly but I couldn't vote for Jeremy Corbyn. I've voted Lib Dem in some recent elections, but it's hard to forgive what they did during the coalition. So what about the Green Party? I voted for them in the European elections because they have a fair voting system. I would have voted for them more often if it were not for our appallingly unfair first-past-the-post system. So why now? Firstly, the Greens are growing. They are well represented in the European parliament, and increasingly in local government. Secondly the urgency of doing something about climate change gets ever more obvious. The Greens are also growing up. They are no longer as keen on alternative pseudo- medicine as they once were. Their anti-scientific wing is in retreat. And Dr Sexton, as a person who is interested in evidence, is just the sort of leader that they need to cement that advance. That's why I decided to join the Green Party to vote for her to be its leader. If you want to know more about her, check [her Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosi_Sexton).
