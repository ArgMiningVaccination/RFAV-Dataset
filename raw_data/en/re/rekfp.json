Part 90). In preparing this document, ATSDR's Cooperative Agreement Partner has collected relevant health data, environmental data, and community health concerns from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state and local health and environmenta l agencies, the community, and potentially responsible parties, where appropriate. In addition, this document has previously been provided to EP A and the affected states in an initial release, as required by CERCLA section 104 (i)(6)(H) for their information and review. The revised document was released for a 30-day public comment period. Subsequent to the public comment period, ATSDR's Cooperative Agreement Partner addressed all public comments and revised or appended the document as appropriate. The public health assessment has now been reissued. This concludes the public health assessment process for this site, unless additional information is obtained by ATSDR's Cooperative Agreement Partner which, in the agency's opinion, indicates a need to revise or append the conclusions previously issued.

Our work is conducted under a Cooperative Agreement with the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. In order for the Envir onmental Epidemiology Program to answer an environmental public health question, several actions are performed: Evaluate Exposure: Tennessee health assessors begin by reviewing available information about environmental conditions at a site. We interpret e nvironmental data, review site reports, and talk with environmental officials. Usually, we do not collect our own environmental sampling data. We rely on information provided by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, U.S. Environmental Protecti on Agency, and other government agencies, businesses, or the public. We work to understand how much contamination may be present, where it is located on a site, and how people might be exposed to it. We look for evidence that people may have been exposed to, are being expose d to, or in the future could be exposed to harmful substances. Evaluate Health Effects: If people could be exposed to contamination, then health assessors take steps to determine if it could be harmful to hu man health. We base our health conclusions on exposure pathways, risk assessment, toxicology, cleanup actions, and the sc ientific literature. Make Recommendations: Based on our conclusions, we wi ll recommend that any potential health hazard posed by a site be reduced or e liminated. Reducing or eliminating the health hazard will prevent possible harmful health e ffects. The role of the Environmental Epidemiology Program in dealing with hazardous wa ste sites is to be an advisor. Often, our recommendations will be action items for other agen cies. However, if there is an urgent public health hazard, the Tennessee Depart ment of Health can issue a pub lic health advisory warning people of the danger, and will work with other agencies to resolve the problem.

Aerodynamic diameter Aerodynamic diameter is the diameter of a unit density (1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g/cm3) sphere that has the same gravitational settling velocity as the particle of interest an d is a useful metric for characterizing particles greater than about 1 m. The aerodynamic diameter is used because it is a way to account for partic les of different shapes and densities that behave the same way in air. APC: Division of Air Pollution Control ASU: Appalachian State University ATSDR Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry is an agency within the Centers for Disease Control and Preventi on, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Average The same as mean. The sum of a list of values divided by the number of values. Bioavailable After ingestion of a substan ce, only a portion of th e substance would be absorbed by the body and coul d react with body organs. CDC Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Chronic exposure Contact with a substance that occurs over a long time (more than 1 year) [compare with acute exposure and intermediate duration exposure] Concentration The relative amount of a substance mixed with another substance. The amount of a substance present in a cert ain amount of soil, water, air, food, blood, hair, urine, breath, or any other media. An example is five parts per million (ppm) of carbon monoxide in air or 1 milligram per liter (mg/L) of iron in water. Criteria pollutants Six pollutants regulated by the U.S. EPA under the authority of the Clean Air Act. The six pollutants are car bon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, PM10, PM2.5, ozone, and sulfur dioxide. CTEH: Center for Toxicology and Envi ronmental Health, a contractor for the Tennessee Valley Authority Curie (Ci) A unit of radio activity, defined as 1 Ci=3.7x10 10 becquerels. This is the same as 3.7x1010 decays per second. 3.7x1010 = 37,000,000,000. This is roughly the radioac tivity of 1 gram of the radium isotope, Radium 226, a substance studied by the pioneers of ra diology, Marie and Pi erre Curie. Decay products Degraded radioactive materials, of ten referred to as \"daughters\" or \"progeny\"; radon-222 is a decay product of radiuim-226. Public Health Asses sment: KIF Coal Ash Release xi Dermal Referring to the skin. For example, dermal absorption means passing through the skin. Dike A levee, embankment, usually ear then, that can act as a barrier for containment purposes. Dose The amount of a substance to whic h a person is exposed over some time period. Dose is a measurement of exposure. Dose is often expressed as milligram (amount) per kilogram (a measure of body weight) per day (a measure of time) when people eat or drink contaminated water, food, or soil. In general, the greater the dose, the greater the likelihood of an effect. An \"exposure dose\" is how much of a substance is encountered in the environment. An \"absorbed dose\" is the amount of a substance that actually got into the bod y through the eyes, skin, stomach, intestines, or lungs. Duplicate A second sample that may be analyzed along with the original sample in order to determine the precision of the analytical method. EEP Environmental Epidemiology Program, part of the Communicable & Environmental Disease Services Sec tion of the Tennessee Department of Health EIP: Environmental Integrity Project Embayment A bay or bay-like shape in a body of water. EMEG Environmental Media Evaluation Guid e; a health comparison value derived by ATSDR from minimal risk levels (MRLs) , specific to soil, water, or air for periods of exposure up to 2 weeks (acute EMEG), for periods up to a year (intermediate EMEG), or for over a year (chronic EMEG) Environmental Media Soil, sediment, water, air, biota (plant s and animals), or any other parts of the environment that can contain contaminants. EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency Exposure Contact with a substance by swa llowing, breathing, or touching the skin or eyes. Exposure may be short-term [acute exposure], of intermediate duration, or long-term [chronic exposure]. FRM: Federal Reference Method Finished water Water that has been through tr eatment at a water treatment plant and is distributed to customers. Health comparison values The concentration of a chemical that is not likely to cause harmful effects during a lifetime. An example is an Environmental Media Evaluation Guide for soil.

Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xvii Summary INTRODUCTION On Monday, December 22, 2008, around 1:00 A.M. the retention wall of a coal ash-holding pond failed at the Tennessee Valley Au thority Fossil Plant in Roane County, Tennessee. More than 5.4 million cubic yards of coal ash, mixed with 327 million gallons of water, spilled into a branch of the Emory River, two Emory River inle ts, and the main channel of the Emory River. The release covered approximately 300 acres outs ide of the Tennessee Valley Authority coal ash dewatering and storage areas, and is considered one of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history. The massive coal ash slide disrupted power and ruptured a gas line, cau sing the evacuation of 22 residents. There were no deaths or injuries cau sed by this extraordinary ash slide. The spill has dramatically affected the environment and disrupted citizens' lives. Water quality in the Emory River at the site of the ash spill was impai red and aquatic habitat was destroyed. The spilled ash filled coves north of the ash containment pond with ash, soils, and debris (from trees and boat docks). The ash and soil complete ly filled in these coves and spilled across the yards of a few homes. Several homeowners owned boat docks and boats and used the coves as an entrance to the larger open water area of th e Emory River. Homeowners used the areas behind their homes for recreation and fishing. The ash spill damaged three homes to the point that they were condemned. The Tennessee Valley Authority provided the families living in these homes compensation and other housing. As of August 2009, TVA had compensated more than 100 property owners living near or affected by the spill. Many residents, whose yards backed up to the coves, were concerne d about the health effects of ash in their yards and in the c oves. People farther from the site were concerned about health effects of airborne ash. Soon after the environmental disaster, various governmental agencies began their emergency response activities. The first response came from the Roane County Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency. The Tenness ee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) responded next. They requested assistance from the National Response Center, who notified the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 4 in Atlanta. The Environmental Protection Agency set up a unified command with local and st ate officials, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the Tennessee Depa rtment of Health, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Initial response act ivities focused on evacuating peopl e, restoring power, repairing the ruptured gas line, and clearing roads for access to the coal ash release area. When coal is burned, the metals in the coal beco me concentrated in the ash. The metals in the coal ash have the potential to cause harm to the environmental and to people. For this reason, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Environmen tal Protection Agency, and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation i mmediately began sampling and analysis of the ash itself, surface water, groundwater, drinking water, and air. The Tennessee Department of Health reviewed all analytical results to ma ke sure that public health was protected. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xviii Several residents, other concerned citizens, a nd several environmental organizations petitioned the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Re gistry for a Public Health Assessment. The Tennessee Department of Health's Environmen tal Epidemiology Program wrote this Public Health Assessment. Its purpose is to help people understand: what government agencies did to protect people and the environment, if the coal ash could have caused, is causi ng, or will cause harm to people's health, how the Environmental Epidemiology Program made its conclusions, and what steps need to be taken next to continue protecting people's health. The Environmental Epidemiology Program used environmental sampling data collected and analyzed by the Tennessee Valley Authority, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conser vation to make its conclusions about public health impacts of the coal ash release. The conclusions about public health impacts were based on potential long-term chronic expo sures, except for two conclusions dealing with the immediate impact of the coal ash release. By considering long-term, chronic exposures, we were being prudent and most protective in our evaluations. The Public Health Assessment is not a 'health study' done by monitoring people. When the coal ash was released from the failed retention wall of one of the coal ash storage ponds, people in the path of the ash could have been harmed by the magnitude and suddenness of the ash release. If the release had occurred dur ing a summer day when people were on the river or riverbanks, many people could have been harmed or killed. Based on TDH's review of data, the coal ash at the site of the KIF coal ash release should not have caused harm to the community's health. The coal ash and the metals in coal ash have not: gotten into private well or spring water, impacted the municipal drinking water from the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants, limited recreational opportunities such as sw imming and boating, except in the immediate vicinity of the coal ash release and clean up, nor increased particulate matter or metals con centrations in ambient air around the site. The Environmental Epidemiology Program wrote th is public health assessment in collaboration with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseas e Registry. ATSDR reviewed the document at each stage in the process to make sure that the science was correct and that the conclusions and recommendations were valid and protective of public health. This Public Health Assessment is not the end of the Tennessee Department of Health's work on the TVA Kingston Coal Ash Release Site. The Depart ment of Health will c ontinue to work with our state and local partners including the Tennessee Depart ment of Environmental and Conservation, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the Environmental Protection Agency throughout the cleanup. The Ea st Tennessee Regional Health Office and the Roane County Public Health Department will con tinue to be local sources of information for citizens. The State Laboratory will continue to analyze environmental samples. The Environmental Epidemiology Program will continue to review environmental sampling data and continue to make recommendations to protect public health from harmful effects of the release. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xix OVERVIEW CONCLUSION 1 When the coal ash was relea sed from the failed retention wall of one of the coal ash storage ponds, people in the path of the ash could have been harmed by the magnitude and suddenness of the ash release. The ash could have bur ied them if they had been on the portion of the Swan Pond Road that was covered. The ash could have buried them if they had been boating, swimming, or fishing in the Emory River or in the Church, Berkshire, or Swan Pond sloughs. If the release had occurred during a summer day when people were on the river or riverbanks, many people could have been harmed or killed. BASIS FOR DECISION An enormous amount of ash quickly filled the Emory River and two coves, moving one house from its foundation and causing two other homes to be uninhabitable. The force of the release ruptured a gas line and disrupted power, causing th e evacuation of the neighborhoods along Swan Pond Road and Emory River Drive. A train derailed when it ran into a portion of the huge pile of coal ash. People driving home during the night found that Swan Pond Circle Road was impassable due to the ash. Fortunately, no one on the road or river was buried by the coal ash release. WHAT WAS DONE The Roane County Office of Emergency Services and Homeland Security acted immediately to protect people. The Tennessee Valley Authority, the U.S. Environmenta l Protection Agency, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, and the Tennessee Department of Health began to assist through a uni fied command structure. Although the command center was demobilized in January 2009, the response from state and federal agencies has continued, and will continue until the area is returned to the conditi ons existing before the coal ash release. The Tennessee Department of Health and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation will c ontinue to widely publicize the following message: If you do contact the ash, then practice good hygiene, especially washing your hands before eating or smoking. Wash thoroughly, including your hands, clothes and shoes if you, your children, or pets come in contact with the ash. Basically, wash the same way you would after mud exposure. Remember, the metals are bound to the ash. Occasional exposur es for brief periods of time should not harm people's health. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xx This coal ash release highlights th e continued need for industries and federal, state, and local officials to work closely together to develop comprehensive emergency response plans and capabilities in communities where acute environmental incidents are possible. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxi CONCLUSION 2 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that it is unlikely that harm occurred to people from touching the coal ash when they had to climb out of their damaged houses on the morning of December 22, 2008, and to those who returned to retrieve personal property. BASIS FOR DECISION Longer-term contact would be necessar y to cause any significant local skin irritation, such as coal ash that has gotten under a bandage. Casual contact with coal ash shoul d not cause skin irritation. In addition, the metals in the coal ash are not likely to get into people's bodies from touching the ash. WHAT WAS DONE / NEXT STEPS People whose homes were destroyed ha ve been relocated. In addition, the Tennessee Valley Authority has relocated most of the families whose property was near the affected portions of the Emory River and coves. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, and the Tennessee Valley Authority should continue to work cooperatively to clean up the ash as quickly as possible wh ile protecting the people in the community from touching, accidenta lly eating, drinking, or breathing the coal ash. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxii CONCLUSION 3 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that no harm to the community's health is expected from touching the coal ash. This includes children who might touch the ash while playing. BASIS FOR DECISION Longer-term contact would be necessar y to cause any significant local skin irritation, such as coal ash that has gotten under a bandage. Casual contact with coal ash shoul d not cause skin irritation. In addition, the metals in the coal ash are not likely to get into people's bodies from touching the ash. The ash has been fenced, clearly marking the areas with coal ash. The opportunity for people, especially children, to touch the ash is currently minimal. NEXT STEPS The Tennessee Valley Authority should continue working in cooperation with the U.S. Environm ental Protection Agency and the Tennessee Department of Environm ent and Conservation to clean up the coal ash while protecting the people in the community from touching the coal ash. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxiii CONCLUSION 4 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that no harm to people's health is expected from accidentally eating a small amount of coal ash. BASIS FOR DECISION The concentrations of metals in the coal ash, except arsenic, are below levels known to cause harm if eaten. Because exposure to the coal ash was brief and the arsenic in the coal ash is not completely available for absorption, no harm to health is e xpected even if the coal ash were accidentally eaten. The ash has been fenced, clearly marking the areas with coal ash. NEXT STEPS The Tennessee Valley Authority should continue working in cooperation with the U.S. Environm ental Protection Agency and the Tennessee Department of Environm ent and Conservation to clean up the coal ash while protecting the pe ople in the community from eating the coal ash. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxiv CONCLUSION 5 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that using the Emory River at the site of the coal ash release (near Emory River mile 2) could result in harm to residents or trespassers from physical hazards associated with cleanup efforts and from the volume of ash present, if residents or trespassers entered the area. BASIS FOR DECISION The Tennessee Valley Authority is using heavy machinery to build dikes and weirs to contain the ash and to remove the ash. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency a nd the Tennessee Valley Authority have brought in large hydraulic dredge equipment to expedite the removal of ash from the Emory River. People could be harmed if their boats became entangled in any cable or tie-offs for the dredging equipment or if any of the transpor t piping used to transport dredged ash were to blowout resulting in ma terials hitting someone nearby. In addition, boaters could hit partially submerged obstructions in the work area or have decreased visibi lity by not being able to see around the large equipment. By summe r 2010, ash removal in the main channel of the Emory River will have been completed and all heavy equipment will be removed. NEXT STEPS The Tennessee Valley Authority is working in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agen cy and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to clean up the coal ash while protecting the people in the comm unity. While cleanup is underway, heavy machinery will be present. The Tennessee Valley Authority should continue to actively patrol the area so that unauthorized persons cannot enter the area. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with the Tennessee Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation and the Tennessee Valley Authority, issued a Recreational Advisory for Watts Bar Reservoir in June 2009. This advisory states, in part: The public is cautioned to avoid recreational use of the lower Emory River in the vicinity of the ash release down to the confluence of the Emory and Clinch Rivers, which includes adjacent coves, inlets, is lands, and sand bars. Small vessel traffic is currently channeled th rough a well-marked navigational lane, but swimming, jet skiing, wate r skiing and tubing are not advised at this time in these areas. In addi tion to construction related risks, contact with submerged or floati ng ash should be avoided, and if ash is contacted it should be washed o ff with soap and water. Chronic exposure by incidental ingesti on and inhalation should also be avoided. On August 11, 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with the Tennessee De partment of Environment and Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxv Conservation and the Tennessee Valle y Authority, closed the Emory River from mile marker 1.5 to mile marker 3. The river closure was extended from mile marker 0.0 to mile marker 6.0. The river was closed to river traffic through May 28, 2010. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxvi CONCLUSION 6 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that using municipal drinking water from the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants will not harm people's health because the raw and finished water have cont inuously met drinking water standards. BASIS FOR DECISION The Environmental Protection Agency 's contractor tested raw and finished drinking water for the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants every day between December 23, 2008, and January 5, 2009. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation tested the water every day between January 2 and January 22, 2009, and continues to sa mple the water weekly. At no time, has the raw or finished wate r contained metals above primary drinking water standards. The water intake for the Kingston water treatment plant is about 6 miles dow nstream of the ash release site. The water intake for the Rockwood water treatment pl ant is about 23 miles downstream of the ash release. NEXT STEPS The Tennessee Department of Envi ronment and Conservation should continue to sample and analyze raw and finished water at the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants. If any at any time, violations of water quality are detected, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation will ta ke immediate ac tion to protect the health of the communities using the municipal water. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxvii CONCLUSION 7 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that using well or spring water within four miles of the coal ash release will not harm people's health from exposure to coal ash or metals in the coal ash because no evidence has been found for groundwater contamination by coal ash. BASIS FOR DECISION Between December 30, 2008, and March 12, 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, a nd the Tennessee Department of Health sampled and analyzed water from 102 privately owned wells and springs within a four-mile radius of the ash spill. None of the water tested had any contaminants above the national or state primary drinking water limits called Maximu m Contaminant Levels (MCLs). There is no indication from groundwater sampling and analysis that coal ash has contaminated the groundwater. NEXT STEPS The Tennessee Department of Envi ronment and Conservation should continue to take samples of gr oundwater from private wells and springs for analysis periodically to make sure that the coal ash is not affecting groundwater. If elevated c oncentrations of any of the metals from the coal ash are found in groundwater, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation will take immediate action to protect the health of the co mmunity. If site conditions at the Kingston Fossil Plant coal ash release should change, then the groundwater sampling timeframe should be re-evaluated. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxviii CONCLUSION 8 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that no harm to people's health should result fr om recreational use of the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers outside the area of the lower Emory River down to the confluence of the Emory and Clinch Rivers, as specified in the recreati onal advisory and river closure. Previous fish advisories should be followed. BASIS FOR DECISION Sampling and analysis for metals associated with coal ash indicated that metals in all other areas of the Emory River and the Clinch River have remained below any health co mparison values. Concentrations of total suspended solids have rema ined low in all areas of the Emory and Clinch Rivers except at the site of the coal ash release. The Tennessee Department of Envir onment and Conservation and the Tennessee Valley Authority will con tinue to sample and analyze surface water in the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers. If at any time, violations of water quality are detected, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation will take immediate action to protect the health of peopl e using the rivers for recreation. The Tennessee Department of Envi ronment and Conservation and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency advise avoiding consumption of striped bass and limiting consumption of catfish and sauger. The pollutants of concern are polychl orinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury from historical activities not related to the Tennessee Valley Authority (see Appendix D). NEXT STEPS The Tennessee Valley Authority should continue to clean up the site of the coal ash release as fast as possible while, at the same time, protecting both public health and the health of the river and its aquatic life. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation should continue to monitor the Emory and Clinch Rivers to make sure they remain safe for recreational activities. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation are sampling fish to make sure the coal ash does not affect them and indirectly ha rm people who eat the fish. Cleanup of the coal ash release is being conducted in a way that will not disturb historical contamina tion of the river sediments with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury. TVA and EPA entered into an Administrative Order and Agreement on Consent on May 6, 2009, to ensure that the enviro nmental impacts associated with the ash spill are thoroughly assess ed and that appropriate response actions are taken as necessary to pr otect public health, welfare of the environment, and to ensure that th e response actions sa tisfy all federal as well as state environmental requirements. TDEC's Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxix Commissioner's Order of January 12, 2009, and TDEC's collaboration with TWRA in prot ecting fish are included in the TVA/EPA order. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxx CONCLUSION 9 While no air measurements were obtained during the time period between December 22 through December 27, 2008, the Tennessee Department of Health concludes that it is unlikely that any harm to public health should have resulte d from breathing ambient air from December 22, 2008, through December 27, 2008. However, any dust that may have been inhaled could have aggravated symptoms in sensitive populations , that is, people with asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. BASIS FOR DECISION The coal ash was wet when it spilled. Wet weather for three days after the spill, combined with low temperatures and slow wind speeds, would have kept the coal ash from dr ying out and getting into the air. WHAT WAS DONE Since no air measurements were obtained during the time period between December 22 through December 27, 2008, it is not possible to know precisely what the air condi tions were during this time. All emergency operations were aimed at protecting the public from released coal ash and dealing with emergency situations created by derailed trains, ruptured gas lin es, destroyed homes, and destroyed roads. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began taking air samples on site on December 27, 2008. Various types of air sampling in the community began on December 28, 2008, by the Tennessee Valley Authority, on December 30, 2008, by the Environmental Protection Agency, and on January 19, 2009, by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxxi CONCLUSION 10a The Tennessee Department of Heal th concludes that breathing ambient air near the coal ash rel ease is not expected to harm people's health as long as adequate dust suppression measures are in place. CONCLUSION 10b The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that no harm to people's health is expected from occasionally breathing coal ash if it should become airborne for short periods of time. CONCLUSION 10c If dust suppression measures should fail and particulate matter is present in concentrations grea ter than National Ambient Air Quality Standards due to the c oal ash becoming airborne for periods longer than one day, the Tennessee Department of Health concludes that particulate matter from airborne coal ash could harm people's health, especial ly for those persons with pre- existing respiratory or heart condi tions. Such harm could include upper airway irritation and aggravatio n of pre-existing conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. BASIS FOR DECISION Sampling and analysis of particulat e matter by all agencies indicated that particulate matter, less than or equal to 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5) and less than or equal to 10 microns in diameter (PM10), in ambient air surrounding the coal ash release met all National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Coal ash is considered a nuisance du st because of the size range of the particulate matter. Metals in the ash are not at high enough concentrations to cause harm if they are breathed. If the coal ash were breathed in for longer periods or more frequently, the particulate matter in the airborne coal ash would cause the same harm as breathing in other dusts (such as dust from a ball field or farm land). Examples of such harm are upper airway irritation and aggravation of pre-existing problems such as asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory or cardiovasc ular conditions. The Tennessee Valley Authority's air monitors did not often detect metals in total particulate matter. Most measurements were below health comparison values. Arsenic and chromium detected by the Tennessee Valley Authority in total particulates on-site were within the range found in the United States fo r metals on particulate matter. Sampling and analysis of ambient air off-site were done by using temporary monitors that sampled total particulate matter, not just respirable or inhalable particulat es. One sample taken on January 26, Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxxii 2009, had cadmium in total particulat es above the health comparison value. This sample represents just one sampling result within results for five sampling stations with da ily sampling from January 1 through March 10, 2009 (345 samples). Metals in total suspended partic ulates measured by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Co nservation were all below health comparison values, except for two samples of arsenic that were slightly above the health comparison values. These two detections of arsenic should have no impact on public health because the concentrations of arsenic detected were extremely low. In addition, metals measured in total suspended particulates include metals of all sizes of particulate matter, not just particulate matter that is respirable. NEXT STEPS The Tennessee Valley Authority and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation should continue to measure particulate matter and metals in particulate matter in the air near the release until the coal ash release is cleaned up. The Tennessee Department of Health, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, a nd the Tennessee Valley Authority will ensure that a system is in place to warn people if the air quality is likely to fail to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxxiii CONCLUSION 11 The Tennessee Department of Health cannot conclude whether breathing dust near the quarry and along the routes of the quarry trucks has or will harm people's health. Such dust can be irritating to upper airways and can aggravate pre-existing conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. BASIS FOR DECISION Of the 47,909 real-time measurements of particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns in diameter (PM10) in the co mmunity near the ash release, 0.1% were above 150 micrograms per cubic meter, the 24- hour average National Ambient Ai r Quality Standard for PM10. Many of these samples were taken near the quarry and along the quarry truck routes. Because the samples were collected during a short time period, three to five minutes, we cannot make any predictions about the 24-hour aver age concentrations. We can say that the quarry dust does not typical ly contain heavy metals like the coal ash. Quarry dust contains chem icals present in limestone, such as calcium, magnesium, and carbonates. Such dust can be irritating to upper airways and can aggravate pr e-existing conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. NEXT STEPS If the rock dust from the quarry was a health problem, it was because it is particulate in nature. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation should continue to work with the quarry and with the Tennessee Valley Authority to le ssen the dust at the quarry and along the truck routes. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxxiv CONCLUSION 12 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that the small amount of radiation from the coal ash is not expected to harm people's health. Any exposure to radiation from the small amount of naturally occurring radionuclides present in coal ash, even in the more concentrated forms in co al ash, would be too small to give a radiation dose to people th at would be substantially greater than the normal, everyday backgro und radiation dose to which all people are exposed. BASIS FOR DECISION The radioactive materials of concer n in coal ash include both radium- 226 and radium-228. Although the concen tration of these materials in the coal ash exceeded the av erage regional background soil concentrations, the levels are below the health-based directive used by both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Regist ry. This regulatory limit was set to protect the health of people, including the health of sensitive populations. NEXT STEPS No additional public health actions are needed related to radiation from the released coal ash. The Tennessee Valley Authority, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a nd the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation si gned the continuing Interagency Agreement Watts Bar Reservoir Permit Coordination in February 1991. This agreement governs any activ ities that could result in the disturbance, resuspension, removal, and/or disposal of sediments contaminated by Oak Ridge Reserva tion past activities. The cleanup of ash in Watts Bar Reservoir is functioning under this agreement to prevent dredging of legacy contamin ation not related to the coal ash release. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxxv CONCLUSION 13 The Tennessee Department of Health supports the efforts of the non-governmental organizations to collect environmental data in the days after the coal ash relea se. The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that data collected by non-governmental organizations confirm data collect ed by governmental agencies at the site of the coal ash release. Because the data were collected for a brief time immediately after the coal ash release and were collected only at the site of the re lease, they could not be used in establishing the long-term public he alth implications of the coal ash release for Watts Bar Reservoir. Data from all agencies agree that arsenic in the coal ash was at levels above health comparison val ues, that arsenic in the Emory River at the site of the ash release was elevated immediately following the release. They also agree that groundwater in the vicinity of the coal ash release wa s not impacted by the coal ash. Non-governmental organizations, as well as the Tennessee Departments of Health and Environment and Conservation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, expressed concern about the potential for harm to health from breathing airborne coal ash. See Conclusion 10 for more about this. The data provided by non-governmental organizations about selenium in certain fish w ere not replicated by Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation's, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency's, or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's sampling and analysis. However, it has signaled the need for further investigation by government agencies. The Environmental Protection Agency's Science Review Panel and the U.S. Corps of Engineers have generated two reports on selenium impacts at the site of the coal ash release. BASIS FOR DECISION Non-governmental organizations (NGOs ) collected most of their data in the days just after the coal ash re lease and in areas near the release. In some cases, the Tennessee De partment of Health could not determine the exact sampling and analysis techniques or quality control and quality assurance measures. We appreciate this additional data and the concern about the environment and the health of Tennesseans by the non-governmental organizations. By working together, all governmental and non-g overnmental agencies can protect the environment and the health of the people who live in the area of the coal ash release. Sampling and analysis of groundwat er, surface drinking water, well water, and air continues by the Te nnessee Valley Authority and the Tennessee Department of Envir onment and Conservation. This Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxxvi continuing sampling will allow the Tennessee Department of Health and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to ensure that the health of the public near the coal ash release continues to be protected. NEXT STEPS None at this time. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxxvii CONCLUSION 14 Based on the Communi ty Health Survey, the Tennessee Department of Health concludes that many residents living in the area of the coal ash release expe rienced stress and anxiety. Some residents reported respiratory sympto ms after the ash release. It is important to note that the survey was done soon after the spill, but was not repeated later. Therefore, the results are only applicable for the short period soon after the spill. BASIS FOR DECISION Analysis of questions from the Community Health Survey indicated that 52 percent of the persons who answered questions for the survey experienced stress and anxiety. Sy mptoms of stress and anxiety are natural and to be expected since th e coal ash release destroyed homes, disrupted lives, and drastically changed the landscape. Since the coal release occurred just before Christmas, even more stress was added to the lives of the people living near the coal ash release. Forty percent of the persons who answered questions for the surv ey reported a change in health status since the spill, primarily worsening of either cough or headaches, wheezing, or shortness of breath. It is important to note that the survey was done soon after sp ill, but was not repeated later. Therefore, the results are only appli cable to the short period soon after the spill. NEXT STEPS The Tennessee Department of Hea lth has continually encouraged people to see their prim ary care provider for any health concerns. People are encouraged to cont act the Oak Ridge Associated Universities to sign up for health scre enings if they are concerned that their health has been harmed by the coal ash release. The health screenings will be done by medical toxicologists from the Tennessee Poison Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The Department of Mental Health and the Tenness ee Valley Authority worked with Ridgeview Community Mental Heal th Center in Oak Ridge and Harriman to provide services to people affected by the coal ash release. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxxviii CONCLUSION 15 Community members living near the quarry and along the routes that quarry trucks traveled made complaints specific to dust at the Tennessee Valley Authorit y's Community Involvement Center. Complaints about respiratory symptoms were widespread and were not oriented toward either the site of the coal ash release or the route of the quarry trucks. BASIS FOR DECISION The Tennessee Department of Health analyzed written complaints to the Tennessee Valley Authority's Community Involvement Center related to health concerns. Th e Tennessee Department of Health performed geographical analysis th at indicated that dust concerns were strongly oriented to the location of the quarry and to routes traveled by the quarry trucks. Geographical analysis indicated that respiratory concerns were not geogr aphically related to either the quarry or the coal ash release site. NEXT STEPS The Tennessee Department of Envi ronment and Conservation should continue to work with the qua rry to control dust. TVA has implemented many dust control measures at the site of the coal ash release and for trucks leaving the site. Dust controls will continue to be required of trucks driving on county roads. The Tennessee Department of Hea lth has continually encouraged people to see their prim ary care provider for any health concerns. People are encouraged to cont act the Oak Ridge Associated Universities to sign up for health scre enings if they are concerned that their health has been harmed by the coal ash release. The health screenings will be done by medical toxicologists from the Tennessee Poison Center, Vanderbilt Univ ersity Medical Center. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xxxix CONCLUSION 16 The Tennessee Department of Health concluded that screening people's blood or urine for metals would not be helpful. BASIS FOR DECISION Based on environmental test resu lts, the Tennessee Department of Health does not expect harm to h ealth from touching, eating, drinking, or breathing the metals in coal fl y ash. No harm is expected from breathing the air as long as adequate dust suppression measures are in place. Any exposures would have be en very brief, and any possible absorption of metals from the coal ash would have been undetectable. NEXT STEPS If people chose to have metals' testing and they are concerned about their results, they should talk with their primary care provider or talk with a medical toxicologist at th e clinics set up in the area by Oak Ridge Associated Universities a nd the Tennessee Poison Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Summary Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release xl THE FUTURE The Tennessee Department of Health understands that people are concerned about whether the coal ash may be a health hazard in the future. The Tennessee Department of Health will continue to consult with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make sure that future sampling will be adequate in all respects to make determinations about the heal th of the people living near the coal ash release. The Tennessee Department of Health will continue to follow all sampling and analysis activities and will inform the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency immediately if any results might be a cause of health concern. The Tennessee Department of Health, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Tennessee Poison Center will continue to work together to ensure that public health is prot ected during the long cleanup process. The Tennessee Department of Health will continue to keep people informed about any new issues or any new findings through the Environmental Epidemiology Program's website, reports, community meetings, and press releases. Since the Public Health Assessment Was Begun All conclusions remain valid and unc hanged as of July 2010. The Tennessee Department of Health ha s reviewed data continually as it has become available to make sure the public health of the community near the Tennessee Valley Authority spill site is protected.

Background 1.1 Introduction The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Kingston Fossil Plant (KIF) is located on the Emory River close to the confluen ce of the Clinch and Tennessee Rivers near Kingston, Tennessee. Constructi on of the plant began in 1951 and was completed in 1955. KIF generates 10 b illion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, enough to supply the needs of about 670,000 homes in the Tennessee Valley. The plant burns approximately 14,000 tons of coal every day when operating at full power. This results in about 1,000 tons of ash. The ash was deposited in an aboveground ash contai nment slurry pond with three cells. TVA managed the ash by mixing it with water to prevent deposition of the fly ash downwind from the plant (TVA 2009). Two types of coal ash are formed when coal is burned in a power plant to produce electricity. Combustion rates in modern facilities are nearly 100 percent, meaning that the organic materi al in coal is completely burned up, while the metals that are left over become more concentrated. Bottom ash forms in the bottom and on the sides of th e furnaces and consists mostly of the non-combustible constituents of coal. Th e portion of the ash that escapes up the stack is referred to as fly ash. The fly ash in the stack solidifies in the exhaust gases and is collected for disposal. Coal fly ash contains sm all particles and can become airborne if it dries out. KIF co llects coal ash in pond s to keep the fly ash wet. The coal ash produced by KIF is approximately 10 percent bottom ash and 90 percent fly ash. However, the coal ash in the ponds was nearly 100% fly ash [Joseph J. Hoagland, TVA, personal communication]. Fly ash is mainly silicon dioxide, aluminum dioxide, iron oxide, and some other metals. On Monday December 22, 2008, around 1:00 a.m., the retention wall of one of the coal ash holding ponds failed. More than 5.4 million cubic yards of coal ash mixed with 327 million gallons of water spilled and covered more than 300 acres of surrounding water and land, enteri ng a branch of the Emory River, two Emory River embayments, and eventually spilling into the main Emory River. The release covered approximately 300 acr es outside of the coal ash dewatering and storage areas of the plant. The massive ash slide disrupted power and ruptured a gas line, causing the ev acuation of a n earby neighborhood. Approximately 22 residents were evacua ted due to the gas line leak. There were no deaths or injuries caused by this extraordinary ash slide. The spill has dramatically affected the environment and disrupted citizens' lives. Water quality in the Emory River at the si te of the ash spill has been impaired and the aquatic habitat has been dest royed. See Figures 1 and 2 for aerial photographs before and after the release and Figure 3 for an overview of the waterways in the area. TVA: TN Valley Authority KIF: Kingston Fossil Plant Background Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 2 The spilled coal ash filled coves north of the ash containment pond with ash, soils, and debris (from trees and boat docks). The ash and soil completely filled these coves and spilled across yards of a few homes. Several homeowners also owned boat docks and boats and used the coves as an entrance to the larger open water area of the river. Homeowners used the areas behind their homes for recreation and fishing. The ash spill damaged three homes to the point that they were condemned. The families were provided compensation and other housing by TVA. As of July 31, 2010, TVA had purchased 165 properties (parcels) near KIF and entered into settlement agreements with owners of the properties. Residents whose yards backed up to the coves were concerned about the health effects of ash in their yards and in the coves. Pe ople farther from the site were concerned about health effects of airborne ash. 1.2 Response of Governmental Agencies A local resident made a 911 emergency call soon after the ash release. Local emergency officials from the Roan e County Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency first responde d to the scene, and soon began to assist residents affected by the flow s of coal ash sludge. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) also responded. The Roane County Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency represents some of the most highly trained emergency response personnel in Tennessee. Their unique expertise can be attributed par tly to the long established partnership between the U.S. Department of Energy and the State of Tennessee formed to respond to an off-site emergency at th e Oak Ridge Reservation. The high level of expertise displayed by the Roan e County Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency demonstrated a rapid and highly effective response to the coal ash release ev en though there was not an emergency plan for an off- site event at KIF. Three residential homes we re condemned because of damage sustained during the release. No injuries or missi ng persons were reported. Roane County Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency and the TEMA requested assistance from the National Response Center who notified the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 4. EPA Region 4's on-scene coordinator and EPA Region 4's contractor, Tetra Tech, arrived on site the afternoon of December 22, 2008. Tetra Tech holds the EPA Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team (START) contract. EPA set up a unified command with local and state officials, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), the Tennessee Department of Health (TDH), and TVA responders. Initial re sponse activities focused on restoring power and repairing the gas line as well as clearing roads for access to the spill. TVA: TN Valley Authority KIF: Kingston Fossil Plant TEMA: Tennessee Emergency Management Agency EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Tetra Tech: Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team (START) contractor for EPA Region 4 TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation TDH: Tennessee Department of Health Background Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 3 TVA initiated spill response cleanup by m obilizing large numbers of backhoes, amphibious backhoes, bulldozers, dump trucks, related equipment, and personnel to clear and repair affected road ways and rail lines necessary to plant operations. The heavy equipment was also used to clear waterways to allow creeks to drain that had been blocked by the coal ash release. Barges were used to bring in riprap to install a dike to slow the flow of ash downstream. Booms were placed in the Emory and Clinch Rivers to contain floating cenospheres that migrated downstream1. TVA contractors vacuumed the cenospheres and cleaned up debris along the waterways. TVA restored gas and water supplies to affected residents. In addition to these emergency responses, all agencies began a program of environmental sampling to determine if the coal ash presented a threat to public health. TVA, EPA, and TDEC all wanted to know if the coal ash was affecting drinking water, well water, springs, or the air. They wanted to know if contact with the coal ash could harm people's health. On December 22, 2008, government agencies began collecting environmental samples. TVA began daily real time instantaneous air sampling at many locations on December 28, 2008. This sampling was done with a portable monitor that took a sample for 3 to 5 minutes. TVA also did sampling and analysis for particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5) and for particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns in diameter (PM10) on December 31, 2008. The partic ulate samples were analyzed for metals. As requested by EPA, Tetra Tech provided technical assistance during response activities at the KIF coal as h response site from December 22, 2008, through January 10, 2009. Between December 23, 2008, and January 2, 2009, Tetra Tech collected 23 surface water sa mples, three duplicate samples, and two background samples along an approxi mate 10-mile stretch of the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers. Tetra Tech specifically collected some surface water samples in areas where cenospheres were visible just downstream from the release area. Between December 23, 2008, and January 5, 2009, Tetra Tech collected seven potable water samples from the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants. On December 30, 2008, EPA' s Science and Ecosystem Support Division (SESD) laboratory collected 10 potable water samples from the upstream Cumberland water treatment pl ant and the downstr eam Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants. Four samples were taken from private drinking water wells. From December 23, 2008, through January 5, 2009, Tetra Tech collected seven ash samples and one duplicate sample fr om the Emory River, fly ash storage area (dredge cell), and from released ash along affected roadways. From 1 Cenospheres are small, hollow ceramic spheres of varyin g chemical composition that are generated during high- efficiency coal combustion at thermal power plants. They are much less dense than water and float easily. TVA: TN Valley Authority EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation PM2.5: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 microns PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns Tetra Tech: Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team (START) contractor for EPA Region 4 SESD: EPA's Science and Ecosystem Support Division Background Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 4 December 28, 2008, through January 5, 2009, nine soil samples, two duplicates, and four background samples we re collected from residential and public shoreline locations along the Emory and Clinch Rivers. On January 11, 2009, EPA transferred the ro le of lead federal agency to TVA and demobilized all remaining personnel and equipment from the site. This was done as the emergency response phase transitioned to long-term operations. In May 2009, EPA and TVA en tered into an Administrative Order and Agreement on Consent. EPA will oversee TVA's cleanup of the site, in consultation with TDEC. EPA requested assistance from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) in evaluating data for its public health implications, reviewing future sampling plans, and working on risk communication messages. ATSDR received EPA data on December 26, 2008, and again on January 1, 2009. ATSDR's emergency response staff responded with telephone calls, emails, and two ATSDR Record of Activity documents. ATSDR is a federal public health agency whose purpose is to serve the public by using the best science, taking re sponsive public health actions, and providing trusted health information to prevent harmful exposures and diseases related to toxic substances. TDH' s Environmental Epidemiology Program (EEP) has funding from ATSDR as a cooperative agreement state. TDEC began sampling and analysis of air on January 19, 2009. TDEC tested for particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns in diameter (PM10) and total suspended particles (TSP) plus metals. TDEC performed daily (seven days pe r week) sampling and analysis of raw and finished drinking water and reported the results daily for the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants fro m January 2 through January 22, 2009. The environmental laboratory in TDH supported TDEC's sampling efforts by providing weekend laboratory coverage . On January 26, 2009, TDEC changed to weekly drinking water analyses. TDEC has sampled river water at other locations and has taken fish samples with the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA). TDH, at the local, regional, and state leve ls, was a part of the initial response. EEP staff assisted with sampling, data management, and risk communication. TDH, with assistance from the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), performed a door-to-door survey to obtain baseline information about people affected by the ash release. Results of the survey will be discussed in a later section. TDH provided education to area health care providers. The education will be discussed in a later s ection of this public health assessment. TVA set up a Community Outreach Center in Kingston. This center provided, and still provides at the time of this report, a central area where residents concerned about the ash release could go for assistance and to file property or EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TVA: TN Valley Authority TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry TDH: Tennessee Department of Health EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns TSP: Total suspended particles TWRA: Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency NCEH: National Center for Environmental Health Background Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 5 health claims. As of April 7, 2009, more than 600 families had contacted the center to address their questions, co ncerns, and property damage claims. TDH's EEP and ATSDR looked at all sa mpling results during the initial response to determine if a people's hea lth could be immediately harmed from exposure to the coal ash and to the ch emicals in the coal ash. EEP's and ATSDR's conclusion was that there was no immediate threat to public health. TVA, TDEC, and TDH have held severa l meetings to keep the community aware of issues. On December 28, 2008, the Kingston City Council held a special meeting with TVA at the Ro ane County High School gymnasium. About 300 people attended that meeti ng. On January 6, 2009, TVA, EPA, TDEC, and the Roane County Emergency Management Service held a meeting at a church in Harriman. The mayor of Harriman led the meeting of about 200 attendees. On January 15, 2009, TVA hosted a meeti ng with EPA, TDEC, ATSDR, and TDH at the Roane State Community College gymnasium. There were no presentations, but people were free to talk with each agency at their tables. Many people attended this meeting. On March 5, 2009, TDEC and TDH held a joint meeting at the Roane State Comm unity College student lounge. Formal presentations were made of all recent work, environmental sampling, and analysis by TDEC. TDH presented its co nclusions about health impacts from the coal ash release. Once again, people were free to talk to each agency in attendance at the end of the presentations. TVA and EPA entered into an Administrative Order and Agreement on Consent on May 6, 2009, to ensure that th e environmental impacts associated with the ash spill are thoroughly assessed and that appropriate response actions are taken as necessary to protect public health, welfar e of the environment, and to ensure that the response actions satisfy all federal as well as state environmental requirements. The Commissioner's Order from TDEC, dated January 12, 2009, and TDEC's collaboration with TWRA in protecting fish are included in the TVA/EPA order. This public health assessment (PHA) is a follow-up to ATSDR's Record of Activity documents. This PHA is a direct response to petitions to ATSDR for a public health assessment. This report will document the public health implications of the coal ash itself and our findings about the impacts of the coal ash on groundwater, drinking water, and air. This PHA will only address human health. It will not include an y discussion of the ash's impact on wildlife, domestic animals, or water quality as it affects fish and aquatic life. It will not determine the cause of any personal health symptoms. 1.3 Potential Routes of Exposure EEP evaluates ways that could lead to human exposure to determine whether persons have been or are likely to be exposed to chemicals. An exposure pathway has five parts: TDH: Tennessee Department of Health EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry TVA: TN Valley Authority TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation TWRA: Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency PHA: Public Health Assessment Background Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 6 a source of contamination, contaminant transport through an environmental medium, a point of exposure, a route of human exposure, and an exposed population. If there is evidence that a ll five of these parts are pr esent, an exposure pathway is considered complete. An exposure pathway is considered incomplete if one or more of these parts is missing. For the TVA coal ash release, the source of contamination is, of course, the coal ash itself. Contaminant transport occurred when the ash was released from the ash pond. Contaminant transport could occur if the coal ash were transported in Watts Bar Reservoir to the intakes of th e water treatment plants at Kingston and Rockwood. Contaminant trans port could potentially occu r if the metals in the coal ash leached out of the ash and into the groundwater, contaminating residential drinking water wells and springs. Another contaminant transport mechanism would be if the coal ash drie d out and became airborne dust. Routes of exposure could be dermal exposure to the ash, ingestion of the ash itself or of water impacted by the ash, ingestion of fish impacted by the ash, and inhalation of airborne coal ash. EEP will discuss each of these routes of exposure in this Public Health Assessment. The people who live near enough to the coal ash release to have potential expos ures are the receptor population. Physical contact alone with a potentially harmful chemical in the environment by itself does not necessarily mean that a person will be harmed by the chemical. A chemical's ability to aff ect a person's health depends on a number of other factors, including the: amount of the chemical that a person is exposed to (dose) length of time that a person is exposed to the chem ical (duration) number of times a person is expos ed to the chemi cal (frequency) person's age and health status, and person's diet and nutritional habits. The purpose of this public health consulta tion is to examine any potential health hazard from coal ash or chemicals in the coal ash to people living near the site of the coal ash release. To evaluate exposure to a hazardous substa nce, health assessors often use health comparison values. If the chemical c oncentrations are below the comparison value, then health assessors can be r easonably certain that no adverse health effects will occur in people who might be exposed. If concentrations are above the comparison values for a particular ch emical, then further evaluation of that chemical is needed. TVA: TN Valley Authority EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program Background Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 7 1.4 Health Comparison Values EEP and other environmental public health organizations use health comparison values to help them make determinations about the contaminants in the environment and their impact on public health. ATSDR and EPA are the two main agencies who have environmental toxicologists who are fully able to make decisions about levels of contaminants that will not harm people. They do this using a process called risk assessm ent. Details about the various health comparisons values EEP will use in this public health assessment can be found in Appendix A: Hea lth Comparison Values. ATSDR is charged by Congress with provi ding support in the assessment of any health hazard posed by Superfund or other hazardous waste sites. Part of that charge is to thoroughly research what is known about toxic and hazardous chemicals. The purpose of the research is to establish health comparison values. These health comparison values are used by ATSDR and TDH so that when toxic or hazardous substances are found in the environment, we can understand the public health implications using the best sc ience available. If the chemical concentrations are below health guidance values, then environmental scientists can be reason ably certain that no adverse health effects will occur in people who are expos ed. If concentrations are above the guidance values (ATSDR 2007a, 2008) for a particular chemical, then further evaluation is needed. In this public health assessment, we will do further evaluation for arsenic in coal ash fo r the ingestion route of exposure. ATSDR's health comparison values for chemicals that do not cause cancer are called Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs). Chronic MRLs represent doses that a person could receive everyday for a lifetime without harm. To be more useful to scientists doing health and risk assessment, MRLs are mathematically converted to Environmental Media Eval uation Guidelines (EMEGs). EMEGs represent concentrations of chemicals in an environmental media, such as soil, air, or water, which people could be exposed to for varying amounts of time without adverse health effects. ATSDR developed EMEGs for varying tim es of exposure and for children and adults. Acute exposure means exposure to a chemical every day for 14 days or less. Intermediate exposure means exposure to a chemical everyday for 15 through 364 days. Chronic exposure means exposure to a chemical everyday for one year or more, up to a lifetime. EEP will use these definitions of acute, intermediate, and chronic exposures. EPA definitions may differ. For example, the chronic EMEG for a child exposed to the chemical arsenic in soil (or ash in this case) is 20 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). This means that a child could accidentally eat soil or ash with 20 mg/ kg arsenic in it for over a year without harm. If a child is exposed to soil or ash with more than 20 mg/kg arsenic in it, the child would not necessarily be harmed. Health and risk assessors would need to look more closel y at details of how often the child is EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TDH: Tennessee Department of Health MRL: ATSDR minimal risk level EMEG: ATSDR environmental media evaluation mg/kg: milligram per kilogram Background Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 8 exposed, how well the arsenic would be absorbed into the child's body, how long the exposure lasts, and details a bout how the EMEG was derived. In our calculations, we assumed that children would accidentally eat 200 mg/day of soil. The 200 mg/day inge stion rate is 2 times the central tendency ingestion rate for children from 1 year to le ss than 6 years of age (100 mg/day) for incidental ingestion of soil and outdoor settled dust (EPA 2008). The EPA is also mandated to publish toxicity information. EPA's values are very similar to ATSDR's MRLs and EMEGs. EPA's reference dose (RfD) and reference (R fC) are analogous to ATSDR's chronic MRL. RfDs are used in cases of oral exposure (eating or drinki ng) to the chemical in question. RfC's are used for inhalation exposure (breathing) the chemical in question. For cancer effects, ATSDR uses EPA in formation to set their cancer risk evaluation guidelines (CREGs) for lifetime exposure. Health comparison values will change periodically as scientists discover more about how a particular chemical does or does not cause harm to people. Thus, MRLs and cancer risk values can be reset higher or lower. EEP used comparison values for chronic exposures to children whenever possible. This means that EEP assumed that all exposures would last more than one year and could last for a lifetime. This is a cautious way to look at possible risks from exposures to chemi cals in the environment. Details for each exposure pathway will be discussed in each section of the public health assessment. If concentrations are below the chroni c EMEG for a particular chemical, the health assessor can be re asonably certain that no a dverse health effects will occur in people who are exposed. Stat ed another way, the health assessor can be very sure that even long-term, c ontinuous exposure to a chemical at concentrations below its chronic EMEG will not harm people's health. EEP used ATSDR's MRLS and EMEGs for chronic exposure to children whenever possible. EMEGs developed for children and chronic exposure are the most stringent health comparison values. For certain metals, ATSDR used an EPA value comparable to their MRLs to calculate a Reference Dose Media Evaluation Guide (RMEG). If ATSDR's EMEGs or RMEGs were unavailable, EEP used comparison values developed by regional EPA offices or EEP developed comparison values for use at this ash release site. 1.4.1 Proper Use of Health Comparison Values Health comparison values may be properly used as: 1. Screening values to identify subs tances/chemicals of concern at hazardous waste sites that n eed further investigation 2. Identification of populations at potential risk EMEG: ATSDR environmental media evaluation guide mg/day: milligrams per day EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry MRL: ATSDR minimal risk level EMEG: ATSDR environmental media evaluation guide RfD: EPA Reference Dose RfC: EPA Reference Concentration CREG: Cancer risk evaluation guide EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program RMEG: ATSDR- derived reference dose media evaluation guide Background Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 9 Health comparison values should not be used as: 1. Threshold levels for a toxic effect 2. Predictors of toxicity at any given level above the heal th guidance value 3. Absolute values (since there is an inherent area of uncertainty surrounding them) 4. Screening values for all effects a nd populations (without first evaluating the relevance of the critical effect upon which the heal th guidance value is based) (DeRosa 2002). This means that the health comparison values we use are simply screening values. If the concentrations of chemical s found in soil, ash, air, surface water, or groundwater are less than any health comparison values, we are sure that those chemicals will not cause harm to anyone. If the concentrations found are above the health comparison values, we cannot say that exposure to those concentrations would cause harm. We would investigate further to see if people are being exposed, what the durat ion and frequency of exposure is, and how sure we are in the health comparison value. We would look at all relevant data and circumstances of exposure. A ll this further inve stigation would be necessary before we could say whethe r the chemicals could cause any harm. 1.4.2 Child Health Considerations In communities faced with air, water, or food contamination, the many physical differences between children and adults demand special emphasis. Children could be at greater risk th an adults from certain kinds of exposure to hazardous substances (ATSDR 1997, 1998). Children have lower body weights than adults. Yet, children dri nk a larger volume of wa ter per mass of body weight than adults. Therefore, a child's lo wer body weight and higher intake rate results in a greater dose of per unit of body weight. If toxic exposure levels are high enough during critical growth st ages, the developing body systems of children can sustain permanent damage. Finally, children are dependent on adults for access to housing, for acces s to medical care, and for risk identification. Thus, adults need as much information as possible to make informed decisions regardi ng their children's health. In preparation of this health document, the health of children was thoughtfully considered. The most important differen ce was in the evaluation of the threat to children and adults who might accident ally ingest ash. Regulatory limits for air and drinking water are set to protect sensitive populations. 1.4.3 Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure EPA has a special way to look at wastes containing metals. They use a concept called the toxicity characteristic l eaching procedure (TCLP). Title 40: Protection of the Environment, Sect ion 261.24 - Toxicity Characteristic defines TCLP. Waste with metals is treat ed in the laboratory in a way that will remove metals from the solid partic les and put them in solution. The EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TCLP: toxicity characteristic leaching procedure Background Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 10 laboratory method mimics what would happen to the waste when it contacts water, such as rain or groundwater. Re gulatory standards have been developed that define TCLP values above which a waste is classified as hazardous. 1.4.4 Drinking Water Regulatory Limits The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was passed in 1974 and amended in 1986 and 1996. It gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to set drinking water standards. Primary Drinking Water Standards are called Maximum Contaminant Leve ls (MCLs). MCLs are legally enforceable standards that apply to pub lic water systems often called municipal water systems. Primary standards prot ect drinking water quality by limiting the levels of specific contaminants that ca n adversely affect public health and are known or anticipated to occur in water. The EPA has established MCLs for a total of 87 chemicals, microorganisms, or compounds in drinking water. Besides the microorganisms, chemicals that have established MCLs include disinfection by-products, disinfectants, inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals, and radionuclides. MCLs are based in part on health-based standards and are legally enforced. Lead does not have an MCL, rather it has an action level of 15 micrograms per liter (g/L). This action level is based on a statistically derived sampling plan at homes, rather than a numeric valu e for the finished water leaving a municipal water treatment plant. The EPA has also set Secondary Drinking Water Regulations. These federal guidelines for contaminants that may cause the water to appear cloudy or colored or to taste or smell bad. EPA recommends, but does not enforce, that municipal water utilities follow the s econdary guidelines. TDEC has the authority to enforce their Secondary Drinking Water Regulations, which are similar to EPA's Secondary Drinking Water Standards. Primary and Secondary Drinking Water Standards do not apply to privately owned drinking water wells or springs. The individual homeowner assumes the responsibility for making his or her well water or spring safe to use. No national drinking water quality standard s have been set for privately owned water wells or springs. When groundwat er from a residential drinking water well or spring is sampled and tested, the results are often compared to the MCLs and secondary standards. This is especially true in cases where documented contamination has occurred in the general area. Following the coal ash release, TDEC assessed if the coal ash release affected local drinking water wells and springs. The primary a nd secondary drinking water standards were used for these private drinking water wells or springs for comparison purposes only as there are no legally en forceable standards for these water sources.

The Tennessee Water Quality Criteria (TDEC 2008) contains descriptive and quantitative criteria for various uses of water. These uses include domestic water supply, i ndustrial water supply, fish and aquatic life, and recreation. In most cases, quanti tative criteria for the domestic water supply are the same number as MCLs. The exception is lead. Lead does not have an MCL, rather it has an action level of 15 g/L. This action level is based on a statistically derived sampling pl an at homes, rather than a numeric value for the finished water leaving a municipal water treatment plant. The water quality criteria for domestic water supply is 5 g/L for lead. Descriptive criteria have been set for so lids in water. The criteria for domestic water supply specifies that total diss olved solids shall at no time exceed 500 milligrams per liter (mg/L). The criteria for Fish and Aquatic Life states that there shall be no turbidity, total suspended solids, or color in such amounts or of such character that will materially a ffect fish and aquatic life. Criteria for Recreation states there shall be no total suspended solids, turbidity or color in such amount or character that will result in any objectionable appearance of the water, considering the nature and location of the water. 1.4.6 Criteria Air Pollutants The Clean Air Act was passed 1970 and la st amended in 1990. The Clean Air Act is the comprehensive federal law that regulates air emissions. This law requires EPA to establish National Am bient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants considered harmful to pub lic health and the environment. The Clean Air Act established two types of national air quality standards. Primary standards set limits to protect public hea lth, including the health of \"sensitive\" populations such as asthma tics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards set limits to protect public welfare, including protection against decreased visibility, damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. They includ e standards for carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, PM10, PM2.5, ozone, and sulfur dioxide. Units of measure for the standards are parts per million (ppm) by volume, milligrams per cubic meter of air (mg/m 3), and micrograms per cubic meter of air (\u00b5g/m3). PM2.5, PM10, and lead will be discussed further in the Air section. MCL: maximum contaminant level g/L: microgram per liter. 1000 g are in 1 milligram mg/L: milligram per liter EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency NAAQS: National Ambient Air Quality Standards PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns PM2.5: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 microns ppm: parts per million mg/m\u00b3: milligram per cubic meter of air g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air Background Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 12 1.5 Tennessee Department of Health's Miss ion for this Public Health Assessment The Tennessee Department of Health's mission is to protect the health of people living in or visiting Tennessee. Following the coal ash release, we want to make sure that Roane County residents: are safe living close to the coal ash release until it can be cleaned up, have clean air to breathe, have clean water to drink, have documentation that potential harm to public health is being investigated, and have knowledge that the Tennessee Departme nt of Health is closely following all environmental sampling and cleanup efforts so the we can be sure that the people of Roane County will not be harmed. The Environmental Epidemiology Program used environmental sampling data taken by the Tennessee Valley Authority, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to make its conc lusions about public health impacts of the coal ash release. The conclusions about public health impacts were based on long-term chronic exposures, except for two conclusions dealing with th e immediate impact of the coal ash release. The Public Health Assessment is not a 'h ealth study' done by monitoring people. Discussion Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 13 2. Discussion The discussion will be organized by media - coal ash, water issues, and air and by topic - radiation, non-governmental ag encies' response, community health survey, physician education, and community concerns. Each media will have an introductory section and sections on r outes of exposure, analytical results, toxicology (if necessary), and public health implications. Figures with a small letter, such as Figur e a, are within the text; figures with a number, such as Figure 1 are at the end of the text. Table with a small letter, such as Table a, are within the text; Ta bles with a number, such as Table 1 are at the end of the text. The first section will be on the coal ash itself and direct contact with the ash. The section on water issues will include details for surface water, municipal drinking water, and groundwater. TVA sampling and analysis is discussed first, followed by discussion of EPA's and then TDEC's sampling and analysis of air.

The concentrations of the metals will vary depending upon the origin of the coal. Current ash generation at KIF result s from burning a 50%/50% blend of Central Appalachian / Powder River Basi n (personal communication, Steven C. Strunk, TVA, March 17, 2009). On March 1, 2002, TVA published data from sampling and analyses of the KIF ponded fly ash from a dredge cell (Table 1) . These data represent a historical record of the metallic cont ent of the coal ash standing in the holding ponds. As part of the coal ash release investigat ion and response, TVA also took samples of ash near residential property and at other locations be tween December 23, 2008, and January 6, 2009. See Table 2 fo r a summary of TVA's ash data. Compared with local soil sampled by TDEC , some metals are concentrated in coal ash while other metals are not. Aluminum, arsenic, barium, cadmium, and calcium concentrations in KIF's coal ash were higher than in soil. On average, concentrations of copper, magnesium, a nd manganese were lower in KIF's coal ash than in soil. Concentrations of antimony, chromium, iron, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, silver, thallium, and zinc were not much different in KIF coal ash than in soil. 2.1.2 Routes of Exposure to Coal Ash In this section, routes of exposure will be touching th e coal ash or ingesting it directly. The populations who might be exposed are those people living in the three houses destroyed by the ash as they escaped from their homes, people living along the water wher e the ash came onto their property (less than 20 homes), and people who came into the cont act with the ash by visiting the areas with coal ash or helping to clean it up. TVA relocated people most at risk very quickly and had fenced off the ash within a month. The duration of exposure would be two months as a maximum, except for workers cleaning up the ash. This public health assessment will focu s on the public health implications of the coal ash release and will not focus on worker exposure. 2.1.3 Sampling As part of the environmental response, TVA, EPA, and TDEC took samples of ash and soil (see Figure 4 for locations of samples) and had them analyzed for various chemicals that might be associ ated with coal ash. The soil sampling results were useful as background inform ation and in helpin g all agencies to understand the areal extent of the coal ash release. KIF: Kingston Fossil Plant TVA: TN Valley Authority TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation Discussion: Coal Ash Public Heal th Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 15 EPA's contractor, Tetra T ech, collected ash and shor eline soil samples of affected and potentially affected areas of the coal ash release. From December 23, 2008, through January 5, 2009, Tetra Tech collected seven ash samples and one duplicate sample from the Emory Rive r, fly ash storage area (dredge cell), and from released ash along affect ed roadways. From December 28, 2008, through January 5, 2009, nine soil samples, two duplicates, and four background samples were collected from shoreline locations along the Emory and Clinch Rivers. Samples were anal yzed for metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). See Tables 3 and 4 for EPA's soil and ash data (Tetra Tech 2009). TDEC collected soil samples from 15 re sidential properties on January 6 and 7, 2009. TDEC also collected 13 ash samples either from the same residential property or near the same residentia l property for comparison. This extra sampling would help to determine if coal ash or coal ash dust had gotten onto residential yards. See Figure 4 for th e soil and ash sample locations. See Tables 5 and 6 for a summary of TDEC's soil and ash data. TDEC analyzed samples for metals in the coal ash, po lyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), VOCs, and radioactivity. As can be seen in Figure 4, the various agencies took samples in different areas of the coal ash spill. Therefore, it is not surprising to see variations in measured concentrations among the different agencies. 2.1.4 Analytical Results EEP received environmental data in a variety of formats from the various government agencies responding to the coal ash release. EEP treated data for the coal ash itself in the following way. If a data point was listed as MDL (method detection limit) or with a U (undetected) designation, the data point was considered to be zero for statisti cal purposes. This was because EEP was not always provided the method detection limits (MDLs). If a data point was listed with a less than (<) character or a J (estimated) designation, the data point concentration was treated as the number listed for statistical purposes. This does not lend to complete consistency in EEP's treatment of data from different agencies, but was necessary considering the various formats in which the volumes of data were received. This had no effect on the conclusions about health hazards. For these chemicals, wh en concentrations were detected, they were well below levels of health concern. 2.1.4.1 Soil Soil was tested to find out if the coal as h had contaminated soil. Analysis of the EPA shoreline soil samples (Table 3) collected from December 28, 2008, to January 5, 2009, and TDEC's soil samples (Tab le 5) indicated that all metals in the samples were below health comparis on values, except arsenic. In one EPA sample, arsenic was detected at 34 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), above the health comparison value for chronic expos ure of a child. However, the average EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Tetra Tech: Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team (START) contractor for EPA Region 4 VOC: volatile organic compound TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation PAH: polyaromatic hydrocarbon EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program MDL: method detection limit mg/kg: milligram per kilogram Discussion: Coal Ash Public Heal th Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 16 concentration was below the health comparison value of 20 mg/kg. No VOCs or PAHs were detected. 2.1.4.2 Ash TVA residential ash samples coll ected from December 27, 2008, through January 2, 2009, contained average arseni c concentrations above the health comparison value of 20 mg/kg. Arsenic concentrations ranged from 2.78 mg/kg to 107 mg/kg, with an averag e of 48.5 mg/kg. All other samples contained metals at concentrations be low health comparison values. Table 2 contains validated sample data. Analysis of the EPA ash samples collected from December 23, 2008, to January 5, 2009, indicated that all KI F ash samples exceeded the health comparison value for arsenic of 20 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). Arsenic concentrations in ash ranged fr om 44.8 mg/kg to 81.3 mg/kg. Table 4 contains validated summary data of the ash samples collected during these dates. TDEC's analytical results for ash showed that, except for arsenic, all samples contained metals at concentrations be low health comparison values. Arsenic was detected in all samples at concen trations above the health comparison value of 20 mg/kg. Arsenic concentrations in the ash ranged from 56 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, with an average concen tration of 78 mg/kg (Table 6). Environmental regulatory agencies have a special way to look at wastes containing metals. They use a concep t called the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure, called TCLP for short. Title 40: Protection of the Environment, Section 261.24 - Toxicity Characteristic defines TCLP. Waste with metals is treated in the laboratory in a way that will remove metals from the solid particles and put them in solution. The laboratory method mimics what would happen to the waste when it contacts water, such as rain or groundwater. Regulatory standards have been developed that define TCLP values above which a waste is considered hazardous. EPA and TDEC determined TCLP con centrations of arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, and silver in the ash samples. Laboratory results indicated that very little of the metals leached from the coal ash. On average, about 0.5 percent of the arsenic leached in the EPA samples collected and about 0.7 percent of the arsenic leache d in the TDEC samples collected. 2.1.5 Discussion of Arsenic and Health Comparison Values for Metals without Applicable Comparison Values As discussed earlier in the Health Comparison Values section, EEP used ATSDR or EPA health comparison values wh en they were available. Tables 3 through 6 detail TVA, EPA, and TDEC analysis of metals and the health comparison values chosen to be protective of public health for ingestion of mg/kg: milligram per kilogram VOC: volatile Protection Agency KIF: Kingston Fossil Plant TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation TCLP: toxicity characteristic leaching procedure EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry Discussion: Coal Ash Public Heal th Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 17 (accidentally eating) coal ash at the KI F ash site. Arsenic will be discussed because it was detected a bove health comparison valu es in ash. In addition, those comparison values needing explanation will be discussed. 2.1.5.1 Arsenic Arsenic is widely distributed in the Eart h's crust and occurs naturally in soil and minerals. People normally take in small amounts of arsenic in air, water, soil, and food. Of these, food is usually the most common source of arsenic for people (ATSDR 2007). In Tennessee, soils contain a range of ar senic concentrations, from 1 part per million (ppm) to 120 ppm. Statistical analys is of the soils da ta indicated that, in 95% of samples, arsenic concentrations were less than or equal to 20 ppm in Tennessee (Head 2006). In nature, arseni c is mostly found in minerals and only to a small extent in its elemental form. In coal fly ash, arsenic is in an inorganic form, mostly as an arsenate ion, AsO (Shoji et al. 2002 ). In the pH range of natural waters, arsenic most usually exists as the arsenate ions, HAsO and HAsO(ATSDR 2007). Current understanding of arsenic's t oxicology suggests that at low-level exposures, arsenic compounds are det oxified\u2014that is, changed into less harmful forms\u2014and then excreted in th e urine. At higher-level exposures, however, the body may not have the ability to detoxify the increased amount of arsenic. When this overload happens , blood levels of arsenic increase and adverse health effects may occur. Arse nic, like some other chemicals, does not seem to cause adverse health effects until a certain amount, or threshold, of the chemical has entered the body. Once the threshold, also known as the minimal effective dose, is reached, and the body is no longer able to detoxify arsenic compounds, adverse health effect s may result (ATSDR 2007). Inorganic arsenic has been recognized as a human poison since ancient times. Arsenic may cause irritation of the stomach and intestines when eaten in higher concentrations than found in the coal as h. Other effects from oral exposure to higher concentrations of arsenic include decreased production of red and white blood cells, which may cause fatigue, abnormal heart rhythm, blood-vessel damage resulting in bruising, and impa ired nerve function (ATSDR 2007). Perhaps the single most characteristic effect of long-term oral exposure to inorganic arsenic is a patte rn of skin changes. These include patches of darkened skin and the appearance of small \"corns\" or \"warts\" on the palms, soles, and torso, and are of ten associated with change s in the blood vessels of the skin. Skin cancer may al so develop (ATSDR 2007). Oral exposure to arsenic has also been reported to increase the risk of cancer in the liver, bladder, and lungs. The Depa rtment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has determined that inorgani c arsenic is known to be a human carcinogen (a chemical that causes can cer). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has dete rmined that inorganic arsenic is KIF: Kingston Fossil Plant ppm: parts per million DHHS: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services IARC: International Agency for Research on Cancer pH: The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a substance is Discussion: Coal Ash Public Heal th Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 18 carcinogenic to humans. EPA also has classified inorganic arsenic as a known human carcinogen (ATSDR 2007). Dermal exposure (getting arsenic on th e skin) to high concentrations of inorganic arsenic compounds may irritate the skin, with some redness and swelling. The skin irritation goes away after contact stops. However, it does not appear that skin contact is likely to lead to an y serious internal effects (ATSDR 2007). ATSDR has an arsenic chronic oral EMEG for children of 20 mg/kg, calculated from ATSDR's chronic MRL of 0.0003 mg/kg\u00b7day. RfD of 0.0003 mg/kg\u00b7day. The EMEG is a screening value. Since arsenic concentrations were ofte n greater than 20 mg/kg, more detailed analysis was required to assess the public health implications. This analysis is in the section, Public Health Implications of Dermal and Ingestion Exposure to Coal Ash. 2.1.5.2 Other health comparison values As discussed in the section on H ealth Comparison Values, EEP choose ATSDR or EPA health comparison values when they were available. Directly applicable values for ingestion were not available for iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, or thallium. Therefore, other health assessment methods were used to assess th e public health implications of these metals. These are discussed below. 2.1.5.2.1 Calcium and magnesium were analyzed in samples from all agencies - TDEC, EPA, and TVA. Magnesium and calcium are essential nutrients that are not usually considered toxic. Hea lth comparison values are not available for either of these metals. For purposes of comparison, the no rmal daily intake or the recommended daily intake was comp ared to the calculated intake. Using cautious assumptions, EEP assumed that a child would eat 200 milligrams of ash that contained the highest concentra tion of the metal that was measured. The intake of these metals was calcula ted using other standard assumptions described in the ATSDR Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual. The dietary reference intake2 for calcium is 500 mg/day for children aged 1 through 3 years and the tolerable upper intake level3 is 2500 mg/day for all ages (NAS 1997). This value can be compared to the daily intake calculated for a child accidentally eating 200 mg/day of soil containing the maximum measured concentration of 19,500 mg/kg calcium. This calculated worst case intake would be approximately 4 mg/day. As part of the Food and Drug Admini stration (FDA) Total Diet study from 1982-1984, the average daily intake of magne sium for a two-year old child was 2 Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) are reference values that can be used for planning and assessing diets for healthy populations and for many other purposes. 3 The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risks of adverse health effects in almost all indi viduals in the specified life stage group. EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry EMEG: ATSDR environmental media evaluation guide mg/kg: milligram per kilogram ATSDR minimal risk level Reference Dose EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation TVA: TN Valley Authority mg/day: milligram per day FDA: U.S. Food and Drug Administration Discussion: Coal Ash Public Heal th Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 19 determined to be 155 mg/day. The National Academy of Science (NAS) has established a value of 65 mg/day as an estimated average requirement4 for magnesium in children 1 through 3 years of age (NAS 1997). These values can be compared to the daily intake calculated for a child accidentally eating 200 mg/day of ash containing the ma ximum concentration of 4,160 mg/kg magnesium. This calculated worst case intake is approximately 0.8 mg/day. 2.5.1.2.2 Iron is an essential nutrient. It is found in large amounts in the Earth's crust. Neither ATSDR nor EPA has published toxicity profiles for iron. NAS has estimated tolerable upper intake levels of 40 mg/day for children and 45 mg/day for adults (NAS 2001). EEP used EPA's Regional Screening Levels for Chemical Contaminants at Superfund Sites (RSL 2009) for a health comparison value for iron. The health comparison value is 55,000 mg/kg in soil. This value can be compared to the daily intake calculated for a child accidentally eating 200 mg/day of soil containing the maximum measured concentration of 39,700 mg/kg iron. This calculated worst case intake would be approximately 8 mg/day. 2.5.1.2.3 Potassium and sodium were measured in ash by EPA and in surface water by TVA. NAS has recommended a tolerable upper intake level for sodium of 2.3 grams per day and an adequate intake level for potassium of 4.7 grams per day (NAS 2005). Because the concentrations of these metals in ash and surface water resulted in intakes a thousand-fold lower than the dietary reference intakes, they were not cons idered in this review of the data. 2.5.1.2.4 Thallium does not have an ATSDR - derived health comparison value because of a lack of toxicological data, although it is a toxic metal. All people are exposed daily to normal environmental levels of thallium, mostly from food. It has been estimated that the average person eats two micrograms per kilogram ( g/kg) of thallium in food on a daily basis (ATSDR 1992). EEP used EPA's Regional Screening Levels for Chemical Contaminants at Superfund Sites (RSL 2009) for a health comparison value for thallium in ash and soil. Screening values for various salts of thallium ranged from 5.1 to 7.0 milligram of thallium per kilogram of soil, with a value of 7.0 mg/kg for soluble salts of thallium. EEP chose to use 5 to 7 mg/kg in ash for health comparison purposes. 2.1.6 Public Health Implications of Dermal and Ingestion Exposure to Coal Ash TDH's public health message about contact with the coal ash has been, \"If you do contact the ash, then practice good hygiene, especially washing your hands before eating or smoking. Wash t horoughly, including your hands, clothes and shoes if you, your children, or pets come in contact with th e ash. Basically, 4 The estimated average requirement is the intake that m eets the estimated nutrient ne eds of 50 percent of the individuals in a group NAS: National Academy of Sciences mg/day: milligram per day mg/kg: milligram per kilogram ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program g/kg: microgram per kilogram TDH: Tennessee Department of Health Discussion: Coal Ash Public Heal th Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 20 wash the same way you would after mud exposure. Remember, the metals are bound to the ash. Occasional exposures for brief periods of time should not harm people's health.\" This message is still correct. 2.1.6.1 Dermal Contact None of the metals in the coal ash will be absorbed through the skin from touching the ash or getting the ash on sk in. However, prolonged contact with the coal ash could result in local skin irritati on (ATSDR 2007). The ash that is along the shorelines has been fenced off. Since the ash is not easily accessible and because the public health message to avoid contact with the ash has been widely publicized, no continued dermal contact with ash is expected for residents of the area. 2.1.6.2 Incidental Ingestion Incidental ingestion (accidentally eating) occurs through hand-to-mouth behaviors. That is, when playing or working in the soil, people may get dust or dirt on their hands and then put their ha nds in their mouth. Children and adults may eat without washing their hands. A dults do not usually wash their hands before smoking. EPA has determined that , on average, a chil d will accidentally ingest about 100 to 200 milligrams of dust or dirt each day. Concentrations of metals, except arse nic, were below health comparison values. The concentrations of arsenic in some ash samples and the average concentration of arsenic in ash sample s were higher than the ATSDR chronic EMEG for a child (20 mg/kg). The aver age concentration of arsenic in ash samples varied between 48.5 mg/kg for TVA ash samples and 78 mg/kg for TDEC ash samples. All three agenci es, TVA, EPA, and TDEC, found arsenic in the fly ash above health comparison values (see Tables 2, 4, and 6). Because arsenic was found at levels above the health comparison values, more detailed analysis was needed to determin e if the arsenic found in the coal ash posed a health hazard. EEP did this by looking at how much arsenic a sensitive member of the population (a child) woul d ingest (the dose). Additionally, we needed to estimate how much of the inge sted arsenic would be absorbed from the child's gastrointestinal tract into his blood (bioavailable). Experiments in animals have shown that between about 5% to 50% of arsenic in soil is absorbed from the gastrointestinal trac t or is bioavailable (ATSDR 2007). EPA generally assumes for risk assessments th at children will in cidentally ingest from 100 to 200 milligrams of soil per day. EEP assumed that young children would not play in the ash unattended excep t for brief periods. We assumed that 50% of the daily ingestion would be ash and 50% would be soil.

This theoretical calculated arsenic dose is less than the ATSDR chronic MRL and the EPA RfD of 0.0003 mg/kg\u00b7day. mathematical computation for calcu lating a dose of arsenic is an example of a reasonable worst case scenario. The highest mean concentration of arsenic found in sampling and analysis was use d. The percent absorption from the gastrointestinal tract used in this example (50%) is the maximum absorption found in experiments. The exposure period was during the winter months when most small children would not be playing outside near the water for long periods. People with ash in their yards were moved quickly, making the exposure time short. Since the ash is not easily accessible a nd because the public health message to avoid contact with the as h has been widely publici zed, no continued ingestion of ash is expected for residents of the area. No harm to the health of children or adults is expected from the possible very brief exposure time. 5 The 200 mg/day ingestion rate is 2 times the central tende ncy ingestion rate for children from 1 year to less than 6 years of age (100 mg/day) for incidental inges tion of soil and outdoor settled dust (EPA 2008). Discussion: Water P ublic Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 22 2.2 Water The physical impacts of the TVA coal ash spill to water were immediate - ash from the failed impoundment completely filled embayments and a portion of the Emory River main channel. Ash was carried downstream into the Clinch River. Plumes of ash in the water were observed entering the Tennessee River after heavy rainfall. The in itial impacts of the spill killed or displaced fish and other aquatic life or caused physical impacts to fish through gillways and ingestion. This public health assessmen t focuses on potential harm to human health. The surface water system in the area of the coal ash release is complex and is affected by the Watts Bar Dam in the Tennessee River. The entire surface water system is called the Watts Bar Rese rvoir. It includes the lower portions of the Emory River, the Clinch Rive r, and the Tennessee River upstream of Watts Bar Dam. This complex river sy stem is widely used for recreation - fishing, swimming, and boating. See Figure 3 for an overview of the water system. Characteristics of coal combustion wast ewater have the potential to impact human health and the environment. Many of the common pollutants found in coal combustion wastewater (e.g., seleni um, mercury, and arsenic) are known to cause environmental harm and can pot entially present a human health risk (EPA 2009). For this reason, all envir onmental regulatory agencies and TVA immediately began sampling and analys is of the materials spilled for potentially toxic constituents of coal ash in area waters. Two types of contamination from the co al ash spill are visible - ash in the water and cenospheres6 floating on the water. Vi sible coal ash often times makes a gray plume of ash in the water. Visible coal ash that floats is made up of cenospheres. Metals, that either di ssolve in the water or are on very small particles that are suspended in the water, will not be visible. Routes of exposure for this section in clude contact with the river water, incidental ingestion during r ecreational activities, ingest ion of fish caught in the river, and use of river water and gr oundwater as a potable drinking water source. Concentrations of metals in river wa ter were compared to Tennessee's Water Quality Criteria for either domestic wa ter supply or recreation. Analytical results for municipal and private well or spring water were compared to EPA's Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs). These were discussed in the Background section. Water Quality Crite ria and MCLs are listed in Table b. below 6 Cenospheres are small, hollow ceramic spheres of varyin g chemical composition that are generated during high- efficiency coal combustion at thermal power plants. They are much less dense than water and float easily.

For this public health assessment, EEP was concerned with uses of domes tic water supply and recreation. TDH values TDEC's protection of fish and aquatic life, although TDH's role is protection of public health. EEP will only address concerns about public health and will not address any ecological issues in this public health assessment. TDEC, TWRA, TVA, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory sampled fish in the Emory and Clinch Rivers for two reasons. They needed to determ ine if there would be any effect from the coal ash on fish and aquatic life. They also needed to determine whether there would be any human health eff ects from eating fish that may have accumulated metals from the coal ash. Fillet samples were collected from 75 fish, including largemouth bass, spotted bass, channel catfis h and blue catfish, in January, February, March, and April of 2009. With the exception of two g/L: microgram per liter. 1000 g are in 1 milligram MCL: maximum contaminant level EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program TDH: Tennessee Department of Health TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation TWRA: Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency TVA: TN Valley Authority Discussion: Surface Water Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 24 catfish samples, all levels of metals were below human health protection standards. These two catfish sample s exceeded the standa rd of 0.3 ppm of mercury. Levels of selenium were well below EPA's proposed toxicity standards for protection of fi sh and other aquatic life. 2.2.1.2 Historical Contamination It is important to remember that there is an existing fish advisory on the lower Emory and Clinch Rivers that was in pl ace before the coal ash release. TDEC and TWRA advise avoiding consum ption of striped bass and limiting consumption of catfish and sauger. The pollutants of concern are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury. See Appendix D for more information on the advisories. As part of their on-going ac tivities, TDEC and TWRA continue to sample fish for hi storical contamination. Cleanup of the coal ash release is being done in a manner that will not disturb the river sediments in which these contaminants exist. TDEC and TWRA will continue to sample fish for historical contaminants and for contaminants from the coal ash spill that could harm the fish or th at could accumulate in fish tissue that would be eaten by people. During the dose reconstruction for PCBs at the Oak Ridge Reservation, it was determined that the vast majority of PCBs detected in fish in the lower Watts Bar Reservoir occurred as a result of re leases to the Tennessee River upstream of the Clinch River (HydroQual 1995). While TVA may have contributed to the PCB contamination in the past, mo re than 20 other major sources on the Tennessee River contributed the bulk of PCB sediment contamination to Watts Bar Reservoir (ChemRisk 1999a). Mercury in fish and sediments in lo wer Watts Bar Reservoir are due to mercury releases from the Oak Ridge Reservation Y-12 plant. Lithium separation operations used more than 24 million pounds of mercury between 1950 and 1963 (ChemRisk 1999b). 2.2.1.3 Routes of Exposure Routes of exposure for this section in clude contact with the river water, incidental ingestion during recreational activities, and ingestion of fish caught in the river. During the winter mont hs, few people would likely have any direct contact with river water. Any contact would be brief. During the summer, many people have cont act with the river water, including children. This issue was fully evaluated by TVA, EPA, TDEC, and TDH, resulting in fact sheets and advisories for the river system. Advisories stated that recreational activities were safe in all parts of the Watts Bar Reservoir except for the area around the coal ash release. Existing advisories for fish consumption in the Watts Bar Reservoir remain in effect. ppm: parts per million EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation TWRA: Tennessee Wildlife Agency PCB: polychlorinated biphenyl TVA: TN Valley Authority TDH: Tennessee Health Discussion: Surface Water Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 25 2.2.1.4 Sampling of River Water Starting the day of the coal ash release, December 22, 2008, TVA has sampled surface water at several locations in the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers for dissolved metals and total metals. TVA continues to sample at these locations. See Figure 5 for th e location of sampling points. Between December 23, 2008, and January 2, 2009, EPA had their contractor, Tetra Tech, collect surface wa ter samples from potentially affected waterways. Tetra Tech collected 23 surface water sa mples, three duplicate samples, and 2 background samples along an approximate 10-mile stretch of the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers. Some surface water samples were collected in areas where cenospheres 7 were visible, floating on the water just downstream from the release area. Location on rivers is designated by river mile. Distance is measured from the mouth of a river, designated as rive r mile 0.0 and then going upstream. The mouth of a river is where the river ente rs another river, a lake, or the ocean. Tetra Tech selected surface water samp ling locations to include both upstream surface waters on the Emory River to mile marker 9.08 and downstream surface waters on the Clinch River to mile marker 0.0, as shown in Figure 6. Tetra Tech collected an additional upstream sa mple from the Tennessee River before its confluence with the Clinch River at Tenness ee River mile marker 568.5. On December 23 and 29, 2008, Tetra Tech accompanied TVA personnel in a boat to collect a total of 19 surface wa ter samples and two duplicate samples from the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers. On December 28, 2008, Tetra Tech collected an additional four surf ace water samples and one duplicate from public and residential shorel ines of the Emory and Clinch Rivers. Tetra Tech reported no visual evidence of coal ash at these locations. On January 2, 2009, Tetra Tech also collected two background surface water samples, one each from the Emory and Clinch Rivers. All EPA samples were analyzed for total metals, dissolved metals, and total suspended solids (also called suspended residue on some laboratory results forms). TDEC began sampling on January 2, 2009, and continues to sample the Emory River at miles 0.1, 1.7, 2.1, and 4.0, the Clinch Rivers at miles 2.3 and 4.5, and the Tennessee River at mile 568.5. See Figure 7 for TDEC's river surface 7 Cenospheres are small, hollow ceramic spheres of varyin g chemical composition that are generated during high- efficiency coal combustion at thermal power plants. They are much less dense than water and float easily. 8 Location on rivers is designated by river mile. Distance is measured from the mouth of a river, designated as river mile 0.0 and then going upstream. The m outh of a river is where the river enters another river, a lake, or the ocean. An example is TRM568.2, meaning river mile 568.2 of the Tennessee River; EMR designates Emory River mile; CRM designates Clinch River mile.

Samples were analyzed for total metals to check for possible impact from the coal ash. Other parameters such as dissolved oxygen, suspended solids, and pH were also measured. 2.2.1.5 Results River Water Sampling 2.2.1.5.1 TVA TVA sampling and analysis values for arsenic and other metals peaked in the Emory and Clinch Rivers around January 7, 2009. Arsenic concentrations are detailed below in Table c. Concentrati ons were near the detection limits before the peaks, and quickly returned to lowe r concentrations after the peaks. TVA reported concentrations of total susp ended solids (TSS) in spreadsheets beginning on February 23, 2009. A review of TVA's website indicated that TSS concentrations peaked around January 10, 2009, at more than 3,000 mg/L TSS (TVA 2009). Data taken from T VA spreadsheets indicated that minor peaks of TSS occurred in mid-March a nd mid-April following heavy rainfall (TVA 2009). See Tables 7 through 19 for de tails. All other results from over 1,000 samples from surface water obtained by TVA were below health comparison values. Table c. TVA surface water data for arsenic peaks on January 7, 2009.

See Tables 20 through 23 for details of these analyses. Analysis of samples for dissolved metals in the Emory River showed that most metals were below either Water Quality Criteria for domestic uses or the analytical detection limit. However, the detection limits for antimony, arsenic, and beryllium were higher than the Wa ter Quality Criteria. For antimony, the detection limit was 20 g/L and the Water Quality Criteria is 6 g/L. For arsenic, the detection limit was 50 g/L and the Water Quality Criteria is 10 g/L. For beryllium, the detection limit was 10 g/L and the Water Quality Criteria is 4 g/L. TVA: TN Valley Authority mg/L: milligram per liter g/L: per liter. 1000 g are in 1 milligram EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Discussion: Surface Water Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 27 On December 23, 2008, the concentration of dissolved arsenic was estimated to be 11.6 g/L at Emory River mile 0.1, slightly above the Water Quality Criteria for domestic water use. By Decemb er 28, 2008, at all points sampled on the Emory River, concentrations of arsenic had returned to levels less than the detection limit of 20 g/L. Concentrations of di ssolved antimony and beryllium were below the detection limits at all sampling points on each date sampled. The actual concentrations of antimony, ar senic, and beryllium could have been negligible or they could have been greater than the Water Quality Criteria. Other metals were below criteria on a ll days. EPA obtained approximately 450 data points and 52 samples for dissolved metals. The actual concentration of arsenic could have been negligible or it could have been greater than the health comparison value. Analysis of samples for total metals in the Emory River also showed that most metals were below either water quality criteria or the detection limits. As for dissolved metals, the detection limits fo r antimony, arsenic, and beryllium were above the criteria. On December 28, 2008, at Emory River miles 0.1 and 1.9, antimony, arsenic, and beryllium were above Water Quality Criteria. For all other dates and locations sampled, antimony, arsenic, and beryllium were found at levels below the detection limits. Analysis of samples from the Clinch River for dissolved metals showed that concentrations were below either the wate r quality criteria or the detection limit. As for sampling and analysis on the Em ory River, the detection limits for arsenic and beryllium were above the criteria. Analysis of samples for total metals in the Clinch River, showed that concentrations were below either the Wa ter Quality Criteria or the detection limit at all locations on all dates, with 1 exception out of approximately 500 data points and 52 samples. On December 28, 2008, the concentration of arsenic at the Kingston C ity Park South Boat Ramp was estimated to be 48 g/L. 2.2.1.5.3 TDEC See Tables 24 through 32 for results of TDEC's sampling and analysis of river water from January 8, through April 8, 2009. Analysis of total metals in the Emory River showed that most metals were below either Water Quality Criteria or the analytical detection limit at all locations and dates (see the Backgro und, Tennessee Water Quality Criteria, page 10). Arsenic and lead were th e only exceptions. Arsenic and lead concentrations peaked on January 22, and February 5, 2009, at Emory River mile 1.7. Arsenic was above the water quality criteria for domestic water use and for recreation. On January 22, 2009, lead was above the water quality criteria for domestic water use and the action level for drinking water. On February 5, 2009, the concentra tion of lead had dropped so that its level in the g/L: microgram per liter. 1000 g are in 1 milligram EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation Discussion: Surface Water Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 28 Emory River was below the action level. Total suspended solids were also increased at Emory River miles 1.7 and 2.1. The ash release is located at these locations on the Emory River. See the figures below. Arsenic was elevated in the Emory Ri ver at mile 2.1 on January 13 and 15, March 26, 31, and April 8, 2009. These in creases are shown in the figures below. TSS was increased at Emory River miles 1.7 and 2.1. Emory River miles 1.7 and 2.1 are at the site of the ash release. Figures a - c for arsenic and lead show c oncentrations with time at the site of the coal ash spill into the Emory River. For arsenic, the green line indicates the Water Quality Criteria for arsenic in recreational waters. The yellow line represents the aver age concentration hi storically found in the Emory River at mile 18.3, upstream of any Watts Bar dam effects. For lead, the red line indicates the EPA action level for lead in drinking water. The green line represents the Water Quality Criteria for lead in domestic water. The yellow line represents the average concentrati on of lead at mile 18.3, upstream of any Watts Bar dam effects. Keep in mind that the Emory River near the ash spill is not used as a drinking water source. Figures d - f show concentrations of se lenium in the Emory and Clinch Rivers and iron in the Emory River. For sele nium, the red line represents the Water Quality Criteria for selenium, as a maxi mum concentration, to protect fish and aquatic life. The green line represents the Water Quality Criteria for selenium, continuous concentration, to protect fish and aquatic life. For iron, the yellow line represents the average concentra tion in the Emory River at mile 18.3, upstream of any Watts Bar dam effects. The figures for selenium and iron are representative of all metals analyses at all sampling locations in the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers (close to 100,000 data points and 252 samples), except for arsenic and lead at the si te of the spill as discussed above. Average concentrations were calculate d from EPA STORET data. Average for the Emory River at mile 18.3 were calculated STORET data for the dates July, 24, 2002 through July 10, 2003.

Discussion: Surface Water Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 32 2.2.1.6 Public Health Implications Sampling and analysis indicated that meta ls and total suspended solids in river water have generally remained below any health comparison values. TDEC and TVA are continuing to monitor the river water to make sure that river water remains safe for recreation and for fish and aquatic life. EEP will continue to work with all agencies to make su re public health is protected. Concentrations of arsenic and lead were elevated above health comparison values near the release site (Emory Ri ver around mile 2.0) on several occasions. The health comparison values used were Tennessee Water Quality Criteria for domestic water use and for recreational use. After the coal ash release, the river was not navigable in the area of the rel ease. In addition, that portion of the river is not used as a sour ce of drinking water. The EPA, TDH, TDEC, and TVA issued an advisory on June 10, 2009, regarding boating, swimming and fishing on Watts Bar Reservoir. See the figure below. The advisory cautioned the public to avoid recreational use of the lower Emory River near the ash release down to the confluen ce of the Emory and Clinch Rivers, which included adj acent coves, inlets, islands, and sand bars. The advisory stated that water-based recreation on other areas of the Emory River, the Clinch River, and the Tenn essee River should not be impacted in summer 2009 (and it was not), and that it was not impacted except in the Lower Emory River. Current fish advisories to limit consumption of striped bass and limit consumption of catfish and sauger are still in effect because of historical contamination with polychlorinated bi phenyls (PCBs) and mercury (not related to TVA activities). Because EPA and TVA brought in large hydraulic equipment to expedite the removal of ash from the Emory River, they began initial river closure on August 11, 2009 between mile marker 1.5 a nd mile marker 3.0. On February 10, 2010, the river closure was extended from mile marker 0.0 to mile marker 6.0 through May 28, 2010. The U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, and TVA extended the closure to protect the public from a ny possible physical hazards due to the continuing cleanup operations.

Discussion: Public Drinking Wa ter Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 34 2.2.2 Public Drinking Water 2.2.2.1 Introduction The Kingston and Rockwood Water Treatment Plants are located closest to the KIF coal ash release site. The Kingston plant is located at Tennessee River mile 568.4, before the Clinch River joins the Tennessee River (about 6.5 miles downstream of the coal ash release). The Tennessee River would have to flow backwards to impact the Kingston water inta ke. Since these rivers are part of a large reservoir system, with flow controlled by dams, this is possible. After heavy rains in May 2009, ash reached the intake to the Kingston Water Treatment Plant, but did not affect the qua lity of the finished drinking water. By managing river flows through the Ki ngston area, TVA plans to manage river flow as much as possible to keep coal ash that might be flowing down the Clinch River from moving upstream toward the water intake. The Rockwood water intake is on an em bayment 1.9 miles upstream from the Tennessee River proper (about 24 miles dow nstream of the coal ash release). The embayment enters the Tennessee River at mile 553. The Harriman water intake is located at mile 12.8 of the Emory River. The Harriman water intake would not likely be impacted by the KIF coal ash release because it is too far upstream of the spill site and the rese rvoir does not cause backflow to that extent. See Figures 3 and 6 for cl earer presentations of locations. 2.2.2.2 Routes of Exposure The route of exposure for this section is the use of treated river water as a source of potable water. Since the cont aminants from the coal ash are metals, with no volatile organic compounds, the onl y applicable route of exposure is ingestion of the water. The Kingston water treatment plant serves a population of 8,939, with 3,694 connections. The Rockwood water trea tment plant serves a population of 9,167 with 3,788 connections. All these pe ople use the treated river water and could be affected if any coal ash contam inated this potable water. To ensure the safety of the public water supplie s, EPA and TDEC immediately began a program to sample raw and finished water. 2.2.2.3 Public Drinking Water Sampling Between December 23, 2008, and January 5, 2009, Tetra Tech collected seven raw water samples and one duplicate sa mple from the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants. On Dece mber 30, 2008, EPA's SESD collected 10 potable water samples and 1 duplicate from the upstream Cumberland water treatment plant, the Kingston and Rock wood water treatment plants, and four samples and one duplicate from residential properties. TDEC collected raw water samples at the intakes to the Kingston and Rockwood Water Treatment Plants on December 31, 2008, and began KIF: Kingston Fossil Plant TVA: TN Valley Authority Tetra Tech: Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team (START) contractor for EPA Region 4 EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency SESD: EPA's Science and Ecosystem Support Division TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation Discussion: Public Drinking Wa ter Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 35 collecting daily raw water samples from January 2, 2009, to January 20, 2009. TDEC also took finished water sa mples at the treatment plants. TDEC sent the water samples to the state laboratory for analysis for the parameters listed in Table d below. Table d.

These weekly samples were analyzed for the same parameters as previously analyzed on a daily basis. Weekly samples will continue to be collected and analyzed. Staff of the Kingston water treatment plant continues to take daily samples to make sure their water meets all criteria for safe drinking water. 2.2.2.4 Public Drinking Water Results Results for sampling and analysis can be seen in Tables 33 through 36. Data were analyzed as follows. If a data point was listed as MDL (minimum detection limit) with a U designation, the data point was considered to be half of the MDL. If a data point was listed with a less than (<) character or a J designation, the data point concentration was treated as the number listed. TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation MDL: method detection limit Discussion: Public Drinking Wa ter Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 36 2.2.2.4.1 Raw Water Raw water is the river water entering the water treatment plant, before it is treated. Water was tested every day between January 2 through January 22, 2009. It has been tested weekly since January 26, 2009. At the Kingston water treatment plant intake, water sampling showed results that either were below detection limits or met MCLs. These samples were taken prior to processing in the water tr eatment plant. For the analytes with a Secondary Drinking Water Standard, ra w water entering the Kingston water treatment plant met all secondary sta ndards with the ex ception of iron and manganese. Iron and manganese levels were within concentration ranges normally present in the Tennessee River, approximately 200 g/L for iron (91 to 401 g/L) and around 50 g/L (31-78 g/L) for manganese (STORET data, Tennessee River mile 568.2, March 26, 2003, through June 21, 2007). At the Rockwood water treatment plant, water sampling showed results that either were below detection levels or met MCLs. A dditionally, for the analytes with a Secondary Drinking Water Standard, the Rockwood intake water met secondary standards. 2.2.2.4.2 Finished Water Finished water is the water that has been through treatment at the water treatment plant and is the water that is distributed to customers. For the analytes with MCL, water sampling show ed results that either were below detection levels or met primary drinki ng water standards after processing at both the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants. Additionally, for the elements with a secondary Drinking Water Standard, the finished water met all secondary standards. 2.2.2.5 Public Health Implications of Raw and Treated Public Drinking Water EEP used Primary and Secondary Drinking Water Standards as comparison values. Refer to the Background secti on for a discussion of drinking water standards. Primary Drinking Water Standards (MCLs) are enforceable. Secondary Drinking Water Standards are not considered enforceable by EPA, but are considered enforceable by TD EC. They are recommendations for taste, odor, and other aesthetic properties of drinking water. Public drinking water from the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants is safe for consumption. There are no adverse public health implications from use of these public water supplies. TDEC is continuing to perform weekly sampling and analyses to ensure the safety of the drinking water. EEP will continue to study the data to make sure that public he alth is protected.

Most groundwater comes from rain or melting snow soaking into the ground. Water fills the spaces within rock and soils, making an \"aquifer.\" About half of our nation's drinking water comes from groundwater. Municipal water treatment provides clean surface or groundwater water to many households. Some families use private, household wells and sp rings as their source of fres h water drinking water and for cooking, and bathing. Groundwater contains many naturally occurring dissolved chemicals and compounds, including dissolved solids, iron, calcium, ma gnesium, aluminum, sodium, acids , chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and minor and secondary elements to name ju st a few. Groundwater also contains many dissolved gases such as oxygen, methane, hydr ogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide. Several microorganisms live in groundwater and include E-coli bacteria and Salmonella . Radionuclides also naturally occur in groundwater, but not typica lly at amounts that constitute a public health threat (Davis and DeWiest 1966). Groundwater's depth from the surface, quality fo r drinking water, and chance of being polluted vary from place to place. Generally, the deeper the well is, the better the groundwater. The amount of new water flowing into the area also affects groundwater quality. Groundwater may contain some natural impurities or contaminants , even with no human activity or pollution. Natural contaminants can come from many conditions in the wate rshed or in the ground. Water moving through underground rocks and soils may pick up salts of magnesium, calcium and chlorides, as well as soluble ra dium. Some groundwater naturally contains dissolved elements such as arsenic, boron, selenium, or radon. Whet her these natural contam inants may be health concerns depends on the amount of the substance pr esent. In addition to natural contaminants, groundwater is often polluted by human activities such as: improper use of fertilizers, animal manures, herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides improperly built or poorly located and/or maintained septic systems for household wastewater leaking or abandoned underground storage tanks and piping storm-water drains that disc harge chemicals to groundwater improper disposal or storage of wastes chemical spills at local industrial sites Private drinking water wells are pipes that are pu t into the ground that act as a straw and allow access to water beneath the ground. Wells may be used by members of a single household or by more than one household. Wells are dug, driven, or drilled into the groun d to capture water for drinking, cooking, bathing, waste di sposal, and recreation. Water occurs beneath the ground in what is called an \"aquifer\". An aquifer is a geologic formation that will provide useable quantities of groundwater to a well over a long period of time. Aquifers can exist over areas as small as one mile or less. Aquifers can also extend to hundreds of miles in extent. They can exist as little as several feet to hundreds of feet underground. Aquifers can also exist as areas where cracks or fractures occur in bedrock underg round. Thus, there are m any types of aquifers. Discussion: Private Drinking Water Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Rel ease 38 Springs are above ground exits of groundw ater. Springs generally occur on the side of a hill, ridge, or rock expos ure where the groundwater flows from a fracture or joint in the rock. Springs are abundant where there are rolling hills or rock outcrops. Many springs occur within and along creeks and rivers. They create creeks, ponds, or wet-weathe r conveyances of water. Springs are the most easily accessible source of gr ound water for rural families. Because they are on the surface, springs are also the easiest water source to become polluted by the activities outlined above. About 15 percent of Americans have their own sources of drinking water, such as wells, cisterns, and springs (EPA 2009a). Unlike public drinking water systems serving many people, water quality from private wells and springs is rarely checked. Individual well owners have primar y responsibility for the safety of the water drawn from their wells. The government's Drinking Water Standards do not apply to private water sources. For this part of the public health asse ssment, we are concerning ourselves with metals that might be related to the TVA ash release that may have been introduced into groundwater from the coal ash release. Some homes may have filtering or water-softening devices installed in the piping from their water well. Any filtering device may assist in filtering out some of the metals that may be attach ed to very small sand- or clay-sized particles that could be present in drin king water. Typical ly, some portion of naturally occurring metals is dissolved in the groundwater and is unable to be filtered out. 2.2.3.2 Routes of Exposure The route of exposure for this section is the use of groundwater as a source of potable water. Since the contaminants from the coal ash are metals, with no VOCs, the only applicable route of exposure is ingestion of the water. No coal ash related chemicals would get into the air from showering, cooking, or washing dishes. Within a four-mile radius of the ash release, about 120 households have private wate r wells or springs that they use as a source of potable water. EPA and TDEC receive d permission from 113 households to sample their well or spring water to make sure that coal ash has not affected their water supply. 2.2.3.3 Environmental Sampling of Priv ate Drinking Water Wells and Springs EPA sampled a small number of private wells immediately after the coal ash release. Shortly after the coal ash release, TDEC implemented a private water well and spring sampling program. The program focused on testing private groundwater sources within a four-mile radius of the coal ash release to identify which households had water wells or springs, if they used them for household use, and if they would like them to be sampled. For those households who provided access to thei r wells and springs, EPA and TDEC TVA: TN Valley Authority VOC: volatile organic compound EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation Discussion: Private Drinking Water Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Rel ease 39 sampled the groundwater for alkalinit y, hardness, and fourteen different metals. See Figure 8 for locations of the sampling. Alkalinity and hardness results are not discussed in this public health assessment because they are only a rough i ndicator of water qua lity and are not very useful for determining human health effects. However, their concentration can indicate the presence of a solution with abundant metals that could enter the groundwater of an area. Households received explanations of alkalinity and hardness with their results. Alkalinity is a reliable measure of the amount of carbonate (CO 32-) and bicarbonate (HCO 31-) ions in most natural waters. Most carbonate and bicarbonate ions in groundwater are derived from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide in soils, and solution of carbonate rocks. Alkalinity concentr ations between 50 and 400 milligrams per liter (mg/L) are most common. Water hardness is primarily the amount of calcium and magnesium, and to a lesser extent, iron in the water. Water hardness is measured by adding the con centrations of calcium, magnesium and converting this value to an equivale nt concentration of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) in mg/L of water. Water hardne ss in most ground water is naturally occurring from weathering of limestone, sedimentary rock and calcium bearing minerals. Generally, water having a hardness of less than 60 mg/L is considered soft while water with a ha rdness of 120 to less than 180 mg/L is considered hard. Water having hardne ss values more than 180 mg/L is considered very hard and has a hi gh amount of dissolved minerals. For the EPA and TDEC groundwater studies , an outdoor spigot or an indoor faucet was the source of water for samp le collection from household drinking water wells. For springs, containers were dipped into the spring water and allowed to fill slowly. The water sample was collected in laboratory-supplied containers. It then was placed on ice until delivery to the laboratory where the testing would be performed. All samples were transported to the laboratory using all standard, appropriate, a nd secure measures for transporting environmental samples. The testing laboratory analyzed the samples using standard methods developed by the EPA for testing of drinking water (EPA 1994). Well and spring samples collected by EPA and TDEC were tested initially by an independent laborato ry, Microbac Laboratories, Inc. of Maryville, Tennessee (State of Te nnessee laboratory Certification Identification Number TN02017). The majority of well water sampled by TDEC was analyzed by the T DH's analytical laboratory. EPA and TDEC sampled wells and springs closer to the TVA KIF first because EPA and TDEC wanted to identify any potential release to groundwater from the KIF coal ash release as early as possible. Wells and springs farther from the KIF and up to the four-mile radius were sampled later. Water well and spring sampling began on December 30, 2008, and ended on March 12, 2009. EPA and TDEC sampled 113 privately owned water wells and springs. mg/L: milligram per liter EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation TDH: Tennessee Department of Health TVA: TN Valley Authority KIF: Kingston Fossil Plant Discussion: Private Drinking Water Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Rel ease 40 2.2.3.4 Results of Sampling Private Drinking Water Wells and Springs EEP used Primary and Secondary Drinking Water Standards as comparison values, even though these standards are not enforceable for private wells and springs. Refer to the Background secti on for a discussion of drinking water standards. Results indicated that there were seve ral metals present in water wells and springs within a four-mile radius of the KIF. Table 37 shows the results of TDEC's water sampling. Metals identif ied in water well and spring samples all occur naturally within the groundwate r in this area of Tennessee. EPA, TDEC, and EEP compared the amount of each metal in the private well and spring water to EPA Primary and Seconda ry Drinking Water Standards. EPA and TDEC have set MCLs for arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, mercury, selenium, a nd thallium. EPA has established a secondary Drinking Water Standard for manganese. No standards or guidelines exist for strontium or va nadium; their concentrations were compared to EPA's Regional Screening Levels for Chemical Contaminants for Superfund Sites (RSL 2009). All metals detected were less than MCLs, secondary Drinking Water Guidelines, or EPA Region 3 screening table values, except for one well with an elevated manganese level. Ma nganese's secondary Drinking Water Guideline was not derived for health reasons, but for aesth etic reasons in drinking water (the water may ta ste bad or stain clothing). 2.2.3.5 Public Health Implications of Sampling Results in Groundwater The coal ash release has not impacted water from private drinking water wells and springs within four miles of the coal ash release. TDEC talked with the owner of the well with an elevated le vel of manganese about ways to reduce the manganese level. Groundwater is not static. Its chemistr y can and does change over time as does the rate at which it moves. Pumping of wells can influence groundwater flow rates and the public's use of land can influence its chemical make-up. It sometimes takes days, months, or years fo r an outside influence to show up in the groundwater of an area. Metals con centrations in groundwater are mainly a reflection of the mineral content of the soils and rocks through which the groundwater moves. The amounts of meta ls present in groundwater near the KIF may or may not change. TDEC has implemented a program to sample designated private drinking water wells surrounding the coal ash release. They will sample these wells two times per year to ensure the safety of the groundwater. EEP will continue to study the data from this sampling as they are made available. EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program KIF: Kingston Fossil Plant TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency MCL: maximum contaminant level Discussion: Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 41 2.3 Air EEP will discuss air sampling and analysis performed by each government agency. Within the air discussion for each agency, environmental sampling and analytical results will be discussed. Discussions about other air issues will be included as necessary. This section is organized as outlined: - Introduction to Air Pollution Standards - Introduction to Coal Fly Ash - Routes of Exposure - Summary of Air Monitoring - TVA o Sampling o Analytical Results - EPA o Sampling o Analytical Results - TDEC o Sampling o Analytical Results - Discussion of Metals and Their Health Comparison Values - Public Health Implications of the Airborne Coal Ash - Dust 2.3.1 Introduction to Air Pollution Standards The Clean Air Act, which was last amended in 1990, requires EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standa rds (NAAQS) (40 CFR part 50) for pollutants considered harmful to public health and the e nvironment. The Clean Air Act established two types of national air quality standards: primary and secondary standards. Primary sta ndards are air polluti on limits set to protect public health, including the health of sensitive populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standard s are air pollution limits set to protect public welfare. These secondary standards include protection against decreased visibility, damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards has set NAAQS for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Units of measure for the air standards are parts per m illion (ppm) by volume, milligrams per cubic meter of air (mg/m 3), or micrograms per cubic meter of air (\u00b5g/m3). In this report, we will most commonly use units of g/m\u00b3 as a standard unit of measure. The criteria air pollutant of concern for the TVA coal ash rele ase is particulate matter. Particulate matter in the atmos phere varies in size, shape, composition, and density. Particulate matter is re ferred to as PM followed by a number, such as PM10. The number refers to th e aerodynamic diameter in microns. EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program TVA: TN Valley Authority EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation NAAQS: National Ambient Air Quality Standards ppm: parts per million mg/m\u00b3: milligram per cubic meter of air g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air PM: particulate matter PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns Discussion: Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 42 Aerodynamic diameter is the diameter of a unit density (1 g/cm3) sphere that has the same gravitational settling veloc ity as the particle of interest. The aerodynamic diameter is used because it is a way to account for particles of different shapes and densities that behave the same way in air. Different size particles pene trate to different parts of the respiratory tract. The terms used for this are respirable and inhalable. EPA considers \"fine particles\" as partic les that are 2.5 microns in diameter or less. These fine particles are referred to as PM2.5 and are considered respirable particles. This means that a large part of these particles will be deposited in the deepest area of the l ungs, called the air ex change (alveolar) region. Particles that penetrate deep in to the respiratory system are generally beyond the body's natural ability to remove them and are more likely to be retained. Sources of fine particles include all types of combustion: including motor vehicle exhaust, power plant em issions, residential wood burning, forest fires, agricultural burning, and some industrial processes. EPA considers \"inhalable coarse particle s\" as particles that are 10 microns in diameter or less. These particles are referred to as PM10 and are considered inhalable particles. These particles w ill reach the lungs, but only a very small portion of these particles would be depos ited in the deepest, air exchange region of the lungs. Sources of coarse particles include crushing or grinding operations and dust stirred up by vehicles traveling on roads. Other agencies may refer to PM2.5 as u ltra fine particles and PM10 as fine particles. The primary and secondary NAAQS for particulate pollution are the same. The standard for PM2.5 is 15.0 g/m 3 for an annual arithmetic average and 35 \u00b5g/m3 for a 24-hour average. The standard for PM10 is 150 \u00b5g/m3 as a 24- hour average. EPA did not retain its annual arithmetic average for PM10 because available evidence does not suggest a link between long-term exposure to PM10 and health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) established a Working Group on Air Quality Guidelines in October 2005 th at recommended concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 that would be protective of human health. Their guidelines are 25 g/m\u00b3 PM2.5 and 50 g/m\u00b3 PM10 as 24-hour averages. 2.3. 2 Health Effects of Particulate Matter Both short-term and long-term expos ures to PM2.5 have been linked to cardiovascular effects, respiratory effects, and mortality. This is especially true for people with pre-existing heart and respiratory conditions. PM2.5 can aggravate existing lung disease, such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, causing more use of medications and more doctor visits. When exposed to particles, people with existing lung disease may not be able to breathe as deeply or vigorously as they normally would. Th ey may experience symptoms such as g/cm3: gram per cubic centimeter EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency PM2.5: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 microns PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns NAAQS: National Ambient Air Quality Standards g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air WHO: World Health Organization Discussion: Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 43 coughing and shortness of breath. Short- term exposures may also increase susceptibility to respir atory infections. In people with heart disease, short-term exposures to PM2.5 have been linked to heart attacks and arrhythmias. Healthy children and adults have not b een reported to suffer serious effects from short-term exposures, although th ey may experience temporary minor irritation of the upper airways when particle levels are elevated. Long-term exposures, such as those experienced by people living for many years in areas with high particulate levels, have been associated with problems such as reduced lung function and the development of chronic bronchitis and even premature death. Short-term exposure to PM10 may be linked to respiratory effects, but the link is suggestive rather than causal. Long-term exposure to PM 10 has not been linked to health problems (EPA 2009b). 2.3.3 Introduction to Coal Fly Ash A large percentage of coal fly ash is a ssociated with particles larger than 2.5 microns. Typically, only about 1 to 7% of coal fly ash is associated with the PM2.5 fraction (Shoji et al. 2002, Meij and te Winkle 2001). Meij and te Winkle found that, in the Netherlands, coal fly ash generated from firing of coal blended from all over the wo rld contains 55% PM50, KIF results from burning a 50%/50% blend of Central Appalachian / Powder River Basin coal. The fly ash in the dredge cell was the product of burning different coal types over the years. Analyses by TVA of this fly ash averaged 32.7% PM10 and 8.5% PM2.5 (personal communication, Steven C. Strunk, TVA, March 17, 2009). Because of the above size distribution, about 33% of airborne coal ash would be inhalable or respirable . TDEC captures all suspended particles (particles of all sizes) at their air monitoring site. Th ey measure metals in these particles. Because the metals analyses that TDEC does at the spill site represent metals in particles of all sizes, rather than in PM2.5 or PM10, this method of measurement will overstate the concentration of metals that could be respired or inhaled. Research into the chemical and toxicol ogical nature of coal fly ash indicates that the ash can be considered a nuis ance dust (Meij and te Winkel 2001; Meij 2000). This means that the fly ash w ould have the same potential adverse health effects as particulate matter. The metals content of the fly ash would not make the particulate matter more t oxic. Ash does not appear to have greater potency to cause pulmonary eff ects than other ambient particulates (Smith et al. 2006). PM2.5: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 microns PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns PM50: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 50 microns PM4: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 4 microns KIF: Kingston Fossil Plant TVA: TN Valley Authority TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation Discussion: Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 44 The material safety data sheet for class 'F ' fly ash indicates that coal fly ash is about 60% silicon dioxide or silica for short. Silica is a solid and can be measured in air. The Occupational Sa fety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the American Conference of Indust rial Hygienists (ACGIH) have set occupational standards to protect worker s from exposure to silica in air in industrial situations. EPA is using a standard set by ACGIH to protect people working on the site of the coal ash release. This standard is 25 g/m\u00b3 of respirable silica as an 8-hour time-weighted average. There is no standard for silica in ambient air. Public health should be protected from inhalation of silica at the coal ash release if PM2.5 and PM10 NAAQS are met in the monitors surrounding the coal release site. 2.3.4 Routes of Exposure The route of exposure is breathing ambient air. If coal ash dust or metals constituents became airborne, adverse health effects would be possible for those people living near the site of the coal ash release. Three hundred twenty-four residences, with about 7 00 individuals, are located within 1.5 miles of the coal ash release. If th e coal ash should become airborne, the airborne coal ash could affect people exposed to higher concentrations of particulate matter, especi ally those with pre-exis ting respiratory or heart conditions. Such effects could include upper airway irritation and aggravation of pre-existing conditions such as as thma, emphysema, and other respiratory conditions. 2.3.5 Summary of Air Monitoring TVA, EPA, and TDEC have all perfor med air monitoring near the coal ash release. Each agency has done different types of air monitoring, at different times and at different locations. Ta ble e below summarizes the monitoring activities by type, parameter, location, and date. See Figures 9 and 10 for locations of TVA and TDEC monitors and Figure 11 for locations of EPA monitors. TVA numbered their locations as PS05-PS09, and EPA numbered their locations as P1-P9. Details of air monitoring will be discussed by agency and type of monitoring.

The mobile monitor measured both PM2.5 and PM10. PM2.5 was measured with two different instruments: a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEO M) monitor and a Federal Reference Method (FRM) sampler. The TEOM monitor measured PM2.5 continuously and recorded the hourly av erage concentration. The FRM instrument contained a filter that collected airborne particle s for 24 hours before it was sent to a laboratory for analysis. Filters in th e sampler were changed at noon each day. TVA also measured the metals conten t in the filters from the FRM PM2.5 monitor for the same time period. The mobile laboratory was dismantled in early February to allow the area to be prepared for on-site storage of dredged coal ash. Individual metals in PM10 ai r particulate samples were collected with a high volume sampler using quartz filters which were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence. See Table 38 for details .

Monitors were identified as PS05 through PS09. Monitor PS05 was located on Swan Pond PS06 located on Berkshire on Emory River Road; PS09 was on Windswept Lane. Figures 9 and 10 show the locations of the monitors. The temporary monitors collected samples of all particulates for total metals analysis. They collected and analyzed for crystalline silica, total dust, and respirable dust that was 4 microns in di ameter or less. Air monitoring results were available online for December 28, 2008, through March 9, 2009, on TVA's website (TVA 2009). Results from their total metals testing can be found in Table 39. 2.3.6.1.3 TVA Stationary Long-Term Monitors TVA now has five FRM PM2.5 and tw o FRM PM10 stationary long-term monitors surrounding the site at the same locations as the temporary monitors. FRM PM2.5 monitors are positioned at locations PS07 and PS09. Most of these monitors began collecting data on February 12, 2009, and all of the new monitors were in operation by Ma rch 2009. Sampling and analysis will continue for the duration of coal ash r ecovery activities with samples being collected every third day or sixth day. Data from the FRM monitors analyzed between September 16, 2009, and January 13, 2010, did meet quality control parameters and are not reliable. The TEOM samples and metals sample data are reliable during that time period. Sampling results for these monitors can be found online at TVA's website. Based on the air monitoring results of total metals up to April 2009, which did not indicate elevated levels of metals, TVA will only analyze the filters for arsenic. FRM monitors use filter-based methods that generally produce data of good accuracy and precision. Data from FR M monitors are used for comparison with NAAQS values. However, the data are not available for some time after the measurement is made. This means that FRM data cannot be used to calculate the Air Quality Index or make rapid deci sions about air quality. Continuous monitors, such as the TEOM monitor, have the advantage of providing near real-time data. 2.3.6.1.4 Real-time measurements In addition, private contractors for TVA have taken several thousand real-time air samples for PM10 every day since December 28, 2008. The real-time TVA: TN Valley Authority CTEH: Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health, a contractor for TVA TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation TVA: TN Valley Authority FRM: Federal Reference Method PM2.5: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 microns PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns TEOM: Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance NAAQS: National Ambient Air Quality Standards Discussion: Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 47 measurements were taken initially by th e contractor, CTEH, and continue to be taken every day by the contractor, Shaw E nvironmental. Particulate levels are measured at predetermined locations with a portable monitor to measure particulate levels for a brief time - from 1 to 3 minutes. It is not possible to use a single 1 to 3 minute average to char acterize either an hourly average or a 24-hour average. However, having consistent daily elevated observations taken at the same time in the same loca tion could indicate that an area may be seeing elevated hourly concentrations a nd possible elevated daily levels. See Figure 10 for representative daily sampling locations. 2.3.6.2 TVA Analytical Results All TVA air monitoring results are summar ized in Table f at the end of this TVA analytical results section. 2.3.6.2.1 Mobile Laboratory On-Site Monitor See Table 38 for a summary of the analytical results. TVA's PM2.5 analyses from their mobile laboratory from December 31, 2008, through February 3, 2009, were below the NAAQS level of 35 g/m\u00b3 as a 24- hour average. In the 35 PM2.5 samples, no cadmium, chromium, or thallium was detected. Arsenic was detected once, lead was dete cted in seven samples, selenium was detected in 17 samples, and vanadium was detected in two samples. These metals were detected at concentrations less than health comparison values. There are no published health comparison values for thallium or vanadium in air. In TVA's PM10 samples, no cadmium, lead, thallium, or vanadium was detected in the 35 samples. Arsenic was detected in three of 35 samples, chromium was detected in 19 of 35 samples, and selenium was detected in four of 35 samples. Arsenic was above the health comparison value of 0.0023 g/m\u00b3 in each of the three samples. The concentrations of arsenic found in PM10 on January 3, January 15, and January 31, 2009, were 0.0042 g/m\u00b3, 0.0031 g/m\u00b3, and 0.0040 g/m\u00b3, respectively. Chromium was above the health co mparison value range of 0.001 to 0.003 g/m\u00b3 in 14 of the 19 samples in which chromium was detected, with a maximum concentration of 0.0109 g/m\u00b3 on January 14, 2009. The average concentration of the samples in wh ich chromium was detected at 0.0039 g/m\u00b3, slightly above the health comparison value range of 0.001 to 0.003 g/m\u00b3. Selenium in PM10 was below its health comparison value of 20 g/m\u00b3 in all four samples in which it was detected.

Most samples had non-detectable concentrations of metals. The details of analytical results for those metals detected at concentrations above the minimum detec tion limit are presented in Table 39. The detection limits for arsenic and chromium were above the health comparison values used by EEP. The health comparison values are 0.0023 g/m\u00b3 for arsenic and the range from 0.001 to 0.003 g/m\u00b3 for chromium. Four samples had detectable levels of lead on January 17, February 7, February 13, and February 24, 2009. Detail s are described in Table f below. These concentrations were below the NAAQS of 0.15 g/m\u00b3 for lead. Table f. Air concentrations of lead de tected above minimum detection limits at temporary stationary monitors. Kingston Foss il Plant coal ash release, Harriman, Roane County, Tennessee. at 0.01 g/m\u00b3 on January 26, 2009, at PS09. This value was above the health comparison value of 0.0056 g/m\u00b3. These results represent total metals, including those th at are not inhalabl e or respirable. Because the concentration of cadmium repr esents particulate matter of all sizes and the health comparison value is for particles of inhalable and respirable size, the health risk is likely overestimat ed. In addition, only one sample of 69 had any detectable cadmium. Aluminum, copper, manganese, and zinc were detected occasionally above the minimum detection limits. No levels of these metals were above health comparison values. 2.6.3.2.3 TVA Stationary Long-Term Monitors TVA's stationary long-term monitors measured PM2.5 at five locations and PM10 at two locations surrounding the ash release. TVA also analyzed the PM2.5 and PM10 for arsenic and thalli um. From February 12, 2009, through February 24, 2009, no arsenic or thallium was detected in PM2.5 or PM10. On February 27, 2009, arsenic and thalli um were below detection limits at sampling stations PS07 and PS08, but were not analyzed at sampling stations PS05, PS06, or PS09. On March 2, 2 009, arsenic and thallium were below detection limits at sampling station 7, but were not analyzed at the other sampling stations. From March 5 to March 23, 2009, analysis was not done for arsenic and thallium.

This means that from February 12 to March 23, 2009, the actual concentra tion of arsenic could have been negligible or it could have been greate r than the health comparison value. Beginning on March 26, 2009, the detection limit for arsenic was well below the health comparison value. No arsenic or thallium was detected from March 26 through May 13, 2009. Results can be seen on TVA's website (TVA 2009). All particulate measurements were below the NAAQS limits. 2.3.6.2.4 Real-Time Results From December 28, 2008, through May 31, 2009, CTEH took 47,908 real-time air samples for PM10 with hand-held me ters. The current contractor is continuing to take samples every day. Of these samples, 216 (0.4%) samples were greater than 100 g/m\u00b3 and 60 (0.1%) samples were greater than 150 g/m\u00b3. Notations in the comment section of the CTEH spreadsheet containing these data points were used in elucid ating the possible cause of the increased readings. Possible causes included fires in fireplaces, from burning of brush, or forest fires, and dust from the quarry and trucks from the quarry traveling to the site of the coal ash release. Fires of some sort were noted in the comments section for 47% of readings greater than 100 g/m\u00b3. Truck traffic or visible dust was noted for 8% of r eadings greater than 100 g/m\u00b3. These data were used in an attempt to correlate higher real-time concentrations and residents' concerns and complaints. See the section on Public Health Implications of the Airborne Coal As h in this section and the section on Community Concerns.

Selenium detected 4 times at levels below health comparison values. 12/28/2008 - 3/10/2009 Temporary total metals monitors at 5 locations (these samples represent total metals, not just respirable metals) Most samples had non-detectable metals. The detection limits for arsenic and chromium were above the health comparison values. The concentrations found were within ranges found in U.S. air. Lead was detected 4 times out of 69 samples at concentrations below the health comparison value. Cadmium was detected one time out of 69 samples at a concentration abov e the health comparison value. 2/12/2009 - 5/13/2009 5 Stationary FRM PM 2.5 monitors All PM2.5 and PM10 were below NAAQS concentrations. PM10 on 2/18/09 was 53.1 g/m\u00b3 at PS09. All others were below 50.0 g/m\u00b3. All PM2.5 were below 25 g/m\u00b3. Samples were analyzed for arsenic and thallium. All arsenic and thallium analysis showed no detections or were not analyzed for. The detection limit for arsenic is above the health comparison value. Concentrations of arsenic were within the ranges found in U.S. air. 12/28/2008 - 5/31/2009 Portable real-time PM10 monitors 47,908 were taken samples between January 1 and May 31, 2009. 0.1% were above 150 g/m\u00b3, the 24- hour average NAAQS concentration.

Tetra Tech pe rformed particulate air monitoring to assess whether air particulate concentrations were exceed ing the criteria for worker safety as well as community protection. Tetra Tech conducted air monitoring activities at a total of ten locations on and off site. Each air monitoring location, designated P1 to P8, P8.2, and P 9, is depicted on Figure 11. On December 27, 2008, Tetra Tech staged a fixed total par ticulate monitor on KIF property near on-going response ac tivities along Swan Pond Road. They recorded particulate conc entrations in the area i mmediately around disturbance of the released coal ash. This air monitor was operated for approximately three to nine hours each day from December 27, 2008, through January 10, 2009. From December 30, 2008, through January 10, 2009, Tetra Tech monitored particulate concentrations at nine additional locations. Five locations were in the immediate vicinity of the releas e on the Kingston Fossil Plant property (P1- P5), and five others were in surrounding residential areas near the release (P6, P7, P8, P8.2, and P9) (Tetra Tech 2009). From December 30 to 31, 2008, monito ring was performed using portable PM2.5 monitors. From January 1 to 10, 2009, Tetra Tech replaced the PM2.5 monitors with portable PM10 monitors to validate comparable data collected by TVA. During the entire twelve -day monitoring period, up to two particulate monitors were deployed each day. One air monitor was placed at a fixed location for a continuous monitoring period. The second air monitor was rotated to all nine monitoring locations throughout the day. Each location was monitored for approximately 10 minutes, and each location was monitored several times throughout the day. 2.3.7.2 Analytical Results Continuous air monitoring for total partic ulates at the fixe d location (P1) on- site from December 27 to 31, 2008, indicat ed the average total particulate concentrations were below the OSHA permissible exposure limit of 5.0 mg/kg for nuisance dust. Air monitoring with a port able particulate monito r equipped with a PM2.5 filter from December 30 to December 31, 2009, indicated particulate concentrations at locations on and off s ite (P2 to P9) were below the 24-hour average NAAQS for PM2.5 of 35 g/m\u00b3 and the WHO guideline of 25 g/m\u00b3. The concentrations ranged from 5 to 9.9 g/m\u00b3.

Monitoring was done with a particulat e monitor equipped with a PM10 filter from January 1 to 10, 2009. Results indi cated that the av erage particulate concentrations were below the NAAQS for PM10 of 150 g/m\u00b3. From January 5 to 8, 2009, and on January 10, 2009, work activities at this location caused instantaneous maximum particulat e concentrations to exceed 150 g/m\u00b3. However, the average particulate concentration based on a time-weighted average did not exceed the NAAQS for PM10 of 150 g/m\u00b3. The time- weighted average concentrati ons ranged from 6.1 to 55.6 g/m\u00b3. Only one measurement was above the WHO guidance for PM10 of 50 g/m\u00b3 as a 24- hour average. Tetra Tech performed air monitoring onsite (P2 - P5) with a portable monitor equipped with a PM10 filter from January 1 to 10, 2009. Average particulate concentrations were below the NAAQS for PM10 of 150 g/m3. The on-site average concentrations ranged from 7.5 to 76.2 g/m\u00b3. Tetra Tech performed air monitoring off- site (P6 - P9) with a portable monitor equipped with a PM10.0 filter from January 1 to 10, 2009. Average particulate concentrations were below the NAAQS for PM10 of 150 g/m 3. The off-site average concentrations ranged from 9.8 to 49.4 g/m3.

The TEOM and TSP are co-located wi th monitors at TVA location PS07. APC operates two monitors in Harriman, a PM2.5 TEOM installed in 2005 and a PM2.5 FRM installed in 1999. See Figures 9 and 10 for locations of monitoring activit ies. APC considers location PS07 to represent the location where the highest levels of particulate matter would consistently be found. APC is measuring the metals in total suspended particles (TSP). TSP refers to all particulates in air - those too large to be inhaled, those that can be inhaled but not respired, and respirable particle s. APC chose this method to ensure that they had enough particulate matter for accurate metals analyses. The level of respirable particles is lower than the levels of TSP. Because the metals are measured in all particulates (TSP), th e concentration of metals that are available for respiration (about 30 percen t of the ash) may be overstated in TDEC's sampling and analysis of TSP for metals. 2.3.8.2 TDEC Analytical Results TDEC began daily monitoring for PM10 and TSP on January 19, 2009, at PS07. Beryllium, cadmium, chromium, thallium, vanadium, and mercury were not detected in any samples ta ken from January 19, 2009, through April 19, 2009. Arsenic was detected in five of 16 samples. The samples taken on February 24 and April 19, 2009 were estimated to be 0.0025 g/m\u00b3 and 0.0029 g/m\u00b3, respectively. These concentrati ons were slightly above the health comparison value of 0.0023 g/m\u00b3. The other 3 samples were less than the health comparison value. Selenium was de tected at very low concentrations in eight of 16 samples at levels ranging from 0.001 to 0.0023 g/m\u00b3. The health comparison value is 20 g/m\u00b3. See Table 40 for deta ils. PM10 measurements were all below the NAAQS of 150 g/m\u00b3 and the WHO guideline for of 50 g/m\u00b3 as 24-hour averages from January 19 through May 31, 2009. PM2.5 measurements at the monitor at Harriman High School have been below the NAAQS of 35 g/m\u00b3 and have shown no effects from the coal ash release. 2.3.9 Toxicology of Breathing Metals and Their Health Comparison Values As discussed in the section on Health Comparison Values in the Discussion, EEP chose ATSDR or EPA health comparison values when they were available. Table h below presents health comparison values for metals in air. These values were used in this publ ic health assessment and by TDEC's APC TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation APC: Division of Air Pollution Control PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns TSP: Total suspended particles EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TEOM: Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance TISCH: a brand name Hi-Vol: a high volume ambient air sampler TVA: TN Valley Authority FRM: Federal Reference Method PM2.5: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 microns g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air NAAQS: National Ambient Air Quality Standards WHO: World Health Organization EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry Discussion: Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 54 (Bashor 2009) and were chosen to be pr otective of public health for airborne coal ash at the KIF ash site. Metals detected above their respective health comparison values in air and those comparison values needing explanation will be discussed in Appendix B.

Therefore, it is impo ssible to make definitive statements about the air quality near the coal ash release before December 27, 2009. The ambient temperature varied between a low of 12 \u00b0F on December 22, 2008, to a high of 66 \u00b0F on December 27, 2008. A trace amount of rain fell on December 23, 2008. Rain fell in the am ount of 0.45 inches on December 24 and on December 26, 2008, and 0.31 inches on December 28, 2008. The ash was wet when it spilled from the holding pond. Wet weather conditions on three days after the releas e would have kept the coal ash from drying out and getting into the air. Average wind speeds ranged from 0.4 to 3.7 miles per hour from December 22 through Decemb er 27, 2008. Raw data from the PM2.5 monitor at Harriman High School about two miles away did not show an increase in PM2.5 concentrations at the end of December 2008. The average PM2.5 concentration in Harriman was 8.9 g/m\u00b3 on December 2008, KIF: Kingston Fossil Plant g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry EMEG: ATSDR environmental media evaluation guide MRL: ATSDR minimal risk level PM2.5: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 microns PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns \u00b0F: degrees Fahrenheit Discussion: Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 55 with range of 4.1 to 16.9 g/m\u00b3.

The results will be discussed after the table. Table j. Air monitoring data summary. December 27 , 2008, through May 31, 2009. Kingston Fossil Plant, Roane County, Tennessee. Agency Date Type of Monitor Result TVA 12/31/2008 - 2/3/2009 PM2.5 at mobile laboratory Less than NAAQS for PM2.5 of 35 g/m\u00b3. PM2.5 was about 28 g/m\u00b3 on 1 day in January. All other measurements were < 25 g/m\u00b3. No detection of cadmium, chromium, or thallium. Arsenic detected once, lead detected 7 times, selenium detected 17 times out of 35 samples- all below health comparison values. Vanadium detected twice - no health comparison value. 12/31/2008 - 2/3/2009 PM10 at mobile laboratory No detection of cadmium, lead, thallium, or vanadium. Arsenic detected 3 times, at concentrations above health comparison values, but within the range found in ambient air in the U.S. Chromium detected 19 times, at concentrations above health comparison values in 14 of 19 samples, but within the range found in ambient air in the U.S. The health comparison value is based on hexavalent chromium; 13% of chromium in coal ash is hexavalent chromium. Selenium detected 4 times at levels below health comparison values. 1/1 - 3/10/2009 Temporary stationary total metals monitors at 5 locations. These samples represent total metals, not just respirable metals. Most samples had non-detectable metals, The detection limits for arsenic and chromium were above the health comparison values. The concentrations were within ranges found in U.S. air. Lead was detected 3 times at concentrations below the health comparison value. Cadmium was detected once at a concentration above the health comparison value. 2/12/2009 - May 13, 2009 5 Stationary FRM PM2.5 monitors All PM2.5 and PM10 were below PM10 on 2/18/09 was 53.1 g/m\u00b3 at PS09. All others were below 50.0 g/m\u00b3. All PM2.5 were below 25 g/m\u00b3. Samples were analyzed for arsenic and thallium. All arsenic and thallium analyses showed no detections or were not analyzed for. The detection limit for arsenic was above the health comparison value, but within the ranges found in U.S. air. 12/28/2008 - Present Portable real-time PM10 monitors 47,908 samples above 150 g/m\u00b3. g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air PM2.5: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 microns NAAQS: National Ambient Air Quality Standards PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns FRM: Federal Reference Method Discussion: Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 56 All measurements for PM2.5 and PM10 at the mobile laboratory, from TVA's temporary stationary monitors, from TVA's stationary long-term monitors, and from TDEC's monitors at sampling station 7 are well within the NAAQS for PM2.5 and PM10, as well as belo w the WHO guideline. Only one measurement of PM10 by TVA at one location was above the WHO guideline of 50 g/m\u00b3. Research into the chemical a nd toxicological nature of coal fly ash indicates that the ash can be co nsidered a nuisance dust (Meij and te Winkel 2001; Meij 2000). The ash does not appear to have greater potency to cause pulmonary effects than those of ot her ambient particulates (Smith et al. 2006). PM2.5 is respirable and can reach deep into the lungs. No metals were detected in TVA's PM2.5 analyses for metals from December 31, 2008, through February 3, 2009, at the mobile laboratory site. EEP did not have exact detection limits for PM2.5 metals an alyses at the mobile laboratory, but they were below 0.005 g/m\u00b3 for arsenic and chromium. No arsenic or Table j continued.

Arsenic was detected in 5 samples. Concentrations in 3 samples were less than the health comparison value of 0.0023 g/m\u00b3. Two samples were detected at 0.0025 and 0.0029 g/m\u00b3, slightly above the health comparison value.

TVA's metals analysis results in samp les from the mobile laboratory site showed some detectable levels of metals in PM10. Arsenic was detected three times out of 35 samples between December 31, 2008, and February 3, 2009, at levels slightly above the h ealth comparison value of 0.0023 g/m\u00b3, but within the range found in the U.S (0.00022 g/m\u00b3 to 0.011 g/m\u00b3). No arsenic was detected in PM10 samples from TVA' s stationary long-term monitors. TDEC's analyses for arsenic in PM10 dete cted arsenic in three samples. Only one of these samples was slightly over the health comparison value. In PM10 samples collected at TVA' s mobile laboratory, chromium was detected at levels above the health comparison value of 0.001 g/m\u00b3 to 0.003 g/m\u00b3 in 14 of 19 samples. The average concentration was on ly slightly above the health comparison value and wa s within the range found at sites throughout the U.S. that mon itor for metals in air (0.00036 g/m\u00b3 to 0.011 g/m\u00b3, with a weighted average of 0.0023 g/m\u00b3). The maximum concentration detected was 0.01 g/m\u00b3, representing total chromium. Hexavalent chromium is much more t oxic than trivalent chromium, and the health comparison value is based on hexa valent chromium toxicity. The coal ash at KIF contains approximately 13% hexavalent chromium. The maximum concentration of total chromium wo uld be equivalent to a maximum concentration of 0.0003 g/m\u00b3 of hexavalent chromium. APC had not detected chromium in any of its TSP samples as of April 1, 2009. Between June 6 and August 17, 2009, APC detected chromium in seven samples, all at levels less than the health comparison value. TVA's mobile laboratory was on TVA property immediately adjacent to active di sturbance of the released ash, while APC's TSP samples were collected at sampling site PS07 in the community. Selenium was detected by TVA in PM 2.5 and PM10 samples at the mobile laboratory site and by TDEC in eight of 16 TSP samples. All measurements were well below the health comparison value of 20 g/m\u00b3. TVA measured total metals in their samples from their temporary stationary monitors. They detected lead in th ree of 69 samples, all below the NAAQS limit of 0.15 g/m\u00b3. Cadmium was detected in one sample, at a level above the health comparison value of 0.0056 g/m\u00b3. The detection limits for arsenic and chromium were above the health comparison values. The actual concentrations of arsenic and chromium could have been greater than their health comparison values. These samples were for total metals, not just metals in PM2.5 or PM10. Although some metals were detected in some samples, the overall results indicate that metals in ai rborne ash should not advers ely affect public health. This reinforces the statements in the peer -reviewed literature that indicate that coal fly ash is a nuisance dust (Meij and te Winkel 2001; Meij 2000; Smith et al. 2006).

For measurements greater than 100 g/m\u00b3, EEP analyzed and mapped results of real- time measurements. Notations in the comments section of the spreadsheets gave some insight into the cause of the higher real-time measurements. Of the 47,908 measurements from January 2 through May 31, 2009, 216 samples measured greater than or equal to 100 g/m\u00b3 as of May 31, 2009, (0.45% of the to tal measurements). Of these, 47 (22%) had no dust or odor to explain the cause of the higher readings. Table k below summarizes the data by presumed cause of the higher PM10 readings. Table k. Notations for real-time PM10 measurement that were equal to or greater than 100 g/m\u00b3. Kingston Fossil Plant, Roane County, Tennessee. January 2, 2009, through March 31, 2009.

The increased PM10 real-time measurements appear to be due to a number of sources . It is unlikely that the increased PM10 measurements are due to airborne coal fly ash. However, 22% of the increased PM10 measurements had no obvious cause. Monitors surrounding the coal ash release indicate that air qu ality was and is meeting all particulate standards. 2.3.10.3 Dust Although PM10, PM2.5, and metals analysis indicate that air is meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards, there was more than 5 million cubic yards of coal ash filling the Emory River and inlets near homes. TVA has implemented dust suppression activitie s, including washing wheels and underbodies of vehicles leaving the site of the ash release, vacuuming local roads, and using water trucks to we t both on-site roads and adjacent public highways. TVA spread grass seed, fer tilizer, and straw over the centralized areas of displaced ash via an aerial, he licopter application within a couple of PM2.5: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 microns PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns FRM: Federal Reference Method TEOM: Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance WHO: World Health Organization EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program CTEH: Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health, a contractor for TVA g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air NAAQS: National Ambient Air Quality Standards Discussion: Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 59 weeks of the spill, but cold weather prevented germination of the winter rye grass seed. After evaluating several products, in February and March, 2009, TVA began using a liquid dust suppression agent called Flexterra flexible growth medium to cover the remainin g, undisturbed portion of the ash dredge cell and other exposed areas. Spraying of Flexterra will continue as necessary to suppress dust. This product has proven to be very effective in controlling fugitive dust emissions. In addition, during the growing season grass seed is added to the mixture, providing a longe r-term vegetative cover. Flexterra consists of green dyed wood fiber, synthe tic fibers, and a proprietary binder. The Material Safety Data Sheet can be found at URL: http://www.profileproducts.com/ erosion_control/item/browse-2-8 . The rainfall in the Harriman area has been greater than average, helping to keep the ash wet. For 2009, 69.77 inches of rain was recorded at the Kingston MRX station 404871, compared to the averag e yearly rainfall in Kingston of 53.23 inches (http://www.nc-climate.ncsu.edu/cronos/ ). For areas of ash that will remain undi sturbed for longer periods of time, TVA plans to apply either Flexterra or er osion control mulch as needed. When weather conditions optimize, TVA will fu rther seed and fertilize if it becomes necessary. A stepped wall on the nort hern portion borders the remaining, undisturbed portion of the ash dredge cell. TVA plans to excavate the stepped wall and construct a flatter (~3:1) slope of ash in its place. This slope will be treated with the erosion control mulch. These dust control measures will be carried out as needed. To rebuild destroyed roads and to build dikes to contain the ash in the river, activity at the local quarry has increased dramatically. Frequently, trucks pass by homes carrying stone to the site and returning to the quarry. TDH, TDEC, and TVA have received complaints about dust on Quarry Road and on other routes that the quarry trucks travel. While TVA has implemented dust control measures along the roads, such as usi ng a combination of water trucks and sweeper/vacuum trucks to minimize dusti ng on the roads, dust still seems to present a problem for homeowners along th e truck route. TDEC continues to work with the quarry owners and the truck owners to implement further dust suppression measures. See the section, Community Concerns, for more discussion of this topic.TVA: TN Valley Authority TDH: Tennessee Department of Health TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation Discussion: Radiation Exposure Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 60 2.4 Radiation Exposure EEP asked for assistance from ATSDR on ra diological issues. They responded with a technical assistance document. The text below is taken from that document (ATSDR 2009). According to the TVA (TVA 2009), the Kingston Fossil Plant burns about 14,000 tons of coal per day to gene rate about 10 bill ion kilowatt-hours annually. For this production, coal is burned at high temperatures, approaching 1700\u00b0C, and the majority of the minerals in the coal are fused in an ash with glass-like properties. In cluded in these typical as h compounds are naturally occurring radioactive materials that are pr esent in the coal. A small amount of minerals and the organic components ar e consumed during the burn (Stranden 1997, Zielinski 1998). At the Kingston location, the resu lting ashes and sludges are stored on site in containment areas. Coal ash contains both metals and na turally occurring radioactive elements. Although the actual composition of the co al and its combustion materials may be dependent on the place of origin, co al typically contains aluminum, silicon, boron, arsenic, selenium, iron, molybde num, cadmium, Vengosh 2009, Gabbard 2009) . The radioactive substances typically include the naturally occurring uranium isotopes and their associated decay products including radium 226 (226Ra) and naturally occurring thorium and its decay products including radium 228 (228Ra). Of these radionuclides, those with the greatest potential of human impact are the radium isotopes radium 226 and radium 228. Both uranium and thorium have extremely long half-lives. As they transform into their respective decay products, those products also undergo decay. The decay pr oduct activity increases over time as the uranium or thorium decay until the activities of the decay products equal the activity of the uranium or thorium. This is ca lled secular equilibrium. Some radioactive isotopes can be difficu lt to measure because of interference from other non-related radioactive isot opes. For example, both Radium 226 and Radium 228 fall into this category. Secular equilibrium, however, allows for alternate methods to be used to identify thes e radioisotopes 9. The data supplied to ATSDR by the TD EC included a sampling report from Duke University (Vengosh 2009). Duke analyzed three ash samples identified as TVA A, TVA B, and TVA C from the spill area. These data are given in Table 41. The results show that the concentration of both radium 226 and radium 228 are essentially identical in the three TVA ash samples. One can also compare the Duke studies to other reports of radioactivity in coal ash. In a study of coal ash from coal plants in Germany, the concentrations of 9 The concentration of Ra 226 can be determined by the concentration lead 214 (Pb 214). In a similar manner, the concentration of Radium 228 can be ascertained by the concentration of its decay pr oduct actinium 228 (Ac 228). EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry TVA: TN Valley Authority 226Ra: radium with an atomic weight of 226 and containing 88 protons and 138 neutrons 228Ra: radium with an atomic weight of 228 and containing 88 protons and 140 neutrons TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation Discussion: Radiation Exposure Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 61 radium 226 and radium 228 were 6.5 pCi/g and 3.5 pCi/g, respectively (Stranden 1985). A similar study of coal ash from a Kentucky coal plant, as reported by Zielinski and Budahn, had an average radium 226 concentration of approximately 4.7 pCi/g; whereas, the aver age concentration of radium 228 was approximately 3.4 pCi/g2. Therefore, th e Duke results are similar to other internationally reported levels of radionuclides in coal ash. TDEC collected 10 ash samples and 13 soil samples from impacted properties. Two additional samples were collected from a nearby landfill. They also collected two background soil samples at a local park about six miles from downtown Kingston and at an embayment of Caney Creek, a tributary to the Tennessee River. All samples were colle cted in January 2009 and analyzed for radium 226 and radium 228 via decay products. The decay products measured by the TDEC, although different from t hose used by Duke University, are based on the same principle, that is, s ecular equilibrium. TDEC measured both lead 214 ( 214Pb) and bismuth 214 (214Bi) for radium 226. For they actinium (228Ac), 212 (212Pb), thallium 208 (208Tl), The results of these anal yses by TDEC are shown in Table 42. ATSDR compared the results from both the TDEC and Duke University using a t-test with unequal variances. This test is used commonly to determine if the average of two groups of data are significantly different. The result of this analysis showed there was no significant difference between the two sets of data. That is, the data collected by the state as compared to the data collected by Duke University are essentially identical. To evaluate whether the radium radi oactivity is a public health concern, ATSDR uses regulatory limits that were originally developed for uranium mill tailing sites (40 CFR 192) as screening values. Thes e regulations require that the radioactivity concentration of Radi um 226 in the top 5 centimeters of soil should not exceed 5 pCi/g above bac kground. EPA's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response has also adopted a similar directive (i.e., 5 pCi/g above background), but their limit is ba sed upon the combined Ra 226 and Ra 228 radioactivity concentra tion or \"total radium.\" The estimated total radium in the TD EC samples is approximately 3.2 pCi/g above background. The Duke University results indicate an average total radium concentration of about 7 pCi/g. After correcting for background levels (using Tennessee background data) and taking into account the potential loss of radon gas 10, the Duke University value is about 4.3 pCi/g above background. Therefore, the radium in the environm ent resulting from the ash spill do not exceed a health based criteria of 5 pCi/g. Naturally occurring radioactive material pr esent in the coal fly ash was released to the surrounding environment following the failure of the TVA containment 10 When radium decays, it form s radon gas that can escape from the soil. The radon that does not escape, decays to particulates that remain in the soil. The radon escape from coal is not si gnificant because of the coal matrix. pCi/g: picocuries per gram TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation 214Pb: lead with an atomic number of 214 and containing 82 protons and 132 neutrons 214Bi: bismuth with an atomic weight of 214 and containing 80 protons and 134 neutrons 228Ac: actinium with an atomic weight of 228 and containing 89 protons and 138 neutrons 212Pb: lead with an atomic weight of 212 and containing 82 protons and 130 neutrons 208Tl: thallium with an atomic weight of 208 and containing 81 protons and 127 neutrons 212 Bi: bismuth with an atomic weight of 212 and containing 80 protons and 132 neutrons ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TVA: TN Valley Authority Discussion: Radiation Exposure Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 62 structure. The radioactive materials of concern include both radium 226 and radium 228. Although the concentration of these materials exceed the average background concentrations, the levels are below the health-based directive of 5 pCi/g above background in the top 5 centimeters as used both by EPA and ATSDR. This directive was set to ensu re the exposure to gamma radiation did not exceed the background ambient radiat ion by more than 20 microroentgens11 per hour. EEP appreciates the technical assistance of ATSDR's health physicists in the investigation of the radi ological properties of th e coal ash. Based on the evaluation of the available data that show levels of radioactivity are below the health-based limits and a review of existing Federal regulations, ATSDR concludes that the concentra tion of radioactive material in the coal ash is not expected to harm people's health in the area of the coal ash release. 11 The roentgen is a unit used to measure exposure. This can only be used for gamma radiation and X-rays in air. A microroentgen is one millionth of a roentgen. pCi/g: picocuries per gram EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program Discussion: Summary of Public Health Implications Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 63 2.5 Summary of Public Health Implications TVA, EPA, and TDEC have all taken e nvironmental samples for a variety of reasons. All agencies sampled the ash to find out what is in it. They did TCLP analysis to make sure it was not a h azardous waste as defined by EPA. TDEC sampled the municipal drinking water from the Kingston and Rockwood Water Treatment Plants every day, and they continue to sample every week. TDEC samples the river water going into th e plants and the water going out for distribution to customers to make sure th at the water is not affected by the coal ash. EPA and TDEC sampled well water and spring water to find out if the metals in the coal ash had gotten into the groundwater. TDEC will continue to take samples of the groundwater. TVA, EPA, and TDEC have done exhaustive sampling of the Emory, Clinch, and Tenne ssee Rivers to find out how the coal ash is affecting the Watts Bar Reservoir. They continue to sample the rivers. TVA, EPA, and TDEC have sampled the air for PM10, PM2.5, and metals in the air at monitors surrounding the coal ash release. TVA and TDEC continue to take air samples. TVA continues to take daily instantaneous air readings at many locations in the wider community. Based on the sampling results by all agencies, TDH is confident that: No harm to health should have occu rred from touching the coal ash. People had an opportunity to be expo sed to the coal ash for about one month before TVA either relocated families or fenced off the coal ash. Longer-term contact would be necessar y to cause any significant local skin irritation, such as coal ash th at has gotten under a bandage. Casual contact with coal ash sh ould not cause skin irritation. In addition, the metals in the coal ash are not likely to get into people's bodies from touching the ash. Although arsenic was found at concentrations above health comparison values for chronic exposure to ch ildren, no harm is expected from a child accidentally eating the coal as h. Chronic health effects from exposure to arsenic require exposures more long term than the type of exposure experienced in th is setting. The period of exposure to the coal ash was very short. Small childre n had little opportunity for direct contact with the coal ash because of the cold, wet weather and the fencing of the ash to prevent contact, as well as the diligence of parents in keeping their children away fr om the coal ash. The exposure frequency and exposure duration were not long enough to cause harm to the health of children or adults. Except in the immediate vicinity of the coal ash release, the coal ash or the metals in the coal ash have not affected surface water in the Watts Bar Reservoir. TVA and TDEC have an advisory for use of the Emory River in the area near the coal as h release. The Army Corps of Engineers and the Coast Guard are pa trolling this area to prevent any harm to people. The Emory River from mile marker 1.5 to mile marker 3 is closed to river tra ffic until February 15, 2010.

TDEC is continuing to monitor the drinking water. Private well and spring water within 4 miles of the coal ash release have not shown any contamination from the coal ash. TDEC will continue to take periodic samples of priv ate well water in the area. Concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 ha ve consistently been below EPA regulatory limits since air samp ling began on December 31, 2008. Metals in air have consistently been within background levels of metals in the U.S. or below any health comparison values. EEP could not determine whether br eathing dust near the quarry and along the routes of the quarry trucks has or will harm people's health. Concentrations of radionuclides are below the regulatory limits for concentrations of radionuclides in air and water that are protective of public health. The only way people could have been e xposed to the coal ash from late December 2008 through the middle of January 2009 was through direct contact with the coal ash or by accidentally eating some of the coal ash. The airborne coal ash could affect peopl e exposed to higher concentrations of particulate matter, especi ally those with pre-exis ting respiratory or heart conditions. Such effects could include upper airway irritation and aggravation of pre-existing conditions such as as thma, emphysema, and other respiratory conditions. TVA, EPA, and TDEC are working to make sure that does not happen. Examples of measures that TVA is taking include: Applying Flexterra/hydroseed to coal ash where activity is not occurring Spraying of water on coal ash where activity is occurring Washing of cars leaving the site Establishing a central drop off point fo r delivery of materials that is off site.TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation PM10: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 microns PM2.5: particles in air with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 microns EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program TVA: TN Valley Authority Discussion: NGO Response Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 65 2.6 Non-Governmental Organizations' Response to the Coal Ash Release EEP relies on other government agencies and their contractors for most data. EEP is not limited in which data it can use. If data are available, we will try to use them. However, since we are maki ng decisions about pub lic health, it is imperative that we understand: where th e data came from; how samples were collected; how samples were protected; and the quality assu rance and quality control measures taken when samples were collected and when the samples were analyzed. EEP is aware of environmental sampli ng and analysis efforts by the following non-governmental organizations: Duke University United Mountain Defense (UMD) and the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) Appalachian State University (ASU ), Appalachian Voices, and the Waterkeeper Alliance's Upper Watauga Riverkeeper Program Appalachian State University, Appalachian Voices, and the Tennessee Aquarium Each of these non-governmental da ta sets will be discussed. 2.6.1 Duke University Staff and students at Duke Universi ty, led by Dr. Avner Vengosh, collected sixteen surface water samples on Janua ry 9-10, 2009, from four upstream river locations, four locations in the \"cove\", and eight downstream river locations. They also collected four groundwater sa mples and three solid ash samples. The water samples were analyzed for 21 inorganics, as well as for general chemistry. The solid ash samples were analyzed for radionuclides. The data were accepted for publication on April 17, 2009, by the journal, Environmental Science and Technology, and published online on May 4 as an article that needed immediate release (Ruhl et al . 2009). Water sampling followed U.S. Geological Survey protocol. The Division of Earth and Ocean Sciences laboratory at Duke University conducte d the analyses. Inorganic elemental concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) on a VG Plasmaquad 3 at the Division of Earth and Ocean Sciences at Duke Universit y. No information was given on the procedures for determining leachability of metals from the coal ash. Not enough information was provided in the report to determ ine whether the analytical methods conform to EPA standard methodology. Further, no information on quality assurance or qual ity control procedures was provided in the report. The report by Ruhl et.al stated that, \" Results show that th e tributary that was dammed by the coal ash spill and turned into a standing pond (\"the Cove\" in the area of Swan Pond Circle Road) has relatively high levels of leachable EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program UMD: United Mountain Defense EIP: Environmental Integrity Project ASU: Appalachian State University EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Discussion: NGO Response Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 66 coal ash contaminants (LCAC), includ ing arsenic, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, strontium, manganese, lithium, and boron. Some of these elements are highly enriched in coals, and are known to be highly soluble in aquatic systems. Among the LCACs, arsenic stands out with concentration of up to 86 g/L in the Cove area.\" Sampling by EPA, TVA, and TDEC confirm that the coal ash contains higher than background levels of arsenic and that arsenic was elevated near the coal ash release in the month after the coal ash release. In a February 5, 2009, meeting held by TDEC with Dr. Vengosh, TDH, and EPA, Dr. Vengosh explained that he used a research procedure that us ed hydrofluoric acid for leachability rather than the EPA sta ndard method that has proven to be accurate and reliable. TCLP analyses of ash by governmental agencies indicated that very little leaching oc curred when the ash was analyzed by standard EPA TCLP methods. Thes e methods are the only acceptable procedure for TCLP analysis for environmental regulatory agencies. The research method for leachability will cause more metals to go into solution than would happen in natural water system s. It appears that the analyses as reported used non-standard methodology fo r leaching of metals and that the definition of what constitutes leachabili ty is inconsistent with normal EPA usage of the word. Radiological data from the report (Ruhl et al. 2009) were discussed in the section above, Radiation Exposure. The radiological data fo r coal ash in the Duke University report are essentially th e same as data measurements of coal ash taken by TDEC. The report by Ruhl et al. expresses c oncern that wind-blown resuspension of fly ash could pose a threat to human health. TDEC and TDH agree that the particulate matter in airborne ash co uld harm people's health if it became airborne. TDH does not believe that me tals in the fly would cause harm to people's health; however, TDEC and T VA continue to measure metals in particulate matter to make sure that public health is protected. Controls have been put into place to prevent resuspensi on of ash particles. In addition, air monitors surrounding the coal ash release are in place, measuring PM2.5, PM10, and metals content of PM10 and TSP. 2.6.2 Appalachian State University, Appalachian Voices, the Tennessee Aquarium, and Wake Forest University ASU, Appalachian Voices, and the Te nnessee Aquarium jointly collected water, sediment, and fish samples from seven locations in the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers on January 8-9, 2009. The surface water samples were analyzed for 17 heavy metals (total and dissolved). ASU's laboratory conducted the analyses, following st andard EPA methodology for sampling and analysis and for qual ity assurance and quality control procedures. The sampling, analysis, and results are deta iled in a Preliminary Summary Report (Babyak et al. 2009).

Total metals analysis for arsenic, barium, cadmium, lead, and selenium showed that levels at Emory River mile 2.2 (at the coal ash release site) were elevated when compared to water quality standards. Arsenic, barium, and cadmium were above MCLs. Lead was above the action level for drinking water, and selenium was above the Tennessee Water Quality Criteria for fish and aquatic life (continuous con centration), but below the MCL. Other sampling sites did not show any elevations of total metals. Dissolved metals were not elevated in any samples. These results generally agree with the results of TVA, EPA, TDEC, and Duke University sampling and analysis for th e Emory River at th e site of the ash release and in upstream and downstream locations. The preliminary report emphasizes elevat ed selenium concentrations in river sediment and harm to fish. Environm ental regulatory agencies are concerned with the health of the ecosystems and fish in the Emory River. The EPA Science Review Panel and the US Army Corps of Engineers have generated two reports on selenium impacts at th e coal ash release site (EPA 2009e; ACOE 2009). However, as stated earlie r, this public health assessment will focus only on human health. Because no one was drinking this water or using this water for recreation, there were no public health concerns at th at time. According to sampling and analysis by TDEC, the arsenic concentr ations have remained below MCLs since May 28, 2009, and the barium, cadmium, lead, and selenium concentrations have never exceeded MCLs or Water Quality Criteria at the site of the spill and most arse nic concentrations have b een below detection limits. 2.6.3 United Mountain Defense and the Environmental Integrity Project UMD and EIP collected 24 river water sa mples from 23 locations on December 30-31, 2008, and on January 4, 2009. The locations consisted of 14 surface water samples from the Emory and Clinch Rivers, five residential well samples, one pond sample, and three upriver surface water samples. The water samples were analyzed for 30 (total) me tals commonly found in coal ash as well as general chemistry. UMD/EIP reported that the sampling followed required EPA methods and procedures and the analyses were conducted by EPA-certified laboratories. The labor atory for UMD / EIP used EPA method SW-846 6010B to measure total metals , which is appropriate. Standard analytical quality assurance and quality control procedures were followed. UMD and EIP also collected solid samp les; however, no information about the sample collection and analyt ical methods were available for the solid samples collected. The report on the UMD website only lis ted those samples which had metals concentrations greater than MCLs. Th e raw data are, also, available on the MCL: maximum contaminant level TVA: TN Valley Authority EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation UMD: United Mountain Defense EIP: Environmental Integrity Project TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation Discussion: NGO Response Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 68 UMD website.

UMD's and EIP's 14 river surface water samples were collected from the Emory and Clinch Rivers or inlets feeding those rivers in the coal ash release- impacted area or downstream of the release. UMD's and EIP's sampling results appear consistent with the EPA and TDEC sampling and analysis that found arsenic in the ash and in the 'sludge'. Results, al so, confirm that the coal ash has not affected groundwater. TDEC did not detect any levels of arsenic above 10 g/L in the Clinch River. They detected elevated arsenic in the Emory River only at miles 1.7 and 2.1, in the area of the coal ash release. UMD/EIP detected the highest concentrations in 'ash pore water'. The U.S. Geol ogical Survey define s pore water as the water filling the spaces between grains of sediment. EEP is unsure how UMD/EIP took the samples. g/L: microgram per liter. 1000 g are in 1 milligram MCL: maximum contaminant level UMD: United Mountain Defense EIP: Environmental Integrity Project EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program Discussion: NGO Response Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 69 Because no one was drinking this water or using this water for recreation, there were no public health concerns at that tim e. In addition, the Emory River at the site of the coal ash release was closed for river traffic and recreation. 2.6.4 Appalachian State University an d the Waterkeeper Alliance's Upper Watauga Riverkeeper Program ASU, Appalachian Voices, terkeeper Alliance's Upper Watauga Riverkeeper Program (WAUWRP) jointl y collected three water and one sediment sample from the Emory River on December 27, 2008. They reported that standard EPA methods were used to collect and analyze each field sample in triplicate for 17 heavy metals. The Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry laboratories at ASU conducted th e analyses. The preliminary results were publicly available from UMD's website (ASU - WAUWRP 2009). There is no report accompanying the data, and details of sampling and analysis are not included. EEP could not determine if the results of analysis of water samples were for total metals or for dissolved metals, although EEP assumed that the results are for total metals. Average arsenic co ncentration at the barge boom 0.51 miles downstream of the site of the coal ash release was reporte d as 3.062 mg/L (or 3,062 g/L). This concentration is many times the arsenic concentration found by TVA and TDEC. The site of the coal ash release is ar ound mile 2 of the Emory River. TVA detected total arsenic above the drinking water limit in the Emory River at miles 1.75 and 2.1 the day of the ash releas e and one day in early January, at concentrations less than 80 g/L on those days. On other days, concentrations of total arsenic were below the drinking water limit of 10 g/L at these locations. EPA detected an estimated c oncentration of 208 mg/L of arsenic at Emory River mile 1.9 and a concentration of 1,490 g/L of arsenic on December 23, 2008. TDEC detected arse nic in the Emory River above the drinking water limit of 10 g/L on a few occasions. TDEC's analysis showed that arsenic concentrations ranged from non-detectable concentrations to a high of 43 g/L near the coal ash release site. These results are not surprising for samples at the site of the coal ash release. Because no one is drinking this water or using this water for recreation, there are no public health concerns at this tim e. In addition, the Emory River at the site of the coal ash release is clos ed for river traffic and recreation. Waterkeeper Alliances took water samples in the \"ash berg\" zone, with very high turbidity. Emergency operations were ongoing at the time of their sampling event and may have stirred up the ash in the area where samples were taken. This might account for much of the difference between TDEC and Waterkeeper Alliances results.

Environmental health concerns associated with the spill prompted TDH to initiate steps for a community-based assessment. TDH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) performed an EpiAid, the field phase of a community health survey, interviewing community members residing in the area of the ash release. TDH designe d the questionnaire for use in this emergency response situation. TDH identified households within an approximate 1.5 mile radius of the coal ash spill. The 1.5 mile radius around the release encompassed all the reside nts who would routinely travel on the affected roads. Each accessible house within this geographic area was approached by a team and invited to part icipate in the voluntary survey. Using a standardized questionnaire , participating adult reside nts and parents of child residents were interviewed. Fact sheets about exposure and protecting themselves from ash and TDH contact information sheets inviting assessment participation were left at each unoccupi ed house. Follow-up visits and phone interviews were scheduled to accommodate participant needs. From January 8-13, 2009, teams of two to three public health staff visited 324 residences within a 1.5 mile radius of the spill. Staff interviewed 368 participants representing 170 households. Results are summarized in Table m below. The most noticeable finding was that 52% of people re ported stress and anxiety after the coal ash release. Most people (60%) did not report any change in health status since the coal ash release. Twenty-seven percent of respondents reported worsening of cough, 25% worsening of headaches, 14 % reported worsening of wheezing, and 14% reported shortness of breath.

A geographic information system integrates hardware, software, and data for capturing, managing, analyzing, and displaying all forms of geographically related information. ArcGIS is a group of geographical informa tion system software that is used for mapping and statistical analysis of da ta that are geogra phically related. See Tables n and o below for significan t and non-significan t results of the spatial autocorrelation results. Spatial autocorrelation and the Global Moran's I is based on the concept that everythi ng is related to everything else, but nearby things are more related than far away things. It indicates whether particular values are likely to occur in one location or are equally likely to occur in any location. EEP used the Ho t Spot analysis tool in ArcGIS to identify the location of clusters. It is important to note, however, that EEP was Discussion: Community Health Survey Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 72 EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program ArcGIS: ArcGIS is a group of geographical information system software used for mapping and statistical analysis of data that is geographically related dealing with very small numbers (less than 30 in each polygon). Very small numbers make any statistical analyses less reliable. A value for Moran's I that is close to zero m eans that the distributi on is random, with no apparent pattern. A value for I that is positive means that similar values are clustered. A value for I that is close to +1 indicates complete clus tering. A value for I that is negative means similar values are dispersed. A value of I that is close to -1 indicates complete dispersion. At a confidence level of 0.05 (95%), a Z-score le ss than -1.96 or greater than +1.96 indicates a statistically significant result. A Z-score in between -1.96 and +1.96, indicates a statistically non-significant result. Table n. Statistically significant clustering of sympto ms, community health survey results.

These results indicate that, for anxiety and stress and for vomiting, the after scores are highly significant. The result for shortness of breath is statistically significant. Further evalua tion would be needed to de termine if the result for shortness of breath were clinically significant. EEP investigated whether the 'afte r' symptoms had different spatial distributions than the 'before' symp toms using a Directional Distribution (Standard Ellipse) tool in ArcGIS. This tool allowed EEP to create what are called standard ellipses, which show th e distribution of symptoms as well as Discussion: Community Health Survey Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 73 whether there is a directional trend or orientation in that distribution. This tool can be used to compare distributions (in this case, symptoms), examine dist ributions from different time periods, and show the compactness and orientation of distributions. If distributions closely resemble a circle, then there is not a strong orientation to the occurrence of the symptom. A large circle means the cases are widespread wh ereas a small circle means the cases are more localized (concentrated). The orie ntation of the circle/eclipse indi cates the direction in which the cases are occurring. See Appendix C for more details about spatial analysis methodology. Anxiety was clustered after the ash release; no qu estions were asked about anxiety before the ash release. Hot spots for anxiety occurred on the no rthwest side of the ash release area where there was much property damage. Anxi ety and stress were tightly orie nted around areas that were directly affected by the coal ash release, wher e the road was destroyed and where boats and boat docks were damaged or destroyed. Shortness of breath was more localized after the ash release, alt hough it was still rather widespread. Shortness of breat h was clustered, with less than a 1% likelihood pattern due to chance. Hot spots for shortness of breath occurre d along the southwest / nort heast axis of the ash release area. The orientation of symptoms of shortness of breath changed somewhat after the coal ash release, moving closer to the spill. Ho wever, the shortness of breath was not strongly related to location and was st ill rather widespread. Vomiting was more localized after the ash release and was clustered, with less than a 1% likelihood pattern due to chance. Hot spots for vo miting occurred in a very tight cluster to the northwest of the spill. Because of the tight clustering, vomiting could ha ve been a result of a viral outbreak, which is common in winter, rath er than a result of the ash release. Discussion: Physician Education Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 74 2.8 Physician Education In response to the TVA Kingston coal ash release and following the community health assessment, TDH hosted an info rmational meeting for local physicians and other healthcare provid ers. Invitations were se nt by fax to approximately 100 medical practices and clinics. This repres ented over 250 healthcare providers from Roane County and the su rrounding area. Three meetings were conducted on January 21 and 22, 2009. Pr esentations were given by the Deputy State Epidemiologist of TDH and an E nvironmental Epidemiologist of EEP. Information covered included: Environmental testing plan and test results Exposure routes and risks a ssociated with coal ash Syndromic surveillance results Community health survey Recommendations that testing of people was not necessary Public health recommendations Contact information for medical toxicologists. Attendees comprised a cross section of medical expertise. The following specialties and organizations were represented: Roane County Family Practices Individual General Practices Individual Internal Medicine Practices Roane Eye Center Kingston Family Practice Cumberland Neurology Group Oak Ridge Pediatric Clinic Chiropractic Health Center Roane County Medical Center in cluding Chief Executive Officer, Directors of Nursing, Laboratory, Respiratory Care, Pathology, and Infection Control Roane County Public Health East Tennessee Regional Health Office Roane County Emergency Medical Staff Roane County Emergency Management Agency Providers were urged to report any co al ash exposures or disease they considered associated with the coal ash release to TDH. 2.8.1 Follow up Because TDH had received no reports of illness associated with the coal ash from healthcare providers, follow-up visits were done on March 17 and 18, 2009. The Deputy State Epidemiologist in terviewed 24 healthcare providers in and around Roane County. The interviews included pediatric and family TVA: TN Valley Authority TDH: Tennessee Department of Health EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program Discussion: Physician Education Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Re lease 75 practice groups, emergency departments, and pu lmonologists. No medical provider reported any illnesses that they could attribute to exposure to coal ash. Many medical providers reported they had seen a few patients with respiratory symptoms who were concerned that the symptoms might be related to the coal ash. Most medical prov iders commented that they could not determine if the symptoms were the result of infection, allergies, dust, or some combination. One physician, who lives in the affected area, said, \"peopl e have not stopped coughing since the spill\" and expressed concern. Several provi ders had patients who asked for heavy metal screening. Some of the providers reassured patients about the low risk of exposure and the patients decided not to proceed with heavy metal screening. Some heal thcare providers ordered heavy metal screening; none of these medical providers reported any positive heavy metal screens. Discussion: Community Concerns Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Relea se 76 2.9 Community Concerns 2.9.1 TVA Community Involvement Center TVA set up a Community Involvement Cent er in Kingston. People can go to the center in person or can telephone with any concerns about the ash release. As of June 22, 2009, 213 households had regi stered in writing at the center. TDH has also received calls from citi zens concerned about the ash release. Many of the same people called the T VA Community Involvement Center and TDH with the same comments. Of th ese contacts, 36% had general health questions or concerns, 38% had respiratory complaints, 5% had complaints about rashes and itching, 7% had compla ints about headaches and migraines, and 5% had other health issues. Resp iratory complaints included complaints about colds, sinus conditions, c ongestion, cough, nosebleeds, asthma, emphysema, respiratory allergies, and chronic obstructive pu lmonary disease. Some contacts were concerned about the air, water, or recreation. Of these contacts, 13% were concerned about the ai r, 6% were concerned with wells or springs, 10% were concerned about muni cipal water, and 15% were concerned about recreational use of the water. There were other non-health related reasons for why people c ontacted the Center. These complaints were mapped in an atte mpt to determine if there was a pattern that suggested any particul ar exposure. See Figure 15 for a map of community concerns. EEP used a Directional Distribution (Standa rd Ellipse) tool in ArcGIS to see if the complaints about dust and resp iratory symptoms and real-time air measurements greater than 150 g/m\u00b3 were related to th e truck routes. This tool allowed EEP to create what are called standard ellipses, which show the distribution of features as well as wh ether there is a directional trend or orientation in that distribu tion. This tool can be used to compare distributions, examine distributions from different time periods, and show compactness and orientation of distributions. If distributions closely re semble a circle, then there is not a strong orientation to the occurre nce of the variable. A large circle means the variables are widespread whereas a small circle means the variables are more localized (concentrated). The orientation of the ellipse indicates the direction in which the ca ses are occurring. See Figur e 16 for the results and Appendix C for more details about the methodology. Respiratory concerns were much more wi despread as indicated by the large size of the ellipse, and have the same orientat ion as the dust concerns that appear to run along the truck route from the quarry. It also appears as though there is a relationship between respiratory co mplaints and the truck route. The ellipse representing clustering of real-time air samples greater than 150 g/m\u00b3 indicates that higher real-time readings are more compactly clustered than the cluster for respiratory symptoms. The ellipse for higher real-time TVA: TN Valley Authority TDH: Tennessee Department of Health EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program ArcGIS: ArcGIS is a group of geographical information system software that is used for mapping and statistical analysis of data that is geographically related. g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air Discussion: Community Concerns Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Relea se 77 readings is not oriented with the quarr y. See Figure 16 for the location of the ellipses. Analysis of 47,908 real-time air sampling re sults, with 216 results greater than 100 g/m\u00b3, reveals that 53% of results greater than 100 g/m\u00b3 are related to fires and that 22% have an unknown cause . See Table p below. Only about 8% of higher readings can be attributed to visible dust or truck/car traffic. Table p. Summary of notations for instantaneous reading >100 g/m\u00b3.

UMD is an organization that works to stop mountain top rem oval coal mining. UMD provided bottled water to residents even though all samp ling for municipal drinking water and well water have continuously met all EPA and TDEC regulations. UMD also worked to have 30 members of the comm unity tested for heavy metals at a Tennessee company called Internal Bala nce. Internal Balance advocates wellness and detoxification strategies. TDH did not recommend metals testing because the community is not exposed to elevated levels of metals from coal ash. Some community members who were test ed for heavy metals are concerned about abnormal results they received , but have had no medical follow up. Some health care providers in the area are uncomfortable interpreting these test results. Several community members have reported abnormal laboratory results for porphyrins testing done thr ough UMD. People are concerned about their health, about exposures, and ab out proper diagnosis and treatment. TVA has contracted with Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) to provide services to indivi duals with health concerns relating to the coal ash release. ORAU has subcontracted wi th the Tennessee Poison Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center ( VUMC) to provide expertise in medical toxicology to area health care providers and to individuals. ORAU and VUMC medical toxicologists have prepared a protocol for acceptance into the medical program and for appropriate testing of individuals. TVA will pay the costs associated with these examinations. In addition, if an individual's health has been adversely impacted by exposure to the released coal ash, TVA will pay for treatment (personal communication, Joseph J. Hoagland, TVA, September 9, 2009). g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air UMD: United Mountain Defense EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation TDH: Tennessee Department of Health TVA: TN Valley Authority ORAU: Oak Ridge Associated Universities VUMC: Vanderbilt University Medical Center Discussion: Community Concerns Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Relea se 78 ORAU and VUMC will not share indivi dual medical records with TVA or TDH without specific authorization fro m an individual patient.

The ash could have buried them if they had been on the portion of the Swan Pond Road that was covered. The ash could ha ve buried them if th ey had been boating, swimming, or fishing in the Emory River or in the Church, Berkshire, or Swan Pond sloughs. If the release had occurred during a summer day wh en people were on the river or riverbanks, many people could have been harmed or killed. An enormous amount of ash quickly filled th e Emory River and two coves, moving one house from its foundation and causing two other homes to be uninhabitable. The force of the release ruptured a gas line and disrupted power, causi ng the evacuation of the neighborhood along Swan Pond Road and Emory River Drive. A train derailed when it ran into a por tion of the huge pile of coal ash. People driving home during the night found that Swan Pond Circle Road was impassable due to the ash. Fortunately, no one on the road or river was buried by the coal ash release. Recommendation 1 The Roane County Office of Emergency Services and Homeland Security acted immediately to protect people. The Tennessee Valley Authority , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Tennessee Department of Environment a nd Conservation, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, and the Tennessee Department of Health began to assist through a unified command structure. Although the command cen ter was demobilized in January 2009, the response from state and federal agencies has continued, and will continue until the area is returned to the conditions existi ng before the coal ash release. The Tennessee Department of Health and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation will continue to widely publicize the following message: If you do contact the ash, then practice good hygiene, especially washing your hands before eating or smoking. Wash thoroughly, including your hands, clothes and shoes if you, your ch ildren, or pets come in contact with the ash. Basically, wash the same way you would after m ud exposure. Remember, the metals are bound to the ash. Occasional exposur es for brief periods of time should not harm people's health. This coal ash release highlights the continued need for industries and federal, state, and local officials to work closely together to deve lop comprehensive emergency response plans and capabilities in communities where acute environmental incidents are possible . Conclusions and Recommendations Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 80 Conclusion 2 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that it is unlikely that harm occurred to people from touching the coal ash when they had to climb out of their damaged houses on the morning of December 22, 2008, and to those who retu rned to retrieve personal property. Longer-term contact would be necessary to cause any significant local skin irritation, such as coal ash that has gotten under a bandage. Casual contact with coal ash should not cause skin irritation. In addition, th e metals in the coal ash are not likel y to get into people's bodies from touching the ash. Recommendation 2 People whose homes were destroyed have been relocated. In addition, the Tennessee Valley Authority has relocated most of the families whose property was near the affected portions of the Emory River and coves. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, th e Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, and the Tennessee Valley Authority should continue to work cooperatively to clean up the ash as quickly as possible while protecting the people in the community from touching, accidentally eating, drinki ng, or breathing the coal ash. Conclusion 3 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that no harm to the community's health is expected from touching the coal ash. This in cludes children who mi ght touch the ash while playing. Longer-term contact would be necessary to cause any significant local skin irritation, such as coal ash that has gotten under a bandage. Casual contact with coal ash should not cause skin irritation. In addition, th e metals in the coal ash are not likel y to get into people's bodies from touching the ash. The ash has been fenced, cl early marking the areas with coal ash. The opportunity for people, especially children, to touch the ash is currently minimal. Recommendation 3 The Tennessee Valley Authority should conti nue working in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to clean up the coal ash while protecting the people in the community from touching the coal ash . Conclusion 4 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that no harm to peopl e's health is expected from accidentally eating a small amount of coal ash. Conclusions and Recommendations Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 81 The concentrations of metals in the coal ash, except arsenic, are below levels known to cause harm if eaten. Because exposure to the coal ash was brief and the arsenic in the coal ash is not completely available for absorption, no harm to h ealth is expected even if the coal ash were accidentally eaten. The ash has been fenced, clearly marking the areas with coal ash. Recommendation 4 The Tennessee Valley Authority should conti nue working in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to clean up the coal ash while pr otecting the people in the community from eating the coal ash . Conclusion 5 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that using the Emory River at the site of the coal ash release (near Emory River mile 2) could resu lt in harm to residents or trespassers from physical hazards associated with cleanup efforts a nd from the volume of ash present, if residents or trespassers entered the area. The Tennessee Valley Authority is using heavy mach inery to build dikes and weirs to contain the ash and to remove the ash. The U.S. Envi ronmental Protection Agency and the Tennessee Valley Authority have brought in large hydraulic dr edge equipment to expe dite the removal of ash from the Emory River. People could be harmed if their boats became entangled in any cable or tie-offs for the dredging equipment or if any of the transport piping us ed to transport dredged ash were to blowout resulting in materials hittin g someone nearby. In addition, boaters could hit partially submerged obstructions in the work area or have decrea sed visibility by not being able to see around the large equipment. By summer 2010, ash removal in the main channel of the Emory River will have been completed and all heavy equipment will be removed. Recommendation 5 The Tennessee Valley Authority is working in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to clean up the coal ash while protecting the people in the community. While cleanup is underway, heavy machinery will be present. The Tennessee Valley Authority should continue to actively patrol the area so that unauthorized persons cannot enter the area. Th e U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with the Tennessee Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation and the Tennessee Valley Authority, issued a Recreational A dvisory for Watts Bar Reservoir in June 2009. This advisory states, in part: The public is cautioned to avoid recreational use of the lower Emory River in the vicinity of the as h release down to the confluence of the Emory and Clinch Rivers, whic h includes adjacent cove s, inlets, islands, and sand bars. Small vessel traffic is currently c hanneled through a well-marked navigational lane, but swimming, jet skiing, water skiing and tubing are not advised at this time in these areas. In addition to construction related ri sks, contact with submerged or floating ash should be avoided, and if ash is contacted it should be washed o ff with soap and water. Chronic exposure by incidental ingestion and inhalation should also be avoided . Conclusions and Recommendations Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 82 On August 11, 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation an d the Tennessee Valley Authority, closed the Emory River from mile marker 1.5 to mile marker 3. The river closure was extended from mile marker 0.0 to mile marker 6.0. The river wa s closed to river traffic through May 28, 2010. Conclusion 6 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that using municipal drinking water from the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants will not harm people's health because the raw and finished water have continuous ly met drinking water standards. The Environmental Protection Agency's contractor tested raw and finished drinking water for the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plan ts every day between December 23, 2008, and January 5, 2009. The Tennessee Department of E nvironment and Conservation tested the water every day between January 2 and January 22, 2009, and continues to sample the water weekly. At no time, has the raw or finished water co ntained metals above primary drinking water standards. The water intake for the Kingston wa ter treatment plant is about 6 miles downstream of the ash release site. The water intake fo r the Rockwood water trea tment plant is about 23 miles downstream of the ash release. Recommendation 6 The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation should continue to sample and analyze raw and finished water at the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants. If any at any time, violations of water quality are detect ed, the Tennessee Departme nt of Environment and Conservation will take immediate action to prot ect the health of th e communities using the municipal water. Conclusion 7 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that using well or spring water within four miles of the coal ash release will not harm people's health from exposure to coal ash or metals in the coal ash because no evidence has been found for groundwater contamination by coal ash. Between December 30, 2008, and March 12, 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Tennessee Department of Environment and C onservation, and the Tennessee Department of Health sampled and analyzed water from 102 priv ately owned wells and springs within a four- mile radius of the ash spill. N one of the water tested had any c ontaminants above the national or state primary drinking water limits called Maximu m Contaminant Levels (MCLs). There is no indication from groundwater samp ling and analysis that coal ash has contaminated the groundwater. Recommendation 7 The Tennessee Department of Environment and Cons ervation should continue to take samples of groundwater from private wells and springs for analys is periodically to make sure that the coal ash is not affecting groundwater. If elevated concentrations of a ny of the metals from the coal Conclusions and Recommendations Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 83 ash are found in groundwater, the Tennessee Department of E nvironment and Conservation will take immediate action to protect the health of the community. If site conditions at the Kingston Fossil Plant coal ash release should change, th en the groundwater sampling timeframe should be re-evaluated. Conclusion 8 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes th at no harm to people's health should result from recreational use of the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers outside the area of the lower Emory River down to the confluen ce of the Emory and Clinch Rivers, as specified in the recreational advisory and rive r closure. Previous fish advisories should be followed. Sampling and analysis for metals associated with co al ash indicated that metals in all other areas of the Emory River and the Clinch River have remained below any health comparison values. Concentrations of total suspended solids have rema ined low in all areas of the Emory and Clinch Rivers except at the site of the coal ash release. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and the Tennessee Valley Authority will continue to sample and analyze surface water in the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers. If any at any time, viol ations of water quality are detected, the Tennessee Department of Envi ronment and Conservation will take immediate action to protect the health of peopl e using the rivers for recreation. The Tennessee Department of Environment a nd Conservation and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency advise avoiding consumpti on of striped bass and limiting consumption of catfish and sauger. The pollutants of concern are polychlorinated biph enyls (PCBs) and mercury from historical activities not related to the Tennessee Valley Authority (see Appendix D). Recommendation 8 The Tennessee Valley Authority should continue to clean up the site of the coal ash release as fast as possible while, at the same time, protecti ng both public health and the health of the river and its aquatic life. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation should continue to monitor the Emory and Clinch Rivers to make sure th ey remain safe for recreational activities. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation are sampling fish to make sure the coal ash does not affect them and indirectly harm pe ople who eat the fish. Cleanup of the coal ash release is being conducted in a way that will not disturb historical contamination of the river sediments with polyc hlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury. TVA and EPA entered into an Administrative Or der and Agreement on Consent on May 6, 2009, to ensure that the environmental impacts associat ed with the ash spill are thoroughly assessed and that appropriate response actions are taken as necessary to protect public health, welfare of the environment, and to ensure that the response actions satisfy all federal as well as state environmental requirements. TDEC's Commi ssioner's Order of January 12, 2009, and TDEC's collaboration with TWRA in protecting fi sh are included in the TVA/EPA order. Conclusions and Recommendations Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 84 Conclusion 9 While no air measurements were obtained durin g the time period between December 22 through December 27, 2008, the Tennessee Department of Hea lth concludes that it is unlikely that any harm to public health should have resulted from breathing ambient air from December 22, 2008, through December 27, 2008. However, any dust that may have been inhaled could have aggravated symptoms in sensitive populations , that is, people with asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory or ca rdiovascular conditions. The coal ash was wet when it spilled. Wet weathe r for three days after th e spill, combined with low temperatures and slow wind speeds, would have kept the coal as h from drying out and getting into the air. Recommendation 9 Since no air measurements were obtained duri ng the time period between December 22 through December 27, 2008, it is not possible to know precis ely what the air conditions were during this time. All emergency operations were aimed at pr otecting the public from released coal ash and dealing with emergency situati ons created by derailed trains, ruptured gas lines, destroyed homes, and destroyed roads. The U.S. Envir onmental Protection Agency began taking samples on site on December 27, 2008. Various types of air sampling in the community began on December 28, 2008 by the Tennessee Valley Authority, on December 30, 2008 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and on January 19, 2009, by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Conclusions 10a, b, c a. The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that breathing ambient air near the coal ash release is not expected to harm people's health as long as ad equate dust suppression measures are in place. b. The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that no harm to people's health is expected from occasionally breathing coal ash if it should become airborne for short periods of time. c. If dust suppression measures should fail and pa rticulate matter is present in concentrations greater than National Ambient Air Quality Stan dards due to the coal ash becoming airborne for periods longer than one day, the Tenness ee Department of Health concludes that particulate matter from airborne coal ash coul d harm people's health, especially for those persons with pre-existing resp iratory or heart conditions. Su ch harm could include upper airway irritation and aggravati on of pre-existing conditions su ch as asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory or ca rdiovascular conditions. Sampling and analysis of partic ulate matter by all agencies indi cated that particulate matter, less than or equal to 2.5 microns in diameter (P M2.5) and less than or equal to 10 microns in diameter (PM10), in ambient air surrounding th e coal ash release met all National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Conclusions and Recommendations Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 85 Coal ash is considered a nuisance dust because of the size range of th e particulate matter. Metals in the ash are not at high enough concentrations to cause harm if they are breathed. If the coal ash were breathed in for longer periods or more frequently, the particulate matter in the airborne coal ash would cause the same harm as breathing in other dusts (such as dust from a ball field or farm land). Examples of such harm are upper airway irritation and aggravation of pre-existing problems such as asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. The Tennessee Valley Authority's air monitors did not often detect metals in total particulate matter. Most measurements were below health comparison values. Arsenic and chromium detected by the Tennessee Valley Authority in tota l particulates on-site were within the range found in the United States for metals on part iculate matter. Sampling and analysis of ambient air off-site were done by using tempor ary monitors that sampled total particulate matter, not just respirable or inhalable part iculates. One sample taken on January 26, 2009, had cadmium in total particulates above the heal th comparison value. This sample represents just one sampling result within results for fi ve sampling stations with daily sampling from January 1 through March 10, 2009 (345 samples). Metals in total suspended particulates measured by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation were all below health comparison values, except for two samples of arsenic that were slightly above the health comparison value. These two detections of arsenic should have no impact on public health because the concentrations of arsenic detected were extremely low. In a ddition, metals measured in total suspended particulates include metals of a ll sizes of particulate matter, not just particulate matter that is respirable. Recommendation 10 The Tennessee Valley Authority and the Te nnessee Department of Environment and Conservation should continue to measure particulate matter and me tals in particulate matter in the air near the release until the coal ash release is cleaned up. The Tennessee Department of Health, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, and the Tennessee Valley Authority will ensure that a system is in place to warn people if the air quality is likely to fail to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Conclusion 11 The Tennessee Department of Health cannot conc lude whether breathing dust near the quarry and along the routes of the quarry trucks has or will harm people's health. Such dust can be irritating to upper airways a nd can aggravate pre-existing conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and other respirator y or cardiovascular conditions. Of the 47,909 real-time measurements of particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns in diameter (PM10) in the commun ity near the ash release, 0.1 % were above 150 micrograms per cubic meter, the 24-hour average National Ambi ent Air Quality Standard. Many of these samples were taken near the quarry and along the quarry truck routes. Because the samples were collected during a short time period, three to five minutes, we cannot make any predictions about Conclusions and Recommendations Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 86 the 24-hour average concentrations. We can say that the quarry dust does not typically contain heavy metals like the coal ash. Quarry dust cont ains chemicals present in limestone, such as calcium, magnesium, and carbonates. Such dust can be irritating to upper airways and can aggravate pre-existing conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. Recommendation 11 If the rock dust from the quarry was a health pr oblem, it was because it is particulate in nature. The Tennessee Department of Environment and C onservation should continue to work with the quarry and with the Tennessee Valley Authority to lessen the dust at the quarry and along the truck routes. Conclusion 12 The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that the small amount of radiation from the coal ash is not expected to harm people's health. Any exposure to radiation from the small amount of naturally occurring radionuclides pr esent in coal ash, even in th e more concentrated forms in coal ash, would be too small to gi ve a radiation dose to people th at would be substantially greater than the normal, everyday background radia tion dose to which all people are exposed. The radioactive materials of concern in coal ash include both radi um-226 and radium-228. Although the concentration of these materials in the coal ash exceeded the average regional background soil concentrations, the levels are belo w the health-based directive used by both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. This regulatory limit was set to protec t the health of people, including the health of sensitive populations. Recommendation 12 No additional public health actions are needed related to radiati on from the released coal ash. The Tennessee Valley Authority, the U.S. Army Co rps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation signed the c ontinuing Interagency Agreement Watts Bar Reservoir Permit Coordination in February 1991. This agreement governs any activities that could result in the disturbance, resuspensi on, removal, and/or disposal of sediments contaminated by Oak Ridge Reservation past ac tivities. The cleanup of ash in Watts Bar Reservoir is functioning under this agreement to prevent dredging of legacy contamination not related to the coal ash release. Conclusion 13 The Tennessee Department of Health supports th e efforts of the non-govern mental organizations to collect environmental data in the days after the coal ash release. The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that da ta collected by non-governmental organizations confirm data collected by governmental agencies at the site of the coal ash release. Because the data were Conclusions and Recommendations Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 87 collected for a brief time immediately after the coal ash release and were collected only at the site of the release, they could not be used in establishing the long- term public health implications of the coal ash release for Watts Bar Reservoir. Data from all agencies agree that arsenic in the coal ash was at levels above health comparison values, that arsenic in the Emory River at the s ite of the ash release was elevated immediately following the release. They also agree that grou ndwater in the vicinity of the coal ash release was not impacted by the coal ash. Non-governme ntal organizations, as well as the Tennessee Departments of Health and Environment a nd Conservation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, expressed concern about the potential for harm to health from breathing airborne coal ash. See Conclusi on 10 for more about this. The data provided by non-governmental organizati ons about selenium in certain fish were not replicated by Tennessee Department of Environm ent and Conservation's, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency's, or the U.S. Environmenta l Protection Agency's sampling and analysis. However, it has signaled the need for furthe r investigation by government agencies. The Environmental Protection Agency's Science Review Panel and the U.S. Corps of Engineers have generated two reports on selenium impacts at the site of the coal ash release. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) collected most of the data in the days just after the coal ash release and in areas near the release. In some cases, the Tennessee Department of Health could not determine the exact sampling and analys is techniques or qual ity control and quality assurance measures. We appreciate this additio nal data and the concern about the environment and the health of Tennesseans by the non-government al organizations. By working together, all governmental and non-governmental agencies can protect the environment and the health of the people who live in the area of the coal ash release. Sampling and analysis of groundwater, surface dri nking water, well water, and air continues by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Te nnessee Department of Environment and Conservation. This continuing sampling will al low the Tennessee Departme nt of Health and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conserva tion to ensure that th e health of the public near the coal ash release c ontinues to be protected. Recommendation 13 None at this time. Conclusion 14 Based on the Community Health Survey, the Tenn essee Department of Health concludes that many residents living in the area of the coal ash spill experienced stress and anxiety. Some residents reported respiratory symptoms after the ash release. Analysis of questions from the Community Heal th Survey indicated th at 52 percent of the persons who answered questions for the survey experienced stress and an xiety. Symptoms of stress and anxiety are natural and to be expect ed since the coal ash release destroyed homes, disrupted lives, and drastically changed the la ndscape. Since the coal release occurred just before Christmas, even more stress was added to the lives of the people living near the coal ash Conclusions and Recommendations Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 88 release. Forty percent of the pe rsons who answered quest ions for the survey reported a change in health status since the spill, primarily either worsening of cough or headaches, wheezing, or shortness of breath. It is important to note that the survey was done soon after the spill, but was not repeated later. Therefore, the results are only applicable for the short period soon after the spill. Recommendation 14 The Tennessee Department of Health has conti nually encouraged people to see their primary care provider for any health concerns. Peopl e are encouraged to contact the Oak Ridge Associated Universities to sign up for health screenings if they are concerned that their health has been harmed by the coal ash release. The health screenings will be done by medical toxicologists from the Tennessee Poison Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The Department of Mental Health and the Tenne ssee Valley Authority worked with Ridgeview Community Mental Health Center in Oak Ridge and Harriman to provide services to people affected by the coal ash release. Conclusion 15 Community members living near the quarry and along the routes that quarry trucks traveled made complaints specific to dust at the Tenne ssee Valley Authority's Community Involvement Center. Complaints about respiratory symptoms were widespread and were not oriented toward either the site of the coal ash rel ease or the route of the quarry trucks. The Tennessee Department of Health analyzed written complaints to the Tennessee Valley Authority's Community Involveme nt Center related to health concerns. The Tennessee Department of Health performed geographical anal ysis that indicated th at dust concerns were strongly oriented to the location of the quarry and to routes traveled by the quarry trucks. Geographical analysis indicated that respirator y concerns were not geographically related to either the quarry or the coal ash release site. Recommendation 15 The Tennessee Department of Environment and C onservation should continue to work with the quarry to control dust. TVA has implemented many dust control measures at the site of the coal ash release and for trucks leaving the site. Dust controls will con tinue to be required of trucks driving on county roads. The Tennessee Department of Health has conti nually encouraged people to see their primary care provider for any health concerns. Peopl e are encouraged to contact the Oak Ridge Associated Universities to sign up for health screenings if they are concerned that their health has been harmed by the coal ash release. The health screenings will be done by medical toxicologists from the Tennessee Poison Cent er, Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Conclusions and Recommendations Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 89 Conclusion 16 The Tennessee Department of Hea lth concluded that screening pe ople's blood or urine for metals would not be helpful. Based on environmental test results, the Tennessee Department of Health does not expect harm to health from touching, eating, dr inking, or breathing the metals in coal fly ash. No harm is expected from breathing the air as long as adequa te dust suppression measures are in place. Any exposures would have been very brief, and any possible absorption of metals from the coal ash would have been undetectable. Recommendation 16 If people chose to have metals' testing and they are concerned about thei r results, they should talk with their primary care provider or talk with a medical toxicologist at the clinics set up in the area by Oak Ridge Associated Universities and the Tennessee Poison Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Since the Public Health Assessment All conclusions remain valid and unchanged as of July 2010. The Tennessee Department of Health has reviewed data continually as it has beco me available to make sure the public health of the community near the Tennessee Valley Authority spill site is protected. Public Health Action Plan Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 90 2.11 Public Health Action Plan The Tennessee Department of Health will continue to work with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and the Tennessee Va lley Authority to analyze data for its public health implications. These agencies will con tinue to monitor the environment around the ash spill until all restoration is complete. The Tennessee Department of Health will continue to work with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to involve the community in the process and to educate the community about the public health implications of the ash release and the cleanup. The Tennessee Department of Health's Environm ental Epidemiology Progr am will continue to work with the U.S. Environmental Protecti on Agency and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, if requested, as additional studies are conducted at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossi l Plant and as the cleanup of the ash release continues.

Appendix A: Health Comparison Values Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 200 ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry TDH: Tennessee Department of Health MRL: ATSDR minimal risk level mg/kg\u00b7day: milligram of substance per kilogram body weight per day NOAEL: No observed adverse effect level LOAEL: Lowest observed adverse effect level EMEG: ATSDR environmental media evaluation guide milligram per meter of air Appendix A: Health Comparison Values ATSDR is charged by Congress with pr oviding support in the assessment of any health hazard posed by Superfund or other hazardous waste sites. Part of that charge is to thoroughly research what is known about toxic and hazardous chemicals. The purpose of the research is to establish health comparison values. These health comparison values are used by ATSDR and TDH so that when toxic or hazardous substances are found in the environment, we can understand the public health implications using the best sc ience available. If the chemical concentrations are below health guidance values, then environmental scientists can be reasonably certain that no adverse health effects will occur in people who are exposed. If concentrations are above the guidance values (ATSDR 2007a, 2008) for a particular chemical, then further evaluation is needed. In this public health assessment, we will do further evaluation for arsenic in coal ash for the ingestion route of exposure. ATSDR's health comparison values for chemicals that do not cause cancer are called Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs). MRLs represent doses that a person could receive without adverse health effects fo r a lifetime. The unit of measurement for MRLs is milligram of chemical per kilogram of body weight per day, written as mg/kg\u00b7day. MRLs are derived from 'no observed adverse effect levels' (NOAELs) or from lowest observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs). A NOAEL is the highest tested dose of a chemical that has be en reported to have no harmful health effects on people or animals. A LOAEL is the lowest tested dose of a chemical that has been reported to cause harmful health effects in people or animals. LOAELs are based on less serious, subtle effects rather th an on obvious toxic effects. To be more useful as a screening tool , MRLs are mathematically converted to Environmental Media Evaluation Guidelines (EMEGs). EMEGs represent concentrations of chemicals in an envir onmental media, such as soil, air, or water, that people could be exposed to for varying amounts of time without adverse health effects. The units of measurement for EMEGs are milligrams of chemical per kilogram of soil (mg/kg), milligrams of chemical per liter of water (mg/L), or milligrams of chemical per cubic meter of air (mg/m\u00b3). ATSDR used conservative assumptions about chemical exposure when developing its EMEGs and minimum risk levels MRLs. EMEGs and MRLs consider non-cancer adverse health effects. Exposure durations are defined as acute (14 days or less), intermediate (15-364 days), and chronic (365 days or more) exposures. For most chemicals, EMEGs have been derived for children and adults. EMEGs serve as screening guidance to help scientists look more closely at the people who might be exposed to harmful levels of chemicals. To use these screening levels we must know how much of a chemical someone is exposed to Appendix A: Health Comparison Values Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 201 (dose), how long that exposure has been or will be occurring (duration of exposure), how frequent the exposure is or will be (frequency of exposure), and the age of the exposed person. If con centrations are below the chronic EMEG for a particular chemical, scientists can be reasonably certain that no adverse health effects will occur in people who are exposed. EMEGs are not action or trigger levels . Concentrations above the chronic EMEG do not mean that adverse health effects would occur. The health assessor would need to look more clos ely at exposure routes, duration of exposure, frequency of exposure, and dose. In addition, the health assessor needs to look more closely at the to xicity of the chemical and how much confidence we have in the MRL. The EPA is also mandated to publish toxicity information. EPA's values are very similar to ATSDR's MRLs and EMEGs. EPA's reference dose (RfD) and reference are an alogous to ATSDR's chronic exposure MRL. RfDs are used in cases of oral exposure (eating or drinking) to the chemical in question. RfC's are used fo r inhalation exposure (breathing) to the chemical in question. Policy decisions at each agency may result in ATSDR and EPA deriving different MRLs, RfDs, and RfCs for the same chemical. In addition, ATSDR derives EMEGs for varying chronic, intermediate, and acute exposure frequencies. Chronic exposure is define d as one year or more. Intermediate exposure is defined as 15 - 364 days. Ac ute exposure is defined as fourteen days or less. EPA-derived RfDs and RfCs are for chronic or lifetime exposure. If ATSDR has not derived an MRL for a chemical, then it sometimes uses EPA's RfD to derive a Reference Do se Media Evaluation Guide (RMEG). ATSDR usually considers RMEGs to represent an intermediate exposure. For cancer effects, ATSDR uses EPA in formation to set their cancer risk evaluation guidelines (CREGs) for lifetime exposure. If a chemical is a probable or known human carcinogen, EPA derives a cancer risk value for that chemical. EPA uses data from animal studies and human epidemiology studies, if they are availabl e, to extrapolate from high doses with known carcinogenic end points to very low doses using complex models. Often EPA assumes there is no threshold; that is, any exposure will result in some risk of cancer. This is an assumption that is valid in some cases and not in others, but for most chemicals we lack sufficient data to know the validity of the assumption. EPA then uses one of several models to determine the slope of the 95% upper confidence level of the extrapolated response at low concentrations. This derived slope fact or is the number that represents the theoretical risk of excess cancer from exposure to the chemical in question (EPA 2005). EMEG: ATSDR environmental media evaluation guide MRL: ATSDR minimal risk level EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency RfD: EPA Reference Dose RfC: EPA Reference Concentration ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry RMEG: ATSDR- derived reference dose media evaluation guide Appendix A: Health Comparison Values Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 202 It is important to note that the cancer risk value is a statistically derived number representing an upper 95% confidence level of a theoretical straight line predicting one extra cancer per unit increase in exposur e. The use of such toxicity values in combination with estimates of expos ure result in estimates of \"excess lifetime cancer risks\" from the exposure in question. This extra or \"excess\" risk is in addition to the risk people already have for any number of other reasons (e.g., genetic pr edisposition, lifestyle factors, etc.). In the US, men have slightly less than a 1 in 2 lifetime risk of developing cancer. For women, the lifetime excess risk is a little more than 1 in 3 (Cancer Facts and Figures 2008). ATSDR does not publish a comparable cancer guidance value; they use EPA's slope factor. EPA regulates chemicals in the environment which may cause cancer, when their presence could result in the range of one excess cancer in 1,000,000 people to one excess cancer in 10,000 people (EPA 1991). Health comparison values will change periodically as scientists discover more about how a particular chemical does or does not cause harm to people. Thus, MRLs and slope factors can get higher or lower. EEP used comparison values for chronic exposures to children whenever possible. This means that EEP assumed that all exposures would last more than one year and could last for a life time. This is cautious way to look at possible risks from exposures to chemi cals in the environment. People are seldom exposed to an environmental c ontaminant constantly for over a year. Details for each exposure pathway will be discussed in each section of the public health assessment. If concentrations are below the chroni c EMEG for a particular chemical, the health assessor can be re asonably certain that no a dverse health effects will occur in people who are exposed. Stat ed another way, the health assessor can be very sure that even long-term, c ontinuous exposure to a chemical at concentrations below its chronic EMEG will not harm people's health. EEP used ATSDR's MRLs and EMEGs for chronic exposure to children whenever possible. For certain metals, ATSDR used an EPA value comparable to their MRLs to calcula te a Reference Dose Media Evaluation Guide (RMEG). If ATSDR's EMEGs or RMEGs were unavailable, EEP used comparison values developed by regional EPA offices or EEP developed comparison values for use at this ash release site.ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency MRL: ATSDR minimal risk level EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program EMEG: ATSDR environmental media evaluation guide RMEG: ATSDR- derived reference dose media evaluation guide Appendix B: Metals in Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 203 Appendix B. Toxicological Discussion of Metals in Air Arsenic Arsenic is widely distributed in the Eart h's crust. In Tennessee, soils contain a range of arsenic concentrations, with an average of 10 mg/kg (TDEC 2001). In the U.S., soils have an average arseni c value of 20 mg/kg (ATSDR 2007). In nature, arsenic is mostly found in minera ls and only to a small extent in its elemental form. In coal fly ash, arsenic is in an inorganic form, mostly as an arsenate (Shoji et al. 2002). Workers exposed to arsenic dusts in an occupational setting often experience irritation to the mucous membranes of th e nose and throat. This may lead to laryngitis, bronchitis, or rhinitis, and very high exposures (characteristic of workplace exposures in the past) can cause perforation of the nasal septum. Despite the known respiratory irritant eff ects of arsenic, there have been few systematic investigations of respiratory effects in humans exposed to arsenic. There is some evidence from epidemiol ogical studies that inhaled inorganic arsenic can produce effects on the cardiovascular system. Dermatitis has frequently been observed in industrial wo rkers exposed to in organic arsenic in the air, with the highest ra tes occurring in the workers with the greatest arsenic exposure. There is evidence from epidemiological studies that inhaled inorganic arsenic can produce ne urological effects (ATSDR 2007). There is convincing evidence from a large number of epidemiological studies that breathing inorganic ar senic increases the risk of lung cancer. Most studies involved workers exposed primarily to ar senic trioxide dust in air at copper smelters and mines, but increased incidence of lung cancer has also been observed at chemical plants where expos ure was primarily to arsenate. In addition, several studies sugge st that residents living n ear smelters or arsenical chemical plants may also have incr eased risk of lung cancer, although the increases are small and are not clearly de tectable in all cases. The strongest evidence that arsenic is responsible for the observed lung cancers comes from quantitative dose-response data relating specific arsenic expos ure levels to lung cancer risk. These data are availabl e for arsenic-exposed workers at the ASARCO copper smelter in Tacoma, Washington, the Anaconda copper smelter in Montana, eight other U.S. copper smelters, and the Ronnskar copper smelter in Sweden. A common limita tion of these studies is confounding exposure to other chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide, and cigarette smoking (ATSDR, 2007). EEP chose a health comparison value for arsenic of 0.0023 g/m\u00b3. This exposure would represent a risk of one excess cancer in a 100,000 people with continuous lifetime exposure to 0.0023 g/m\u00b3 of airborne arsenic. EEP used the risk values from EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). The respirable portion of the coal ash is less than 30%, and, with dust suppression measures in place, actual exposure to airborne ash should be infrequent and for short periods of time. mg/kg: milligram per kilogram EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Appendix B: Metals in Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 204 Chromium Chromium is a naturally-occurring element found in rocks, animals, plants, and soil. The three main forms of chromium are elemental chromium (valence state 0), trivalent chromium (v alence state +3), and hexavalent chromium (valence state +6). Small amounts of trivalent chromium are considered to be a necessity for human health . The primary route of exposure for the general population is food ingestion. Chromium content in foods varies greatly and depends on the processing and prepara tion. In general, most fresh foods typically contain chromium le vels ranging from <10 to 1,300 g/kg (<0.01 to 1.3 mg/kg) (ATSDR, 2008a). Hexavalent chromium compounds are more toxic than trivalent chromium compounds. The most common health problem experienced by workers exposed to airborne chromium involves the respiratory tract. These health effects include irritation of the lining of the nose, runny nose, and breathing problems (asthma, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing). Workers have also developed allergies to chromium compounds, which can cause breathing difficulties and skin rash es (ATSDR 2008a). The concentrations of chromium in ai r that can cause these effects may be different for different types of chromium compounds, with effects occurring at much lower concentrations for hexavale nt chromium compared to trivalent chromium. However, the concentrati ons causing respiratory problems in workers are at least 60 times higher than levels normally found in the environment (ATSDR 2008a). The International Agency for Research on Cancer has determined that hexavalent chromium compounds are carcinogenic to humans. The National Toxicology Program's 11th Report on Carcinogens classified hexavalent chromium compounds as known human carcinogens. In workers, inhalation of hexavalent chromium has been shown to cause lung cancer. In laboratory animals, hexavalent chromium compounds have been shown to cause tumors to the stomach, intestinal tract, and lung (ATSDR 2008a). Researchers have performed spectral an alysis of coal fly ash that was experimentally generated by combusti on of three high-volatile bituminous coals from the eastern United States and four coals from the western United States. Results indicated that fly ash from western coals contained significant amounts of hexavalent chromium (9% to 26% of all chromium in fly ash), while fly ash from eastern coals containe d no hexavalent chromium (Shoji et al 2002). Researchers in the Netherland s found that hexavalent chromium accounts for an average of 6 percent of all chromium in coal ash. In the Netherlands, coal from all over the world is burned to generate electricity (Meij and te Winkel 2001). TVA blends central Appalachian coal (eastern) and Powder River Basin coal (western) in a 50/50 ratio to meet th eir sulfur dioxide limits (personal communi cation, Jeryl Stewart, TD EC, through Quincy Styke, TDEC, March 12, 2009, and Steven C. Strunk, TVA, March 17, 2009). In the in Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 205 past, it is likely that eastern coal was burned exclusively, resulting in lower levels of hexavalent chromium in mixed coal ash. EEP conservatively assumed that the ash that spilled would have 13 percent hexavalent chromium (based on a 50/50 mixture of coal containing no hexavalent chromium and coal containing 26% hexavalent chromium). Hexavalent chromium is carcinogenic, and there are no health comparison values for trivalent chromium. The concentration that corresponds to one excess cancer in 100,000 people (1x10-5 risk of excess cancer) is 0.00083 g/m3. This level is lower than th e 2008 average concentration of 0.004 g/m\u00b3 and maximum concentration of 0.02 g/m\u00b3 in the U.S. The level representing one excess cancer in 100,000 people is also less than the 2008 average concentration of 0.002 to 0.003 g/m\u00b3 and maximum concentration of 0.02 g/m\u00b3 in the State of Georgia, the near est state with metals monitoring (EPA 2009c). EEP chose to use background concentra tions found in Georgia (0.002 to 0.003 g/m\u00b3) for comparison purposes pertaining to the KIF release. The calculated theoretical risk of one ex cess cancer in 100,000 people (1x10 -5) is below background levels found in the U.S. B ecause only about 13% of chromium in the KIF coal ash is in the hexavalent form of chromium, the actual risk from breathing KIF coal ash is less than would be mathematically calculated. In addition, the respirable portion of the ash is small. With dust suppressions measures in place, actual exposure to airborne ash should be infrequent and for short periods. Manganese Manganese is a naturally-occurring subs tance found in many types of rocks and soil. Pure manganese is a silver-color ed metal. Manganese does not occur in the environment as a pure metal. Ra ther, it occurs combined with other substances such as oxygen, sulfur, and chlorine. Manganese is a trace element and some is necessary for good health (ATSDR 2008b). The most common health problems in workers occupationally exposed to high levels of manganese involve the nervous system. These health effects include behavioral changes and other nervou s system effects, which include movements that may become slow and clumsy. This combination of symptoms when sufficiently severe is referred to as \"manganism.\" Other less severe nervous system effects such as slowed hand movements have been observed in some workers exposed to lower concentratio ns of manganese in the work place. The health comparison values for manga nese in air are undergoing review by EPA and ATSDR. The ATSDR Draft T oxicological Profile for Manganese released in September 2008 included a health comparison value of 0.3 g/m 3 for chronic exposure to manganese in air (ATSDR 2008b). The currently listed health comparison value from ATSDR' s Air Comparison Values Table is 0.04 g/m3. The comparison value from EPA that represents hazard index of 1 is TDEC: TN Department of Environment & Conservation TVA: TN Valley Authority g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air KIF: Kingston Fossil Plant EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry Appendix B: Metals in Air Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 206 0.05 g/m\u00b3 (IRIS 2009). EEP chose to use ATSDR's value from their Air Comparison Values Table of 0.04 g/m\u00b3 as its health comparison value for this public health assessment. Other Metals The health comparison values for airbor ne aluminum and barium were taken from EPA Region 3's Regional Screeni ng Tables. The health comparison value for aluminum is 5.2 g/m\u00b3 and for barium is 0.52 g/m\u00b3. The health comparison value for sele nium was taken from EPA Region 4's chronic inhalation screening values, adju sted for a hazard index of 1. This value is 20 g/m\u00b3. No health comparison values for inha lation are available for thallium and vanadium in air. Sufficient inform ation about the human toxicology of thallium and vanadium could not be id entified to derive health screening values . g/m\u00b3: microgram per cubic meter of air ATSDR: Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry EPA: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program Appendix C: Spatial Analysis Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 207 Appendix C: Spatial Analysis with ArcGIS EEP did spatial analysis using ESRI's Ar cGIS Version 9.3. In order to do the analysis, incident data were aggreg ated based on 1,500 foot by 1,500-foot grid cells. Census block groups could not be used for aggregation because the area around the TVA spill site is very rural; th erefore, census block groups were too large. Due to the relatively low incide nce of symptoms, it is important to note that EEP was dealing with very small nu mbers (less than 30 in each cell). As a result, a small change in symptom occurre nce can lead to a large change in the symptom proportion. To discern any temporal trends in symptom occurrence, EEP investigated whether the 'after' symptoms had different spatial distributions than the 'before' symptoms using the Directional Distribution (Standard Ellipse) tool in ArcGIS. This tool allowed EEP to cr eate standard ellipses, which show the distribution of features as well as wh ether there is a directional trend or orientation in that distribution. It doe s so by calculating the standard distance between each feature to the mean center of the distribution separately for the x and y coordinates. These two measures define the axis of an ellipse, which encompasses the distribution of the feat ures. The length of the x-axis is calculated in the east-west direction and the length of the y-axis is calculated in the north-south direction. Because the standard deviation is measured in each direction from the mean center, the to tal length of each axis is twice its standard deviation. To determine the orientation of the ellipse, ArcGIS calculates an angle of rotation from 0 o due north for the y-axis so that the sum of the squares of the distance between th e features and the axes is minimized. It then rotates each axis by this angl e, ultimately finding the best fit of both axes among the features in which the dist ance of the features to the axes is minimized (Mitchell 2005). The Directional Distribution (Standard Ellipse) tool can be used to compare distributions, examine distributions from different time periods, and show compactness and orientation of distributions. If distributions closely resemble a circle, then there is not a strong orientation to the o ccurrence of the symptom. A large circle means the cases are widespread whereas a small circle means the cases are more localized (concentrated). The orientation of the circle/eclipse indicates the direction in which the cases are o ccurring (ESRI 2006). Next, EEP determined whether or not each of these symptoms were clustered and, if so, at what distance the clusteri ng is most significant using the Spatial Autocorrelation (Global Moran' s I) tool in ArcGIS. Th is tool is based on the concept that everything is related to ever ything else, but nearby things are more related than far away things. It indicate s whether particular values are likely to occur in one location or are equally like ly to occur at any location (ESRI 2006). It does so by calculating a Moran's I statistic. This statistic calculates the difference between each feature and th e difference between each neighboring feature to the mean value fo r all features in the study area. It then compares EEP: Environmental Epidemiology Program ESRI: Environmental Systems Research Institute ArcGIS: ArcGIS is a group of geographical information system software that is used for mapping and statistical analysis of data that is geographically related. TVA: TN Valley Authority Appendix C: Spatial Analysis Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 208 these two differences. The values for Moran's I range from -1 to +1. The closer Moran's I is to +1, the greater the clustering of similar features. Conversely, the closer Moran's I is to - 1, the greater the dispersion of similar features. An I close to 0 indicates that the features are random and there is no apparent pattern (Mitchell 2005). The Spatial Autocorrelation (Global Mora n's I) tool also cal culates a Z-score which indicates statistical significance. For this analysis, EEP used a significance level of 0.05, or 95%. Therefore, a Z-score greater than +1.96 or a Z-score less than -1.96 is a significant result. A positive Z-score above the significant value of +1.96 would thus indi cate that similar values tend to be found together and you can be 95% confiden t that the clustered pattern is not due to chance. A negative Z-score belo w the significant value of -1.96 would indicate that high and low values are interspersed and you can be 95% confident that the dispersed pattern is not due to chance (Mitchell 2005). Once significant clustering of symptoms was recognized, EEP used the Hot Spot Analysis with Rendering tool in ArcGIS to id entify the location of these clusters. Using a distance-based neig hborhood, this tool calcu lates a Getis-Ord Gi* statistic for each feature by summing the values of the neighboring features within a specific distance and dividing th is sum by the sum of the values of all the features in the study area. A gro up of features with high Gi* values indicates a hot spot. A hot spot is an area where there is an unexpectedly high number of symptoms given the number of people. Equally, a group of features with low Gi* values indicates a cold spot which is an area where there is an unexpectedly low number of symptoms given the number of people. A Gi* near 0 indicates an area where there is neither a high nor a lo w concentration of symptoms (Mitchell 2005). As with Moran's I, the Hot Spot Analysis with Rendering tool also calculates a Z-score to test statistical significance. A high Z-score for a feature indicates its neighbors have high attribute values and a low Z-score for a feature indicates its neighbors have low attribute values. As such, with a significance level of 0.05, a Z-score greater than +1.96 indicates that the identified hot spot is statistically significant. A Z-score less than -1.96 indicates that the identified cold spot is statically significant. A Z-score near 0 indicates no apparent concentration of similar values (Mitch ell 2005). The greater the Z-score, whether it be negative or positive, the more intense the clustering (ESRI 2008).

Redlands, California Appendix D: Fish Advisories Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 210 Appendix D: Excerpt from Fishing an d Biological Advisories in Tennessee Fishing and Bacteriological Advisories in Tennessee can be found at URL: http://www.state.tn.us/environment/w pc/publications/pdf/advisories.pdf Fish Tissue Contamination Fish are an important part of a balanced diet and a good source of low fat protein. They also provide essential fatty acids that are crucial fo r the proper functioning of the nervous system and help prevent heart disease. The Department reco mmends that residents and visitors continue to eat fish from Tennessee rivers and reservoirs, but they s hould also follow the published advisories on consumption hazar ds in individual reservoirs. Approximately 94,400 reservoir acres and 119 ri ver miles are currently posted due to contaminated fish. The contaminants most frequen tly found at dangerous levels in fish tissue are PCBs, mercury, chlordane, and other organics. Organic substances and mercury tend to bind with the sediment, settle out of the water, and persist for a very long time. In the sediment, th ey become part of the aquatic food chain and, over time, concentrate in fish tissue. Contamin ants can be found in fish tissue even if the substance has not been used or manufactured in decades. Waterbodies where fish tissue has levels of contamination that pos e a higher than acceptable risk to the public are posted and the public is advised of the danger. Signs are placed at main public access points and a press release is submitted to local newspapers. The list of advisories is also published in TWRA's annual fishi ng regulations. If needed, TWRA can enforce a fishing ban. Where contaminants are elevated in fish, they may also be present in other aquatic life as well. Therefore, the public is advised to limit or avoi d consumption of other animals such as turtles, crayfish and mussels in water bodies with a fishing advisory. In March 2004, the U.S. Department of Health an d Human Services, in conjunction with the U.S. Environment Protection Agency, issued a mercur y advisory for the consumption of fish and shellfish by pregnant women, nursing mothers, young children, and wome n who might become pregnant. The advisor specifically warns this se nsitive sub-population to avoid eating fish with elevated mercury levels: Shark, Swordfish, King Mackerel, and Tilefish. For more information see EPA's website: http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/fishadvice/advice.html Reducing Risks from Contaminated Fish The best way to protect yourself and your family from eating contaminated fish is by following the advice provided by the Department of Envi ronment and Conservation. Cancer risk is accumulated over a lifetime of exposure to a car cinogen (cancer-causing agent). For that reason, eating an occasional fish, even from an area with a fishing advisory, will not measurably increase your cancer risk. At greatest risk are people who eat contaminated fish for years, such as recreational or subsistence fishermen. Some groups of peopl e like children or peopl e with a previous occupational exposure to a contaminant are more se nsitive to that pollutant. Studies have shown Appendix D: Fish Advisories Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 211 that contaminants can cross th e placental barrier in pregnant women to enter the baby's body, thereby increasing the risk of de velopmental problems. These substa nces are also concentrated in breast milk. The Division's goal in issuing fishing advisories is to provide the information necessary for people to make informed choices about their health. People concer ned about their health will likely choose not to eat fish from contaminated sites. If you choose to eat fish in areas with elevated contaminant levels, here is some advice on how to reduce this risk: 1. Throw back the big ones. Smaller fish generally have lower concentrations of contaminants. 2. Avoid fatty fish. Organic carcinogens such as DDT , PCBs, and dioxin accumulate in fatty tissue. Large carp and catfish tend to have more fat than gamefish. Moreover, the feeding habits of carp, sucker, buffalo, and catfi sh tend to expose them to the sediments, where contaminants are concentrated. In contrast, however, mercury tends to accumulate in muscle tissue and will tend to concentrate in higher levels in gamefish. 3. Wash fish before cleaning. Some contaminants are concentr ated in the mucus, so fish should be washed before they are skinned and filleted. 4. Broil or grill your fish. These cooking techniques allow the fat to drip away. Frying seals the fat and contam inants into the food. 5. Throw away the fat if the pollutant is PCBs, dioxin, chlordane or other organic contaminants. Organic pesticides tend to accumulate in fat tissue, so cleaning the fish so the fat is discarded will provide some protection from these contaminants.

See the attached joint EPA and FDA advisory. Where contaminants are elevated in fish, they may also be present in other aquatic life as well. Therefore, the public is advised to limit or avoi d consumption of other animals such as turtles, crayfish and mussels in water bodies with a fishing advisory.

Peer Review Comme nts and Response to Comments Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 213 Peer Reviewer 1 Peer Review Comment Form Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Kingston Fossil Plant Coal Ash Release Public Health Assessment December 2009 Guide to Reviewers: The objective of peer review conducted by the Office of Science is to ensure the highest quality of science for NCEH/ATSDR studies and results of research; therefore, your comments should be provided with this goal in mind. Unlike othe r peer review processes in which you may have participated, the questions to be addressed fo r NCEH/ATSDR are broadly based so that each reviewer may have a wide lat itude in providing his/her comment s. Any remarks you wish to make that have not been specifically covered by the General Questions Section may be included under question # 2 in the Additional Questions Section. Please note that your unaltered comments will be sent to the investigator for a response. You should receive a copy of the response to the peer review commen ts when they are available. Tennessee Department of Health's and ATSDR's re sponses to comments are in italics following the comment. General Questions: Does the public health assessment adequate ly describe the nature and extent of contamination? The Public Health Assessment t horoughly and completely describes, in appropriate scientific terms and by appropriate technical analyses, the environmental c ontamination that resulted from the December 22, 2008 release of coal ash and water from the TVA Fossil Plant holding pond. The Health Assessment correctly applies scientific methods by comparing measured values of potentially harmful components in the coal ash to known limits and standard values applicable to well-established measures used for public and occ upational health protection. This reviewer did not find fault with the methods or approach used by the authors. The results and findings Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 214 presented in the Health Assessment are highly credible and show careful attention to the scientific method, appropriate methods of anal ysis, and correct inte rpretation of results. No response needed. Thank you. 2. Does the public health assessment adequa tely describe the existence of potential pathways of human exposure? This Public Health Assessmen t describes each of the major pathways for human exposure applicable to the accident and l ong-term consequences, including but not limited to: direct skin contact with coal ash, drinking home water fr om well and municipal sources, breathing air containing coal ash dusts, and ingesting contaminat ed soils. The Assessment correctly identifies each of the primary contaminants (metals and radi onuclides), their chemical forms, pathways for human intake, and known toxicities. Specific comments in detail: a. In Conclusion 12, no specific values of radiation dose to members of the general public are given for comparison to normal background levels. This reviewer made a suggestion under question 5 for rewording this conclusion. It has been so reworded. Because of this rewording and becaus e it is nearly impossible to make radiation and health comprehensible to those who are not he alth physicists, it seem ed best to leave the conclusion as suggested in the rewording. b. On page 15, the chemical form (molecular st ructure) of arsenate should be added. Added c. On page 17, the text states that no ATSDR derived health comparison values are available for thallium. Indicate whether thallium is considered to be a toxic metal. Thallium is indeed a toxic metal (Handbook on Toxicity of Inorganic Compounds). However, all people are daily exposed to normal environmental levels (about 2 micrograms per day as a daily intake). The threshold limit value-time weighted average for thallium in workplace air is 0.1 mg/m 3. Clarify that 1) the EPA screening values are for thallium per kg of coal ash, Done and 2) that the airborne levels of th allium to which people are exposed from environmental sources, including aerosols from the coal ash release, are substantially less than this EPA threshold limit value. Because no thallium has been detected in air at the monitors, this suggestion was not done. The air chapter is already so complex that any additional complexity would not be helpful. Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 215 d. On page 20, section on \"Water,\" the authors n eed to more clearly define what they mean by \"a mix of obvious and more subtle impacts. \" This review recommends deleting that statement. Done e. On page 31, add that water moving thr ough underground rocks and soils may pick up soluble radium as well as magnesium, calcium , and chlorides (salts of radium, calcium, and magnesium). Done f. On what basis is the statement made on pa ge 34, bottom, that \"private well and spring water monitoring may be necessary for several years to assure that there is no impact from the coal ash release? Ot her places in the text suggest that a long-term impact of the release on wells and spring water is not possible (and this reviewer agrees). The text was changed to refl ect the reviewer's comment. g. The statement at the bottom of page 35 is not correct. A high-quality light microscope can obtain a diffraction limit of resolution of as little as 0.2 micrometers. This has been corrected. h. The entire section of the text on \"Introduc tion to Airborne Coal Ash,\" comprising pages 35 to 42, is not very well written, and need s some work. The section describing fine particles is poorly written. Agreed. The section has been extensively rewritte n. This section has been very difficult to write. Course particles are not 2.5 to 10 micrometers. While many organizations do not define 10 microm eter particles as 'coarse', EPA defines PM10 as coarse particles. Particles do not cause deaths from heart and lung disease (this needs to be clarified and put in context because everyone breathes in such particles in normal breathing air). You have a gap between 24 hour exposures and long-term exposures over many years. Particulate air pollution does not imme diately cause heart disease. This has been clarified in the text in accordance with EPA's Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter, 2009. What is meant by \"there is no arithmetic average for PM10\"? and why is that relevant? Another reviewer wanted to know why I did no t specify a PM10 arithmetic average. I added that statement to make it clear that PM10 standards did not have an arithmetic average because EPA had not found correlations between long-term exposure to PM10 and adverse health effects. Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 216 The section describing WHO working gr oup guidelines seems out of place. The WHO paragraph is in a new place. I hope the whole section is now clearer. Overall, there is not a good description of the concepts of \"respirable\" and \"non- respirable\" in terms of aerodynamic diamet er and lung function. Differences between physical diameters and aerodynamic diameter s are not explained or clarified. I have tried to clarify respirabl e and inhalable. I added a little bit about aerodynamic diameter, but, since any valid discussion would include things like St oke's diameter, density, and aerodynamic drag, I did not add any detailed disc ussion. The PHA is not the place for such a discussion. The concept of \"nuisance dust\" needs explanation. A sentence has been added for clarification. This reviewer does not agree with the statem ent on page 37 that \"the metals analyses based on total suspended particulates will overstate the concentration of metals that could be respired\". I disagree with the comment. Total suspended solids measure all particulate matter, up to about 45 m, well outside the range for inhalability. Ther e is no reason to believe that metals would only be in or on the inhalable and respirable parti cles; therefore, the concentration of metals measured would overstate the concen trations that matter biologically. The section under \"routes of exposure\" on page 37 seems to be overstated (that if the coal ash should become airborne, the coal ash dust and metals constituents could impact all of these people\". How and why would this be the case. Why make th at case if it is not realistic? What are the adverse health effects that are bei ng described here? This has been reworded. i. At the bottom of page 41, the detection li mit for arsenic is not given. Rephrase the statement pertaining to the time period from February 12 to March 23, which could have as easily been negligible as \"greater than the health comparison value.\" Done. j. Under the section on dust, first sentence, page 51, give num erical values to the \"huge amount\" of coal ash. Done k. Page 57, restate the bullet that \"concentr ation of radionuclides ar e below the regulatory limits for concentrations or radionuclides in air and water (not \"radiation\"). Done Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 217 l. Bottom of page 57, if exposure to particul ate matter in air could result, what kind of harm to health would result? This has been clarified. 3. Are all relevant environmenta l and toxicological data (i .e., hazard identification, exposure assessment) being appropriately used? The Health Assessment provides data from a larg e number of different types of environmental measurements. Health comparison values are also given for compar ison, including the ATSDR minimal risk level, the environmental media ev aluation guide, the cance r risk evaluation guide, and the ATSDR-derived reference dose media evaluation guide. Also presented are the Environmental Protection Agency's Reference Do se guides, maximum contaminant level guides, National Ambient Air Quality Standards reference values, and the State of Tennessee water quality criteria. All the environmental measur ement and referenced toxicological standards appear to have been obtained and applied correctly and seem to meet a high standard of scientific rigor. No response needed. 4. Does the public health asse ssment accurately and clearly communicate the health threat posed by the site? The Health Assessment does accurately and cl ear communicate the deta ils of the holding pond failure, the flood of water and coal ash that disp ersed along its pathway an d flowed into adjacent rivers, the short-term and long-term impacts on th e environment, and all actions taken to mitigate and characterize the release. The Assessment car efully documents all he alth risks associated with contaminants in the coal ash, their envi ronmental pathways, risks to human health, and implications of exposure. Minor corrections and suggestions for improvement are given above in this reviewer's response to question 2. Th is Public Health Assessment is quite thorough, and has not omitted critical details. It appears to be an honest and thorough scientific analysis of all the health threats involved and th e likelihood that any of these mi ght have risen to a level of concern for health effects in the exposed human population. The language used in the Assessment is clear, albeit rather lengthy and detailed for the average reader. Thank you. I have tried to make the report easier to read. I hope I have hit the compromise between simplicity and putting in enough de tails to explain the reasoning used. 5. Are the conclusions and recommendations approp riate in view of the site's condition as described in the public health assessment? This Health Assessment provides a comprehensiv e set of conclusions and recommendations. The Summary, Introduction, and Overview provide the main conclusions concerning the overall impact of this environmental event, the steps taken to mitigate the spread of coal ash contaminants. These are summarized as 16 main conclusions with a statement on Future sampling and analysis activities to ensure the heal th, safety, and welfare of the affected public. Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 218 Conclusion 1 could be clarified a nd strengthened by stating precise ly how people in the path of the coal ash release could have been harmed (for example, by burial under the mud flow), to ensure that this statement is not confused w ith potential harm from low-level environmental exposures to the metal cont aminants in the coal ash. Done Appertaining to Conclusion 2, this reviewer does not believe that the evidence is strong that casual touching the coal ash could cause local sk in irritation. Rather, it would require a long- term dermal contact (for example, entrapment under a bandage) to result in any significant localized skin irritation. Certai nly, the Assessment should not infer that skin irritation could result from casual touching of the coal ash. This has been clarified. Conclusion 5 could be clarifie d and strengthened by stating precisely how people could be harmed by using the Emory river at the site of the coal ash release (for example, by trespassing and being crushed by a front-end load er), to ensure that this statement is not confused with the potential effects of low-level exposure to coal ash metals. Done Conclusion 9 states that the Tennessee Department of Health cannot conclude whether breathing coal ash from December 22 through December 27, 2008, harmed people's health. However, the local weather conditions and the high moisture content of the coal as h would have precluded airborne exposure to nearby residents, as explained in the report. Th is conclusion could be restated in such as way as to explain that cond itions were such during th at period to preclude any significant airborne exposure levels that could have harmed people's health. The conclusion has been restated. Conclusion 12 describes the small amount of radi ation from the coal ash that would not be expected to harm people's health. This reviewer suggests alternative wording, as follows: \"The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that any exposure to radiation from the small amount of naturally occurring radionuclide s present in coal ash, even in the more concentrated forms characteristic of coal ash, would be too small to impart a radiation dose to people that would be significantly greater than the normal, everyday background exposure radiation to which all people are exposed.\" Done 6. Are there any other comments about the public health assessment that you would like to make? The Health Assessment provides a s econd column of text to the right of the main text. This second column explains all acronyms and abbreviations used in the accompanying main text. While the second column is a helpful feature, this reviewer would prefer a simple correction: Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 219 simply spell out all acronyms in the main te xt, and eliminate the extra column of acronym explanation. That change woul d simplify reading and review. I gave chapters to people who had not seen the p ublic health assessment and asked if the column with explanations or spelling out all the acronyms would be better. They all said that spelling out the acronyms made the senten ces too long and cumbersome so that they forgot the purpose of the sentence after wading through the long names. So, I think the column to the right of the text is the better way to deal with th e issue, although it is not perfect. Are there any other comments? Overall, the Health Assessment is well wri tten. Exceptions are stated under Question 2. Additional Questions: 1. Are there any comments on ATSDR's peer review process? The ATSDR peer review process is excellent. ATSDR works hard to identify well-qualified reviewers.Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 220 Peer Reviewer 2 PEER REVIEW COMMENT FORM Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Kingston Fossil Plant Coal Ash Release PUBLIC HEALTH ASSESSMENT DECEMBER 2009 GUIDE TO REVIEWERS : The objective of peer review conducted by the Office of Science is to ensure the highest quality of science for NCEH/ATSDR studies and results of rese arch; therefore, your comments should be provided with this goal in mind.

Does the public health assessment adequately describe the nature and extent of contamination? Yes for the most part. Overall the report is a th oughtful presentation of exis ting data collected by a variety of agencies and NGOs. Some of the information could be presented more clearly using figures an d graphical methods to present the data and give readers a cleare r picture of the contamination over time. In particular it would help if the scales on th e aerial photos and maps were consistent across figures: for example while Figures 1 and 2 show more or less the same area, it is difficult to put see how these relate to Figure 3, for example, wh ich does a poor job of showing where the spill is in relation to these previous figures. The scale changes again slightly when one gets to Figures 4 through 11 also have the same issue: pick on e scale that fits the in formation and then use it consistently. For water sampling also show the dire ction that the Rivers flow with arrows: it is not at all clear to the na\u00efve read er looking at these. This is es pecially important if and when rivers might flow backwards (as mentioned in the report) and if the ash flow is not all in the Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 221 direction of the river. Labeling of the individual rivers is also needed: I've never managed to figure out which was which. This hinders the unde rstanding of the extent of the contamination. For the first two figures, we used aerial photographs supplied by T VA. There is really nothing I can do about the scales being different, although I know it would be be tter if they were identical. For Figure 3, I have tried to emphas ize the spill area so it can be easily seen. The purpose of Figure 3 is to show how all the ri vers interrelate to form Watts Bar Reservoir. I found the water flow to be very confusing, too. The other figures have different scales because the sampling locations for the different types of samples and for different agencies cover widely different geographic areas, even though they all center on th e spill area. I have added river names and flow directions to the river maps. Many of the m aps came from other agencies so there is little I can do about the scales. The report does not make effective use of graphi cal methods to display, in particular, the water quality data over time. There are small and hard to read graphs on page 25, for example, that try to do this by displaying trends in concentration of pollutants relative to health-based standards. Most of the data in the multiple tables in the ap pendices should be given this treatment as well, as most of them will likely show the bolus effect during the release and subsequent fall in concentrations over time as pollutants are diluted. This would also allo w the report authors to summarize the quantitative uncertaintie s through use of error bars and/ or coefficients of variation on various analytical methods, to the extent that this information is available. I have added text to reinforce the fact that concentrations of metals other than arsenic and lead near the spill site early on never were elevated or were elevated for a brief time. I have enlarged the 3 figures to make them more friendly. I have added background concentrations to these figures, as well as the health comparison values. I have added two figures for selenium in the Emory and Clinch Rivers and one fo r iron in the Emory River as exa mples of concentrations not changing much through time. Hist orically, no one has sampled se lenium in the water column anywhere in Watts Bar Reservoir or outside its area of influence in the Emory River. Therefore, I was not able to show normal background for selenium. 2. Does the public health assessment adequately describe the existence of potential pathways of human exposure? Yes, though it seems more focused on cold weathe r pathways and does not mention extensively pathways that can occur in warmer weather as the site is/has been cleane d up over time. I realize that the report is focused on the immediate afte rmath of the spill and likely exposures around the time of event. It should mention if these events are likely to be addresse d in future reports, and the long term controls monitoring data that might be used to a ddress these issues. Clearly no one is going to be fishing around the spill any tim e soon, but as the cleanup proceeds what might reasonably be expected to happy seems germane to the report. The report is looking at short-term and long-term potential health e ffects. Of course, for surface water more people will have exposure in the su mmer when they can swim and ski. Fishing goes on all year. The introductory comments about the spil l were talking about winter because that is when the spill happened. However, the discussion for surface water was geared toward protecting people for recreational use of Watts Bar Reservoir, which is more prevalent in Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 222 summer. All the conclusions were based on yea r-round exposure potential. Air concentrations are independent of the temperatur e, but could be related to dry conditions. The discussion of air is appropriate for any season - TVA needs to keep ash particulate out of the air. This will be the final Public Health Assessment. Other reports will be written in the event something goes badly wrong during the final stages of cleanup. Most of the ash is out of the Emory River itself. It will take several years for all the ash to be removed fr om the inlets. We will keep a watch on all sampling data until everything is back to way it was before the spill. 3. Are all relevant environmental and toxicologi cal data (i.e., hazard identification, exposure assessment) being appropriately used? Yes, and for the most part these are carefully documented. It would be useful to mention in the summary on page 7 how much ash ingestion is being assumed and put that 200 mg number in context for those readers who are not familiar with SI units. But the HID and tox values are from peer reviewed sources and the standard e quations used are applied appropriately. Done 4. Does the public health assessment accurate ly and clearly communicate the health threat posed by the site? Yes. But I also think it would be useful to do some of the data pres entation I mentioned under answer 1 above, which would allow comparison to background levels over time (as opposed to health/based standards). Since there are few acute health-based standards this would help readers picture the relatively rapid short term changes in environmental concentrations relative to typical concentrations in water and air over time. This exercise is separate from figures that compare concentrations to health based standards. I have added background concentrations to three figures about TDEC's monitoring of arsenic and lead in surface water. I have added two representative figures for selenium and iron. 5. Are the conclusions and recommendations appropriate in view of the site's condition as described in the public health assessment? My main quibble is that the conclusions and recommendations should follow one another in series: i.e., Conclusion 1, reco mmendation 1, etc. Both conclusions are recommendations are clear for the most part, though th e section on \"The Future\" is ju st a list of all the involved agencies and does not provide much detail on th e sort of long term environmental quality monitoring and assessments that will be done. This reviewer concurs that biomonitoring of residents is unlikely to be useful and that resources and en ergy should be on dust suppression, environmental quality monitoring, and exploration of potential warm weather pathways of exposure that might result form fugitive dust release or the continued presence of ash in the river. Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 223 I have reformatted the conclusions and recomme ndations to be in series. ATSDR usually requests that the two sections be separate, but in this case ha ving two sections only confuses things. 6. Are there any other comments about the public health assessment that you would like to make? No. 7. Are there any other comments? No. Additional Questions: 1. Are there any comments on ATSDR's peer review process? It would be easier for reviewer s if you provided both a hard copy and a PDF or some other searchable document type. I am sorry that you did not know about our website: http://health.state.tn.us/coalashspill.htm .

Tennessee Department of Health's and ATSD's responses to comments are in italics following the comment. General Questions: Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 225 The purpose for TDH/ATSDR in writing the Public Health Assessment (PHA) is to draw conclusions about past, present, and future publi c health implications of the spill, not for remediation or environmental restoration protocols. I agree that the tables are cumbersome. However, the actual data needs to be in the PHA so that people can see what the data are and make comparisons across agencies if they wish to. For the surface water section, I have amended the three little figur es for arsenic and lead by making them bigger and adding background information to the figures. I have al so added two figures for iron and selenium as representative of concentrations of metals not being increased o ver time or only increased for a short period of time. The conclusion section is organized by route of exposure and has a brief discussion of associated with each conclusion. The conclusion section an d the conclusions in the summary need to be concise, with detailed discussion of how we ca me to the conclusion in the Discussion section. The discussion of pathways of exposure is by section: ingestion and de rmal contact with ash, exposure to surface water, groundwater, municipal wa ter, air, radiation. There is a summary of public health implications that summarizes conclusions based on route of exposure on pages 56 and 57. The survey used soon after the release was an em ergency response effort with the purposes of finding out if anyone had unusual symptoms and to make contact with people. The emergency use of such a survey is not meant to be objective and scientifically rigorous. Just making contact with the people affected was just as important as the questions asked. We have had conflicting comments from reviewers about the vom iting data, so I will live it as is. Appendix E: Peer Review Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 226 The conclusion section is written in accordance w ith the latest ATSDR guidance. Conclusions 9, 10c, and 11 are not speculative in a public health sense. In most scie ntific fields, data is rigorously obtained and conclusions from individual research effo rts are clearly drawn from the experiments. In environmental public healt h, toxicological experiments and epidemiologic studies are probably the most scie ntifically rigorous areas. Each toxicology experiment and each epidemiologic study have exact data and fair ly exact conclusions. However, when we put all the experiments and epidemiologi cal studies together to figure out the public health impact of exposure, we lose the precision and accuracy. Fo r the sake of protecting public health, we are forced to make decisions and draw conclusions th at are not firm and can be seen as speculative by practitioners of more exact sciences. In other words, we have to make decisions even when data is less than desirable. Risk assessment is not an exact science even though it uses the scientific method. We recognize that Conclusion 1 is not based on a rigorous scientific revi ew. In dealing with communities affected by events such as this, we feel it is important to acknowledge and emphasize that the community has experienced something big, scary, and unexpected, and that could have been life-threatening. The practice of public health is about more than data and facts. Any report written for the public has to acknowledge that people are im pacted - bodies, minds, and emotions. The reports must have some soul, otherwise th ey are purely academic exercises. TDH has and continues to follow the results of all environmental sampling and analysis done at the spill site. All data conti nue to support our conclusions. Comments 5., 6., and 7. It would not be good environm ental public health practice to eliminate conclusions 1, 9, 10c, and 11. The conclusions are based on facts and are justifiable. Conclusion 14 is about the community survey, so I think leaving the conclu sion as is would be better. Appendix F.

This report is a remarkable piece of work given the magnitude of the spill; the multiplicity of agencies, organization and residents involved; and the number of data sets analyzed. The r eading level is satisfactory though the complexity of the problem situation makes reading a challenge. I don't know how you can simplify it without abdicating your obligation to science and the public. The following comments are meant to raise questions and suggestion improvements to strengthen the report. At the beginning of the report (e.g., in the introdu ction on p.xvi) include the timeframe covered by the report (e.g. from the time of the spill through so many m onths). In this way, it will be clear to the reader that this report addresses the acute and intermediate phase of potential contaminant exposure; and the understanding the impact of the spill on wildlife, work ers, and people remaining in the area will require long term study. This may help alleviate disappointment among those who are looking for a more holistic view of the situation. If it is possible to identif y who will be responsible for producing a report that synthesizes all relevant analyses, please do so. Tennessee Department's of Health and ATSDR's responses to comments are in italics. Page C o m m e n t xxxi Conclusion #13. Please provide the URL links for the two reports on selenium (EPA Science Review Panel and the US Corps of Engineers). [This also applies to page 60, paragraph 3 and page 77, paragraph 1] Done 6 Paragraph 3, line 3. Replace the words controlled by with the words depends on. Done 8 Paragraph 2, line 3. Change the words can get to can be reset. [Also, page 193, paragraph 3, line 3]. Done 16-17 Other health comparison values. I do not disagree with the exclusion of the elements iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium from the review. (I have no opinion on thallium.) However, the reasoning needs to be updated to reflect current nutritional guidelines from the Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 229 National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Institut e of Medicine. Cite the following National Academy Press references for the reader: Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc (2000) Dietary Reference Intakes of Calcium, P hosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride (1997) Dietary Reference Intakes for Water, Pota ssium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate (2005) IRON. Although ATSDR and EPA have not published toxicity for iron, NAS has addressed questions pertaining to its role in nutrition and human health that includes estimated tolerable upper intake levels (UL) of 40 mg/day for children and 45 mg/day for adults. Also, please make cl ear that the EPA health compar ison value is based on the quantity of iron in soil. Would the read \"55,000 mg/kg of soil?\" CALIUM. Pica (eating dirt) is characteristic of the young child. Contrasting the \"estimated intake from soil accidently consumed\" with the recommended dietary allowance for an adolescent is not a valid comparison. Also, the current dietary reference intake for calcium is 500 mg/day for the child 1-3 year s, 800 mg/day for child 4-8, and 1300 mg/day for adolescent. The tolerable upper intake (UL) for children from 1-18 yrs. And adults (all ages) is 2500 mg/day. MAGNESIUM. Likewise, there are new values for magnesium intake. NAS does discuss the magnesium (65 mg of supplementary magnesium a day for children 1 through 3 years of age). POTASSIUM and SODIUM. The fact that potas sium and sodium are essential nutrients that ubiquitous in foods and salts is not an acceptable reason to exclude them from this review. Find another reason. Are the levels of potassium and sodium in ash, surface water, and groundwater similar to background levels in soil and the Tennessee River? This might be an acceptable reason. Done 18 Paragraph 2, line 5. please cite a reference/link for the EPA estimate for accidental ingestion of dust/dirt. Done 24 Paragraph 3. What does this mean? \"Concentrations of dissolved antimony and beryllium were below the detection limits at all sampling points on each date sampled, but it is impossible to know if they were above the criteria.\" This has been clarified in the text. The detection limit was higher than the water quality criteria. So we cannot know if the true concentrations were insignificant or if they were above the water quality criteria. 26 Paragraph 3. In reference to the sentence \"...historical contamination with PCBs and mercury (not related to TVA activities).\" Do we really know that TVA activities did not contribute to observed PCB and mercury contamination? Cite a source. Done Please cite relevant ATSDR reports that speak to legacy contamination in this area (e.g., reports on White Oak Creek radionuclides and PCBs). This has implications for future Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 230 dredging activities that should be clearly ackn owledge in this report. [These comments also apply to page xxv, paragraphs 3 and 4; page 74, conclusion number 8, paragraph 3; and page 80, number 8, paragraph 2]. I cited the TDH dose reconstruction report s that ATSDR used in their assessments. 30-31.1 Do you have data that demonstrate that \"iron levels were at levels normally present in the Tennessee River?\" Refer reader to appropriate tables (e.g. Tables 33-37). Those sources are cited in the text, with the ranges found. 51 In the last section on dust: This would be a good place to mention the above average rainfall that occurred this year (approximately 12 inches) as a boon to dust suppression. Also, provide a link for the composition and safety of vinyl acrylic emulsion. Done 62 Paragraph 1, lines 2-3 and paragraph 5, lines 3-4 are incomplete sentences, and the meaning is not clear. This has been corrected 63 Syndromic surveillance. This analysis is misleading. It suggest that there was no change in health status. This study does not prove it. It only demonstrates that this method does not show it. Speculation about concurrent infect ious diseases provides interesting context. However, the large number of people with infectious diseases would overwhelm the relatively small number of people showing up from Swan Pond especially those who were forced to relocate and sought health care in disparate locations. This section has been removed since it added no useful information. 65 Table I: Please add a column with numbers of people and overall N. This will help overcome the omission of a demographic analysis of Swan Pond community in this report. Done 74 Number 8, paragraph 3. Please include a reference/link to fish advisories with cooking tips to lower contaminant levels. It is imperative to in clude specific information especially for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding babies. Perhaps this information should be included in an appendix. Done 76 Number 13. Although I do not belong to any NGOs, I find it quite comforting to see independent confirmation of findings. Omit the wo rds \"limited usefulness.\" Your appraisal of NGO methods, results, and reports is sensitively worded and may help build trust and goodwill among people in the NGOs and the community. This has been reworded. 77 Number 14. The Community Health Survey was done soon after the spill (thank you!) It would be appropriate to note this was monitored over time. I venture to say that as reality set in more people experienced stress and anxiety both in Swan Pond and the community at large. It was not pretty! We have much to learn about the impact of environmental catastrophes on mental health and well-being. This was a one-time event done as part of the emergency response. I have clarified the wording in the PHA. TVA had a contract with Ridgeview Community Mental Health Center to assist people with these kinds of issues. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 231 79-82 The section on recommendations is really rough. Recommendations do not have to correspond one on one with conclusions. I have incorporated the conclusions and recommendations into one section. I hope this makes it all read better. 79 Combine paragraph 2 of recommendations #2 with recommendations #3 and #4. I have incorporated the conclusions and recommendations into one section. I hope this makes it all read better. 81 Recommendation #12. Mention that monitoring of radionuclides will be stepped up when dredging occurs. A clear statement about t he interagency agreement that governs this activity would be good. I added information about the interagency agreement. Recommendation #15. Combine paragraph 1 with recommendation #11. Paragraph 2 duplicates recommendation #14. Recommendation #16 duplicates #14 and #15, paragraph 2. I have incorporated the conclusions and recommendations into one section. I hope this makes it all read better. 82 Will TDH also work with TWRA? See htt://tn.gov/twra/Kingston.html. This website indicates that \"assessment of the impact of this releas e on wildlife resources and habitat will require repeated sampling and evaluation ov er the next three to five years. TWRA will coordinate with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS ) and other resource agencies to assess the long-term impact of contaminants on other w ildlife resources in the area including mammals, bird life, and aquatic species.\" TWRA coordinates their fish sampling with TDEC . TDH will work with both agencies as needed. Are there other cooperative agreements that should be acknowledge in this report? Will NIOSH report on workers' health? What is the ongoing role for ATSDR? We need ATSDR! We will continue to be a cooperative agreement state with ATSDR. As such, we will continue to do environmental health investigations and write the reports. ATSDR will review all our work to make sure it is scientifically sound. ATSDR also is a resource for TDH. Their expertise in environmental toxicology is absolutely vital to us. I do not believe that NIOSH has bee n called in so they are unlikely to make a report. EPA has mandated that the site and site-workers meet all OSHA regul ations and standards. All workers have had the 40- hour HAZWOPER Training. Air monitoring on-site ha s demonstrated that OSHA requirements for silica are being met. The Site Worker Safety and Health Plan was revised on February 10, 2010. This revision as well as subsequent revisions of the SWSHP inco rporates the specific requirements of 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.120; Hazardou s Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER). Plans written prior to this revi sion were not required to address the HAZWOPER requirements; however they were adequately protective of employee safety and health. The major changes in this and future revisions primarily addr ess terminology, work zones, worker training and medical monitoring requirements as required b y HAZWOPER. 89-103 Figures 1-16: Nice photographs! Light dots show up better than dark dots. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 232 105-110 In Tables 1 through 6, health comparison values for calcium and magnesium are given as EHN (essential human nutrient). If you are not able to derive an appropriate comparison value from National Academy of Sciences public ation (1997), it would be better to use NA (not available). Also, a sampling date needs to be added to the header of these tables. I used NA in the tables with a footnote to see the text. 183 Please check the values for sodium in Table 34. Is the order of magnitude off? Do you need to move the decimal point? You are correct. Thank you for finding the error. COMMENTS on the 4 page Summary: 2 The write up of \"What do the environmental data indicate?\" Does not say that the spill occurred in the middle of the night in the dead of winter. That would make the summer scenario more meaningful. 3-4 The conclusions section needs synthesis. A narrative would be better\u2014or at least fewer enumerated conclusions. Abbreviating the conclusion statements diminished the author's sensitivity to the reader (e.g., number 13). This list has no soul. Conclusion #16. Why even mention this ty pe of routine screening when ORAU-Vanderbilt screening activities have been made available? The summary has been redone. I hope it is better and has some soul. Copy to EEP-TDH 1/15/10 Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 233 Public Commenter 2 Comments on the Public Health Assessment for Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Kingston Fossil Plant Coal Ash Release. 1. The title to the document needs to be more descriptive than Public Health Assessment- the exact title of the document is unclear. Response: The title is set by ATSDR. All their public health assessments are named in this way. 2. The sections and subsections of the document need to be numbered for quick reference. Response: Done 3. There is a continued repetition of the phrase \"no continued contact wi th ash\" within the document- how true is this assumption? Response: TDH based the validity of the phras e on personal observation, reports from TDH's regional environmental epidemiologist, EPA, and TD EC. All agencies are reinvestigating this in light of the approaching summer season and the opening of the Emory River to make sure that people using the rivers for recreation will not have any harmful exposures. 4. Clearly explain the relationship between the Environmental Epidemiology Program (Tennessee Department of Health) and the AT SDR. How does the funding flow for the work of this report? Response: ATSDR currently funds 29 stat es and 1 Indian Community through competitive cooperative agreement applications. TDH is in its 5th year of its second round of funding for the cooperative agreement for site-spe cific activities. These acti vities include public health consultations, public health assessments, and education/community involvement. Currently ATSDR provides funding for two health asse ssors in TDH. Other staff in EEP are funded through CDC Public Health Emergency Prepare dness funds (2 positions), CDC's Environmental Health Specialist Network (1 position), National Toxic Substances Incidents Program (2 positions), and the State (1 position). The mon ey flows from ATSDR to TDH just like other grant-funded programs. The money is drawn down as it is used in accordance with the yearly budget. ATSDR has not provided Tennessee with any extra funds to work on the TVA ash spill. As a cooperative agreement state, TDH and EEP do environmental invest igations and write the reports, which are reviewed and certified by ATSD R, before they are released to the public. 5. Provide a chart (in addition to text) pr oviding the following information: sampling agency, media, sampling dates (span of dates discussed in the report) , number of samples, standards used (TVA vs. EPA vs. TDEC), etc. Response: Done. It is at the end of the introduction in the Discussion. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 234 6. What is the latest data used in this particul ar report? It should be noted in a prominent place for each agency. Response: The latest data is detailed in the summary table discussed in comment 5 and specified in the text and on the data tabl es. The dates are generally fr om the time of the spill through spring of 2009. An addendum at the end of the main report will summarize data findings through spring 2010. 7. There is an excessive use of acronyms (see page 8 paragraph 4). Side bars are extremely useful and well done. Response: There are a lot of acronyms. When we tried writing out everything in full, the sentences were so long and complex that they were not intelligible. We are glad you found the sidebars helpful. 8. Why were PM 10 monitors used instead of PM 2.5 monitors (pages 41 and 44) from January 1 st forward? Response: EPA began testing with portable PM 2.5 monitors. TVA was using portable PM10 monitors to take instantaneous readings through out the community, in addition to its FRM and TEOM monitors. EPA switched to the portable PM10 monitors so it could validate comparable TVA data. 9. In the summary introduction and conc lusions (pages xvi to xxxvi) the Basis for decision for each conclusion does not always provide evidence, proof, or documentation as a basis; often the conclusion is just re-stated. Response: I have tried to clarify the bas is for decision for several conclusions. 10. The Next Steps sections often do not list any steps and do not indi cate how the agencies will proceed. Sometimes this section lists what has been done which are not \"next steps.\" This is frustrating to the public because this is a section the public is particularly interested in. Response: I apologize. ATSDR has set the format for the overview sect ion of public health assessments after a good deal of research. The layout and formatting are done from their guidance. For some conclusions, such as Conc lusion 1, in which everything to do with that conclusion has already been done, there are no Next Steps. In those case s, I have changed Next Steps to What Was Done. I hope that makes the document less frustrating. 11. Much of the information in the document is too general and self eviden t to be very useful to the community. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 235 Response: TDH has tried very hard to make the doc ument specific to the s ituation near KIF. We did not want the document to be generic. The data discussions we re quite detailed. It is true that some conclusions are self-evident after looking at the data. For instance, air data from all the agencies indicated that parti culate matter was not elevated in the ambient air surrounding the ash spill. The obvious conclusion is that public health was not harmed from exposure to particulate matter. The conclusion is obvious, but the analysis that led to the conclusion was not obvious, simple, or general. 12. Clearly define the purpose and limitations of the document toward the beginning of the document; e.g., immediate harm assessed vs. long term hazard; human health only; for purposes of screening only vs. a detailed health study. What the public needs and wants from a public health study is clearly different from what is provided in this public health screening/assessment. Response: I have attempted to clarify the purpos es by addition of a paragraph in the Summary and the Background sections. The purposes of an ATSDR Public Health Assessment were explained at a public meeting he ld for that intention on June 11, 2009. The purpose of Public Health Assessment is different fr om the purpose of a health study . This difference is not a limitation, just a difference. At the meeting, differences in a Public Health Assessment and the clinical examinations of ORAU and Vanderbilt were explained. 13. Are any additional, more detailed ATSDR studies expected? Response: At this time, no ATSD R studies are expected. If th e situation changes, of course, ATSDR and TDH will respond in an appropriate way. 14. Page 12, Calcium is listed as a metal with con centrations higher in ash than soil; however calcium is not listed in the preceding para graph listing the metals found in coal ash (inconsistent presentation of data). Response: The list of metals in the first par agraph under Discussion, Coal Ash, Introduction, is a list of what toxicologists call heavy metals. These are the metals that are toxic at certain concentrations. When TVA analyzed the coal ash, they also did analysis for some metals that are not considered toxic and are not termed, he avy metals. Calcium was one these metals. 15. Page 15, the 4th sentence on in the first paragraph re peats verbatim a paragraph on page 9 Response: This is true. We t hought it was worded well th e first time, so we re peated it when the subject of TCLP was brought up again. 16. In drinking water, surface water and groundwater sections mention the times required for migration can vary greatly and may require years. Sampling in th e short term provides very little information for long term impacts. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 236 Response: In surface water, it takes some time fo r metals to leach out of the coal ash. The time it takes is dependent upon the characteristics of the particular coal ash. Sampling now assures us that metals in Watts Bar Reservoir from the co al ash spill are not at elevated levels. It is important to remember that merc ury in sediments and fish are eleva ted from past activities at the Oak Ridge Reservation. The ash is being removed fr om the river at a very fast rate. It will be out of the Emory River by this summer. It ma y take two-to-four years to remove all the ash from the three impacted sloughs. Monitoring on a regula r, frequent basis will continue in Watts Bar Reservoir until all the ash is removed and the ar ea restored as specified in TDEC's and EPA's Administrative Order and Agreemen t on Consent of May 6, 2009. The wells and springs within 4 miles of the ash spill have not been impacted by leaching of metals from coal ash, even though the dredge ce lls have been in existence for years. TDEC will take regular samples from groundwater to make sure that they are not being affected by coal ash. 17. Page 44, 2nd paragraph, explain why the air moni tor was operated between 3 and 9 hours and not the same amount of time each day. Response: EPA wanted to monitor the air in as many places as they could with a limited number of monitors. 18. Page 14, last 3 paragraphs, how were the aver ages calculated for arsenic (TVA, EPA, and TDEC)? Response: In answering this question, I looked at the raw data in Excel spreadsheets. In looking at it with fresh eyes, I noticed that various kinds of as h sampling were included in the dataset. I calculated new sta tistics based on ash samples taken in residential areas. The numbers changed, but the impact of the data did not change. The newly calculated numbers are now represented in the paragraph and in Table 2 at the end of the document. The averages were calculated the usual way, adding the values and dividing by the number of values. This was done in Excel using the formula for average over a range of cell. Concentrations of all arsenic samples were above the method detection limit, so the issue of using one-half the limit of detection did not arise. 19. There is some question about the adequacy of sampling for the Community Health survey. - Response: TDH and NCEH staff members tried to reach each home within an approximate 1.5 mile radius of the spill. The survey was not a scientific study, but an emergency response. The table within the discussion of the survey now includes numbers of people in addition to the percentages. Appendix F.

Page xx, Conclusion 3, Basis for Decision, seco nd sentence \" The ash has been fenced, clearly marking the areas with coal ash.\" This statement does not address the coal ash that contaminated the shore lines and was washed on land during the initial tsunami, and the coal ash that is commingled with th e native soil and river sediment. Response: The data indicate t hat there was very little comingli ng of ash and native soil except right along the shoreline. The initial wave of ash filled part of the Emory River, three sloughs and the lower-lying land with the road, railroad tract, C hurch Slough, and the peninsula between Berkshire and Swan pond Sloughs. I observed orange fencing in all these areas in January 2009. 2. Page xxii, second to last sentence, and last se ntence needs to be updated to reflect the closing of the Emory River from mile marker 0 to 6. Response: This has been done. 3. Page xxiii, Conclusion 6 states \"water from the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants will not harm people's he alth because the raw and finish ed water have continuously met drinking water standards.\" However, in the Next Steps section, the recommendation is for TDEC to continue to sample and analyze raw and finished wa ter. Why does this need to be done if the water has been good so far, what is the basis for continued sampling? What is the possibility of the samples not bei ng good at some point in the future? Response: The drinking water has been free of coal ash contaminant s. It is highly unlikely that this will change. The recommendation for continue d sampling is probably overly cautious, but it is prudent to make sure that nothing changes and so that we can know for sure that the water remains safe. 4. Page xxiv, Conclusion 7, \"using we lls or spring water within four miles of the coal ash release will not harm people's he alth.\" The Next Step section recommends TDEC continue to take samples of ground water from private well s and springs for analysis periodically..\" How long will samples continue to be taken? What private wells are on a long term sampling plan? Page 34 states \"It sometimes takes days, months or years for an outside influence to show up in the groundwater of an area.\" TDEC is only sampling wells two times a year for several years. This does not seem adequate. Residents within the spill area should be included on the sampling plan if requested by the resident. Response: The wells and springs within 4 mile s of the ash spill have not been impacted by leaching of metals from coal as h, even though the dredge cells have been in existence for years. TDEC will take regular samples from groundwater to make sure that they are not being affected by coal ash. TDEC would be amenable to requests from residents. TDEC will determine how many years to continue to take samples in coll aboration with other agencies to make sure that the public is protected. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 238 5. Page xxvi, Conclusion 9, Basis fo r Decision, and Next Steps indicates \"No agencies took air samples in this period\" and \"since no air m easurements were obtained during the time period between December 22 and December 27, 2008. However, the statement on page 3, 2nd paragraph, contradicts this statement by stating \"On December 22, 2008, government agencies .... Began collecting samples of soil, as h, and drinking water. TVA began daily real time air sampling at many locations.\" Response: I clarified both the conclusion and th e text on page 3. The list of the types of environmental sampling was deleted fr om page 3, paragraph 2. Ash sampling began immediately, but there was a delay for TVA in beginning air sampling until December 28. EPA began some air monitoring on-site, but not off-site, on December 27, 2008. 6. Page xxvii, Conclusion 10b, \"The TDEH concl udes that no harm to people's health is expected from occasionally breathing coal ash if it should become airborne for short periods of time.\" What is the defin ition of \"short period of time\"? Response: I have not found a precise definition for 'short-term' in any references, including Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter authored by the National Center for Environmental Assessment - RTP, Division of Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Tr iangle Park, NC. I have inferred that, for particulate matter, short-term refers to exposur es of an hour or two to one day to peak concentrations. Extremely high l evels of air pollution, such as the London fog of 1952 or the episode in Donora, Pennsylvania, in the mid-1950s , can have very quick effects. Those most at risk from short-term exposures are the el derly and those persons with pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory illness. It is thought that long-term ex posure to less than peak concentrations have the most potential for harm. These are the definitions asso ciated with the EPA NAAQS: The annual average standard for PM2.5 is the 3-year average of the weighted ann ual mean PM2.5 concentrations from single or multiple community-oriented monitors that must not exceed 15.0 g/m3. The 24-hour average for PM2.5 is of the 98th pe rcentile of 24-hour concentrations at each population-oriented monitor within an area that must not exceed 35 g/m3. There will be times in most area s in which the reading for one day is over the 24-hour average of 35 g/m\u00b3, but the area meets the st andard in terms of the differ ent kinds of averages. EPA's National Ambient Air Quality St andards and the World Health Organi zation's guideline were set to be protective of public health. 7. Page 16, Conclusion 16, Basis for Decision, \"No ha rm is expected from breathing the air as long as adequate dust suppression measures ar e in place.\" What happens when \"adequate\" dust suppression is not in place? Response: TDEC has in place a system to notif y people if concentrations of particulate matter are elevated so that people can stay indoors or leave the area temporarily. The health impacts would be the same as when particulate matter is elevated for any other reason. TVA, EPA, and TDEC are taking every known precaution to keep the ash from getting air-borne. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 239 8. Page 60, 4th paragraph, \"Because no one is drinking this water or using this water for recreation, there are no public health concerns at this time.\" What specific area does this statement refer to? Parts of the Emory River outside of the closed area (1.5 to 3.0 mile marker) as well as the Clinch and Tennessee Rive rs were used for recr eation last summer. What are the concerns since the water was used for recreation, and will be used for recreation this summer too? Response: That paragraph refers to the site of the spill. Last summer, Watts Bar Reservoir was safe for recreation except in the closed area. This summer the river may be open because the ash will have been removed from the Emory Rive r and the heavy equipment will be gone. EPA, TDEC, and TDH are currently revising last yea r's advisory to reflect the new conditions. 9. Page 64, Community Health Survey, \"324 residences within a 1.5 mile radius of the spill\" were visited. How many homes are located in a 1.5 mile radius of the spill? I know of many families who were not contacted who live in this area. Response: I regret that not all families were able to be contacted. Efforts were made to administer the survey to everyone w ithin the 1.5 mile radius of the spill. This survey was a part of the emergency response and was not intended to be a scientific st udy. We identified 324 homes within 1.5 miles and visite d each one. We were able to interview 368 people in 170 of those homes. March 8, 2010 Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 240 Public Commenter Health question 1/4/2010 5:58 PM >>> I have a question regarding the health effects related to coal ash. Has there been a document ed occurrence where exposure to coal ash has had negative health effects? If so, could you give me details? I lived near the TVA spill and have participated in the ORAU study. I assume there has been a revi ew of research and related health studies on this subject. Looking over the PHA dra ft I have not seen a reference to this type of review. Thanks, Response (1/22/2010): I have spoken with several experts in epid emiology and medical toxicology. We can find no documented negative health effects related to coal ash in any situation like that in Harriman. O ccupational exposure to coal dust while m ining it, of course, has adverse effects. If the coal ash should become air-borne so that ambient air standards are violated, we would expect negative health effects from the particulate matter, such as upper airway irrita tion and aggravation of pre-existing con ditions such as asthma, emphysema, an d other respiratory conditions. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 241 Public Commenter 5 NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL EARTHJUSTICE ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY PROJECT SIERRA CLUB March 9, 2010 Environmental Epidemiology Program Tennessee Department of Health 1st Floor Cordell Hull Building 425 5th Avenue North Nashville TN 37243 Re: Comments on the Public Health Assessm ent of the Kingston Fossil Plant coal ash release To Whom It May Concern, The Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthjus tice, The Environmental Integrity Project, and the Sierra Club submit these comments on the Tennessee Department of Health Public Health Assessment of the Tennessee Valley Authorit y Kingston Fossil Plant Coal Ash Release . I. Introduction Coal combustion ash contains heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and other toxic elements such as selenium that may leach out of the ash when it comes into contact with water. 1 The toxic health effects of these substances are well known. Arsenic increases the risk of cancer of the bladder, liver, lungs a nd skin, while cadmium may cause kidney damage. Inhalation of hexavalent chromium is associated with an increased risk of cancer, and its ingestion may increase the risk of stomach tumors. Elevated exposure to lead, mercury or selenium may cause neurological problems.2 Fly ash, the lighter ash residue th at enters a power plant's smokest acks, typically leaches metals at higher rates than the bottom ash that clings to the walls and bottom of the furnace. The coal ash impoundment that ruptured on December 2 2, 2008 at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Kingston Fossil Plant in Harriman, Tennessee, cont ained almost exclusivel y wet fly ash. Because the coal ash was stored in a wet impoundment, and because it subsequently spilled into the Clinch and Emory Rivers, there is concern over potential human e xposures through drinking 1 U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. (2006) Coal Combustion Waste Management at Landfills and Surface Impoundments, 1994 - 2004 . Document No. DOE/PI-0004.

Available at: http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaq.html Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 242 water caused by the leaching of contaminants into ground and surface water. Risks also exist for people who use the river recreationally, including those who engage in sports or subsistence fishing who may ingest contaminated fish. Ingestion through eating other contaminated food or through hand-to-mouth behavior may increase these risks. Furthermore, ash that dried after the spill may become airborne, increasing levels of respirable particulate matter in air and aggravating respiratory problems in the exposed population. Dermal exposure to coal ash may also result in skin irritation. Response: Yes, TDH agrees that coal ash contains heavy me tals that may leach into water and that can be toxic. We stated such in the PHA in unambi guous language. Whether or not the ash spilled at the Kingston site leaches or is to xic is specific to this site and its coal ash characteristics. The potential for toxicity depends upon the concentrati ons of metals that are available for intake and absorption and how long people were exposed. All of this was carefully cons idered in the PHA. The PHA is a site-specific document. The conc lusions expressed in it may not apply at other locations. It would be a disservice to the community to make generi c statements about the potential for public health impacts when it is possible to do site -specific analysis. Of course, there were and are potential human exposures through drinking water. That is why both raw and finished water at the two closest wa ter treatment plants were tested immediately and everyday by TDEC until January 20. TDEC con tinued to sample weekly, while the Kingston WTP retained the daily sampling and analysis. At no time since the spill has municipal drinking water violated any water quality regulations. People use the Watts Bar Reservoir recreationally. It is beautiful and pleasant waterway. EPA, TDEC, and TDH were and have been concerned about any potential effects from fishing and other recreational activities on the Reservoir. That is why TVA and TDEC have sampled and are continuing to sample long stretches of the Re servoir, from upstream on the Emory River, the Clinch River, and the Tennessee River. Thes e thoughts were also exp ressed unambiguously in the PHA. After sampling and analysis and before the start of summer acti vities, a recreational advisory was published stating that Watts Bar Reservoir was safe for recreation and fishing except in the vicinity of the spill. Later, as larger equipment was brought in to remove ash, the river was closed for a few miles on either side of the spill site. Unfortunately for such a beautiful reservoir, legacy contaminati on from mercury and PCBs have necessitated fish advisories in the Reservoir. These advisories have been in place for many years. EPA, TDEC, and TWRA began fish sampling soon after the incident, and are continuing to watch the situation closely. Ingestion of ash could result in harm. Inci dental ingestion was ca refully considered. Information contained in the ATSDR Toxicologica l Profiles and obtained from consultation with expert medical toxicologists, assure us that th e potential short-term, mi nimal exposure at this site would not result in harm. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 243 EPA, TVA, TDEC, and TDH are aware of the potential for harm to public health from exposure to inhaled particulates from air-borne coal as h. Again, this was stated unambiguously in the PHA. Air sampling began very quickly. The type s of sampling changed with time as more FRM and TEOM samplers became available for use around the site. TVA and TDEC operate air samplers at the point that best professional judgement indicated as the point of maximum exposure, based on the nature of the ash on the ground and prevailing wind direction . In addition, there are other air monitors surrounding the site and on the site. Air sampling surrounding the site indicates no violation of e ither National Ambient Air Quality Standards or World Health Organization guidelines. Air samp ling on-site indicates no violation of OSHA standards. Contaminant leaching from coal ash is known to have polluted many s ites across the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged the existence of sites in 23 states where coal ash is known or suspect ed to have caused environmental damage.1 The sites reviewed by EPA primarily involv ed the leaching of contaminants from intentionally placed coal ash, not massive accidental ash releases such as the one at the TVA Kingston plant. A release of such magnitude as the one in Kingston carries the potential to cause much more widespread contamination. Response: TDH, TDEC, and EPA have never denied that the pot ential for widespread contamination. That is why so many environmental samples have been and are being taken. To reiterate, all agencies are investigating potential envir onmental and human health harms not as generic possibilities, but as site-specific actualities. The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH), under a cooperative agreement with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Department of Health, conducted a Public Health Assessment (PHA) of the coal as h release at the TVA Kingston Plant. While we welcome the fact that TDH has collected and analy zed data on the effects of the spill, a number of unsupported assumptions and data limitations call into question some of the conclusions presented in the PHA. TDH did not conduct blood tests or other form s of biomonitoring to assess exposures to metals in coal ash among the populati on affected by the Kingston disaster. Response: TDH did not conduct blood tests or other forms of biomonitoring. Any exposure from any route or any media would have been very brief. The weather and the wetness of the ash precluded it from becoming air-borne. Any dermal exposur e or incidental inge stion would have been possible only for a very few days. Any such expos ures would have been impossible to detect with any type of biomonitoring. A central tenet of he alth assessments is that somehow enough of the 1 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). Coal Combustion Waste Damage Case Assessments. July 9, 2007. Available at www.regulations.gov (Document ID No. EPA-HQ-RCRA -2006-0796-0015). Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 244 chemicals of concern have to get inside so meone for a long enough time before they can do harm. TVA has arranged, through ORAU, for medical exam inations, including blood testing, of anyone living near the spill who wants it. The protocol for the examinations was carefully developed by occupational and environmental phy sicians from the University of Colorado School of Public Health, Vanderbilt Medical Center medical toxico logists, and ORAU scientists. The protocol includes blood testing. By overestimating children's body weight, th e assessment underestimates arsenic doses in children from incidental inge stion of ash-contaminated soil. Response: TDH did not overestimate child ren's body weight. ATSDR's P ublic Health Assessment Manual specified 16 kg as the appropriate value to use in exposure dose ca lculations for children aged 1 through 6 years. The 200 mg/day ingestion rate us ed in the PHA is 2 time s the central tendency ingestion rate for children from 1 year to less than 6 years of age (100 mg/day) for incidental ingestion of soil and outdoor se ttled dust (EPA 2008). People w ith the potential for actual exposure to the ash were moved quickly. Infants aged from 6 months to 11 months old would not have been left to play unattended along the shor eline where ash was deposited. In addition, in the rare instance when a child might have gotte n to the shoreline and ea ten ash, the length of exposure would have been very short (a matter of minutes) and the possibility for exposure would have lasted at most a few days. Because the ash was wet and stayed wet and bec ause ash was deposited only along the shoreline except for three properties, it its highly unlikely t hat any ash was deposited on clothes. Sampling of soil in yards showed a clear demarcation between ash and soil. The ash was only along the shoreline except in the three houses from which people were relocate d immediately. It is highly unrealistic to assume that peopl e could have ingested or inha led enough ash from yards or clothes to have caused any harm. Drinking water (municipal, spring and well) ha s not been tested for boron, a constituent of coal ash that may cause harm to the ma le reproductive system, low birth weight, and birth defects. Response: TVA has 1,216 sample results for boron between December 22, 2009, and the end of May 2009. Only 1.6% of those sample results we re above the detection limit (usually 50 g/L, occasionally 100 g/L). The highest concentration found was 227 g/L. No samples taken in the Tennessee River upstream of the water treatment pl ants were above the detection limit of 50 g/L. Boron is considered in the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality. The Drinking-water Quality Committee, at its meeting of 9- 13 November 2009, recommended revising the Boron Guideline Value to 2.4 mg/L. The revised Gu ideline Value and Summary Statement will be Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 245 incorporated into the Guidelines. This health -based value for drinking water is well above any concentrations found in Watts Ba r Reservoir in the spill area. Arsenic and selenium levels in surface water have exceeded EPA water quality criteria. Therefore, the PHA should not conclude that no harm will come to people's health from recreational river use, since fish may be bi oaccumulating selenium. Fish tissue testing by Appalachian State University and others in January 2009 found high levels of selenium in fish that highlight the ne ed for further biomonitoring. Response: TDEC, TWRA, and EPA began testing fis h for selenium uptake soon af ter the spill. They were unable to duplicate Appalachian State Universi ty's results; the EPA Sc ience Review Panel and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have generated two reports on selenium impacts at the coal ash release site 1. TDEC and TWRA are continuing to test fish to make sure that they are not bioaccumulating coal ash constituents. Current fish advisories for Watts Bar Reservoir, that have been in place for many years for mercury a nd PCB contamination from historical activities upstream of the ash spill, will continue to prot ect public health. If selenium is found to be bioaccumulating in fish tissue, then TDEC and TW RA will amend the existing advisory to protect people from selenium in fish. The ash is being removed from the river at a very fast rate. Over two-thirds of the ash is now out of the river; th e ash will be out of the embayments and inlets in two to four years. Selenium would not bioaccumulate enough in one season to present a problem. TDH should not conclude that breathing coal ash will not harm people's health, since available evidence points to the existence of elevated health risks. Particulate matter has exceeded levels known from scientific studies to aggravate asthma symptoms in children. Arsenic has exceeded health comparison values in some air samples. Furthermore, TDH found statistically significant clustering of respiratory symptoms near the area of the spill. Response: TDH did not conclude that brea thing coal ash will not harm people's health. Conclusion 10b states: \"The Tennessee Department of Health co ncludes that no harm to people's health is expected from occasionally breathing coal ash if it should become airborne for short periods of 1 (ACOE 2009) U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Laboratory, Engineer Research and Development Center.

Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 246 time.\" TDH stands by this conclusion. This conclusion was supported by medical toxicologists and outside peer reviewers. PM10 and PM2.5 have not been measured at levels above either EPA NAAQS nor WHO recommendations in off-site monitors. Instantaneous readings for PM10 in a large area around the spill area have shown higher 3- to 5- minutes concentrations . It is not possible to predict 24- hour average concentrations of PM10 from thes e real-time measurements , but it is certainly possible that at some locations PM10 was at levels greater than th e NAAQS limits 24-hour average concentration of 150 g/m\u00b3. The increased PM10 real-tim e measurements appear to be due to a number of sources, including fires in fi replaces, localized forest fires, or dust from the local quarry. It is extremely unl ikely that the increased PM10 meas urements are due to airborne coal fly ash because monitors su rrounding the coal ash release indi cate that air quality was and is meeting all parti culate standards. Arsenic in air was fully discussed in the PHA. In off-site monitors surrounding the ash spill, TDEC had 2 measurements for arsenic slightly above the health co mparison value - 0.0025 and 0.0029 g/m\u00b3 compared to the comparison value of 0.0023 g/m\u00b3. The detection limit for TVA's measurements for arsenic was above 0.0023 g/m\u00b3, but well within normal concentrations of arsenic found in the U.S. ambient air (0.00022 to 0.011 g/m\u00b3). Arsenic in air does not pose a human health threat around ash spill. Scientists continue to look at health effects fr om air pollution. There has been and will continue to be discussion about how to synthesize protect ive standards from academic research findings. This PHA is not the place for that kind of discussion. We can confidently say that monitoring by TEOM and FRM monitors surrounding the ash spill have not shown any levels of particulates above EPA regulations or World He alth Organization recommendations. The survey conducted by TDH and NCEH was not a sc ientific study, but an emergency response. The data can only be used to suggest hypothese s. The Tennessee Poison Center is conducting evaluations of the health stat us and blood levels of certain he avy metals in all community members who desire it. The air data taken by EPA, TVA, and TD EC do not indicate that coal ash constituents are getti ng into the ambient air. It would be in the best interest of the co mmunity affected by the Kingston coal ash spill for TDH and ATSDR to address these serious shortcomings in the PHA. Response: ATSDR sent the draft PHA to three outside peer reviewers to make sure that the scientific methods used were robust and the conclusions we re drawn correctly from the data. TDH has worked diligently to analyze data for site-speci fic conclusions relevant and helpful to the community. In the words of outside peer Revi ewer 1, \"It [the PHA] appears to be an honest and thorough scientific analysis of all the health threats involved and the likelihood that any of these might have risen to a level of concern for heal th effects in the expos ed human population\" and \"The results and findings presented in the Hea lth Assessment are highl y credible and show Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 247 careful attention to the sc ientific method, appropriate me thods of analysis, and correct interpretation of results.\" II. Discussion This document will discu ss the Conclusions of the Public Health Assessment (PHA), as enumerated below. CONCLUSION 1: \"When the coal ash was released from the failed retention wall of one of the coal ash storage ponds, people in the path of the ash could have been harmed by the magnitude and suddenness of the ash release. If the release had occurred during a summer day when people were on the river or riverbank s, many people could have been harmed or killed.\" 1 Comment: We agree that the amount of ash and the force of the release could have added loss of life to this environmental and economic catastro phe. However, we understand the term \"harmed\" here to mean only \"immediate physical injury\", since there is not enough data in the PHA to reliably conclude that the coal ash release has not negatively affected the health of the community, particularly in the absence of biomonitoring by TDH. Response: We consider the data to be sufficient to evaluate each route of exposure. We conclude that we should not expect negative im pacts to public health. Comment: This first conclusion is followed in the PHA by a message to be publicized by TDH and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), recommending the practice of good hygiene by washing hands, clothes and shoes if people come into contact with the ash. This is a useful recommendation; howev er, its effectiveness may be undermined by the statement that follows it: \"Remember, the meta ls are bound to the ash. Occasional exposures for brief periods of time should not harm people's health.\" 2 Metals may leach from the ash when it comes into contact with moisture, which would occu r if the ash were ingested, or breathed into the lungs. Arsenic and lead leaching at the pH in the human stomach (pH 2) are likely to be higher than predicted by Toxi c Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) tests, which are carried out in a solution buffered to pH 5.3, 4 In fact, a recent repor t by the EPA's Office of Research and Development determined that variable pH has a dramatic effect on the leaching of 1 Tennessee Department of Health (TDH).

Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 248 metals from coal ash, particularly for arsenic.1 Using a new and more reliable leach test, the EPA determined that arsenic leaching from fly ash reached levels up to 18,000 ug/L or 3.5 times the toxicity characteristic (haza rdous waste level) of arsenic.2 Since it is not possible for either health agenci es or exposed individuals to pinpoint the precise threshold of exposure time at which a person may begin to suffer adverse effects from exposure to the coal ash, this last statement regarding me tals being bound to the ash and not causing harm through occasional exposures should not be included in public messages. Response: TDH stands by its conclusion. For arsenic to leach from ingested ash and harm someone, it would be necessary for someone to ingest it in a large enough amount and for long enough. People, whose homes were impacted, were evacu ated very quickly after the ash spill. Any exposures would have been very brief - a matter of hours. Use of risk equa tions indicated that a child could possibly ingest 0.0002 mg/kg day of arsenic. This oral dose is much less than ATSDR's acute MRL of 0.005 mg/kg day. We agree that the TCLP method is not useful for pr edicting absorption of metals in the GI tract. However, real life data indicates that absorption of arsenic would not likely exceed 50%. See our response to the last comment under Conclusion 4 for more details. CONCLUSION 2: \"The Tennessee Department of Health concludes t hat it is unlikely that harm occurred to people from touching the coal ash when th ey had to climb out of their damaged houses on the morning of December 22, 2008, and to those who returned to retrieve personal property.\" 3 Comment: TDH based this conclusion on the argument that metals would not enter people's bodies from touching the ash. However, coming in to contact with the ash may have led to incidental ingestion, or inhala tion once portions of the ash on people's clothes or property became dry. Furthermore, TDH did not conduct blood tests or other forms of biomonitoring to determine people's levels of exposure to metals in the coal ash. Response: Long-term contact would be necessary to cause any significant local skin irritation. In addition, the metals in the coal ash are not likely to get into people's bodies from touching the ash. This statement is correct. Even if the metals could ge t from skin into the bl ood stream, the extremely short exposure period would preclude meas urable amounts from getting into blood.

TVA personnel and contractors removed clothes and other possessions from the three houses that were irreparably damaged and cleaned them before re turning them to the owners. Potential risks from ingestion of coal ash and from inhalatio n of air borne coal ash are discussed in conclusions 4, 9, and 11. Exposure to coal ash while escaping from impacted homes was brief. Any exposure to ash on clothing was of short duration (hours at most). TVA hired contractors to retrieve and clean possessi ons so that residents would not have any additional exposure. It is our unde rstanding that ash did not get in side any of the homes - three homes were damaged by the ash flow, but they were not flooded with ash. Outside peer reviewer 1 states, \"this reviewer do es not believe that the evidence is strong that casual touching the coal ash could cause local sk in irritation Rather, it would require a long- term dermal contact (for example, entrapmen t under a bandage) to resu lt in any significant localized skin irritation. Certainly, the Assessm ent should not infer that skin irritation could result from casual touching of the coal ash.\" Blood testing was not necessary for the reasons al ready stated. In the words of outside peer reviewer 1, \"The results and findings presented in the Health Assessment are highly credible and show careful attention to th e scientific method, appropriate me thods of analysis, and correct interpretation of results.\" Outside peer revi ewer 2 states, \"This reviewer concurs that biomonitoring of residents is un likely to be useful and that re sources and energy should be on dust suppression, environmenta l quality monitoring, . . .\" CONCLUSION 3: \"The Tennessee Department of Health conclude s that no harm to the community's health is expected from touching the coal ash. This includes children who might touch the ash while playing.\" 1 Comment: Touching the ash while playing may lead to its inhalation and ingestion, since small children are prone to engage in frequent hand- to-mouth behavior. Since TDH did not test the exposed population for levels of metals or thei r health effects, it ha s no data to support its conclusion that no harm to the community's health is expected from touching the ash. Response: The conclusion follows from a scientific analysis of the data. ATSDR sent the draft PHA to three outside peer reviewers to make sure that the scientific methods used were robust and the conclusions were drawn correctly from the data. Outside peer reviewer 2 states, \"This reviewer concurs that biomonitoring of residents is unlikely to be useful and t hat resources and energy should be on dust suppression, enviro nmental quality monitoring, . . .\" Any exposure of young children to the coal ash w ould have been short and extremely infrequent due to where the ash was (along th e shoreline), the ability of paren ts to clearly see the ash, the excellent work of emergency response personnel, and the weather - cold and wet. 1 Id., at xx.

Certainly, the Assessm ent should not infer that skin irritation could result from casual touching of the coal ash.\" See the response to comments on conclusion 4 for a discussion of issues surrounding incidental ingestion of coal ash. CONCLUSION 4: \"The Tennessee Department of Health concl udes that no harm to people's health is expected from eating a small amount of coal ash.\" 1 Comment: TDH goes on to acknowledge that arsenic wa s found in the coal ash at levels above health criteria. Its claim of no harm being expected rests on assu mptions such as only 50 percent of the arsenic being bioavailable, and that coal ash would represent 50 percent of daily contaminated soil ingestion.2 In the case of a child, TDH assumed the age of the child to be 2 years, and his/her weight to be 16 kg, or 35 pounds. However, the ATSDR Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual states that \"ATSDR calculates an EMEG for a child using a daily soil ingestion rate of 200 mg/day for a 10-kg child.\" This body weight value corresponds to the weight of an infant 6- to 11-months of age.3 TDH used the following equation to calculate the oral dose of arsenic a child would receive from ingesting coal ash in contaminated soil: 4 Oral dose = CA x abs x IR x CF x FI BW Where: CA = concentration of arsenic in ash; 78 mg/kg, the highest mean concentration abs = percent likely to be absorbable, 50% (0.5) IR = ingestion rate, 200 mg/day for a child CF = conversion factor, 10 -6 kg/mg or 1 kg/1,000,000 mg FI = fraction ingested, assuming 0.5 (half) of the incidental ingestion is ash BW = body weight When the oral dose is calculated using the ATSDR-recommended body weight value of 10 kg instead of the 16 kg wrongly used in the PHA, the result is: Oral dose = 78 mg/kg x 0.5 x 200 mg/day x 1 kg x 0.5 = 0.00039 mg/kg \u00b7 day 10 kg x 1,000,000 mg 1 Id., at xxi. 2 Id. at xxi; 18. 3 ATSDR (2005) ATSDR Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual , Appendix Available at: http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/PHAmanual/appf.html 4 TDH (2009), at 18-19. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 251 The resulting dose is 0.00039 mg/kg \u00b7 day, which exceeds the ATSDR MRL and the EPA Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.0003 mg/kg \u00b7 day. Furthermore, contrary to TDH's assertion, the assumptions used in the PHA arsenic dose calcula tions do not represent a worst-case scenario. The 78 mg/kg arsenic concentration in coal ash is the highest mean, but the maximum concentration was 166 mg/kg, which was found in the TVA samples. Calculating the oral dose using the maximum concentration of 166 mg/ kg yields a result of 0.00083 mg/L, or over 2.5 times the MRL. Therefore, children may be exposed to arsenic concentrations that are substantially higher than ATSDR or EPA health criteria. The estimated arsenic dose indicates that the health of children in the area of the co al ash spill may be at risk from ingesting unsafe levels of arsenic. Response: TDH's methodology is correct. An infant would not be in a s ituation in which he would be eating ash. A child might have been in such a situation for a short pe riod of time. Using variables for a reasonable worst-case scenario (w hich is what TDH used) is appropriate. The soil ingestion rate is double th e central tendency ingestion ra te for children aged 1 through 6 years. The use of the highest mean arsenic conc entration is appropriate. Assuming that half of the consumption is ash that a child would consum e in a day is an overestimate of exposure. Assuming that 50% of the arsenic in coal ash is bioavailable is also a conservative estimate based on real-world data. The ATSDR and EPA health comparison values are for long-term exposures. Any exposure in this situation would have been ex tremely short-term. It is im proper to compare this one time unlikely event dosage with a long-term health comparison value. Even using the variables suggested by the reviewers, th e calculated dose of 0.00083 mg/kg day is well below the acute exposure MRL of 0.005 mg/kg day. CONCLUSION 5: \"The Tennessee Department of Health concludes t hat using the Emory River at the site of the coal ash release (near Emory River mile 2) could result in harm to residents or trespassers from physical hazards associated with cleanup efforts and from the volume of ash present, if residents or trespassers entered the area.\"1 Comment: We agree with this conclusion and with th e recreational advisories issued by the U.S. EPA, TDH, TDEC and TVA, whic h caution the public to avoid the use of the lower Emory River in the vicinity of the coal ash spill, and to avoid chronic exposure to the ash. No response necessary. 1 TDH (2009), at xxii. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 252 CONCLUSION 6: \"The Tennessee Department of Health concl udes that using muni cipal drinking water from the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment plants will not harm people's health because the raw and finished water have c ontinuously met drinking water standards. \"1 Comment: While the water from these two treatment plants does not appear to have exceeded primary drinking water standards in tests perf ormed by TDEC and the EPA contractor, it is necessary to test the water for boron, which is enriched in coal ash2 and is an indicator element of coal ash contamination of water. According to the ATSDR, animal studies have indicated that boron affects the male reproductive organs, and may lead to low birth weight and birth defects. The EPA has not set a primary drinking water st andard for boron, but it has issued a Longer Term Health Advisory for boron in drinking water consumed by children of 2.0 mg/L, while the European Union has adopted a standard of 1.0 mg/L 3, 4 We agree with TDEC that the agency should c ontinue monitoring municipal drinking water as well as private wells and springs, but future drinking water testi ng should include boron tests to determine whether it may pose a risk to co mmunities relying on drinking water from the Kingston and Rockwood water treatment, since conventional drinking water treatment methods do not remove boron. 5 Response: TDH will pass this comment to TDEC so that th ey can make the decision whether or not to test for boron in municipal water. TVA's sampling, as discussed above, does not indicate that boron in Watts Bar Reservoir is elevated. TVA has 1,216 sample results for boron between December 22, 2009, and the end of May 2009. Only 1.6% of those sample results we re above the detection limit (usually 50 g/L, occasionally 100 g/L). The highest concentration found was 227 g/L. No samples taken in the Tennessee River upstream of the water treatment pl ants were above the detection limit of 50 g/L. Boron is considered in the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality. The Drinking-water Quality Committee, at its meeting of 9-13 November 2009, recommended revising the Boron Guideline Value to 2.4 mg/L. The revised Gu ideline Value and Summary Statement will be 1 TDH (2009), at xxiii. 2 Goodarzi, F; Swaine, DJ. (1994) Paleoenvironmental and environmental aspects of boron in coal.

This value for drinking water is well above any concentrations found in Watts Bar Reservoir in the spill area. CONCLUSION 7: \"The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that using well or spring water within four miles of the coal ash release will not harm people's health from exposure to coal ash or metals in the coal ash because no evidence has been found for groundwater contamination by coal ash.\" 1 Comment: As in the case of municipal drinking wate r, well and spring water did not appear to contain concentrations of coal ash contaminants in excess of primary drinking water standards. However, there has been as of yet, no comp rehensive hydrogeologic study of groundwater or karst water movement under the Kingston plant or the release site and thus primary flow paths and rates and directions of water flow have not been definitively established. Even if such work had been done at the release site, the limited, mostly one-time sampling of offsite wells and springs that has occurred has not been sufficien t to definitively support a conclusion of no harm to human health, particularly given the admission in TVA's draft Engineering Evaluation and Cost Analyses (EE/CA) for the Embayment/Dredge Cell and River that arsenic has very recently been found above the MCL and historic levels in groundwater downgradient from the dredge cell at the Kingston site. 2 Finally spring and well water may also be subject to contamination with boron, which has no primary drinking water standa rd and which was not included in chemical tests. Given the reproductive and developmenta l health risks posed by boron, spring and well water should also be tested for this contaminant. Response: There is no evidence that boron is elevated in su rface water near the s ite. Sampling and analysis of wells and springs did not show any effects from the coal ash. The dredge cell has been in existence for many years, so if it were affecting wells and springs we would expect the effects to be evident. TDEC will continue to sample we ll water periodically to determine if coal ash constituents are getting into groundwater. CONCLUSION 8: \"The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that no harm to people's health should result from recreational use of the Emory, Clinch and Tenne ssee Rivers outside the area of the lower Emory River down to the confluence of the Emory and Clinch Rivers, as specified in the recreational advisory and river closure.

TVA sampling was conducted between December 23 a nd May 8, 2009. Concentrations have been converted in this documen t from mg/L to ug/L. More exceedances of the 0.14 ug/L arsenic criterion were recorded by EPA and TDEC sampling.3 Detection limits for antimony, arsenic, and beryllium for certain EPA surface water samples were higher than the water quality criteria, so it is not possible to determine from those results whether additional exceedances occurred.4 Testing by Vengosh et al. (2009) found high concentrations of arsenic in the Emory and Clinch Rivers in excess of th e arsenic criterion, with all 14 samples at or downstream of the ash spill exceeding the criterion. Dissolved arsenic concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 69.6 ug/L (497 tim es the criterion) ; total arsenic ranged from 0.3 to 95.2 ug/L. The highest levels were found in the dammed tributary.5, 6 Sampling conducted by Appalachian State Universit y, Appalachian Voices, Tennessee Aquarium and Wake Forest University of Emory River mile 2.2 in the area of the spill found a to tal recoverable arsenic concentration of 2,667 ug/L.7 Elevated selenium levels have also been measured in surface water. Although according to TDH \"levels of selenium are well below EPA's proposed toxicity standards for protection of fish and other aquatic life\", 8 selenium concentrations reached or exceeded the EPA freshwater quality criterion of 20 ug/L three times between December 23 and May 8, 2009:9, 1 1 Id., at 111-70. 2 40 CFR 131.36.

While TDH simply recommends following pre- existing fish consumption advisories issued for P CBs and mercury that are unrelated to the coal ash release, the arsenic and selenium levels de tected indicate the need for a more cautious approach when reaching conclusions about possible harm from and recreatio nal use of the river, including fishing, and when issuing recommendations to the public. Fish testing by Appalachian State University, Appalachian Voices, Tennessee Aquarium and Wake Forest University found elevated selenium concentrations in fish muscle of 3.19 to 5.17 parts per million (ppm). 2 While these did not exceed the EPA draft health guidance, selenium levels in fish should continue to be monitored closely, as bioaccumulation may lead to increased concentrations in tissue over time. Given the data presented in the PHA, TDH cannot c onclude that use of the river will not result in harm to people's health. Fish monitoring should continue in the Emory and Clinch Rivers, the community should be informed of the exceedances of water quality criteria, and new advisories should be issued (and/or existing advisories strengthened) if fish tissues exceed health comparison values for any contaminants. Response: The commenters are correct that the number 0.14 ug/L appears for arsenic in the national criteria table found on the EPA website. It shou ld be noted that EPA has withdrawn support for this criterion due to concerns about its accuracy. A footnote to th is criterion states that it is being reconsidered. EPA has approved the existing Tennessee arsenic cr iterion of 10 ug/L, which is the water quality standard which properly applies to the Emory and Clinch. The 10 ug/L arsenic criterion is not an acute crite rion as suggested by the commenters - rather it is based on arsenic levels over time and chronic exposures. TDEC and TDH agree with the commenters that arsenic levels in the lower Emory have exceeded this 10 ug/L criterion with enough frequency, duration, and magnitude that the classified use of domestic water s upply has been impacted in this sp ecific area. In other words, arsenic levels documented in 2009 would present an obstacle to the lower Emory being used as a 1 40 CFR 131.36.

Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 256 water supply during the duration of the ash spill. However, we do not agree that this leads to a conclusion that public health is at risk. The lo wer Emory, although classifi ed for domestic water supply, is not being used for this purpose. When the proper arsenic criterion of 10 g/L is used, TDEC shows exceedances in 4% of their samples, all at the site of the ash spill. TVA shows exceedances in 0.06% of 30,781 analyses for arsenic. These exceedances are as follows: Exceedances of Arsenic water quality criterion approved by EPA (10 g/L) River Mile Arsenic Concentration, g/L Dissolved (D) or Total (T) Date TDEC ERM 1.7 19 T 1/22/09 ERM1.7 17 T 2/5/09 ERM 2.1 14 T 43 T 17 3/31/09 4/8/09 TVA 14 T 1/7/09 CRM2. 0 24 D 1/7/09 CRM2. 0 94 T 1/7/09 CRM4. 0 22 D 0 109 20 1/7/09 T 14 59 1/7/09 ERM2.1 131 T 1/7/09 All exceedances outside the area of the spill occurred on January 7, 2009, and have not recurred since then. TDH does not agree with the commenters that a significant issue with arsenic is found outside the lower Emory. TDH did not use data from NGOs for the reasons stated in the PHA. Most sampling was done at the site of the spill and in da mmed tributaries in the earliest days after the spill. This data confirmed elevated levels of arse nic at the site of the spill. However, the data were not particularly useful for determining ef fects of chronic exposures to the Watts Bar Reservoir. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 257 Reaching EPA's Water Quality Criterion for se lenium twice and exceeding it once in more than 5 months of sampling does not cons titute a reason to say that recr eation if unsafe.

CONCLUSION 9: \"The Tennessee Department of Health cannot c onclude whether breathing coal ash from December 22, 2008, through December 27, 2008, harmed people's health. However, any dust that may have been inhaled could have aggravated symptoms in sensitive populations, that is, people with asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory conditions.\"1 Comment: TDH cannot draw this conclusion. As TDH acknowledges, no agencies took air samples from December 22, 2008, through December 27, 2008. Although TDH believes that it is unlikely that the wet ash released from the fa iled impoundment dried enough to become airborne during this period, 2 thinner layers of ash on the propert y or clothes of people who came into contact with the ash may have posed an i nhalation risk during the period in question. Response: After comments from outside peer re viewers, EEP has changed conclusion 9 to read, \"While no air measurements were obtained during the time period between December 22 and December 27, 2008, the Tennessee Department of Health concludes that it is unlikely that any harm to public health should have resulted from breathing ambient air from December 22, 2008, through December 27, 2008. However, any dust that may have been inhaled could have aggravated symptoms in sensitive populations, that is, people with asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory conditions.\" The coal ash, which was wet and remained wet in that time period, did not get into yards or on clothes except for 3 homes that were evacuated. Data support our conclusion. In fact, we state in the conclusion that if a person with pre-existi ng respiratory conditions breathed the coal ash, then this could have aggrav ated their symptoms. CONCLUSION 10a: \"The Tennessee Department of Health conclude s that breathing am bient air near the coal ash release is not expected to ha rm people's health as long as adequate dust suppression measures are in place.\" CONCLUSION 10b: \"The Tennessee Department of Health concl udes that no harm to people's health is expected from occasionally breathing coal ash if it should become airborne for short periods of time.\" CONCLUSION 10c: 1 TDH (2009) at xxvi. 2 Id.

Such harm could include upper airway irritation and aggrav ation of pre-existing conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory conditions.\"1 Comment, 10a - 10c: TDH has stated that despite TVA's dust suppression measures, dust still appears to be a problem for home owners along the truck route, a nd that there appears to be a relationship between respiratory complaints and the truck route.2, 3 We strongly agree on the need to have adequate dust s uppression measures in pl ace, and that the failure of such could cause harm to people suffering from respiratory or cardiac conditions. Response: The dust referred to is not dust fr om the coal ash, but dust from the quarry. Comment: However, we strongly disagree with Conc lusion 10b, which states that \"no harm to people's health is expected from occasionally breathing coal ash if it should become airborne for short periods of time.\" Studies ha ve shown that exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of just a few hours may aggravate airway inflammation and asthma symptoms in children.

(2006) found a st atistically significan t association between morning peak PM 2.5 concentrations (but not 24-hour averages) an d increased bronchodilator use at school and urinary leukotriene E 4 - a biomarker for airway inflammation - during school hours among children with moderate and severe asthma. These effects were observed despite the fact that the morning means were 30.2 ug/m 3 and the 24-hour averages were 11.8 ug/m3, both below the 24-hour National Ambient Air Qualit y Standard (NAAQS) of 35 ug/m3 .4 Delfino et al. (2002) also found an association between short exposures to elevated PM10 concentrations (1-hour and 8-hour maxima) and asthma symptoms in children, even though the 24-hour PM10 NAAQS of 150 ug/m3 was not exceeded. Th e 1-hour maximum was 51 ug/m 3; the 8-hour and 24-hour maxima were 38 ug/m3 and 25 ug/m3, respectively.5 These studies indicate that children may be at greater risk of asthma symp toms from short-term exposure to elevated levels of PM2.5 and PM10, even if the 24-hour NAAQS are not exceeded. EPA sampling has detected average PM10 concentrations on- and off TVA property that are within th e range associated with the aggravation of asthma symptoms in child ren in the referenced studies (76.2 ug/m 3 on-site and 49.4 ug/m3 off-site.).6 Response: 1 Id., at xxvii. 2 Id., at 52. 3 Id., at 70. 4 Rabinovitch N, Strand M, Gelfand EW (2006) Particulate levels are associated with early asthma worsening in children with persistent disease.

Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 259 This same comment was discussed at length in se ction I. It is repeat ed here. TDH did not conclude that breathing coal ash will not harm people's heal th. Conclusion 10b states: \"The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that no harm to people's health is expected from occasionally breathing coal ash if it should become airborne for short periods of time.\" TDH stands by this conclusion. This conclusion wa s supported by medical to xicologists and outside peer reviewers. PM10 and PM2.5 have not been measured at levels above either EPA NAAQS nor WHO recommendations in off-site monitors. Instantaneous readings for PM10 in a large area around the spill area have shown higher 3- to 5- minutes concentrations . It is not possible to predict 24- hour average concentrations of PM10 from thes e real-time measurements , but it is certainly possible that at some locations PM10 was at levels greater than th e NAAQS limits 24-hour average concentration of 150 g/m\u00b3. The increased PM10 real-tim e measurements appear to be due to a number of sources, including fires in fi replaces, localized forest fires, or dust from the local quarry. It is extremely unl ikely that the increased PM10 meas urements are due to airborne coal fly ash because monitors su rrounding the coal ash release indi cate that air quality was and is meeting all parti culate standards. Scientists continue to look at health effects fr om air pollution. There has been and will continue to be discussion about how to synthesize protect ive standards from academic research findings. This PHA is not the place for that kind of discussion. We can confidently say that monitoring by TEOM and FRM monitors surrounding the ash spill have not shown any levels of particulates above EPA regulations or World He alth Organization recommendations. Comment: Other testing results also raise concern about possible health risks from breathing airborne ash. Levels of arsenic and chromium in some PM10 samples obtained by a TVA mobile on-site monitor from December 31 2008 thr ough February 3, 2009 were above health comparison values (arsenic was above its health comparison value in three of 35 samples, and chromium in 14 of 35 samples.) 1 TDEC also found exceedances for arsenic in 2 of 16 samples.2 Other exceedances may have occurred, since det ection limits for arsenic and chromium at TVA stationary monitors were at times above health comparison values.3 Response: This was also discussed in Secti on I and is repeated here. Arsenic in air was fully discussed in the PHA. In off-site monitors surrounding the ash spill, TDEC had 2 measurements for arsenic slightly above the health co mparison value - 0.0025 and 0.0029 g/m\u00b3 compared to the comparison value of 0.0023 g/m\u00b3. The detection limit for TVA' s measurements for arsenic was above 0.0023 g/m\u00b3, but well within normal concentrations of arsenic found in the U.S. ambient air (0.00022 to 0.011 g/m\u00b3). Arsenic in air does not pose a human health threat around the ash spill. 1 Id., at 40. 2 Id., at 46. 3 Id., at 41-2. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 260 Health agencies and TVA must ensure that dust suppression measures are strengthened to reduce the risk of respiratory health problems in surr ounding communities. They must also ensure that meaningful monitoring, with appr opriate detection limits below health comparison values for arsenic and chromium, be consistently instituted. Response: EPA and TDEC are doing an excellent job in overs eeing TVA's work and monitoring activities. TDEC continues to monitor the air in the commun ity at the point that models predict would have the highest concentrations of air pollutants orig inating from the site of the spill. TDH will continue to follow all activities at the site. CONCLUSION 11: \"The Tennessee Department of Health cannot conclude whether breathing dust near the quarry and along the routes of the quarry truc ks has or will harm people's health. Such dust can be irritating to upper airways and can aggravate pre-existing conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory conditions.\" 1 Comment: According to TDH, 0.1% of real-time 3-to -5-minute measurements in the community near the ash release, many of which were taken near the quarry truck routes, have exceeded the 150 ug/m 3 PM10 NAAQS. Short exposures to PM2.5 and PM10 at elevated levels below the NAAQS may aggravate asthma symptoms in pe ople with respiratory conditions, especially children. See Comment on Conclusions 10a - 10c, above. Breathing dust ne ar the quarry may aggravate respiratory symptoms in the exposed population. TDH should con tinue to monitor for increases in hospital treatment and admissions fo r asthma and other respiratory conditions among the community. The need for health mon itoring is supported by the findings of the Community Health Survey conducted by TDH and the Centers for Di sease Control and Prevention, which found a statistically significant clustering of shortness of breath, with hot spots occurring along the southwest/northeast axis of the ash release area.2 As previously mentioned, TDH has also stated that dust still appears to be a problem for homeowners along the truck route, and that there appears to be a relationship between resp iratory complaints and the truck route.3, 4 Response: not say that 0.1% of real-time 3-to-5-m inute measurements in the community near the ash release, many of which were taken near the quarry truck routes, have exceeded the 150 ug/m 3 PM10 NAAQS. TDH said that instantane ous readings for PM10 in a large area around the spill area have shown 3- to 5- mi nutes concentrations greater than 150 g/m\u00b3. It is not possible to predict 24-hour aver age concentrations of PM10 from these real-time measurements, but it is certainly possible that at some locations PM10 was at levels greater than the NAAQS limits 24-hour average concentration of 150 g/m\u00b3. The increased PM10 real-time measurements appear to be due to a number of sources, including fires in fireplaces, localized 1 Id., at xxix. 2 Id., at 66-7. 3 Id., at 52. 4 Id., at 70. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 261 forest fires, or dust from the lo cal quarry. It is extremely unlikely that the increased PM10 measurements are due to airborne coal fly ash because monitors surrounding the coal ash release indicate that air quality was and is mee ting all particulate standards. 0.1% of samples represents less than 50 readings. As we stated, we cannot draw any conclusions about harm to pub lic health from breathing dust near the quarry or along the truck routes. TVA has arrange d, through ORAU, for medical examinations, including blood testin g, of anyone living near the spill who wants it. The protocol for the examinations was carefully developed by occupational and envi ronmental physicians from the University of Colorado School of Publ ic Health, Vanderbilt Medical Center medical toxicologists, and ORAU scientis ts. These organizations are be tter able to do this type of medical screening than is TDH. CONCLUSION 12: \"The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that the small amount of radiation from the coal ash is not expected to harm people's health.\" 1 Comment: Radium-226 and radium-228 were found in the coal ash at concentrations above background soil levels. The estimated total radium in the TDEC samples is approximately 3.2 pCi/g above background; in Duke University sample s, it is 4.3 pCi/g above background (the EPA regulatory level is 5 pCi/g above background). 2 Even though these concentrations were below regulatory limits, the fact that they are enrich ed above background levels adds to the existing background health risks and should be of concer n for people chronically exposed to coal ash aerosols.3 Response: People are not being chronica lly exposed to coal ash aerosols. CONCLUSION 13: \"...The Tennessee Department of Health concludes that data collected by non- governmental organizations were of limited usefulness in estab lishing the long-term public health implications of the coal ash release. However, the non-governmental organizations' data confirm data collected by governmental agencies... Data from all agencies agree that arsenic in the coal ash was at levels above health comparison values, that arsenic in the Emory River at the site of the ash release wa s elevated immediately following the release... The data provided by non-gover nmental organizations about selenium in certain fish were not replic ated by Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation's, the Tennessee Wildli fe Resources Agency's, or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's sampli ng and analysis. However, it has signaled the need for further investiga tion by government agencies...\" 4 1 Id., at xxx. 2 Id., at 54. 3 Vengosh, A; Ruhl, L;, Dwyer, GS.

Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences, Duke University. 4 TDH (2009) at xxxi. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 262 Comment: We disagree with this conc lusion. Both the arsenic and se lenium data demonstrate the need for additional monitoring of surface water and fish to determine whether existing fish consumption advisories need to be strengthened, or new advisories issued . Arsenic and selenium concentrations have exceeded water quality criteria in TVA, EPA and/or TDEC sampling. See Comment on Conclusion 8, above. Response: TDEC, TWRA, and EPA have explored and are continuing to explore the selenium issue. They have not ignored selenium issues. TDEC and TDH acknowledge that arsenic is above water quality criteria at the site of the ash spill. Th is is issue has been explained earlier in the comments. CONCLUSION 14: \"Based on the Community Health Survey, the Tennessee Department of Health concludes that many residents living in the area of the coal as h release experienced stress and anxiety. Some residents reported respir atory symptoms after the ash release.\" 1 Comment: As stated earlier in the Comment to Conclusion 11 above, the findings of the Community Health Survey conducted by TDH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support the need for continued m onitoring of respiratory symptoms among the community. The Survey found a statistically signi ficant clustering of shor tness of breath, with hot spots occurring along the southwest/northeast ax is of the ash release area, in addition to the significant clustering of stre ss and anxiety symptoms. 2 Response: Tennessee Poison Center medical toxi cologists are medically evaluating members of the community. They are better able to do this type of medical screening than is TDH. CONCLUSION 15: \"Community members living near the quarry and along the routes th at quarry trucks traveled made complaints specific to dust at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Community Involvement Center. Complaints about respiratory symptoms were widespread and were not oriented toward either the site of the coal ash release or the route of the quarry trucks.\" 3 Comment: The statistically signifi cant clustering of respir atory symptoms along the southwest/northeast axis of the coal ash releas e area, and the change in orientation of the symptoms, which move closer to the spill area afte r the coal ash release, indicate that people in the community may have been experiencing respirat ory symptoms related to the coal ash release. Respiratory symptoms may have been widesprea d, but TDH's own analysis has indicated that 1 Id., at xxxiii. 2 Id., at 66-7. 3 Id., at xxxiv. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 263 respiratory symptoms were clustered near the spill area,1 and that there appears to be a relationship between respiratory compla ints and dust along the truck route.2, 3 Response: The truck route referred to is the route that the quarry trucks ta ke. Any dust generated by the trucks would come from the quarry, not the ash spill site. TVA has very stringent controls in place to keep coal ash out of the community. Again ORAU and the TN Poison Center are doing medical examinations using a protocol devel oped by experts in medical toxicology and environmental medicine. CONCLUSION 16: \"The Tennessee Department of Health conclude d that screening people's blood or urine for metals would not be helpful.\" 4 Comment: We strongly disagree. TDH asserts that \"b ased on environmenta l test results, the Tennessee Department of Health does not expect harm to health from touching, eating, drinking, or breathing the metals in coal fly ash. No harm is expected from breathing the air as long as adequate dust suppression measures are in place.\" However, TDH has acknowledged that the maximum concentration of arsenic in soil excee ded the health comparison value for chronic exposure of a child. 5 Also, as noted above, our arsenic inge stion estimate indicates that risks may exist for children who may ingest co al ash or ash-contaminated soil (see Comment on Conclusion 4, above, adjusting TDH calculations by usi ng the correct child body weight value). Biomonitoring is necessary to determine whether ch ildren are or have been exposed to excessive levels of arsenic. TDH has acknowledged the health concerns of community members following abnormal results for heavy metals in biomonitoring testing ma de possible by the non-governmental organization United Mountain Defense. TDH has also stated that TVA will make resources available for further testing of individuals. 6 Data obtained from such testing should be incorporated into the PHA. Response: All these comments have been fully discussed. Data from the medical exams will not be available in time for incorporation into the PHA. This PHA is based on currently available data and the pr oper use of risk assess ment methodology. If medical evaluation shows that people were harmed by exposure to coal ash, then we would take 1 Id., at 66-7; 101. 2 Id., at 52. 3 Id., at 70. 4 Id., at 35. 5 Id., at 14. 6 Id., at 71. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 264 further action to explore the issue. It is inappropriate to wait until data resulting from the medical evaluations are ava ilable to publish the PHA. III. Miscellaneous comments Discussion of EMEGs , page 8: According to the PHA, \"If con centrations are below the chronic EMEG [Environmental Media Evaluation Guidelin e] for a particular chemical, the health assessor can be reasonably certain that no advers e health effects will occur in people who are exposed. Stated another way, the health assesso r can be very sure that even long-term, continuous exposure to a chemical at concentr ations below its chronic EMEG will not harm people's health.\" This statement is misleadi ng. In its discussion of EMEGs, the ATSDR Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual states that \"before excluding all substances detected at concentrations below environmental guidelines from further consideration in a public health assessment, you need to consider the factors described in Section 7.4.\" Section 7.4 of the Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual enumerates these factors as: Community concerns Specific populations (Particularly sensitive popul ations, or populations exposed at higher rates than the averag e population, e.g. subsistence fishers) Multiple pathways of exposure Multiple-chemical exposures Response: TDH used health comparison values co rrectly. Outside peer reviewers agree. In addition, ATSDR reviews and approves all methodologies and conclusions. TDH did not consider contaminant exposure among subsistence fishers, who may be exposed to higher doses of contaminants than recreational fishers. Furthermore, EMEGs do not account for carcinogenic effects. According to the ATSD R Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual \"EMEGs are based on toxicity information (MRLs), which consider noncarcinogenic toxic effects of chemicals, including their developm ental and reproductive toxicity. MRLs do not consider potential genotoxic or carcinogenic eff ects of a substance. Because some substances have both noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic eff ects, ATSDR has derived CREGs [Cancer Risk Evaluation Guides] to consider potentia l carcinogenic effects of a substance.\" 1 These CREGs are \"media-specific comparison values that are used to identify concentra tions of cancer-causing substances that are unlikely to result in an increase of cancer rates in an exposed population. ATSDR develops CREGs using EPA's cancer slope factor (CSF) or inhalation unit risk (IUR), a target risk level (10-6), and default exposure assumptions.\"2 Response: We know of no populations of subsistence fishers in this area. The current fish advisories have been in place for many years. If someone is a subsistence fisher using the Watts Bar Reservoir, they are at much greater risk from mercury and PCBs than from a theoretical bioaccumulation of metals from the coal ash. TDEC and TWRA are sampling fish and will continue to sample 1 ATSDR (2005) ATSDR Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual , Appendix F. Available at: http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/PHAmanual/appf.html 2 Id. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 265 fish. TDH used all health comparison values correctly, for carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects. Simply stated, a health assessor cannot be \"very sure that even long-term, continuous exposure to a chemical... will not harm people's health\" simply because the concentrations detected were below the EMEG without first having considered whether the chemical in question may produce carcinogenic effects, which are not accounted for by the EMEGs. Arsenic, a carcinogenic element, is present in the ash from the Kingston ash spill. As stated on pages 4 and 5 of these comments, children may be receiving doses of ar senic that are higher th an TDH estimated, and in excess of the ATSDR MRL and the EPA Refe rence Dose. However, TDH did not derive a CREG for arsenic when evaluating exposures to this substance among children or other subpopulations. This oversigh t should be corrected. Response: TDH did not derive a carcinogenic value for ar senic, although EPA has done so. The health comparison values used in this PHA for arseni c, beryllium, and cadmium in air are based on carcinogenic potential risk. Definition of TCLP test; page 14: According to TDH, Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) testing of coal ash samples \"g ives a good indication if the metals would be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when ingested.\" 1 In the TCLP tests, about 0.5 percent of the arsenic present in the EPA-collected sa mples leached, and about 0.7 percent from TDH- collected samples.2 However, contrary to the TDH statem ent, the TCLP test is not a good or reliable indicator of how much leaching of metals would occur in the gastrointestinal tract. Metals leaching is pH-dependent. While the test solution in the TCLP test is buffered to pH 5, the pH in the human stomach is approximate ly 2. Wang et al. (2009) tested Appalachian bituminous coal samples and found that arsenic leaching was greatest at pH <3 and pH >7.3 The pH in the human stomach falls w ithin the range of greatest arse nic leaching (pH <3), while the pH of the solution in TCLP tests falls within the range of lowest leaching (3<pH<7). In the Wang et al. (2009) study, arseni c leaching at pH 2 exceeded 800 ug/L, but was <10 ug/L at pH 5.4 Mercier et al. (2002) also found that the TCLP test leached less lead than a gastric juice simulation test conducted at pH 2,5 providing further evidence that the TCLP test is inadequate when determining how much of a me tal would leach out of coal ash in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, the latest report on coal ash le aching by the EPA's O ffice of Research and Development provides additional definitive evid ence that metal leaching is pH-dependent and the TCLP test is not a reliable test. This report determined that variable pH greatly affects the 1 TDH (2009), at xiv. 2 Id., at 15. 3 Wang, T; Wang, J; Tang,Y; Shi, H; Ladwig, K.

Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 266 leaching of metals from coal ash, particularly for arsenic.1 Using a new and more reliable leach test, the EPA determined that arsenic leaching from fly ash reached levels up to 18,000 ug/L or 3.5 times the toxicity characteristic (hazardous waste level) of arsenic.2 Response: Including the statement in the defi nition was an oversight and has been corrected. CONCLUSIONS Based on our review of the Public Health Assessment (PHA) of the Kingston Fossil Plant coal ash release, we conclude the following: The lack of biomonitoring data in the Public Health Assessment undermines the conclusions by TDH concerning h ealth risks from exposure to coal ash, particularly to children. Data from any future biomonitoring te sts should be incorporated into the PHA. TDH has underestimated arsenic doses in ch ildren from incidental ingestion of ash- contaminated soil by overestimating a refe rence child's body weight in a manner inconsistent with the ATSDR Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual . TDH must recalculate the dose by using the correct body weight. The Environmental Media Evaluation Guide lines (EMEGs) TDH used in its health assessment do not account for carcinogenic risks from arsenic. TDH should have considered, in addition to the EMEGs, appr opriate Cancer Risk Evaluation Guides (CREGs) that would account for these risks. TDH has not conducted a comprehensive hydr ogeologic study of groundwater or karst water movement under the Kingston plan or th e spill site. Thus primary flow paths and rates and directions of water flow have not been definitively established. Such analyses should be completed, followed by comp rehensive testing of groundwater for contaminants, including boron. These results must be analyzed before a conclusion is drawn that groundwater is safe for human cons umption in the area ne ar the plant and spill site. Drinking water municipal systems, springs and wells should be tested for boron, a leachable constituent of coal ash. While th ere is no EPA drinking water standard for boron, animal studies indicate that boron ma y cause harm to the male reproductive system, low birth weight, and birth defects. The U.S. EPA has set a Longer Term Health Advisory for boron in drinking water cons umed by children of 2.0 mg/L, while the European Union has adopted a standard of 1.0 mg/L 3, 4 Based on water and fish testing results, it is premature for TDH to conclude that no harm will come to people's health from recreational river use, since fish may be 1 U.S. EPA, (2009) Characterization of Coal Combustion Residue s from Electric Utilities Using Multi-Pollutant Control Technology - Leaching and C haracterization Data (EPA-600/R-09/151).

TDH should consid er risks to subsistence fishers in its health assessment. TDH should not conclude that breathing coal ash will not harm people's health, since available evidence points to the existence of elevated health risks. Particulate matter has exceeded levels known from scientific studies to aggravate asthma symptoms in children. Furthermore, TDH found statistically significant clustering of respiratory symptoms near the area of the spill, and of re spiratory complaints near the truck route. Therefore, dust control measures along the quarry truck route and in the spill area should be improved. We urge TDH to address the issues identified in these comments on the Public Health Assessment (PHA) to protect the community residents from the health risks posed by coal ash exposure.

Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release Comments on Exposure to Coal Ash Sirs, I am submitting comments the draft Public Health Assessment on exposure to coal ash. The draft assessment of no health danger to humans lacks significant evidence of de termination of what are the potential long term effects of exposure to coal ash on humans. Long term health concerns have been raise at locations in other states on the long term human health effects to human exposure. It is my concerns that discounting th ese findings would be a serious mistake by the TN Department of Health. Especially with the la ck of knowledge of studying the exposure impacts on children. The placement of schedule screen ing on impacted children must be done. The priority is to assure citizens of efforts to ca tch health problems before they are untreatable. The present assessment does nit ta ke into account long term expos ure and the procedures needed to catch health exposure problems before they are untreatable. The implementing of screening assures citizens that they con cerns are being address. Prior lo ng term exposure health problems have been documented in other states. A screen ing programs of resident should be implemented to over the long term concerns over the next 5 to ten years to catch health concerns before they are untreatable. It would be a serious mistake to determin e \"No health danger\" based upon present health status of residents and their children. I thank you for this opportunity to submit comments if the draft. Sincerely, Response: The Public Health Assessment looked at long-term chronic effect s of exposure to coal ash. TDH did not conduct blood te sts or other forms of biomonitoring. Any exposure from any route or any media would have been very brie f. The weather and the wetness of the ash precluded it from becoming air-borne . Any dermal exposure or in cidental ingestion would have been possible only for a very few days. Any su ch exposures would have been impossible to detect with any type of biomonitoring. A central tenet of health assessm ents is that somehow enough of the chemicals of concern have to ge t inside someone for a long enough time before they can do harm. TVA has arranged, through Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), for medical examinations, including blood testin g, of anyone living near the spill who wants it. The protocol for the examinations was carefully developed by occupational and envi ronmental physicians from the University of Colorado School of Publ ic Health, Vanderbilt Medical Center medical toxicologists, and ORAU scientists. The protocol includes blood testing. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 270 Public Commenter <EEP.Health@tn.gov> Date: 2/8/2010 8:15 AM Subject: Regarding TDH's PHA for Kingston ash spill Dear Sir or Madam: The implication in the recently published assessmen t that the Kingston coal ash spill poses little public health threat is ridiculous knowing wh at we know about the human health impacts of aerial and waterborne ash. Furthermore, it contra dicts the experiences of a number of residents of the affected region. The report states that ash and the toxic metals c ontained within have not \"gotten into private well or spring water\". But, what of the massive cont amination of the Clinch and Emory rivers, and seepage into groundwater? The report states that the coal ash did not \"increase particulate matter [...] in the ambient air around the site\". Some of it may have blown away, but the impacts of inha ling toxic particulates within the first several week s after the spill (w hen poor air quality was independently documented by citizen monitors) must not be underestimated. Finally, it states: \"Scree ning people's blood or urine for metals would not be helpful.\" Right. Not helpful to TVA's mounting liability for this catastrophe. Frankly, this report smells like a cover-up. An independent (out-of-state experts with a citizen review board) investigation should be conducted. Unless the true magnitude of what happened last December in Kingston comes to light, negligen t utilities and coal comp anies will continue to allow these things to happen. Sincerely, Response: This Public Health Assessment was r eviewed by three outside peer reviewers who are experts in their fields. Two of the three reviewers fully support the conclusions and discussion and conclude that the report is valid. One revi ewer had issues with how the conclusions were worded, but not with how the environmental sampling data was interpreted. All possible routes of exposure were discussed in the report: groundwater, surface drinking water, surface recreational water, the ash itself, and air. The report looked at si te-specific data and drew conclusions based on actual data rather than generic informa tion about coal ash. TDH did not conduct blood tests or other forms of biomonitoring. Any exposure from any route or any media would have been very brief for this particular spill. The weather and the wetness of the ash precluded it from becoming air-borne. Any dermal exposure or incidental ingestion would have been possible only for a very few day s. Any such exposures would have been impossible to detect with any type of biomonitoring. A central tenet of health assessments is that Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 271 somehow enough of the chemicals of concern ha ve to get inside someone for a long enough time before they can do harm. TVA has arranged, through ORAU, for medical exam inations, including blood testing, of anyone living near the spill who wants it. The protocol for the examinations was carefully developed by occupational and environmental phy sicians from the University of Colorado School of Public Health, Vanderbilt Medical Center medical toxico logists, and ORAU scientists. The protocol includes blood testing. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 272 <EEP.Health@tn.gov> Date: 2/8/2010 7:09 AM Subject: Long term Effects I definitely think that screening for toxic hea vy metals should be conducted on residents in the surrounding area of the coal ash spill. My husband grew up in Herculaneum, MO and was exposed to lead in air and water for approximately 18 years until he left for college. The lead smelter was then called St. Joe Lead Company, which is now listed as Doe Run Lead. When growing up, he had chronic GI pains, fatigue, an d low weight. The St. Joe doctor, the only MD in area, never addressed the lead poisoning or anal yzed his blood for lead. Fifty years later he and his 2 sisters all have neuropa thies in hands and feet and neur ological damage. This damage is just from lead exposure, who knows the potential health risks from the combined effects of arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, selenium, thallium, and vanadium. Children are more affected and at risk; th is fact cannot be ignored. Response: I am sorry that your husband did not have anyone to protect him from lead exposure at Herculaneum. We did not ignore any potential risk s to children or adults at the ash spill. The Public Health Assessment is a s ite-specific analysis of the spill and its potential for harm to people. TDH did not conduct blood tests or other forms of biomonitoring. Any exposure from any route or any media would have been very brief for this particular spill. The weather and the wetness of the ash precluded it from becoming air-borne. Any dermal exposure or incidental ingestion would have been possible only for a very few day s.

The protocol for the examinations was carefully developed by occupational and environmental phy sicians from the University of Colorado School of Public Health, Vanderbilt Medical Center medical toxico logists, and ORAU scientists. The protocol includes blood testing. Appendix F. Public Comments and Responses Public Health Assessment: KIF Coal Ash Release 273 TDA is denying their responsibility. The TVA spill Toxic Coal Ash Threatens the Health and Environment and is a human carcinogen (based on occupational exposure studies) associated with increased risks of skin, lung, and bladder cancers\" Additionally, thos e same scientists strongly recommend \"long-term follow-ups of various population groups, includ ing children and adolesce nts, pregnant women, persons exposed in utero, and individuals with pre-existing broncho-pulmonary diseases and diabetes mellitus\" because of the ash's radioactive and heavy metal content, and because of the likelihood of fine particles becomi ng resuspended in the air. It's outrageous for TDH to state \"screening peop le's blood or urine for metals would not be helpful\". These people have been poisoned and TDA is denying their responsibility. Sincerely, Response: TDH did not conduct bl ood tests or other forms of bi omonitoring. Any exposure from any route or any media would have been very brief for this particular spill.
