Children's Vaccination Resources The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 to include children 6 months to 4 years of age via a 3-dose series. The vaccine formulation is a lower dose than previous formulations, at 3 micrograms of mRNA, compared to 30 for the adult dose. The FDA has also authorized the use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine for children ages 6 months through 5 years via a 2-dose series. The dosage is 25 micrograms of mRNA compared to 100 for the adult dose and 50 for the adult booster. The authorization was based on the FDA's thorough and transparent evaluation of the data that included input from independent advisory committee experts. See the [Pediatric Pfizer Fact Sheet](https://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=17228&format=pdf) and the [Pediatric Moderna Fact Sheets](https://www.fda.gov/media/159309/download) for more info. At this time, the Pfizer vaccine is the only approved COVID-19 vaccine for ages 5 - 11 and is administered as a two-dose primary series, 3 weeks apart, but is a lower dose (10 micrograms) than that used for individuals 12 years of age and older (30 micrograms). See the [Teen Pfizer Fact Sheet](https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/files/21_5-18%20vaccine%20fact%20sheet_11-4.pdf) for more info.
