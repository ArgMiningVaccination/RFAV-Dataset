A great idea, says the Canadian Federationof Senior Citizens andPensioners. They'vegot 120 to give to theFederal in the new year. That number, saysCurtis DeCoste, ofBoylston, NS and the new National President of the Federation, represents the number ofresolutions passed at the Senior's Annual Meeting held a few weeks ago in Sydney . The resolutions, now being edited and catalogued, will be presented to the appropriate departments of the FederalGovernment, and to the Leader of the Oppositionas well\u2014sort of a memory-jogging device to helpgovernment remember what is being asked. Curtis told us in a telephone conversation the other day that the resolutions range across a broad spectrum, from health, housing and highway betterment, to pensions, patent medicines andparental-grandparental issues revolving aroundvisiting rights with the children.Some of the resolutions have been on the plate before, but they bear repeating, say the seniors,who discussed and debated them at the Sydneyconvention. Among the matters the seniors want to put before government: Health care, the closing of hospital beds, the shortage of doctors and nurses, a review of BillC-91 which provides patent protection for drugmanufacturers against others who can producesimilar medication at lower prices; long termhomecare and a careful look at the rising cost ofhealth services and drugs. Merry Christmas from the staff of the Senior Citizens' Secretariat2And then there's the high cost of transportation for seniors (especially in rural areas); the risingcost of fuel for travel and heating; the urgencyabout road conditions, including the need fortwinning dangerous sections; higher pensions forseniors; repeal of the clawback provision whichreduces a pensioner's benefits if he/she earnsmore that a prescribed amount of income. The resolutions also want freedom from income tax on the death benefits paid a surviving spousefrom the Canada Pension Plan; clear rules forgrandparents to have visiting rights with theirgrandchildren in the wake of family disputes andbreakups; retention of the Canadian BroadcastingCorporation's role as the national broadcastingservice; and abandonment of the Federalconsideration to privatize Ste. Anne de BelliveauVeterans Hospital in Quebec, fearing that it couldlead to a lessening of veterans' care across thecountry . \"We plan to take our resolutions to each department concerned so that our concerns aremade known to the appropriate ministers andsenior staff. We hope to meet with the policy-makers early in the new year,\" said Mr. DeCoste. The Guysborough County resident brings much experience and organizational savvy to his new job as Federation President. He and his wife Helen have been involved in the senior movement formany years and have held important leadershipand advocacy roles. It's fitting, too, that with the closeness that exists between veterans and seniors groups, Mr. DeCoste brings Royal Canadian Legion experience into play . He is currently president of the Guysborough Branch of the Legion.Submitted by: Harold SheaSecretariat Newsletter The Secretariat Newsletter is published four times a year by the Senior Citizens'Secretariat and distributed free of charge.We welcome letters, articles and items ofinterest from you.

The Senior Citizens' Secretariat was established in 1980 to facilitate the planning and development of services and programs for seniors by coordinatingplans, policies and programs presented by the departments of the provincial government. The Secretariat serves as aone door entry to government for seniors,seniors' groups and other provincial bodies concerned with aging issues. The Secretariat develops plans, policiesand programs in partnership with otherlevels of government and agencies responsible for seniors.

Box 2065, 1-800-670-0065.Health Canada's plan to create a national health data network to help in health planning issparking debate about patients' rights toprivacy . Although Canada's PrivacyCommissioner, Bruce Phillips,acknowledged in his annual report to theHouse of Commons that the plan offers\"exciting prospects for improvingCanadians' health and the health caresystem,\" he criticized the final report issuedby the Advisory Council on HealthInfostructure on the basis of patientprivacy risks. For anotherperspective on this issue, weasked Dr. Eike-Kluge, UVicphilosophy professor and biomedicalethicist, to comment on the following threecriticisms made in the Annual Report of thePrivacy Commissioner. Criticism 1 (all criticisms are excerpts taken from: Annual Report Privacy Commissioner 1998-1999, The Health Infoway: Path to Health Surveillance ? http://www.privcom.gc.ca/02_04_07_e.htm) Thefinal report issued by the Advisory Council onHealth Infostructure fails \"to acknowledge thepatient's right to choose not to participate in anyhealth information network. Nor does it speakabout limiting surveillance of individual patientswho do participate.\" Dr . Kluge's Comments: This sounds acceptable however, what should be borne in mind is if apatient is a recipient of health care services, thenthe patient has a prima facie duty to participatein research that makes the delivery of such health care possible. Ethically , if the planners have a duty to provide health care, then they have a right to the means demonstrably necessary to provide that care. Data access is implicated here. What isethically appropriate is not that the patient may withdraw from the data pool, but that the personal identifiers of the patients be deleted. Alternative to that\u2014where it may not be possible to do this\u2014is to follow the various provincial legislations thatallow bona fide researchers to access such data, but makes it an offense to breach confidentiality . Criticism 2 \"The [final] report's recognition that groups of people can be stigmatized by having health information used against them was another important milestone. Unfortunately the recognition was limited to Aboriginal and immigrantcommunities. Any group of individuals can beperceived as having particular attributes that arethen ascribed\u2014rightly or wrongly\u2014to anymember of the group. The conclusion can besimplistic and dangerous. The concept of \"group\"privacy deserves broader interpretation in thehealth care context and more attention overall.\" Dr . Kluge's Comments: This is fair comment. No particular group has a greater right to privacyand confidentiality than any other group. 3Can the Need for Privacy and the Need for Health Information be Balanced? by Nancy NewallCriticism 3 \"Fuelling our concern is that tone of the companion Health Information Roadmap, produced by Health Canada, Statistics Canada and the Canadian Institute for Health Information.The roadmap describes the steps needed to builda comprehensive health information system and infrastructure to deliver health care to individuals. While it acknowledges that \"individuals have important rights over when and how their personal information is used,\" its answer to protectingthose rights is patient access to privacy policies, and stripping names from the medical information. The first risks being mere window dressing; thesecond attempts to provide confidentiality , notprivacy . Protecting patient\"privacy\"by replacingpatients' names with identifying numbers is asimplistic solution to a complex problem. It is asimple matter to re-identify the individuals andso unlock a comprehensive and intensely detailedprofile.\" Dr . Kluge's Comments: This is unfair and untrue. Privacy can be guaranteed if the list linkingidentifiers and names is kept physically separatefrom the master documents and can be accessedonly by duly authorised individuals for dulyapproved purposes. Not only that: this comment ignores the fact that there are certaincircumstances where one would want to be ableto trace the source of information so as to helpthe individuals. For instance, if a screeningprogramme found out that certain conditions areindicative of a hither to unidentified seriousproblem, one wants to be able to trace. The RedCross Blood Programme was unable to do thatwith the hepatitis infection data. We should havelearned from this not that one does notwant to be able to link, but that one does want to be able to link under certain circumstances. The abovecomment, therefore, strikes me as not onlysimplistic in itself, but to ignore completely theethics of due care. Source: Centre on Aging: Research throughout the Life Course, Victoria, BCShooting from the Hip Golfers know him as \"Nick the Wedge\" becauseof his prowess with the club. But it would also bereasonable to call him \"Nick the Hip\". Four-timeCanadian Amateur champion Nick Weslock, now82, has undergone five hip replacements and continues to play excellent golf. Anybody looking to a \"poster senior\" for this operation need lookno further. \"I've had three on my left and two on my right,\" says Weslock, who has played in four Masters.\"The reason I've had to go back is that therotation in my swing loosened the stem in thefemur. But every operation has left me pain-freeand has allowed me to keep on playing golf.\" Weslock had his first hip replacement in 1973, with the most recent in 1999. While it's unusualfor an individual to have so many , Weslock hasnever been leery of the procedure. It's all aboutquality of life, he says, and the hip replacementshave never slowed him down\u2014in fact, Weslock still competes and regularly shoots in the mid-70s. \"I average 240 yards off the tee,\" he says, \"and Ithink that's pretty good. I try to let the golf clubswing me, rather than forcing myself to swing it.\" The eight-time Ontario Amateur and seven-time Ontario Open champion is hardly the only high-profile golfer to have found new life in golf viahip replacement surgery . None other than JackNicklaus, 60, had the procedure two years ago,and has returned to play some fine, high-levelgolf\u2014in April, he made the halfway cut at theMasters, and this season he's also playing the U.S.and British Opens, plus the PGA Championship,Nicklaus knows he wouldn't be golfing at allwithout having had hip replacement surgery . Then there are the thousands and thousands of recreational golfers who have enjoyed the gamefollowing the operation. Ernie Skrow , a 67-yearold Torontonian, is one. Skrow had his surgery nine years ago, six years after first experiencing hip-related pain. Whilestretching and strengthening exercises initiallyhelped him minimize the discomfort\u2014he alsosought physiotherapy and chiropractic help\u2014heeventually required hip replacement surgery . 4\"It got to the point where I couldn't get out of the car,\" he recalls. \"There were times I couldn't put one foot in front of the other. The funny thing was my back, my leg and my ankle hurt me\u2014butnever the hip. But it was the hip that was causingmy problems. The pain went away the day afterthe surgery , and after rehab I was back on thecourse.\" It was Dr. Marvin Tile, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre in Toronto and a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto, whoperformed Skrow's operation. An active golferhimself, Tile has countless examples of howreplacement surgery\u2014its formal name is total hip arthroplasty\u2014has helped golfers continue playing. \"The main indication that surgery is required is aseriously arthritic hip,\" Tile says. \"The pain fromarthritis is what leads to surgery . I always ask apatient, 'Are you having fun in life? Is the paintaking over?' If it is, and an x-ray shows the hipis the problem, it could be time for the surgery .\" While hip replacement surgery can certainly improve an individual's quality of life, it doeshave its limitations. \"I had one man in his late 80s who was told he could walk 18 holes but not 36, so he wanted ahip replacement,\" Tile says. \"I thought that wasunrealistic. On the other hand, it's wonderful tohelp people regain enjoyment of the game.\" What of the \"post-op\" effects on one's golf game? As Nick Weslock was quick to learn, it's crucial that golfers returning to the course know just how far they can push themselves. Having had hismost recent hip replacement only last November,Weslock found he needed to restrict his lower-body motion during his swing. Gradually , as helet the club swing him, Weslock noticed his bodywas following. He was gaining mobility in hislower body and finishing with all his weight onhis front foot, just as the experts advise. \"The only pain I have now is from a bad shot, not hip pain,\" Weslock says. \"Hip replacementsurgery is really marvelous. Just to walk out freefrom pain is wonderful. And then to get back onthe course and play decently , well, that's a bigbonus.\"It's a bonus available to all golfers who havesuffered hip problems and for whom hipreplacement surgery is an option. As Dr. Tileemphasizes, there's nothing in the golf swing per se that should cause hop problems. He pointsout that sports such as tennis (especially singlestennis) squash and handball, with their frequentstops and starts, are far more likely to lead to hipproblems. \"Once you get structural changes in the hip and you're in pain it's time to think about surgery ,\" Tile counsels. \"You can't reverse arthritis once those changes happen and the hip reaches a certain Golfers need not worry , however. They can look to Nicklaus, Weslock, and Senior PGA Tourwinner George Archer,who has had two hipreplacements.And Skrowis outon thecourse,again playing three orfour times a week. What else is there to say? Nothing but hip, hip,hooray for a surgery thatcan add years to yourgolfing life. Contributing Editor LorneRubenstein is Canada's premier golf author andcommentator.

Ageism Affecting Quality of Care for Canadian Seniors Experts Develop New Program to Educate Healthcare Professionals on Unique Health Issues Toronto. Ontario\u2014July 24, 2000 The Canadian Working Group on Seniors' HealthIssues today announced the launch of MATURE(Multidisciplinary Approach To UnequalledResults in the Elderly), the first in a series ofrevolutionary new programs to help overcomethe prevalence of agism in Canada. The program,targeted to healthcare professionals acrossCanada, will help to ensure a comprehensiveassessment of all elderly people, not just thosebelieved to be frail or at high risk for significantlong-term illness or death. \"The number of elderly persons in the developed nations is growing at an ever increasing rate,\"explained Dr. William Dalziel, President of theCanadian Geriatrics Society and Co-chair of The Canadian Working Group on Seniors' Health lssues. \"There is a need for the medicalprofessional to focus not only on the illnessesthat are affecting seniors, but to recognize thatmany seniors can easily lead healthy lives wellinto their senior years. This program marks animportant step in providing solutions to thechallenges faced by healthcare professionals,patients and families in achieving effective healthmanagement for seniors.\" The MATURE program was launched following the conclusion of the second annual meeting of theWorking Group held in Toronto on July 7, 2000.The group has been formed to help address theurgent needs of Canadian senior by identifyingissues and providing solutions to the ongoingand increasing challenges faced by the elderly . Program Highlights Although it has been well established that thereare specific conditions that a physician should beaware of when assessing an elderly patient, theseconditions are often overlooked. The programprovides physicians and other healthcareprofessionals with education around preventive 7approaches and screening tools for these common diseases, including depression,osteoporosis and dementia. The first module, focusing on the \"healthy senior\" looks at: 1. Normal aging changes 2. Early warning signs and screening and assessment methods for common problemsof the elderly including visual and hearing problems, depression, cognitive impairment, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis andinfluenza 3. Evidence-bused primary and secondary health-promotion measures for the elderly Beyond monitoring and screening the program also recognizes that physicians have anincreasing role in helping their healthy elderlypatients remain healthy\" Counselling is also animportant component of the overall assessment,including dietary recommendations and lifestylemodifications. MATURE will be made available in the corning months to geriatricians across Canada through an educational grant from SmithKline BeechamPharma. \"Aging can impact people's health in many different ways. Beyond the obvious disease states,their health is often affected by their economicsituation, their role in society or their family , ortheir psychological state,\" explained Dr. BarbaraPower, Chief of Geriatric Medicine, The OttawaHospital, University of Ottawa and Co-chair ofThe Canadian Working Group on Seniors' HealthIssues. \"We must begin to understand all of theseissues.\" In Canada, seniors already represent a significant proportion of the patients attended to by primarycare physicians. This number is expected toincrease significantly over the next decade. To ensure a good quality of life for Canadian seniors, physicians need to begin monitoring for earlywarning signs of a number of common problems.The majority of these conditions are treatable. The Canadian Working Group on Seniors Health Issues The Working Group includes representatives from the Canadian Geriatrics Society , The College of Family Physicians of Canada, Canada's Association for the Fifty-Plus, The Canadian Association on Gerontology , One Voice-The Canadian Seniors'Network, The Canadian Home Care Association, The Canadian Health Care Association, SmithKline Beecham Pharma, The Canadian Pharmacists'Association, Centre Hospitalier Universit\u00e9 deMontr\u00e9al-Pavillon St-Luc, The HomeCare Association, Elizabeth Bruy\u00e8re Hospital and The Canadian Gerontological Nursing Association.

Dave Weinbaum, The One-Line PhilosopherPhone 'angels' reach out to isolated seniors Leon Kuperberg believes in \"invisible angels\". The 89-year-old lives in his own home and receives a phone call from his angel every week.And just who is this angel? She's a very real and special person who is one of the phone volunteers with Baycrest's Seniors Support Program. The program has been operating for three years and helps more than 250 seniors in the Torontoarea, many of whom are frail and living alone.Some are on the waiting list for long-term care,others may be recently widowed or struggling tolook after a sick spouse. Calling up a senior to say , \"Hello, how are you today\", is a simple gesture that makes them feelvalued and cared about, says social worker LesleyPatterson, who coordinates the program. In some cases, it can be a lifeline for a senior who is unable to get out much and feels isolated. The phonevolunteer is backed-up professionally by an in-house social worker and registered nurse. Leon has been looking after Rachel, his wife of 62 years, since she had a series of strokes. EveryT uesday morning, he looks forward to a call fromhis phone angel Freda Slotnick. \"It is a full-time job caring for my wife,\" says Leon. \"I'm very thankful when people call to askhow I am doing. It's just a simple phone call, butit means so much to me.\" The Seniors Support Program needs more \"invisible angels\" for a few hours a week, either in the morning or afternoon.

Source: Volunteers: The Heart of BaycrestCoping With Stress\u2014 Coping Styles By Gordon Hurler , Ph.D., Psychologist You can find many books on stress and coping in the self-help or health sections of bookstores andlibraries. Each book has its own advice on howto best handle stress. Although there are manydifferent techniques that can be used to copewith stress, most can be grouped into three maincategories: I. Task-oriented, 2. Distraction-oriented and 3. Emotional-oriented. The techniques in each of these categories have their advantages and disadvantages. Some workbetter with some types of stressors than others.As well, people often prefer or are morecomfortable using some types of techniques than others. Task-oriented techniques focus on doing something to change yourself, the stressor or the situation so that it is no longer stressful.Examples include reading about the problem,talking to an expert about the problem,reorganizing your schedule so that you can takecare of the stressor, or learning a new skill tohelp you deal with the problem better. Using organization and planning is also useful with problems that have deadlines, such aspreparing your income tax return. Task-orientedtechniques tend to be less helpful in coping withsituations where you have little control or whereyou are simply waiting for time to pass (forexample, worrying about your family travellingthe highway during a bad storm). For situations where lack of control or time is an issue, distraction-oriented techniques can be helpful. The purpose of distraction-orientedtechniques are to help you to get your mind offthe situation and allow you to relax, even if onlyfor a brief period of time. Watching television,writing letters, surfing the Internet, and reading are all examples of distraction-oriented techniques. 10Physical exercise or physical activities such as gardening, woodworking or doing houseworkmay not only distract you, but can also be usefulin putting the excess energy that comes with too much stress to a good cause. Distraction-oriented techniques should be avoided when a task-oriented approach would help get rid of or lessen the stressor. For example, if you feel stressed becauseyou have not completed some job that needs tobe done then you would probably be better offactually working on the job instead of distractingyourself from thinking about it! Emotional-oriented techniques focus on addressing feelings and can be helpful in justabout any situation. Seeking out companionship,talking with family and friends, or addressingspiritual needs are all emotional-orientedapproaches. For most people, talking out a problem, \"getting it off my chest\", can be very helpful. Talking with others lessens the burden. As well as gettingsupport from others, occasionally you can getinformation or ideas that will actually help youdeal successfully with the problem. If a familymember or friend are not available or are notenough, then you might want to seek out somehelp (psychologist, social worker, family doctor,priest, minister or rabbi, etc.) When choosing a technique to deal with a stressor, first check your own personal style\u2014are you task, emotional or distraction oriented? Try to pick anapproach that best fits your style. But also checkthat the technique you choose is the best notonly for the moment, but for the long run aswell. Don't use distraction when a task-orientedresponse is called for!

Source: Health Edition , Vol.4, No.44 11 Gene therapy: medical breakthroughs by Leona Adamo Maxwell Gene therapy is a phrase that has been the subject of many reports and much interest in the 90s. The concept is one that can inspire great hope,yet provoke fear. With the prospect of genetherapy as a cure, researchers and sufferers alikeare hunting for what this can mean for illnesses as diverse as cancer, AIDS, arthritis, cystic fibrosis,musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases, and inheritable diseases such asGaucher disease, infectious diseases and more.The possibilities seem unlimited; the conceptseems stolen from a science fiction novel. For Pennsylvanians, there is much to be excited about because of the extensive research that isgoing on in the state's hospitals and universities,especially the Institute for Human Gene Therapyat the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centerin Philadelphia, the Pittsburgh Genetics Institute at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Jake Gittlen Cancer Institute at Penn StateCollege of Medicine at the Milton S. HersheyMedical Center. Broadly defined, gene therapy is the use of genetic engineering to enhance a damaged cell ortissue, thus restoring its healthy function. In thecase of cystic fibrosis, for example, an affectedindividual is born with a mutated gene thatcauses the disease. Gene therapy , then, strives tointroduce a correct copy of the gene for cysticfibrosis into the person's body , thereby helpingthe body to recode its genetic malfunction. When a potential therapy is identified, the clinical trials begin. Any research being done atthis time is in the preliminary stages, or in PhaseI clinical trials. A Phase I clinical trial, accordingto Dr. Nelson Wivel, deputy director of theInstitute for Human Gene Therapy at Universityof Pennsylvania Medical Center, is performed toestablish that the therapy under investigation issafe and can be considered for the next stage ofdetermination, on its road to being declared acure. As Wivel notes, \"if something therapeutichappens, that's good,\" but the trials are notmeant to declare a cure; rather to determinesafety for continued study . But that's still exciting. Currently , Wivel notes that since the first gene-related trials in September1990, there has been a steady increase in clinicaltrials, and over 200,000 patients have beeninvolved. \"Eighty per cent of the trials focus oncancer because that is a disease for which we areall at risk and which primarily affects people asthey get older.\" In December 1996, researchers at Penn State's College of Medicine at Hershey Medical Centrereported the discovery of a \"new gene that suppresses the metastasis, or spread, of melanoma, the often fatal skin cancer.\" Dan R. Welch, Ph.D.,assistant professor of pathology at the College ofMedicine's Jake Gittlen Cancer Institute, andJeong-Hyung Lee, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellowfrom Korea, isolated a gene, called KiSS-1, fromthe cells of malignant melanomas in humans.Welch explains that it has been tested on rats and is determined to be between 80 percent and90 percent effective in inhibiting the spread ofmelanoma. What does this mean to those of us who are waiting to see when the gene therapy formelanoma starts? Welch says that they arehoping by year's end to have materials necessaryto begin testing on patients. \"Research is goingon around the world. We are working with thebest people, but it also is a matter of luck.\" Does that mean there will be a cure soon? \"We've come a long way , but...\" there is still moreresearch and then the clinical trials. He noteswith this particular research it's important to beappropriately encouraged, but not misled. Cancer research and gene therapy is also a very important part of the picture at the University ofPennsylvania Medical Center. Wivel explains thatmuch of the research centers around the \"HolyGrail\" of gene therapy , which is the \"stem cell.\"The stem cell is the \"godfather of all cells thatreside in the bone marrow. They are the cells thatgive rise to all the different kinds of blood cells\u2014red, white, platelets, lymphocytes.\"When cancerresearch is mentioned, stem cell research is 12generally a part of the discussion, because of its importance to all the other cells. Most researchregarding stem cells involves taking stem cellsfrom the bone marrow of a patient and treatingthe stem cells with whatever gene therapy isbeing researched for that particular cancer. Theobjective is to make that population of bloodcells resistant to whatever is attacking them. Thecells are then reintroduced into the body throughferrying retroviruses which, depending on thecancer, bring the healthy blood cells to wherethey can fight the disease. Currently , at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Phase I trials are being performed in areas as diverse as brain tumors called malignant gliomas, for which there is very littleto offer patients at this time in the way ofstandard treatment; and mesothelioma, a cancerrelated to exposure to asbestos. All research being done is aimed toward clinical trials. In order for a cure to be identified, humans eventually have to come into the picture as part of the research. When they do, they are introducedto the concept by genetic counsellors. The goalsof the counselors are to provide support andeducation for those patients for whom a clinicaltrial is a choice. Erin Rice, a genetic counselor for patients with Gaucher disease, works at the Pittsburgh GeneticInstitute at the University of Pittsburgh MedicalCenter. She explains that doctors here, under thedirection of John Barranger, Ph.D., are involvedin many programs, one of which is the Gaucherclinical trial. Gaucher disease is an inheriteddisease. It causes enlarged organs, bonedeterioration with multiple fractures andprogressive nervous-system degeneration. Rice's job is to identify patients who might benefit from the gene therapy trial and then counsel them as they go into the therapy . Currently , medicationis available for the disease, but the treatments are very expensive, so an approach that could combinethe gene therapy with reduced doses of medication would be a benefit to sufferers. Throughout theprocess, Rice educates, reviews and supportsthose patients. In this particular trial, the University of Pittsburgh has been approved by the FDA for four transplants (all trials go through a lengthy approval processthat includes, finally , FDA approval for the trial). Irene Marshall is a patient at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who agreed to be apart of the trial. She has received four transplants and has now been approved to reduce her medical treatments by 5O percent. With gene therapy ,there is often a fear factor born of movies likeThe Island of Dr. Moreau or Frankenstein, whichdepict the results of playing around with whatnature intended. Few people are comfortablewith someone tampering with their DNA, sodeciding to be part of a clinical trial involvinggenes is a courageous decision. Marshall is anurse who weighed her options and decided tobe part of the clinical trial for Gaucher disease.As a nurse, I knew of the complications,\" saysMarshall. But she felt and still does feel \"realconfident about it (gene therapy). \"This is the time to be living,\" she says. \"Just when my problems started to become really serious, there is the new treatment. ..I wasn't afraid, because it has to go through so many channels to get to atrial. I knew it would be safe.\" Tests are performed on somatic cells. Wivel explains that somatic cells are those cells in thebody that are not part of the germ line, which isthe reproductive line. Therefore, therapy done onsomatic cells can only affect the patient; it cannotbe passed on to the next generation. Of course, that is good news and bad news. For those who have hereditary diseases, it would becomforting to know that they could be treatedbefore having children to prevent them fromgetting it. But there is no approved study forgerm line gene therapy or enhancement therapyfor improving looks, intelligence or changing thesex of a child. According the Wivel, the medicalcommunity considers enhancement therapyunethical. The good news in Pennsylvania\u2014by the year 2000 some residents could be cured through genetherapy .

This money will be used to fund promising research initiatives acrossCanada, under the categories of personnelawards, operating grants, and applied research. In Nova Scotia, researchers Dr. Hyo-Sung Ro and Dr. Ehud Ur, both from Dalhousie University , were awarded operating grants from the Canadian Diabetes Association. Dr. Ro's research willcontinue to study how certain molecules in thebody signal for new fat cells to be made, allowing us to understand ways to block new fat cells from developing, and to prevent fat from collecting inthese cells. This may lead to new ways to controlobesity , and subsequently reduce the risk of typeII diabetes. Dr. Ur and his colleagues will continue to conduct studies on leptin, a protein produced by fat cells,which acts on the brain in order to reduce foodintake and to increase energy expenditure. Untilrecently , leptin was thought to be produced only by fat cells, but Dr. Ur's team has now shown that leptin is also made in the part of the brain whichcontrols appetite and weight. Further findingsmay help us better understand the causes ofobesity , and hence develop new treatments for itand its consequences, one of which is diabetes. A portion of Canadian Diabetes Association research dollars continues to be specificallyearmarked for islet cell research. Internationally-recognized research at the University of Alberta,funded in part by the Association, and led by Dr. James Shapiro, confirmed that eight patientswith type I diabetes had been able to stop takinginsulin after undergoing islet cell transplantation.The researchers had successfully transplantedinsulin-producing islet cells from donatedpancreases into the livers of the patients. To date, the research has allowed these patientsto produce their own insulin for over a year ,making insulin injections unnecessary . Islet cellsare located in the pancreas, and a small portionof the pancreas is made up of cells that secretehormones, such as insulin.These insulin-producing cells are called the Islets of Langerhans. The potential for islet cell research is that one day the reversal of diabetes in humansmay , in fact, be possible, and it also suggests theneed to explore alternative sources of insulin-producing tissues, as donated pancreas organs are in short supply . Drs. Edmond Ryan, GregoryKorbutt, and Jonathan Lakey , members of theEdmonton research team, were in Halifax thismonth to attend the Association's ProfessionalConference. Finally , it was recently announced that in Calgary , a group of researchers, also funded inpart by the Canadian Diabetes Association,unveiled a significant step towards understandingthe development of type I diabetes. The Studyexamines the way in which inflammation of thepancreas in type I diabetes progresses to overtdisease, and the role certain white blood cellsplay in this process. The research outlines howthe body's white blood cells cause inflammation,and eventual destruction, of islet cells. Thepancreatic cells recognize protein markers on the surface of the islet cells, and this allows thewhite blood cells to bind and damage the isletcells. By treating mice predisposed to diabeteswith protein, the researchers have discovered that they can halt the destruction of insulin-producing insulin-producing cells, thereby preventing micefrom developing diabetes. The Calgary Study , led by Dr. Pere Santamaria. suggests a strategy to block the onset of type 1diabetes in at-risk individuals. Dr. Santamariareceived the Canadian Diabetes Association'sGreat West Life & London Life Young ScientistAward at the October Conference.

The 1994 International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) showed that seniors in Nova Scotia havelow literacy levels across the three literacydomains: prose literacy , document literacy andquantitative literacy . In addition, we know that34% of seniors 65 years of age and older, have less than a grade 9 education. While these statistics provide general insight into the literacy levels among seniors in Nova Scotia, they do not providea clear definition of their specific upgrading needs, nor do they clearly address the rural versus urban dynamics relative to seniors' literacy issues.Moreover, they are not community specific anddo not document the unique needs of thosesenior citizens who are isolated in their homes. The goal of the Nova Scotia Seniors for LiteracyProject is to prepare a strategic plan that willguide the development of programs, services andprojects to address the literacy and upgradingneeds of seniors in Nova Scotia. Data that willinform this issue and that will help to identify possible solutions will be collected via four means: 1. T wenty-four focus groups will be organized in rural and urban communities across theprovince. 2. Front line staff with the Victorian Order of Nurses (VON) and Home Care Nova Scotiawill administer a brief questionnaire to asample of isolated seniors in their care. 3. VON and Home Care Nova Scotia personnel from across the province whosupport seniors, will be asked for their insight on the literacy needs of their clients. Their suggestions for enhanced services to seniors with literacy needs will bedocumented and presented by theirmanagers at an information meeting inHalifax. 4. A survey on the literacy needs of seniors will be administered to a broadly basedsample of community-based upgradingprograms in Nova Scotia. A final report and strategic plan for addressing seniors' literacy needs through local communityprojects and/or through provincial initiatives willbe prepared and distributed widely .

In a sleep laboratory study , 47% of post- menopausal women had sleep apnea\u2014comparedto only 21% of a pre-menopausal group. Researchers recommend a closer look at hormone therapy as a possible treatment for sleep apnea inpost-menopausal women.

Source: Looking Forward The Hope Heart InstituteVol. 13, No. 6 - Early winter 2000High Fuel Costs Canadians are facing high increases in the cost of home heating fuels\u2014whether heating with oil, electricity or natural gas. Because of the forecasted cold winter there will be an increased usage ofhome heating fuels imposing a terrible burdenfor people on low-incomes or fixed incomes,such as seniors. Seniors' organizations are urging the provincial government to provide rebates for seniors and other low- income families to offset the increased costs of home heating fuels. Alberta has developed two non-taxable rebate programs for all Albertans over the age of 16 years. The first program provides $300 per person to offset the increased cost of home and automobile fuels. The second is an electricity rebate of $20 per month on the bill of those who pay the electrical bill, starting in January 2001 and in operation for the entire year.It is recommended the government considerthese rebate programs for Nova Scotians on low-incomes. Redvers Cainey Canada's Association for the Fifty-Plus(CARP) 19Age is a matter of feelings, not of years. George William Curtis (1824-1892), Writer Remaining Healthy: It's Never Too Late! Old age is not a disease. Although we develop more health problems as we get older, we don'tnecessarily have to resign ourselves to years ofsickness. Modern health care includes takingpersonal responsibility for our health no matterwhat our age. It is never too late to try to maintain good health. Remember, if you are 65, you can expect to live15 more years; if you are 75, you can expect 10more years; and at 85, expect an average of sixmore years. Most of us want to add as much\"life\" as possible to these years. There are several simple, straight-forward measures that seniors can take to help preventillness and maintain health. The following arejust six of these simple steps. Have a family doctor Preventive medicine is an important part offamily practice. Your family doctor is your mainlink with the constantly changing health-caresystem. Find a family doctor with whom you candiscuss your health maintenance plans. This isthe person you can turn to if your need medicaladvice and support for your plans. Your doctorwill respect you for taking steps to remainhealthy and will help you toward your goal. Exercise If you keep physically active, you can slow certain changes that occur with aging. Older people whohave always exercised are proof of this. Exercisehelps maintain muscle strength, oxygen use and many body functions. Even after years of inactivity and the loss of conditioning that results, carefulexercise may improve muscle weakness andincrease the range of joint movement. Rememberyou can even exercise in a wheelchair! Balance, strength and endurance can all be improved in the elderly . Obviously , older peopleplanning to exercise should consult their familydoctors to determine suitable and safe exerciseprograms.A combination of endurance exercise andstrength training is often recommended. Walkingand cycling are the most common examples ofendurance exercise. Strength training involvescontracting groups of muscles against resistance. This is not restricted to the young. It is not unusual these days to see seniors involved inweight training and enjoying it. Regular exercise promotes an improved self- image and a sense of well-being in the elderly , aswell as in younger people. It can help combatdepression. Exercising with others is a way todeal with loneliness. Carefully planned exerciseis becoming part of the management of a range ofmedical problems of older people. These includediabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, constipation,Parkinson's Disease, obesity , and heart diseaseand its risk factors. Stop Smoking Studies show that even older people benefit froman end to smoking. Elderly smokers who stoppedas recently as two years earlier have reduced theirrisk of death compared with those the same agewho continue to smoke. The risk of heart attacksis reduced within a year after stopping smoking. Stopping the tobacco habit also slows the rate of decline of lung functioning and may help slowthe development of osteoporosis. These are justsome of the good reasons for a person of any ageto stop smoking. Have your blood pressure checked Hypertension (high blood pressure) is commonin the elderly . It is a serious problem. Bloodpressure is recorded as an upper figure (systolic)over a lower figure (diastolic). Until recently theemphasis was mainly on the risk of an elevateddiastolic pressure. However, studies now showthat a systolic pressure above 160 mmHg puts anolder person at increased risk for heart attackand stroke. 20Treatment of high blood pressure can prolong your life because your risk of heart attack andstroke is reduced. Although non-drug treatment such as exercise can be mildly effective, medication is usually indicated when high blood pressure isconfirmed. Doctors have a choice of medicationsand will select the drug most suitable for you. There is an important point to remember in relation to your blood pressure. Be aware ofdizziness when you stand up from a lying orsitting position, especially if you are takingmedication for high blood pressure. Sometimesyour blood pressure will drop quickly when youstand, which can cause dizziness and possibly a fall. It's a good idea for your blood pressure to be checked in both lying and standing positions. A significant drop in blood pressure on standingis called postural hypotension and may affecthow your doctor treats your high blood pressure. Have your hearing and eyes checked Hearing loss is common as we age. It occurs in30 per cent of those older than 65 and in 50 percent of those older that 85. The good news isthat it is usually treatable. In the most commontype of hearing loss, there is difficulty hearinghigh pitched sounds, especially when there isbackground noise. If you are having hearing problems, have your hearing checked. Hearing tests are simple andhearing aids usually help the hearing loss.Remember too, removing wax from your earsoften dramatically improves hearing so you may not need a hearing aid.Deafness causes elderly people to isolatethemselves socially and contributes todepression. Why suffer from the results ofhearing loss when you don't have to? Have your eyes checked. Increased pressure in the eye, glaucoma, is the most common cause ofblindness in Canada. Moreover, it is preventableif discovered before any symptoms occur! Olderpeople have a higher risk of this serious buttreatable condition. Get a flu shot Everyone over age 65 is in the at-risk populationthat should receive influenza vaccine (a flu shot)yearly . The only ones in this group who shouldnot receive the vaccine are those who haveserious allergic reactions when the eat eggs. Influenza vaccine can prevent flu and the complications of pneumonia and death. Atparticularly high risk of these problems are older people with chronic heart, lung and kidneydiseases, diabetes and diseases or drugs thataffect their immune systems. The vaccine is effective, safe and inexpensive. Special flu shot clinics organized for the elderlyoften make it easier to receive the vaccine. Ask a senior Treat yourself well. Ask yourself three questionsand then get busy . 1. Are you interested in keeping healthy?2. What better investment can you make?3. Why not start now?

Grandparents, Requesting, Access, and Dignity During the past year the Secretariat has met with a group of grandparents who have had the experience of being denied access to grandchildren due to the divorce of their adult children and the emotional upheaval of these changing relationships. These grandparents had close relationships withtheir grandchildren before being denied access.Sharing holidays, serving as babysitters andactually having daily or weekly contact came toan abrupt end. We know that grandparents arevery often a stabilizing factor in grandchildrenslives and offer unconditional love and a saferefuge when parental relationships are strained.The two-way benefits of learning together andsharing hobbies, past experiences and newchallenges are quickly taken away . Through the assistance of mediation, through friends, ministers and mental health professionalsmany relationships have been restored to thebenefit of all concerned. Too often in the pastlegal costs have been high and the legal processhas polarized attitudes, instead of encouragingconsensus. Because of the loss of closerelationships, grandparents in this situation needthe support from others who can offer hope andshare the steps others have taken to restore thegrandparent grandchild relationships. In a time when challenges and change are affecting families it's a wonderful time to strengthen familyrelationships between older and younger persons.The age gap can be overcome, especially aroundvalues and cultures. Interwoven in the aims of G.R.A.N.D. is the belief that grandparents have a Right to grandchildren and grandchildren have a Right to know and have relationships with grandparents.
