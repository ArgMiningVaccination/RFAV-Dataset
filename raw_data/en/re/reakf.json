Is there an Alternative? Are Flu Shots Safe? Is there an Alternative? You've seen the signs- EVERYWHERE. \"FREE FLU SHOTS AVAILABLE HERE\" seems to outnumber Starbucks coffee houses. But none answer the question, Are Flu Shots safe? Are they effective? Is it a small necessary inconvenience or is there an alternative effective way to combat the flu during flu season? The fact is safety and effectiveness of the Flu Shot is marginal at best and yet it is still pushed heavily by hospitals, pharmacies and mainstream medicine. We are lucky that right now, we have a choice. So, we can look at the facts and make a decision based on reason rather than herd-mentality and prodding by the medical establishment. FACTS *There are hundreds of Flu strains out there. *Per the CDC (Center for Disease Control), this year's vaccine protects against only 3-4 of the strains (but it's not guaranteed) *Each year the CDC is a year behind (they vaccinate using the data collected from the prior year) *With your possible ineffective strain vax, it takes 2-4 weeks for the immunity to kick it (so you could still get it!) *The medical industry and drug manufacturers DO make money on vaccines. *Some doctors push heavily and vaccinate even infants and pregnant women with the flu vaccines containing Thimerosal (Mercury), and there is a risk of miscarriage! (A fetus or newborn infant does not even have the ability to detoxify heavy metal exposure, so it remains with yet unstudied consequences.) *The 36,000 people who die of the \"Flu\" each year is a lie. Over 90% of those deaths are actually cataloged as Pneumonia and the CDC uses the excuse that they \"may have been\" exposed to the flu first in order to inflate their numbers and cause a scare. *In 2004-2005, the flu vaccine was 10% effective *This year it was 42% effective.* The flu mist vaccine contains MSG (mono sodium glutamate) *The vaccine has Formaldehyde (embalming fluid) in it, which causes cancer. *The vaccine still contains Thimerosal (Mercury) in it, even though it's supposed to be Mercury free. *Mercury is toxic to our bodies. Their \"low levels\" are higher than what's stated allowable.(The 12.5 micrograms of mercury in each of the mandatory two flu shots is actually 14 times more than the EPA guidelines for the average 6 month old. Liquids with 200 ppb mercury or higher is considered hazardous waste.) *Mercury destroys brain tissue. See this video link here to see what Mercury does to brain tissue. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N064Gp1r_98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N064Gp1r_98) *CDC warns side effects could be anaphylaxis* (which is a life threatening allergic reaction) and Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) which is one of the scariest conditions that can occur as a result of the flu shot. This condition causes the immune system to attack the nerves, causing tingling and weakness in extremities, which can later develop into full-blown paralyzation. *The FDA nor the CDC have done vigorous testing on Thimerosal and its effects before stating that it is \"safe.\" *Repeated vaccination at a young age substantially increases the risk of influenza in older age, by a factor ranging between 1\u00b72 (vaccination after 50 years) to 2\u00b74 (vaccination from birth). You can see and submit adverse effects of vaccines on [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) ](https://vaers.hhs.gov/)It documents adverse effects of vaccines including flu vaccines and people are able report their side effects, sometimes nurses submit them, some have been quite severe. So many report on the question are flu shots safe, a resounding \"no.\" Now, you may ask, \"Then what is the alternative?\" Our doctor, Dr. Anju Mathur, of Angel Longevity Center, recommends, you take large doses of Vitamin C administered by IV directly into your bloodstream. Our bodies don't produce Vitamin C naturally so we must supplement.

However, when it's delivered by IV, Vitamin C is 100% bioavailable. It's like adding an army to your white blood cells and the vitamins because they go directly into your bloodstream do not get filtered out or watered down by passing through your liver first.
