Alternative practices focus on stimulating the body's ability to heal itself via energy, alignment, diet, nutritional supplementation, and other balancing techniques. Conversely, allopathic medicine focuses on symptom-specific treatment, typically with pharmacological or invasive methods to remove the offending agent. Here are some of the complementary and alternative medicine methods that are utilized at Arlington Chiropractic Clinic PC in Arlington Heights, IL. What Type of Therapy Helps Body Alignment? Chiropractic Adjustments to the spine help to restore alignment and mobility to the major supporting part of our skeletal system. Any affected joint in the body can be adjusted by our professionally trained Chiropractors, from the TMJ to the toes. In addition, physical therapy techniques use various therapeutic exercises, and modalities to help patients recover from injuries, surgeries, and other medical conditions that affect their posture, movement, alignment, and function. What are the Benefits of Massage Therapy? Massage therapy is manual therapy involving the manipulation of the soft tissues of the body, including muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. Massage therapy relieves pain, reduces stress and anxiety, improves circulation, and promotes healing. A variety of techniques are used which include kneading, stroking, tapping, and trigger point pressure to specific points. What Is Acupuncture? Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medicine, is the process of inserting thin needles into specific places on the body. The goal of acupuncture is to balance the flow of energy throughout the body. This is intended to promote healing and reduce pain and other symptoms. Acupuncture treats a wide range of health conditions, including chronic pain, anxiety, depression, digestive issues, and infertility. It stimulates the nervous system and triggers natural pain-relieving chemicals, such as endorphins, to release in the body. What Is Spinal Decompression? Spinal decompression is a non-surgical treatment used by our Chiropractors to relieve back and neck pain. This process involves gently stretching the spine to relieve spinal disc and nerve pressure. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including herniated discs, sciatica, degenerative disc disease, and spinal stenosis. Do Diet and Nutritional Supplementation Help? We find, and research shows, that many patient complaints related to the musculoskeletal system respond more quickly and more thoroughly when nutritional deficiencies are corrected.
