Contents of this page 1. Sector definition The European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) defines food additives as substances added intentionally to foodstuffs to perform certain technological functions, for example to colour, sweeten or help preserve foods. There are various groups of food additives. This study focused on the ingredient categories and products that are produced in developing countries, and which present an opportunity for suppliers in the European market: - Natural food colours - Natural sweeteners - Natural flavours - Natural emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents. The main applications of natural food additives in Europe are: | | Natural food additive category | | Main applications | | Natural food colours | | bakery and cereals, beverages, confectionery, dairy and cheese, meat and meat alternatives, dietary supplements | | Natural sweeteners | | beverages (incl. soft drinks and energy drinks), bakery, dairy, confectionery, table-top sweeteners | | Natural flavours | | beverages (incl. alcoholic beverages), dairy and ice cream, bakery, confectionery, snacks, soups and sauces, meat and meat alternatives | | Natural emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents | | soups, sauces and dressings, bakery (incl. fillings), beverages (incl. juices), dairy and ice cream 2. What makes Europe an interesting market for natural food additives? Europe has a large food and beverage industry that demands natural additives for various applications. European consumers are paying more attention to the ingredients in their food and beverage products, leading to a growing demand for the natural food additives market. Likewise, the growth in plant-based diets drives demand for natural and innovative alternatives in additive categories. Demand for natural food additives also stems from an increasing substitution of artificial ingredients due to stricter EU legislation. This presents an opportunity for suppliers in developing countries. European food additives market continues to grow [The European natural food additives market was valued at US$9.6 billion in 2021](https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/market-insight/europe-natural-food-additives-market-4811), with a forecasted growth of 5.6% until 2028. This upward trend creates opportunities for suppliers of natural food additives in developing countries. The trend follows a general growth in the global food additives market. Figure 1 shows that the global market size of food additives was worth US$26 billion in 2020. As shown in Figure 1, the largest additive categories are food thickeners and stabilisers, which account for around 33% of the total market. Modified starches and colourants follow with 12% share each. In the European natural food additives market, [ingredients with a flavouring and enhancing function lead, accounting for nearly 42% of the market](https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/market-insight/europe-natural-food-additives-market-4811), followed by ingredients with a sweetening function, colouring, antioxidants and preservatives. Source: Statista A powerful European food and beverage industry offers wide applications for natural additives The sizeable market and its healthy growth rates make the European ingredients market attractive. The European food and beverage industry provides a wide range of applications for natural food additives, thus creating opportunities for suppliers in several categories. According to Food and Drink Europe, [this industry has a turnover of nearly \u20ac1.1 trillion](https://www.fooddrinkeurope.eu/about-the-industry/). Between 2013 and 2019 the turnover of the European food industry fluctuated. By the end of 2021, the industry showed renewed signs of growth. For example, [the food and drink industry turnover increased by 3.3%](https://www.fooddrinkeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FoodDrinkEurope-Economic-Bulletin-Q4-2021.pdf) in Q4 2021 compared to the previous quarter. France has the largest food and beverage industry in Europe, accounting for around 19% of the total turnover, followed by Germany (17%), Italy (13%), Spain (11%), the Netherlands (7%), Poland (5%) and Belgium (5%). The application of natural food additives in the European food and beverage industry is wide and diverse. Dairy and confectionery are the leading categories using food colours, followed by desserts, ice cream, juice drinks, bakery, chocolate, snacks, meals, soft drinks and sauces, and seasonings. Bakery, meat products, dairy and drinks are the main application areas for oleoresins. Soft drinks, dairy products, chocolate and biscuits are very relevant end-using industries for natural sweeteners. Figure 2 highlights the main food and beverage industry segments in Europe. Source: [Food Drink Europe](https://www.fooddrinkeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FoodDrinkEurope-Data-Trends-2021-digital.pdf), 2021 (2018 data) A growing organic market in Europe drives up demand for natural additives One of the main trends in the European food and drink market is the increasing demand for organic products, which also drives up demand for natural food additives. Europe has the second-largest market for organic products in the world, only behind North America. [Organic retail sales in the EU](https://statistics.fibl.org/europe/retail-sales-europe.html?tx_statisticdata_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=Element2Item&cHash=fb0bf78322e49d3cbb8164db04e2b18c) grew at a strong rate from \u20ac28 billion in 2016 to nearly \u20ac45 billion in 2020. Steady growth is expected to continue in the coming years, thanks to the growing availability of organic food and rising consumer awareness. European consumers want to avoid pesticides and other chemicals in the food and drinks they consume. Many are likewise concerned about the environmental impact of conventional farming and want to support organic production methods. Organic food and beverage products also avoid the use of synthetic food additives. This creates an opportunity for natural additive suppliers in developing countries. The growing market for plant-based products in Europe requires natural additives Plant-based products continue to drive the demand for natural food additives in the European market. With ever more flexitarian and vegan consumers in Europe, the demand for natural additives from vegetable origin is also rising significantly. The European plant-based food sector grew by 49% between 2018 and 2020, reaching a total sales value of \u20ac3.6 billion. [Plant-based milk leads the market in most European countries, followed by plant-based meat](https://www.bioecoactual.com/en/2022/06/14/plant-based-protein-market-organic/), which grew by 31% in terms of sales value in this period. These and other products, like plant-based yoghurts, dairy-alternative drinks and vegan cheeses, drive up demand for natural additives. Natural food colours are an important example. European consumers and the industry are constantly searching for natural food colours that [combine sensory experience without compromising taste](https://sensientfoodcolors.com/en-eu/dairy/natural-colouring-plant-based-dairy-cheese-alternatives/). Plant-based diets require more complex solutions to [make products like meat substitutes more visually appealing](https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/natural-colors-plant-based-meat-browning-solutions-spotlighted-while-research-delves-into-emotive-properties.html). For example, Naturex (part of Givaudan) launched a product line made from beetroot and other natural extracts called VegebriteTM Veggie Reds, [aimed at achieving an authentic meat-like colour in meat substitutes](https://www.naturex.com/Expo-West-2020/VEGEBRITE-VEGGIE-RED). European regulations favour natural alternatives Consumer demand for sustainable and plant-based options have been key drivers for the natural food colours industry, but changes in European regulations also create more room for use of natural food additives by the food and beverage industry. For example, [according to the online platform FoodManufacture](https://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Article/2022/04/04/Food-colours-feature-NPD-clean-label-and-sustainability-focus), the EU's regulatory framework is a major driver for the growing market for food colours. These additives undergo continuous safety evaluations over the years by scientific experts in Europe. These evaluations may lead to ban the use of specific food colours by the European food industry. This is increasingly happening for non-natural colours, which is leading to the [increasing use of fruit, vegetable and other plant alternatives by the industry](https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/customized-pigments-natural-claims-in-food-colors-drive-consumers-to-bright-and-bold-hues.html). Safer, natural alternatives are being adopted across the board for all colours and food categories in Europe due to these growing regulatory limits. Additionally, the EU regulatory framework is [being constantly updated with the aim to reduce the potential impact of sugars on human health](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/health-promotion-knowledge-gateway/sugars-sweeteners_en), leading to new policies and legislation that favour the use of sugar alternatives like natural sweeteners. This is also true for the United Kingdom, where [the government introduced its 'sugar tax' on soft drinks](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/soft-drinks-industry-levy-comes-into-effect) in 2018 as a way to tackle childhood obesity. Around 50% of soft drink manufacturers have reduced their sugar content as a result. This is likely to have influenced the imports of stevia into the UK. Regulation is pushed further by the European industry: the Code of Conduct for responsible food business and marketing [addresses the reformulation of products, specifically targeting sugar reduction](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/07/05/Food-industry-unites-behind-Code-of-Conduct-but-fault-lines-remain-for-food-system-transformation). The code is paired with commitments by the Union of European Soft Drinks Association (UNESDA) [to reduce average sugars in products by 10% by 2025](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/06/29/Europe-s-soft-drinks-industry-to-reduce-added-sugars-in-beverages-by-another-10).

A large share of French imports are sourced directly from developing countries, such as glycosides (including stevia) at 84% and natural gum arabic at 95%. France plays a particularly important role in ingredient formulation, with leading companies in sectors like flavours and fragrances, and natural sweeteners. According to Food and Drink Europe, France had the largest food and drink market in terms of turnover in 2019. The most important sectors were meats, dairy, beverages and confectionery. France has also one of the largest organic food and drink markets in Europe. France's organic food market topped \u20ac13 billion for the first time in 2020. The interest in organic produce will prolong this growth. By favouring natural ingredients, the demand for organic as high-quality product from food and drink manufacturers is expected to rise further. In terms of plant-based foods, France ranks fifth in Europe. French consumers [demand high-quality, innovative and healthy products](https://en.portal.santandertrade.com/analyse-markets/france/reaching-the-consumers). France has a large food-processing sector and is also an important re-exporter of natural ingredients to other European countries. The country has a prominent industry for natural sweeteners. In this category, [France has held a strong position in the European stevia market](https://www.expertmarketresearch.com/reports/natural-sweeteners-market-europe) since it approved the use of stevia sweeteners, particularly the Reb A strain, in 2009. The country also has an important flavouring sector, including major flavouring companies like [MANE](https://www.mane.com/) and [Naturex](https://www.naturex.com/) (now part of the Swiss-based multinational Givaudan). Givaudan is one of the main natural extract companies worldwide, engaged in sourcing, producing and selling natural ingredients for the food, health and beauty sectors. France is also a major importer of gums, as the main European importer of natural gum arabic and essential oils. An important trader of gum arabic in France is [Nexira](https://www.nexira.com/), with the largest market share in Europe. [Alland & Robert](https://www.allandetrobert.com/) is another importer of gum arabic. The country is also a leading importer of essential oils and oleoresins, including companies industry and trading powerhouse Germany combines all the elements that make an interesting market for natural food additives: a massive food and beverage industry, a large organic and plant-based market, significant imports across several ingredient categories, an important trading function, and a concentration of interesting companies demanding ingredients. Germany plays a vital role in the trade of most natural food additives, including seaweed extracts, natural gums, essential oils and oleoresins, and glycosides, including stevia. Germany is also an important re-exporter of natural ingredients to other European countries. In 2020, the German food and drink industry generated \u20ac227 billion in revenues, having as important sectors meat and meat processing, dairy, confectionery, bakery and alcoholic beverages. Germany is the third-largest exporter of food products in the world and a major re-exporter of several natural ingredients in Europe. The German food industry has steadily grown in recent years. According to [GTAI](https://www.gtai.de/en/invest/service/publications/the-food-beverage-industry-in-germany-63994), growing national retail sales entirely compensate for the drop in food service sales and exports during the pandemic. One element that stands out in Germany is that 10% of the turnover is invested in research & development in this sector. This number even lies above the average of other research-intensive industries in the country and thus contributes significantly to food diversity and safety. Growing food safety concerns, paired with the pressure to adopt clean label, creates an innovative environment in the German food and beverage sector, aimed at developing natural colours that meet this consumer demand. Germany has the largest organic food market in Europe, valued at \u20ac15.9 billion in 2021. German consumers have a high awareness and willingness to pay for high-quality products. Plant-based products are also popular among German consumers. The country has the largest plant-based products market in Europe, worth \u20ac817 million. Major German companies active in natural additives are the multinational ingredient formulator [Symrise](https://www.symrise.com/), with a 70-year tradition in the industry, and [Doehler](https://www.doehler.com/en/our-portfolio/natural-ingredients/natural-colours.html), which sources ingredients worldwide in a vertically-integrated fashion. [Brenntag](https://food-nutrition.brenntag.com/en-de/product-range/flavouring-colouring/colors/) is another German multinational active across several natural ingredients. Germany has many other important companies active in processing and trading natural food additives, like [Silesia Aroma](https://www.silesia-aroma.com/), [All Treasures](https://www.all-organic-treasures.com/) (specialised in organic ingredients) are also interesting German-based trading companies active in some natural additive categories. The United Kingdom: large consumer market and strong orientation towards natural and healthy The UK is among the main importers of natural food additives in several categories. The country is one of the leading importers of essential oils and oleoresins and of natural thickeners gum arabic and agar (or agar-agar). It is also one of the main players in natural sweeteners, including stevia. The UK also has one of the largest consumer markets in Europe. According to the UK Food and Drink Federation (FDF), the country's food and beverage sector generated about \u20ac120 billion in turnover in 2020. The sector is quite robust, and the biggest manufacturing sector in the country by turnover. Since Brexit the UK retains proven stability and ongoing vivid trade with Europe and the rest of the world. Similarly, the British market for organic food and drink is growing. Rising consumer awareness and growing demand for natural and healthier food and drink products are major drivers. The UK has the second-largest plant-based products market in Europe. A wide range of plant-based alternatives to meats and dairy products are available from British retailers. The UK is home to several interesting companies across several natural food additive categories. The main importers of natural food colours in the UK are [Dura Color](https://duracolor.co.uk/), [Plant-Ex](https://www.plant-ex.com/) and [ScotBio](https://scotbio.com/), a company that developed ScotBio Blue, a natural blue colourant extracted from spirulina usable in food and drinks. Leading importers of oleoresins in the UK include [British Pepper [Phoenix Products](http://www.phoenixproducts.co.uk). Within natural sweeteners, the UK is home to the headquarters of major European stevia company [Tate & Lyle](https://www.tateandlyle.com/), which has a portfolio of stevia-derived food additives. The Netherlands: a European hub for natural ingredients The Netherlands offers various opportunities for exporters of natural food additives in developing countries. The country is a significant entry point of ingredients into Europe. This is due to re-exports to other European countries as well as to a strong ingredient-processing industry. Continued growth is expected for the Dutch industry in the coming years. The Netherlands aggregates technology and know-how in the formulation of ingredients, being an interesting destination to suppliers from developing countries. The Netherlands is also a significant entry point of raw materials into Europe, partly because most raw materials are re-exported to other European countries. The country also has some significant ingredient processors and formulators. It is among the leading importers of essential oils and oleoresins, as well as natural colours. According to Food and Drink Europe, the Dutch food and drink market was worth \u20ac76.2 billion in 2019. The [Dutch Food Economic Report](https://edepot.wur.nl/539900) 2020 further states that the food industry is the largest branch of industry in the Netherlands in terms of sales and employment. Retail revenue from food and drinks amounts to around \u20ac44 billion. The meat- and dairy-processing industries are the most important in this sector of the Dutch economy. Ingredient formulator [DSM](http://www.DSM.com) (now part of the Firmenich group) and the trading companies [Holland Ingredients](https://www.hollandingredients.nl/) and [Caldic](https://www.caldic.com/en) are other examples of internationally active companies working with natural food additives. The European headquarters of Cargill, a leading multinational ingredient company, are in the Netherlands. There are also companies working in specific categories, such as [Exberry](https://exberry.com/en/exberry-by-gnt/) (part of GNT), a major player in the formulation of food colours, and [Van Wankum Ingredients](https://vw-ingredients.com/), a leading importer of stevia. Spain: a thriving and specialised food and ingredient industry Spain is one of the leaders in the production and imports of seaweed extracts, food colours and oleoresins, and plays an important role in the trade of natural gums. Spain is a leading re-exporter of food additives to Europe, including seaweed extracts. The country also has a large and thriving food-processing and ingredient industry. Its organic market is growing, which also indicates a long-term consumer demand for healthier products. Spain has the fifth-largest food and drink market in Europe. According to the [Spanish Federation for the Food and Beverage Industry](https://fiab.es/), the Spanish food industry generated \u20ac119.2 billion in revenues in 2019. The food and beverage industry is the number-one sector in Spain, representing 3% of GDP in 2019. Spain is Europe's leading producer of organic products in terms of area and third-biggest producer in the global context. However, only 2.4% of consumers buy organic produce - a substantial difference in average European consumption. The retail sales value of organic food in Spain amounted to \u20ac2.5 billion in 2021, with expected steady growth. Spain-based [Roko](http://www.rokoagar.com/) is the leading European producer of agar (seaweed extract), while other Spanish companies like Agar de Asturias also play an important role in this category. [PROCONA](https://colorantesnaturales.com/) (part of the SEIMEX Group) is one of the main natural colour formulators in Spain, founded over 20 years ago and specialising in a wide range of colours. Other Spanish companies specialised in food colours are [Sancan](https://www.sancan.com/), providing solutions for several product categories from meat to a vegan and vegetarian range, and [Coralim](https://www.coralim.com/es). Spanish importers of oleoresins include [Pimenton](http://www.pimenton.com/), [Diego P\u00e9rez Riquelme e Hijos](https://lamargarita.es/home/) and [Evesa](https://evesa.com/).

Leading companies in Spain handling Prieto](https://www.azucaresprieto.com/#/home), [Disproquima](https://www.disproquima.com/en/home) and focused on high-quality and natural products Italy's role in natural food additive imports is more limited, but still relevant in the European context. The country is among the leading importers of natural gums, natural food colours and natural sweeteners such as stevia. With a traditional food and beverage market of great importance in Europe, Italian consumers focus on high-quality ingredients. The organic market is sizeable and growing. Italy plays a smaller role than other European markets in the imports of natural food additives, but is still prominent for specific ingredient categories. Italy has the third-largest food and beverage market in Europe. In 2019, the market was worth \u20ac145 billion. The Italian food processing industry is dependent on food ingredient imports. The [most important food sectors in Italy](https://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Food%20Processing%20Ingredients_Rome_Italy_3-29-2018.pdf) are bakery, dairy, processed meats and seafood. Italy is also a significant manufacturer and exporter of food and drink products in Europe. Italy has one of the largest markets for organic products, which is growing at a healthy pace. Italian consumers tend to seek high-quality natural products. In 2020, the Italian organic food market was worth \u20ac3.9 billion.

Which products from developing countries have most potential in the European Market? Interesting product groups for suppliers in developing countries are: - natural sweeteners, including stevia and other products like coconut sugar - emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents, including natural gums gum, locust bean gum, tara gum, and seaweed extracts (agar, carrageenan) - natural flavours, including essential oils and oleoresins - natural food colours High demand for natural sweeteners is coming from the organic food sector, since those consumers are more health-conscious and look for products that have low sugar content. Natural sweeteners have a diverse range of applications in the European market, including confectionery, beverages, breakfast cereals and dairy. Other natural sweeteners, like coconut sugar, are also gaining popularity in the European market. Coconut sugar is a popular sweetener in many vegan diets, as it is plant-based and minimally processed. Natural emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents represent a good opportunity for suppliers in developing countries thanks to a growing demand for healthier products from European consumers. Hydrocolloids have a wide range of applications, such as bakery and confectionery, meats and beverages. Rising demand for ready-meals and processed foods also generates demand. Natural flavours are in high demand in the European market partly because of their relatively low costs and a rising consumer demand for natural products. Natural flavours have become mainstream in some European countries, partly because of the burgeoning organic food market and a rising demand for processed foods. Natural colours are another promising category. Due to increasing consumer demand for natural colour alternatives to artificial additives, the industry is in constant search for raw materials and extracts that can meet performance, stability and safety requirements. Food colours are present in many foods and beverages, including snacks, margarine, cheese, jams and jellies, desserts and drinks. Natural sweeteners The European industry is increasingly using natural sweeteners to replace sugar in food and beverage products. According to the 2020 New Nutrition Business Survey, two-thirds of European consumers are trying to lower their sugar intake. Research has also found that [European consumers are increasingly looking for products with no added sugars](https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/14994-europeans-seek-to-avoid-added-sugar-too). This is linked to the fact that [Europeans consider being healthy to be the most important aspect of a sustainable diet](https://www.fooddrinkeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FoodDrinkEurope-Data-Trends-2021-digital.pdf), as reported by Food and Drink Europe. European industries like soft drinks have also committed to sugar reduction. Since 2015, [the European soft-drinks sector reduced added sugars in products at an average rate of 17.7%](https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/eu-sugar-reduction-drive-gaining-traction-amid-reformulation-investments.html), based on the commitments of the European Soft Drinks Associations (UNESDA). One of the sector's focal areas is the increased use of natural sweeteners. All in all, the quest for healthier diets among Europeans and the commitments at the industry level have contributed to the expansion of sweeteners. [At a global level, the natural sweeteners market size was estimated at US$2.8 billion in 2020](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/naturalsweeteners-market-1071.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwquWVBhBrEiwAt1KmwobCAgZGLeKKDQEYfMeI959B4Q9_aJ921vjrxwLdxPrCSI_aA0713BoCcfwQAvD_BwE) and projected to reach US$3.8 billion by 2025, recording an annual growth of 6.1% for that period. But there are reports that [consumers are partly shifting towards products without any additional sweetening ingredients](https://www.euromonitor.com/article/sugar-and-sweeteners-consumer-priorities-triggering-change), which threatens the growth of the natural sweeteners category. Table 3: Natural sweeteners allowed in the EU | | E-Number | | Additive | | HS Code | | E420 | | (i) Sorbitol | | 290544 | | | | (ii) Sorbitol syrup | | | | E421 | | Mannitol | | 29054300 | | E957 | | Thaumatin | | 350400 | | E959 | | Neohesperidine DC | | 29389090 | | E960 | | Steviol glycoside | | 29389090 | | | Erythritol | | 29054900 Stevia Stevia is one of the most popular natural sweeteners. In 2021, the [European market for stevia](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/europe-stevia-market) reached US$150.8 million and is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate of 9%, reaching US$234 million in 2026. The [global stevia market](https://www.imarcgroup.com/stevia-market) was worth US$590 million in 2020 and is expected to grow at an average annual growth rate of 8.6% until 2026, according to the IMARC group. The major drivers of growth in the stevia market are rising consumer demand for healthier and natural products, increasing rates of obesity and diabetes in Europe, and growing popularity of flavoured soft drinks. Consumer awareness of stevia is rising among European consumers, while applications in food and drink products are widening. However, substitute sweeteners with similar properties such as barley malts, maple syrup, agave juice and coconut sugar present a threat to the stevia market. According to industry sources, demand for stevia is expected to continue growing in the foreseeable future. Awareness of stevia is increasing in companies; for example, Pepsi and Coca-Cola have started using stevia as a sweetener in their soft drinks. Other food and drink manufacturers are also using stevia in yoghurts, confectionery, and processed products like ketchup. It is expected that demand for stevia will continue to rise over the forecasted period as more food and beverage companies use alternative sweeteners. This will continue to offer supply opportunities to exporters from developing countries. Figure 5 shows EU imports of HS Code 29389090, which includes other glycosides, natural or reproduced by synthesis, and their salts, ethers, esters and other derivatives. This HS code includes stevia, but not exclusively - it is only an indication of stevia imports into the EU. The figures show there was an increase in EU imports in terms of volume and value between 2017 and 2021. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years due to increasing demand for stevia and limited production in Europe. The industry continues to innovate and present opportunities. In August 2021, stevia supplier [PureCircle](https://www.purecircle.com/) received a positive safety opinion from the [European Safety Authority](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en) for its Reb M, Reb D and Reb AM stevia ingredients produced through bioconversion of stevia leaf extracts. This positive development means that food and beverage manufactures now have access to more cost-effective ways to reduce sugar in products. This will boost the demand for stevia and create opportunities for suppliers in developing countries. Source: Eurostat, 2022 Source: Eurostat, 2022 Other natural sweeteners Other natural sweeteners include monk fruit, palm sugar, coconut sugar and yacon syrup. These types are not as widely used by European food companies. The demand for these sweeteners depends on the willingness of R&D departments to use them as ingredients. Coconut sugar is a sweetener cultivated from the sap of the flower bud stem of the coconut palm. The Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand are major producers, accounting for about 80% of global production. Coconut sugar is considered a healthier alternative to traditional sugar because of its nutritional properties. Consumers are moving towards coconut sugar as they look for natural sweeteners (alternatives to conventional sugar). Coconut sugar has a lower glycemic index (GI) than traditional sugar. Consumption of coconut sugar reduces the chances of diabetes and other sugar-related diseases. Demand for coconut sugar in Europe is also driven by increasing popularity of vegan and plant-based foods. Coconut sugar is considered a vegan alternative to traditional sugar, as bone char is used during sugar processing. Tips: - Target companies producing healthy food and beverage products that are more likely to demand natural sweeteners as a sugar alternative. Such companies usually exhibit at organic and natural product trade shows, like [Biofach](https://www.biofach.de/en), [Natural & Organic Products Europe](https://www.naturalproducts.co.uk/), [Free From Functional Food Expo](https://amsterdam.freefromfoodexpo.com/)and the [Nordic Organic Food Fair](https://www.nordicorganicexpo.com/). - Read the CBI studies on [stevia](https://www.cbi.eu/market-information/natural-food-additives/stevia)and [coconut sugar](https://www.cbi.eu/market-information/natural-food-additives/coconut-sugar), which provide additional information about exporting these two products to the European market. - If you are an exporter of stevia, connect with stevia good source of information on the stevia industry and the relevant regulations and standards. Emulsifiers, and gelling agents Emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents are used as food additives to prevent ingredient separation and maintain consistent product texture. Many of them are derived from natural sources like plants and seaweeds. They can also be made by bacterial fermentation or chemical modification of natural cellulose to produce a synthetic version of the natural product. These additives are used in a wide range of products, such as condiments, dairy and confectionery. Table 4 shows a list of natural emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents allowed in the EU. Table 4: Natural emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents allowed in the EU | | E numbers | | Additives | | HS code | | E322 | | Lecithins | | 29232000 | | E400 | | Alginic acid | | 39131000 | | E401 | | Sodium alginate | | 39131000 | | E402 | | Potassium alginate | | 39131000 | | E403 | | Ammonium alginate | | 39131000 | | E404 | | Calcium alginate | | 39131000 | | E406 | | Agar | | 13023100 | | E407 | | Carrageenan | | 13023290 | | E407a | | Processed eucheuma seaweed | | 12122100 | | E410 | | Locust bean gum; carob gum | | 13023210 | | E412 | | Guar gum | | 13023290 | | E413 | | Tragacanth | | 13019000 | | E414 | | Acacia gum; gum arabic | | 13012000 | | E415 | | Xanthan gum | | 13019000 | | E416 | | Karaya gum | | 13019000 | | E417 | | Tara gum | | 13019000 | | E418 | | Gellan gum | | 13019000 | | E425 | | Konjac | | 13021970 | | E426 | | Soybean hemicellulose | | | | E427 | | Cassia gum | | 13019000 | | E440 | | Pectins | | 130220 | | E460 | | Cellulose | | 3912 | | E1103 | | Invertase | | 350790 Gum arabic Natural gums like gum arabic or acacia gum, guar gum and locust bean gum are in demand thanks to their unique properties. They are used as a substitute for fat in low-fat and fat-free food products. Other applications and functionalities depend on the individual type of gum. Demand for gum arabic is expected to continue to grow at a stable pace as food companies look for such natural alternatives in their formulations. Figures 7 and 8 show the imports of gum arabic to Europe. Imports were fairly stable in volume in 2017-2021, but have decreased in value. This is due to wider raw material availability caused by the improved political situation in Sudan, since European importers depend heavily on Sudan for the supply of gum arabic. Sudan supplied around 46,000 tonnes of natural gum arabic to Europe in 2021, which accounts for 86% of total suppliers (excluding intra-European trade). Despite recent improvements in infrastructure, quality and communication, European importers still have difficulties sourcing the product from Sudan and are generally open to finding new suppliers. Other suppliers of gum arabic to the European market are mostly located in West and Central Africa - Chad, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Mauritania. The market for gum arabic is highly concentrated. The French processor and importer [Nexira](https://www.nexira.com/) is estimated to control [50% of the global market](https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/suc2017d4_en.pdf). Another important French importer is [Alland & Robert](https://www.allandetrobert.com/). Other important European importers of gum arabic are located in Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. Source: Eurostat, 2022 Source: Eurostat, 2022 Other natural gums Other gums, as guar gum, locust bean gum, tara gum, tragacanth gum and konjac gum, are also in growing demand in the European market. According to industry sources, gums have a lot of potential in the European market, especially for free-from food products like gluten-free and vegan. Many gums can be used as a substitute for gelatine in certain applications, making them an attractive ingredient for vegan food products. - Guar gum: used in a variety of industries, including food. [The global guar gum market](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/guar-gum-market)is estimated at around \u20ac812 million (US$824.3 million) in 2021, forecasted to grow up to \u20ac1.18 billion (US$1.2 billion) by 2026. [India is the main international supplier](https://www.guargum.biz/guargum_global_market.html)of guar gum, with approximately 80% of the total market, followed by Pakistan. - Locust bean gum (LBG): used as a thickening and gelling agent in the food industry. It is in high demand by the food and beverage industry, especially the dairy sector. Most carob gum is produced in the Mediterranean region - Spain, Portugal, Italy, Morocco, Algeria, Cyprus and Crete. - Tara gum: a less popular additive gum, often used as an alternative to guar gum and LBG. The food industry is the main end user of tara gum, used in low-fat and low-calorie foods. Peru is the largest supplier of tara gum, but the product is finding emerging suppliers in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. - Tragacanth: a form of dietary fibre used as a natural emulsifier, thickener, stabiliser and texturing additive. It has good properties in the presence of heat or low pH and has a long shelf life. In the food industry it is used in dressings, sauces, relishes, beverages, bakery products, broths, confectionery, ice creams, soft jellied products, condiment bases and sweet pickle liquors. - Konjac gum, also known as konjac glucomannan: used as dietary fibre and gelling agent in the pharmaceutical industry. In the food industry it is used as thickener, texture stabiliser, emulsifier, gelling agent and preservative. Konjac gum can be found in dairy and bakery products, pastries, confectionery, dressings, drinks, spreads, processed meats and frozen foods. Seaweed extracts Seaweed extracts, or seaweed hydrocolloids, are used as gelling and thickening agents. They have applications mainly in food, health products and biotechnology sectors. Seaweed extracts are made of different seaweeds sourced from various countries, like Indonesia and China. Common seaweed extracts are agar and carrageenan. Agar is a gelatinous substance derived from red seaweed, such as the gracilaria kind. Agar has nutritional benefits as a source of iron and magnesium, plus digestive, bone and brain health benefits. As shown in Figures 9 and 10, there has been a decline in imports of agar to Europe due to a decreasing demand from non-food industries. In 2015, the agar supply was negatively affected by raw material shortages, causing prices to increase. The price has been declining since then, as the supply situation has improved. Source: Eurostat, 2022 Source: Eurostat, 2022 Carrageenan is derived from red edible seaweeds. The nutritional benefits of carrageenan include promoting gut health, its high level of antioxidants, and its positive effect on treating cholesterol, flu and colds. The [global carrageenan market size](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/carrageenan-market#:~:text=The%20global%20carrageenan%20market%20size%20was%20estimated%20at%20USD%20780.5,USD%20825.0%20million%20in%202021.) was estimated at \u20ac692.7 million (revenue) in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.0% between 2020 and 2028. The food and beverage segment dominated the market with a value share of 72.1% in 2020. Carrageenan finds application in bakery, dairy, meats and beverages. Carrageenan is added to these products to alter viscosity or texture, which in turn improves their sensory properties. The European carrageenan market size was estimated at \u20ac214.7 million (revenue) in 2020, which is about 30% of the global market.

Make sure to promote all the positive properties of gums to buyers. Your claims must be in line with [Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32006R1924&from=en)on nutrition and health claims made on foods. Essential oils Food-grade essential oils can be used as flavouring in food products. Substantial volumes of essential oils are used by the European flavouring sector. Essential oils such as peppermint, lemon, orange, lavender and bergamot are commonly used in sweets, frostings, baked goods and marinades to enhance or add flavours. Thyme and marjoram are used in savoury foods. Figures 11 and 12 show imports of essential oils to Europe between 2017 and 2021, reaching over 85,000 tonnes or \u20ac1.7 billion in 2021. It is shown that the volume of imports has been increasing overall with some small fluctuations in this period. More fluctuations are seen in import value. The inconsistency with value of imports is due to price volatility and changes in imports of different types of essential oils. The most popular essential oil types are orange and other citrus, which are used to add freshness to finished products. Most citrus essential oils are by-products of the juice industry, and the market is dominated by large suppliers from Brazil, Argentina, China, etc. and, to a certain extent, European suppliers like Italy and Spain. Source: Eurostat, 2022 Source: Eurostat, 2022 Oleoresins Oleoresins are concentrated extracts from plants, spices and herbs, and comprise volatile and non-volatile compounds, which differentiates them from essential oils. The main components of an oleoresin include essential oils, fixed oils, pigments, pungent constituents and natural antioxidants. Oleoresins are 5-20 times stronger in flavour than their corresponding spices and are weaker than the corresponding essential oils. Oleoresin compounds provide aroma, taste, colour and pungency and are thus a relevant natural food additive. Additionally, when oxidation is avoided oleoresins can be standardised for flavour with a high stability in storage. The physical characteristics range from viscous oils to thick, tacky pastes which dissolve in fats and oils but generally require use of a carrier to apply to food. Fields of application range from bakery to meats and cheese, beverages (juices, alcoholic drinks) and sauces. Table 5: Overview of oleoresin applications in the food sector | | Application | | Main oleoresin | | Aroma & taste | | black pepper, chillies and capsicum, turmeric and ginger, cinnamon, oregano and rosemary, thyme | | Colour | | capsicum/paprika and turmeric | | Pungency | | chilli peppers, black pepper, ginger | | Preservative | | cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and clove [The global market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/oleoresins-market) for oleoresins was valued at US$1.43 billion in 2021, according to Grand View Research. The market is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9% between 2022 and 2030. Specifically, the European region led the market with a revenue share of over 30% in 2021, which goes back to the growing demand for natural flavouring and colouring agents like oleoresins in the food and drinks industry. Suppliers of oleoresins from developing countries find wide opportunities on the European market as demand will continuously rise, given that more food and beverage companies are exploring natural alternatives to synthetic ingredients. According to European buyers, the most popular oleoresins in Europe are black pepper, paprika and turmeric. Black pepper oleoresin is mainly used in the meat industry, paprika is used in processed foods because of its colour and taste, and turmeric is used mainly in health foods. Ginger and garlic are also important oleoresins. Demand is increasing because of their growing use in ethnic food and businesses shifting towards natural ingredients. Source: Eurostat, 2022 Source: Eurostat, 2022 According to the [European Flavour Association](https://effa.eu/about/our-members) (EFFA), the European flavour industry is responsible for about one-third of the global market share. The main share of the European flavour companies are SMEs and family-owned businesses, combining long-standing experience with state-of-the-art science. These companies require sustainable and transparent practices from suppliers. At the other end of the value chain, European flavouring companies have set up direct sourcing projects for oleoresins. The major end user in Europe is the food sector, which takes more than half of the European market for oleoresins.

Natural food colours [Food colours](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/food-colours) are food additives that are added to foods to: - Make up for colour losses due to light, air, moisture and variations in temperature - Enhance naturally occurring colours - Add colour to foods that would otherwise be colourless or differently coloured Some of the main product categories of the EU's food and drink industry are among the largest end users of natural food colours. For example, the dairy industry accounts for around 15% of the industry's total turnover, while the bakery industry accounts for another 11%. the dairy industry accounts for around 15% of the industry's total turnover, while the bakery industry accounts for another 11%. Dairy and confectionery are the leading categories using food colours, followed by desserts, ice cream, juice drinks, bakery, chocolate, snacks, meat products, soft drinks and sauces, and seasonings. As a result, European demand for natural food colours continues to grow. [The European food colours market](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/europe-food-colorants-market-industry#:~:text=Europe%20food%20colorant%20market%20is,period%20(2020%20%2D%202025).&text=Anthocyanin%20and%20betalain%20pigments%20are,demand%20over%20next%20five%20years.) is projected to increase at an annual growth rate of 3.8% between 2020 and 2025. Europe is considered a global frontrunner in the use of natural food colours, followed closely by the US. Natural food colouring in the food & beverage industry is gaining popularity, with an increasing number of natural food colours being produced commercially. The main market drivers in Europe are related to a growing demand for clean-label foods and health awareness. Safer, natural alternatives are being adopted across the board for all colours and food categories in Europe due to expanding regulatory limits. This opens up opportunities to exporters of natural food colours, especially those with consistent colour intensities, stability upon exposure to light and heat, consistent supply, no reactivity with other food components, and no secondary flavours and odours. The increased use of natural colours in several food categories in Europe drive up imports of various plant-based alternatives. European imports of products under HS code 32030010, covering colouring matter of vegetable origin, have risen consistently over recent years, as seen in Figures 15 and 16. In 2021, EU imports amounted to \u20ac552 million or 47,000 tonnes, having increased at an annual average rate of 4.1% in value and 4.8% in volume since 2017. Around 75% of imports are sourced from intra-European suppliers, but supplies from non-EU sources showed a steady annual growth of 2.2% in value and 1.9% in volume for the same period.
