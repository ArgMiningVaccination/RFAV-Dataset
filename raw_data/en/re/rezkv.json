Of particular interest are simultaneous neural and behavioral recordings now possible in several important model systems. We can now hope to tackle a fundamental question in biology: how do animals control and adapt their behavior? However, due to their complexity, spatiotemporal datasets stretch the limits of existing analysis methods. Bringing with them unique challenges in how to analyze and extract meaning from them. In this talk, I will demonstrate my thesis that the theory of dynamical systems combined with modern machine learning and topological data analysis methods provide a powerful avenue to build interpretable, data-driven models of complex biological phenomena. I will show examples from my past and current research on building a purely data-driven theory of C. elegans locomotor behavior and preliminary analysis of large-scale neuro-behavioral recordings.

Synapses are evolved to sense and homeostatically counteract impairments in the function of neurotransmitter receptors, via an active process called presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). It is generally accepted that synapses continuously monitor receptor-related functional readouts, such as ion-flux, especially calcium. Any sustained changes in such readouts due to synaptic impairment is considered as a signal for PHP induction, which is mediated by a stereotypic molecular signaling. Here, I will present two major findings that challenge this view of PHP induction. First, contrary to the current expectation, conventional receptor-related functional readouts do not act as instructive signals for PHP induction. Second, distinct signaling pathways could induce this process depending on the underlying nature of receptor perturbation. Taken together, these results highlight the need to establish a novel mechanistic framework to understand signaling processes underlying the stability of the nervous system function. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Microbes are the dark matter of the living world. To view them through the narrow lens of disease and devastation, would be doing an enormous disservice to them. We know that soils, rocks, ocean and wind circulation, the shapes and size of landmasses together form the enormous, planetary-scale, biogeochemical reactor that powers the Earth. But this reactor depends on microbes that are the largest primary energy producers on Earth, and regulate the bulk of Earth's carbon-oxygen cycle. Microbes prey on one another, digest, produce, process, ferment, breakdown, recycle, reformulate and synthesise chemicals faster and more efficiently than any human machine ever made. Microbes are also the engines of evolution. All life on Earth evolved from microbes and they live within every creature that is bigger than them. Billions of diverse microbes and viruses live within our gut, inside our lungs, and skin. There is perhaps a virus lurking in every organ of our body. Viruses are a part of us. We cannot outnumber or outmatch viruses. We have to find a way to make peace with them, to understand them, and to treat them as if our very existence depends on them. Because it does.

In plant ecology, work on plant interactions with soil microbes has cast fundamental insights into key processes ranging from ecosystem functioning to species coexistence. But the complexity of these interactions, which are characterized by plants directly and indirectly interacting with a variety of microbes that are themselves interacting with one another, makes it challenging to interpret the wide range of observed patterns and to predict their long-term consequences. In this talk I will illustrate how a tight integration of ecological theory and empirical data helps tackle this challenge. First, I will show how mathematical models of plant-microbe interactions can help disentangle the multiple avenues through which soil microbes influence plant coexistence, as well as the context-dependence of these effects. I will then present results from controlled experiments of plant-soil feedback to show that the primary avenue for microbial controls over plant coexistence is through their frequency-independent effects on population growth rates, not through their frequency-dependent effects as classically assumed. Finally, I will present ongoing work that aims to disentangle how various global change factors alter the outcome of microbially mediated plant coexistence in natural systems. I will conclude with my vision for future research and collaboration \u2014 a vision shaped by the inextricably linked needs to address environmental challenges and to cultivate an equitable future for ecology | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Bacteria thrive in dynamic environments with their DNA facing a constant onslaught of damage. To combat these damages, genomes code for a toolkit of cellular responses, including DNA repair. Making a choice of DNA repair pathway is critical to ensure genome stability versus accuracy. Comparative genomics based studies have highlighted a variability in the repertoires of repair pathways coded across bacterial genomes. Even though we have started to gain mechanistic insights of how these repair pathways work at a molecular level, we still lack an understanding of the factors that dictate the employment of a given repair pathway over the other. In this light, some of the outstanding questions that we do not have answers to, include, how, when and why repair pathways came to be distributed across bacteria. Towards addressing these questions, we included two different repair pathways as case studies - 1. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a template-independent double strand break repair pathway and 2. AlkB, an oxidative demethylase employed in nucleotide alkylation damage repair. We developed a workflow to understand the evolution of these two repair pathways using computational approaches like comparative genomics, phylogenetic comparative methods and machine learning. We found that shared ancestry is not sufficient to explain the incidence of proteins involved in both the repair mechanisms. Our work supports the hypothesis that sources of genome instability play an important role in dictating the evolutionary history of these DNA repair pathways across bacteria. | | Two-dimensional packings of cells in developing epithelial tissues are commonly found to be disordered. However, highly organized packings can emerge during development, such as the hexagonal pattern of ommatidia in the eye epithelium of the fruit fly. We analyze hexatic order parameter in the fruit fly pupal wing epithelium and find a sudden increase in this order parameter over time, indicating the presence of hexatic phases in two-dimensional systems, as described by the classical KTHNY theory. The melting transition scenario with the intermediate hexatic phase has been reproduced in a model of epithelial tissues [Pashupalak et al. Soft Matter, 2020] where the stochastic active forces generated by the cells play the role of an effective temperature. However, both KTHNY theory and recent literature on packings of epithelial tissues assume uniform properties of particles and cells, respectively. In a proliferating tissue, cells grow and divide, which inevitably leads to heterogeneity of cell sizes. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to study how the disorder-to-order transition is affected by the heterogeneity of cell sizes. We find that reducing cell heterogeneity as a control parameter drives the system through an ordering transition. | | Cytoskeletal network and its associated proteins organize the interior of a cell. Remodeling of cytoskeletal filaments and cargo transport driven by motor proteins on the cytoskeleton constitute the two major activities that are involved in diverse cellular functions. Therefore, the cytoskeletal network is under tight regulation. Through my research, I have explored themes in cytoskeletal regulation using reconstitution and single-molecule biophysical methods. My work has shown that cytoskeletal regulatory mechanisms are diverse ranging from clustering of motor proteins in lipid microdomains for effective cargo transport (Rai et al., Cell, 2016) to regulation of actin remodeling by motor binding kinetics to the cargo (Rai et al., JBC, 2021). My current research interest lies in understanding regulation of actin remodeling by pathogenic factors through \"molecular mimicry\" mechanisms using cryo-electron tomography and single-molecule FRET paradigms. | | Gene expression is orchestrated by transcription factors (TF) that bind to promoters and enhancers in the context of conducive epigenetic state. Here, we have studied sequence determinants of human gene regulatory elements as well as epigenome reprogramming in human cancer cells of endodermal origin. First, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) were used for unbiased analysis of human regulatory elements, demonstrating that functional human promoters can be enriched de novo from completely random DNA sequences. Second, multimodal analysis combining genomic MPRA results with epigenomic profiling revealed enhancer activity from distinct classes of transposable elements (TE) in colon and liver cancer cells that are silenced by different epigenetic mechanisms and activated by distinct TFs in each cancer type. Finally, we developed two novel experimental systems for studying early events of pancreatic tumorigenesis - a cell fate conversion method for generating pancreatic exocrine cells, and a factor indexing single-nuclei approach for transcriptome and epigenome profiling upon expression of defined factors. We found that development of pancreatic cell identity is a dynamic process characterized by transcriptome and epigenome remodeling that occurs through TF-mediated rate-determining steps. In conclusion, our multidimensional analysis has revealed epigenome reprogramming events by specific TFs in the context of lineage-specific cancer. | | Research over the past two decades have assembled an elaborate parts list of molecular machinery at kinetochores that is required to form robust attachments with spindle microtubules (MTs) during mitosis. However, we still do not understand how this machinery is coupled to dynamic MT ends to execute accurate chromosome segregation. The Ndc80 kinetochore complex is essential for forming robust end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments during mitosis. Ndc80 recruits the Ska1 complex to kinetochores, where Ska1 has been shown to aid in microtubule-plus end tracking by Ndc80. Our previous work has shown that Cdt1, a DNA replication licensing factor, is a novel spindle microtubule-associated protein that is also recruited to kinetochores via the Ndc80 complex and is required for robust kinetochore-microtubule attachments in metaphase. In the current study, we have developed an Auxin-induced Degron (AID)-tagging approach to validate the previously demonstrated mitotic role of Cdt1. Further, using multiple biochemical approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between Cdt1 and the Ska1 complex in vitro and in mitotic cell lysates. Ska1-Cdt1 interaction is essential for proper recruitment of Cdt1 to kinetochores and spindle microtubules. We find that Cdk1 phosphorylation of Cdt1 during mitosis is important for Ska1-binding as mutations of these phosphorylation sites substantially reduced Cdt1-Ska1 interaction, causing severe destabilization of metaphase spindle microtubules and impeding normal mitotic progression. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) experiments reveal that Cdt1 synergizes not only with the Ndc80 complex as expected, but also with the Ska1 complex, for microtubule-binding. Further, using single molecule TIR-FM, we have established the formation of a highly diffusive, tripartite microtubule-binding complex involving Cdt1+Ska1+Ndc80. Strikingly, this tripartite complex of Cdt1+Ska1+Ndc80 was recorded to spontaneously track the ends of dynamic microtubules with high processivity. Taken together, our data points to a model where Cdt1 binds to Ska1 and serves as an essential co-factor to facilitate the formation of the tripartite Ndc80-Ska-Cdt1 complex. This minimal molecular unit can bi-directionally track dynamic microtubule plus-ends with high-processivity and is essential for efficient kinetochore-microtubule coupling during mitosis. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Flying insects sense and respond to environmental cues at very rapid rates. To achieve stable flight, insects need to sense certain cues at timescales on the order of single wing strokes. In the case of Lepidopteran insects such as moths or butterflies, these cues include visual feedback from optic flow on their compound eyes, and mechanosensory cues due to antennal vibrations from Johnston's organs situated at the base of their antennae. Several hundreds to thousands of multimodal sensors, located on the head, register these cues and transmit them to different regions of the brain from where they are conducted to the thoracic ganglia by a small number of descending neurons to ultimately generate coherent responses that enable stable flight. This massive convergence of sensory information suggests the hypothesis that single descending neurons transmit sensory cues from multiple modalities. How are these multimodal signals integrated by the descending neurons and transduced to the flight motor system at rapid timescales? What are the encoding principles that underlie such multimodal integration? We addressed these questions by conducting intracellular electro-physiological recordings of descending neurons in the Oleander hawkmoth, Daphnis nerii, while providing the moth with various visual and antennal movement stimuli. From these recordings, we identified multiple novel classes of descending neurons with diverse encoding properties. We modelled these classes as functional circuits using an algorithm that used the responses of these neurons to the visual and mechanosensory stimuli as input, and generated functional circuits as output. We next developed computational simulations of these functional circuits to validate our understanding of the responses of the corresponding descending neurons. Together, these recordings, functional circuits, and the simulations shed light on a subset of mechanisms of descending control in insects in general and moths in particular. | | small RNAs are among the main drivers of epigenetic gene regulation. There are three main categories of small RNAs, namely, microRNAs, piRNAs and endogenous siRNAs. These various small RNA pathways are conserved across most eukaryotes. I will take you through my research journey of working with the endogenous small RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans - a well-established model for studying RNAi and epigenetic inheritance, along with my recent identification of a SARS-CoV-2 derived microRNA hijacking the host RNAi machinery. In C. elegans germline, thousands of mRNAs are concomitantly expressed with antisense small RNAs, which are loaded into the Argonaute CSR-1. Despite their essential functions for animal fertility and embryonic development, how CSR-1 associated small RNAs are produced remains unknown. I will briefly talk about the function of CSR-1 pathway, while mainly focusing on the biogenesis of CSR-1 associated small RNAs. I will highlight how the interplay of argonaute slicer activity and translation efficiency, and codon usage of target mRNAs dictate the activity of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to synthesize CSR-1-associated small RNAs. I will show that CSR-1 slicer activity is primarily involved in triggering the synthesis of small RNAs on the coding sequences of germline mRNAs. Moreover, codon optimality and efficient translation antagonize CSR-1 slicing and small RNA biogenesis. I propose that codon usage differences encoded into mRNA sequences might be a conserved strategy in eukaryotes to regulate small RNA biogenesis and Argonaute targeting. I will also talk about my new ventures into the field of infection biology and role of small RNAs in host-pathogen interaction by highlighting our findings on a SARS-CoV-2 derived microRNA which hijacks host RNAi machinery to suppress the activation of host interferon stimulated genes to evade immune response. | | This comprehensive presentation covers key processes from drug Discovery to Development, including the progression and translation of scientific information through different development stages and the transition to clinical studies.

Discussions by artists, archivists, academics, lawyers, teachers, journalists and others. Coming Apart A Brief History of Dissent and Sedition Chitranshul Sinha Friday, Dec 16 2022. (Haapus), NCBS Details: https://bit.ly/apls-dissent Abstract: The Indian law of sedition has a colonial history. It started with an effort to protect the reputation of the English monarch. Over the past two decades, this law has resulted in incarceration and charging of those who have drawn cartoons against corruption, protested against bills in legislation, celebrated songs and sportspersons of another country, and those who have dissented on social media. This law has a history going back about eight centuries, and was drafted for India by people who had little context of the social situation of the sub-continent. The UK itself abolished its sedition law in 2009; its Indian counterpart is currently being reviewed by the Supreme Court of India. And at the heart of this is perhaps a question that keeps doing its rounds across history: when does dissent really become seditious in the modern state? The talk will discuss this colonial history of one of India's most controversial laws and will try to analyse if we are repeating the same mistakes today when we look at updating our penal laws. Bio: Chitranshul Sinha is an Advocate on Record of the Supreme Court, and a Partner in Dua Associates, Advocates and Solicitors. He is also an author; his book, The Great Repression: The Story of Sedition in India, was published in 2019 by Penguin India. He is also a regular contributor to publications like the Indian Express, Times of India, The Hindu, Mirror, and Mint, where he writes on issues related to law. Chitranshul also helped draft a writ petition challenging the constitutional validity of the sedition law before the Supreme Court of India for a sitting Member of Parliament. | | Direct organogenesis provides tremendous plasticity during plant growth and development under various conditions. Highly derived fibrous root system in grasses is primarily determined by adventitious/crown roots. Unlike root-borne lateral roots, the crown roots originate from the shoot tissues by shoot-to-root tissue trans-differentiation, thus involve lineage reprogramming. We use this as a model system to investigate the mechanism underlying the tissue transdifferentiation/lineage reprogramming. Employing laser-capture microdissection coupled with RNA sequencing, we provide genome-wide landscape of transcriptional signatures and in-depth spatio-temporal expression patterns of potential epigenetic modifiers, and transcription factors during priming of rice crown root primordia. Functional analyses of rice cell fate determinants from WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX and PLETHORA gene families reveal their species specific roles in orchestrating fibrous root architecture. We show that while PLETHORA genes retain their conserved function in regulating root-derived lateral root in both dicot and monocot plants, rice PLETHORA1 has acquired new function in controlling lineage reprogramming during shoot-derived adventitious root formation in grass species. Interestingly, rice PLETHORA genes rescue lateral root primordia outgrowth defects of Arabidopsis plt mutant, demonstrating their conserved role in root primordia outgrowth irrespective of their developmental origin. Thus, our findings unveil a molecular framework of tissue trans-differentiation during primordia establishment and species-specific functional divergence of master regulators, leading to culmiation of robust fibrous root architecture. | | To transform a single-celled zygote into a multicelled adult, development employs three basic processes --- asymmetric cell division, signaling and gene regulation. The enormous variety of multicellular life-forms emphasizes the diversity that development can create. In this work, we attempt to chart this diversity using a generative model where development is expressed as combinations of rules governing cell division, signaling and gene regulation. We sample millions of developmental programs and survey the variety of cell-type lineage graphs they produce. This extensive collection of lineage graphs allows us to comment on the statistical properties of cell-differentiation trajectories in real organisms. We find, in contrast to common views, that cell-type lineage graphs are very unlikely to be tree-like. Instead, they are likely to be rich in convergent differentiations, where two or more cell-types differentiate into the same cell-type. Additionally, a majority of our model-generated 'organisms' can regenerate using pluripotent cells. This finding supports the long-standing hypothesis that whole body regeneration is an epiphenomenon of development. 10:00 AM, Friday, Dec 23, 2022 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterInformal Talk by Dr Viraj Doddihal on 'Functional integration of positional information during animal regeneration' 03:30 PM, Monday, Dec 26, 2022 | Haapus (LH1)Presynopsis Thesis Seminar by Ms Aparna Agarwal on 'Adaptation to novel environments: Role of initial selection pressure, population size and microbes' 11:00 AM, Wednesday, Dec 28, 2022 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterSeminar Aasheesh PM, Dec 28, 2022 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterThesis Seminar by Mr Ketan V Thorat on 'Nucleophilic catalytic platforms to alleviate pesticide-induced AChE inhibition, neuro-toxicity and mortality' 11:30 AM, Thursday, Jan by Dr Yamuna on OF G PROTEIN COUPLED INWARDLY RECTIFYING POTASSIUM (GIRK) CHANNELS ' 10:15 AM, Monday, Jan 09, 2023 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterTalk by Dr Manish Jaiswal on 'Genetic screens: targeting mitochondrial shape size and numbers' 02:00 PM, Monday, Jan 09, 2023 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterInformal Talk by Ms Devika Thapar on 'Informal talk by Ms Devika Thapar on 'Wilbe: Home for Scientist Leaders'' 11:30 AM, Tuesday, Jan 10, 2023 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterInformal Talk by Prof Jonathan Schwartz on 'Pandemic Preparedness & Response: Why some countries do it better' 04:00 PM, Tuesday, Jan 10, 2023 | InstemAuditorium150SeaterInformal Seminar by Prof Hiroshi Hamada on 'Molecular and cellular basis of left-right asymmetry in vertebrates ' 10:15 AM, Wednesday, Jan 11, 2023 | Haapus (LH1)Seminar by Dr Mahita Jarjapu on 'Investigating biomolecular recognition through an interdisciplinary lens: Lessons from proteins of the immune system' 02:30 PM, Thursday, Jan 12, 2023 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterTalk by Dr Soman Abraham on ' Recurrent urinary tract infections and a novel prevention strategy' 12:00 PM, Friday, Jan 13, 2023 | FF-North Wing-Lecture RoomThesis Seminar by Mr Anirudh Cs on 'Multi-layered natural light sensors controlling neural output in flatworms and engineered optical sensors for diagnostics' 02:30 PM, Friday, Jan 13, 2023 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterThesis Seminar by Ms Ankita Kapoor on 'Understanding neurotransmitters of myeloid-like blood progenitor development during Drosophila hematopoiesis' 10:15 AM, Tuesday, Jan 17, 2023 | Haapus (LH1)Talk by Dr Darren Williams on 'As natural to die as to be born -
