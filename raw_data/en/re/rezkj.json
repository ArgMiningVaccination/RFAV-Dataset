All of PCC's cleaning products: - Are non-toxic - Do not create harsh fumes - Do not contain fillers or thickeners - Reduce impact on water quality and marine life - Are kinder to your skin, and some are hypoallergenic - Biodegrade more quickly and more completely - Do not contain chlorine or optical brighteners that remain on your clothes to reflect light and trick you into thinking they're cleaner A little goes a long way Most household cleaners contain unnecessary toxins that can be harmful to the environment and our health. The manufacture and use of any product affects the environment, so PCC offers only those that are the least damaging. Use less, save money Many of the cleaning products found at PCC are cost-effective because they're concentrated, so often only a very small amount is necessary. Try using half the amount called for by the directions; you may find the cleaning power to be just as good. It'll be easier on the mechanics of your appliances and our environment, and leave less residue on your clothes and dishes. Concentrated formulas also are more eco-friendly because they reduce the need for additional packaging. Inexpensive, homemade cleaners Vinegar mixed with water is an inexpensive cleaning solution that will clean most household surfaces, from kitchen appliances to tile and toilets. A few drops of an essential oil \u2014 lemon, tea tree, or lavender \u2014 add a fresh scent! Lemon juice is as versatile for cleaning as it is for cooking. Mix it with vinegar or baking soda (or both) to make an all-purpose cleaning paste that cuts through grease, dissolves soap scum, and even shines silver. Or try cutting a lemon in half and sprinkle baking soda on the cut section, then use it to scrub dishes, surfaces, and stains. Baking soda can be used to scrub surfaces in the same way as commercial abrasive cleansers and is a natural deodorizer. To keep your kitchen smelling fresh, just keep an open box in the refrigerator and sprinkle some on the top layer of your garbage. "}
