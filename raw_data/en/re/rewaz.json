Energy Wave Therapy is an exciting new approach to treating erectile dysfunction. With this new, exciting treatment for ED, men are able to forego the need for pills, pumps, injections, or penile implants. This non-invasive, revolutionary procedure for ED increases blood flow to the penis to optimize erections, sensitivity, and sexual performance. Energy wave therapy is safe and effective. It utilizes gentle high-frequency, low-intensity sound waves to stimulate the erectile tissue and improve blood flow in the penis so men can achieve natural, spontaneous erections. The application of energy waves on the penis triggers revascularization, a process in which new blood vessels form. The formation of new blood vessels, coupled with the restoration of blood flow in the penis, help restore erectile function in men with ED. Quick, Safe, & Painless: How Energy Wave Therapy Works Low-intensity energy waves are delivered to the shaft of the penis using a treatment wand. The technician places the treatment wand gently on the penile skin in several different areas. In total, there are 5 points of treatment with each session: 3 on the top shaft of the penis and 2 underneath. The energy waves are delivered through the skin into the tissue to stimulate new blood vessel growth, restore blood flow, and improve erectile quality. The energy waves repair older blood vessels and stimulate the growth of new blood vessels in the penis to improve erectile quality. What to Expect Your urologist will conduct a thorough medical examination to determine whether you're a good candidate before you can start energy wave therapy for ED. During the treatment, the technician will follow the treatment protocol prescribed by your urologist. You will be made comfortable and asked to lie down to begin your treatment session. Each session is approximately 20 minutes and most men experience little to no discomfort during or following the treatment. After your treatment, there are no restrictions. You can immediately resume all normal activities, including sexual intercourse. Benefits of Energy Wave Therapy This non-invasive, outpatient procedure takes only just six sessions, and each session typically takes only 20 minutes. Energy wave therapy has been proven effective, with improvement in erectile function that may be experienced after only a few sessions. No surgery or anesthesia are required, and men experience no or minimal side effects. One of the best parts? You won't need to rely on ED medication anymore, so you can go back to enjoying an active, spontaneous sex life. Recent studies show that many men who are taking common erectile dysfunction medications can discontinue them completely and go back to spontaneous erections following energy wave therapy. Risks Energy wave therapy, or low-intensity shock wave therapy (LI-SWT), has not yet earned the FDA's approval. However, it has been used widely in the U.S. and in other countries for many years and has shown to be an effective treatment for ED in most cases. Results Most patients can get the quality, rigid erection they once had with energy wave therapy's gentle energy pulse treatment within just 6 office visits. Incremental improvement in erectile function may be seen after just a few sessions. The formation of new blood vessels typically takes about 3 months to reach maximum effort. "}
