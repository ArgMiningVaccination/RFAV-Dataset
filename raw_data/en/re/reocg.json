Below she shares 5 of the things she does regularly to help maintain her balance. - Journal, pray and read challenging or encouraging verses in the Bible with hot coffee in hand! This is a time for self-reflection, to be challenged about how I think and speak and how I serve my family and the world around me. It is essential to my personal growth. This doesn't happen every day and sometimes it is for 5 minutes but I try my best to make it a regular practice. - Have a dance party with my husband and daughter. Life can get way too serious. We blast some good pop tunes or a country favorite and I make my family dance with me, especially around 5 or 6 pm when meltdowns are likely to happen (for adults and babies alike)! - Take 1 day per week when I don't drive a car. I bike or take public transport where I need to go... it is amazing how much less can be packed into my schedule when I have to bike or commute with my daughter to run errands or see a friend. This helps me to be more present and enjoy the journey rather than focus on how much I can get done. - Watch my daughter take the world in. My now 8 month old is so fascinated with the world and gets so excited to see people, new things or learn something new. I aspire to emulate this. I now take moments throughout my own day when I notice and am thankful for the little things that make up daily life. - Practice Pilates. Deep breathing and thoughtful movement has become essential to my well-being. It affords physical fitness but more importantly provides stress management, postpartum rehab and an hour for myself when I am not giving to anyone else - I am simply being refueled. "}
