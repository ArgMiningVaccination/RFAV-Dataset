Cardiovascular (CV) disease, cognitive impairment, dementia, and depression are common comorbidities in patients with COPD, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. However, there are considerable gaps in how these comorbidities are assessed, while the burden of other s remain s inadequ ately res earched . This PhD applied several methodologies and used different databases to 1) explore whether circulating biomarkers from the blood (soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End -products - sRAGE) and urine (microalbuminuria) might have a role in COPD related to prognostication of CV risk (assessed by aortic stiffness and carotid intima -media thickness) , 2) evaluate the prevalence and inc idence of cognitive impairment and dementia, 3) examine the incident risk of depression, and 4) assess the risks of respiratory -related morbidities associated with antidepressant use in patients with COPD. Using data from a multisite UK study , sRAGE was not associated with aortic stiffness, carotid intima -media thickness, or CV disease in patients with COPD. However, there was a weak direct association between sRAGE and sp iromet ric lung function measures. Data from the same cohort also showed that ur inary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) was not strongly associated with physiological CV risk measures. Nevertheless, patients with COPD and either diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, or cerebrovascular disease have increased UACR, compared to patients witho ut these comorbidities. Microalbuminuria was also prevalent in all patients with COPD. Using a large primary care database, this PhD demonstrates that patients with COPD have increased prevalence of cognitive impairment compared to subjects without III COPD, matched by age, gender and GP surgery. The incidence of cognitive impairment following COPD diagnosis was 23.1 per 1,000 person -years compared to 16.3 per 1,000 person -years in subjects without COPD. However, the prevalence and incidence of dementia were l ess frequently recorded in patients with COPD compared to individuals without COPD, indicating the possibility of underdiagnosis of dementia and highlighting the need for systematic assessment. The incidence of d epression was also greater following COPD diagnosis, compared to subjects without COPD, which indicates the need to stay alert and target accordingly. Antidepressant use was associated with increased risks of pneumonia and COPD exacerbations relative to periods of unexposed to anti depressants in patients with COPD, raising the concern of potential side -effects and adverse events . This thesis addresses several aspects of COPD comorb idities and contributes new evidence for assessing , recognising, and managing comorbidities in patient s with COPD.

The key characteristic of COPD - that is persistent airflow limitation - is caused by a mixture of small airway disease and parenchymal destruction [1]. COPD is a disabling disease that usually occurs and worsens over time . COPD is also associated with comorbidities, which have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality [1]. The heterogeneity of COPD includes both chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as the presence o f cough and sputum for more than three months for two consecutive years, without any other condition causing sputum production [2]. Emphysema, meanwhile, is a pathological term refers to permanent enlargement of the airspace and destruction of the gas -exchanging surface (alveolar wall) distal to terminal bronchioles, leading to irreversible loss of elastic recoil [3]. 1.2 Risk factors for COPD Tobacco smoking is the primary environmental factor - especially in low and middle income class countries (LMIC s) - which increases the risk of COPD [1]. Compared to non -smokers, smokers are associated with increased prevalence of lung function abnormalities and a higher rate of COPD mortality [4, 5] . Indeed, tobacco smoking induces inflammation in the lung and its airway by provoking inflammatory cytokines and macrophages. It is, however, important to menti on that less than 50% of smokers develop COPD, irrespective of the scale of smoking [6]. This implies that other factors 3 are contributing to the development of COPD [7]. It is evident that n on-smokers account for a considerable proportion of patients with COPD. The Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) study, which collected data from 14 countries, indicated that non -smokers (n= 4,291) comprise 28% of all COPD and 23% of moderate COPD and worse [8]. Occupatio nal exposures, which include fumes, chemicals, and organic/nonorganic dust, also contribute to the development of COPD [9, 10] . A recent UK population - based study (n= 94,5 51) identified several occupations (such as sculptors, gardeners, and warehouse workers) that were associated with amplified COPD risk among non - smokers and non -asthmatics [11]. According to US popula tion-based data collected from 9,823 subjects, occupational exposures account for 19% of all COPD cases, and 31% of cases among lifelong non -smokers [12]. However, the risk from occupational exposures seems to be much more significant in LMIC s. Therefo re, it is important to take occupational history into account during respiratory assessment. Air pollution, which occurs as a result of industrial operations, vehicular traffic, and biomass fuels, also increases the risk of developing COPD [13, 14] . A recent large population -based study within the UK , including 303,887 subjects aged 40 -69, showed that higher exposures to ambient air pollution were associated with reduced lung function and increased prevalence of COPD [15]. Current literature also suggests that about 3 billion people , especially in LMIC s, rely on solid fuels (coal and biomass ) as an energy source (e.g. cooking and/or heating ) [16, 17] , contributing to higher exposure to household air pollution (HAP ), and therefore to COPD. Indeed, in many countries, several studies have linked the exposure to solid fuel to increased risk of COPD [18-23]. A recent systematic review and meta -analysis involving 35 studies 4 (n=73,122) showed that exposure to HAP from biomass increases the risk of C OPD by almost 3 times compared to non -biomass fuels [18]. A recent Chinese cohort study involving 277,838 people who never smoked demonstrated that solid fuel users were at increased risk of COPD compared to clean fuel users [24]. Women are more likely to be predisposed to COPD through HAP, resulting from solid fuels exposures, especially in LMICs [25, 26] . The association - that is the risk of COPD - is more significant in women living in rural areas (OR:1.95; CI: 1.54 to 2.37) compared to women in urban areas (OR: 1.61; CI: 1.20 to 2.02), given the higher exposure to solid fuels [25]. This may be attributed to the considerable exposure to smoke from biomass fuels to women living in rural areas [27]. The s ocioeconomic status (SES) has been considered as a strong determinant of health in a variety of diseases; one of which is COPD [28]. An analysis of three population - based studies involving 11,042 participants (aged 35 -95 years) demonstrated that lower SES was associated with higher odds of having COPD, following adjustments for confounders [29]. In the UK, primary care data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) has also shown that the prevalence of COPD was greater amongst individuals with lower SES, compared to subjects with a higher SES [30]. Genetic susceptibility to the development of COPD has been reported. Alpha -1 antitrypsin deficiency is recognised as a cause of COPD [1]. Previous studies indicated that a low concentration of alpha -1 antitrypsin, defined as < 11 micromol/L, is associated with early onset of emphysema [31]. However, deficiency in alpha -1 antitrypsin only accounts for a small proportion of COPD [32]; other genetic factors also contribute. 5 1.3 COPD symptoms Patients with COPD often present with several symptoms, such as dyspnoea (breathlessness), cough, sputum production, wheezing, and chest tightness [1]. Dyspnoea, either chronic or progressive, is considered the hallmark of COPD, defined as \"a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity \" [33]. Dyspnoea is common in all COPD stages [34], and has been associated with worse clinical outcomes, including a higher risk of COPD exacerbation [34], frequent visit to primary care practice [34], reduced physical activity [35], and depression [36]. A simple, validated method for the measurement of dyspnoea is by using the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea score (1 5; Table 1-1) [37, 38] . It is a unidimensional measure, where patients indicate how their breathlessness impacts on their everyday activity. Table 1-1. Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea grades [39] Grade Description 1 Not troubled by breathlessness except on strenuous exercise 2 Short of breath when hurrying or walking up a slight hill 3 Walks slower than contemporaries on level ground because of breathlessness, or has to stop for breath when walking at own pace 4 Stops for breath after walking about 100 m or after a few minutes on level ground 5 Too breathless to leave the house, or breathless when dressing or undressing 6 1.4 COPD diagnosis According to the guideline produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), a diagnosis of COPD should be suspected in patients who have a risk factor (primarily a history of smoking in the high -income countries) and one or more of the aforementioned respiratory symptoms [40]. A COPD diagno sis is then confirmed by post -bronchodilator spirometry. The post -bronchodilator spirometric criterion of the airflow obstruction is defined as the ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1)/forced vital less non -invasive measure for airflow limitation. It is noteworthy that good quality spirometry measurements are essential in making a diagnosis and assessing disease progr ession and severity. 1.4.1 COPD severity NICE and GOLD guidelines grade COPD airflow obstruction severity based on the reduction in FEV 1 in those with the obstruction, and compare it to the individual's reference values: age, sex, and height and ethnicity [1, 40] . The GOLD and NICE classification of the severity of airflow limitation is presented in Table 1-2. 7 Table 1-2. GOLD and NICE classification of airflow limitation severity in COPD [1, 40] . GOLD FEV Mild FEV 1/FVC < 0.70 FEV 1 80% GOLD 2 Moderate FEV 1/FVC < 0.70 50% FEV 1<80 % FEV 1/FVC < 0.70 FEV 1<50 % GOLD FEV 0.70 FEV 1 <30% FEV 1: Forced expiratory volume in one second; FEV1/FVC: the ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity 1.5 Epidemiology of COPD COPD presents a significant public health threat across the world. Its prevalence, incidence, as well as associated morbidity and mortality, have increased in recent years [41]. It is ranked as the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide [41]. The increased burden of COPD , especially in LMICs , is usually associated with the increased prevalence of smoking , whereas other factors (e.g. occupational and envi ronmental) are common in LMICs [42]. 1.5.1 Prevalence and Incidence of COPD There has been an increasing trend in COPD prevalence over the past decades. Adeloye et al. reported that the global prevalence of COPD (defined based on spirometry) increased from 10.7% (95% to 15%) [43]. The World Health Origination (WHO) reported that there were approximate ly 251 million cases of COPD globally in 2016 [44]. A recent geographical study, including population -based studies between 1995 and 2019, showed that western and central Europe had the highest mean prevalence of COPD 8 with approximately 14.2% (95% CI: 8.8% to 19.6%), respectively [45]. In the UK, it is estimated that around 3 million people live with COPD; of whom, 2 million cases are undiagnosed. Statistics also suggest that 2% of the entire UK population, and 4 -5% of people over the age of 40 in live with COPD [46]. Furthermore, the number of individuals who have received COPD diagnosis has increased in the last d ecade by 27%, from 1,600 to 2,000 per 1000,00 . This may indicate that more people are getting diagnosed with COPD but could also mean that the prevalence of COPD is increasing. Indeed, between 2008 and 2012, the prevalence of COPD increased by 9%, and t he proportion of males living with COPD is higher than that relating to females [46]. Data based on the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) for general practices (GPs) indicates that the prevalence of COPD in England is estimated to be 1.9% [47]. 1.5.2 Morbidity and economic burden of COPD COPD imposes significant morbidities (e.g. emergency visits and hospitalisation) with a considerable economic burden. Indeed, it has become the 2nd largest cause of hospital admission in the UK, with 115,000 emergency admission and over a million bed days per year [48]. Available data also show that 43% of patients admitted with COPD were readmitted within 90 days after discharge in 2014, with a substantial increase from 33% in 2008 [49]. The cost of COPD to the National Health Service (NHS) is estimated to be \u00a31.85 billion per year and is expected to increase to \u00a32.32 billion by 2030 [50], with the most significant costs related to COPD exacerbation and hospitalisation. In addition, COPD 9 severity is directly related to healthcare cost - that is the direct cost per patient increases with the increased number of experienced COPD exacerbations [51]. As COPD is a disabling disease, 25% of patients with the condition are prevented from working, and the annual cost of lost productivity because of COPD is estimated to be \u00a33.8 billion [52]. 1.5.3 Mortality of COPD COPD is a major ca use of death , accounting for nearly 5% of all deaths worldwide [53]. The most significant proportion of COPD deaths occur in low -middle income - countries (about 90% of all COPD deaths) [44]. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study reported that there were more than 3 million deaths caused by COPD in 2015 ; an increase of 11.6% compared with the number of deaths recorded in 1990 [54]. By 2060, COPD and its related conditions are expected to cause more than 5.4 million deaths annually [55]. Statistics have shown that the UK is one of the top 20 countries in terms of COPD mortality, with an age -standardised mortality rate of 210.7 per 1000,000 of the population [46]. The British Lung Foundation (BLF) reported that there were 30,000 deaths from COPD in 2012 , and this accounted for 5.3% of all mortality cases , making COPD the 5th largest cause of death in the country. The distribution of these deaths is slightly greater in men (51.2%; 15,254 deaths) compared to women (48.8%; 14,531 deaths) [46]. 10 1.6 Management and treatment of COPD As COPD is an irreversible condition, an effective COPD management plan such as assessing disease severity and progression, minimising risk factors, and managing stable COPD and exacerbations, should be employed. COPD management should , therefore, focus on improving patients ' overall health by preserving lung function , and reducing symptoms, risk of exacerbation, and disease progression [1, 40] . Smoking cessation remains the most effective approach for people who smoke [1]. Indeed, it has been shown to alter the natural history of COPD and reduce the lung function decline [56]. Smoking cessation should be supported by pharmacological (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy) and non -pharmacological (e .g. therapies [1, 40] . medications) , as bronchodilators and corticosteroids, is mainly indicated to ameliorate symptoms, reduce the severity of COPD exacerbation s, and improve exercise limitation and overall health status [1, 40] . The latest NICE COPD guidelines have published an algorithm for the selection of inhaled therapies based on clinical evidence. Short -acting bronchodilators are indicated (as necessary) to relieve shortness of breath and improve exercise limitation. Long -acting agents, such as long-acting anti -muscarinic (LAMA) and long-acting 2 agonist (LABA), in addition to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) , are indicated if breathlessness persists , and to improve day to day symptoms and reduce exacerbations [1, 40] . [1, 40] . They have been shown to reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)/pneumonia and mortality in patients with COPD [57]. 11 An important non -pharmacological therapy is a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), defined as \"an individually tailored, multidisciplinary care program for people with COPD, which aims to optimize physical and psychological condition through exercise training, education, and nutritional, psychological, and behavioural interventions \" [40]. PR should be considered in a wide range of respiratory diseases, one of which is COPD [58]. PR aims to improve symptoms, overall health , exercise limitation , and psychological well is defined as \"a sustained worsening of the patient's symptoms from his or her usual stable state that is beyond normal day - to-day variations and is acute in onset \" [1] that requires a change in the treatment [59]. The GOLD report recommends managing COPD exacerbation based on the severity of the episode. The main goal of treating COPD exacerbation is to minimise the impact of the current episode as well as reduce the risk of subsequent/future ones. The majority of COPD exacerbation episodes (up to 80%) are managed in outpatient by pharmacotherapies such as bronchodilators, corticosteroids (oral), and antibiotics. In some cases, where COPD exacerbation cannot be managed by pharmacological therapies, hospital admission may be required [1]. COPD e xacerbations are important events in the natural history of COPD and are associated with a significant impact on a patient s' health [60]. Even a single exacerbation episode can significantly increase the lung function decline rate [61]. Also , COPD exacerbation is associated with increased readmission rates as well as in - hospital and post -discharge mortality [62-64]. Current evid ence shows that exacerbations are associated with a more significant disease progression (e.g. faster 12 decline in FEV 1), and increased risk of a subsequent event [65, 66] . Indeed, 25% of COPD exacerbations are followed by a second recurrent episode within eight weeks [67]. 1.8 Comorbidities in COPD Although COPD mainly affects the lungs, it is commonly associated with other comorbid conditions . The term \"comorbidity\" is widely described as the co -existence of other medical conditions alongside the primary disease of interest (e.g. COPD). The co-existence of comorbidities does not necessarily imply that these comor bidities are directly related to COPD. Some comorbidities may arise independently, while others may occur due to common risk factors . Further, i t is also possible that one condition could amplif y the risk of the other . The underlying mechanisms linking COPD to its associated comorbidities remain for further investigation [68]. Comorbidities, either single or multiple, are common in patients with COPD, impacting on patients' health status, and increasing the risks of exacerbations, readmission, and mortality [69-74]. Nevertheless, current guidelines provide l imited information on how to identify, assess, and manage these comorbidities in patients with COPD [1]. Current literature suggests that patients with COPD are more likely to suffer from a higher proportion of comorbidities , compared to subjects without COPD [75, 76] . Further , patients with COPD are likely to die from non -pulmonary causes [73, 77]. In a cluster analy sis of 213 well -characterised patients with COPD (defined based on FEV 1 % predicted), 98% had one or more comorbidities, and 53% had at least four comorbid conditions [78]. In a previous study, involving 1,969 patients with COPD and 316 subjects without COPD, Divo et al. reported that the median number of 13 comorbidities in patients with COPD is 4 (interquartile range; 2 -7) compared to 2 (interquartile range; 0 -3) in subjects without COPD [79]. The view that a considerable proportion of patients with COPD suffer from multiple comorbidities has a significant impact on survival. Almagro et al. demonstrated that comorbidi ties, quantified by Charlson comorbidity index score, was associated with 23% increased odds of mortality , following adjustment for confounders [80]. In the BODE COPD cohort, there was an amplified risk of death with higher values of COPD specific comorbidity test (C OTE) index (Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.13; 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.18) [73]. Even the co -existence of a single comorbid condition in patients with COPD has a significant impact on survival . Data from the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End -points (ECLIPSE) study showed that the presence of 1 comorbidity was associated with 74% increased o dds of mortality (compared to no comorbidity) , while the co -existence of 4 comorbidities were associated with a 4 -fold increase of death [81]. These observations - that is a significant proportion of patients with COPD have comorbidities (86% to 98 %) - have led researchers to conclude that the co -existence of comorbidities (either single or multiple) in COPD is likely to be the rule as opposed to the exception [82]. Comorbidities are common at/in all COPD severities [83-85]. However , it appears that the impact of comorbidities is significantly greater on patients with advanced COPD severity [86]. Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study of 20,296 patients showed that worse COPD severity (GOLD stage 3 or 4) was associated with increased odds of comorbidities , even after adjusting for commo n confounders. These comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease ) 14 contributed to worse clinical outcomes such as an increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality [87]. The presence of comorbidities in patients with COPD makes the assessment and clinical management more challenging. To explain , some medications that are commonly prescribed for patients with COPD can potential ly worsen or increase the risk of other medical conditions. For instance, bronchodi lators may worsen the existing CV disease, or increase the risk of subsequent CV event [88]. Current evidence reports that more than 50% of patients with COPD take more than 4 medications [82]. This may add to the risk of drug interactions , resulting in potential adverse events [89]. In addition, clinical decision making is also complicated, as there are no sufficient recommendations regarding the management of patient s with COPD who have comorbidities. The current COPD guidelines (e.g. GOLD and NICE) state that comorbidities should be managed according to usual care. However, identifying and diagnosing co -existing comorbidities is not always easy. Some comorbidities ca n be asymptomatic, whereas other symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea) may not be specific to COPD. Because of this, there needs to be a holistic approach when identifying and treating comorbidities in COPD. Based on the preceding discussion, it is evident that comorbidities are a common issue in patients with COPD, with significant impacts on prognosis and management. However, it is noteworthy that studies on the burden of comorbidities (either single or multiple) in COPD are largely heterogeneous in data collection methods and in how patients with COPD were defined . There is a wide disparity with regards to the burden of comorbidities in COPD. This indicat es that there is a need for more research to understand the broader spectrum of the disease and its associated comorbidities . There 15 have been many comorbidities recorded in patients with COPD [73, 79] . Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding in some of these comorbidities, while others have not been adequately researched. In the following sections, specific comorbidities relevant to this thesis are discussed. These include cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, dementia, and depression. 1.8.1 Cardiovascular (CV) disease 1.8.1.1 Cardiova scular disease and lung function A large body of evidence has demonstrated an association between impaired lung function and cardiovascular (CV) risk, even in the absence of established pulmonary disease [90]. Indeed, current evidence demonstrates that reduced lung function (FEV 1) is a marker of CV mortality, independent of common risk factors ( e.g. age, sex, and history of smoking ) [91]. Reduced lung function is also a predictor of all-cause mortality [92]. Even a small reduction in FEV 1 has shown to increase the risk of CV events . Recent longitudinal data on 4,761 subjects aged 18 -30 years demonstrated that a reduction in FEV 1 (by 10 % of FEV 1 percent predic ted) and FVC (by 10% in FVC percent predicted) at a younger age, was associated with an 18% ( adjusted HR: 1.18; CI: 1.06 to 1.33) increased risk of CV events, respectively, in middle age, independent of traditional risk factors [93]. Agarwal et al. reported an inverse association between heart failure and FEV 1 - that is increased risk of heart failure with decreased FEV 1 even after adjustments for confounders [94]. There is also an associa tion between CV risk and lung function decline. Analysis from the ARIC study on 10,351 subjects free of CV disease, showed that a fast decline in lung function (defined as a reduction in FEV 1 > 1.9% per year or FVC >2.1% per year) 16 over a 3-year follow -up period , was associated with a greater risk of CV disease, after accounting for smoking status and other confounders . The same study also showed that a rapid decline in FEV 1 in the first year of follow -up was the most prognostic (HR: 4.22) [95]. Collectively, these findings clearly show that there is an association between impaired lung function and CV risk . 1.8.1.2 Cardiovascular disease and COPD Cardiovascular disease (CV) is a very common comorbidity in patients with COPD. Both conditions (e.g. COPD and CV disease ) share similar risk factors, such as ageing, smoking, and unhealthy lifestyle (e.g. physical inactivity and unhealthy diet ) [73]. Patients with COPD and CV disease , compared to subjects without COPD, are at increased risk of hospitalisation [87] and mortality [77, 96] . In addition, it is well - documented that the observed prevalence of CV disease in patients with COPD is indep endent of age, sex, smoking, and other risk factors [82, 87] . A recent meta - analysis , including 29 datasets , showed that patients with COPD were at 2 to 5 times greater risk of CV diseases ( ischaemic heart disease , arrhythmias, heart failure, diseases of the pulmonary circulation, and diseases of arteries) [97]. It is clear that there is a significant CV risk in patients with COPD, which highl ights the importance of increasing awareness , and emphases on routine screening/assessment to the CV state to increase detection. A series of large -scale prospective, population -based studies demonstrated that patients with COPD are at increased risk of CV disease, both as a composite outcome and as a specific disease. It has been shown that p atients with COPD are at increased risk of acute CV events, namely myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke [98-100]. In 17 addition, other studies have also reported increase d CV disease other than MI and stroke (e.g. heart failure and arterial fibrillation) [96, 101, 102] . CV disease is also recognised as a significant determinant of survival in patients with COPD. Indeed, it has been shown that patients with COPD are more likely to die from CV disease than from respiratory causes [103] . Data from the Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study showed that CV deaths account for 27% of all deaths (n=911) in patients with moderate to severe COPD [77]. In addition, the Lung Health Study indicated that, even in p atients with mild -moderate COPD, CV disease was also a significant cause of death, accounting for 22% of CV mortality [104] . The exact causes of the increased risk of CV disease in COPD remain poorly understood. This may be attributed to common risk factors, such as age, smoking, systematic inflammation, sedentary lifestyle, or conditions that can impair the heart from lung disease [73, 105] . However, what remains unclear is whether there are mechanistic pathways which contribute to the development of CV disease in COPD, or vice versa. Given the greater burden of CV disease in COPD, healthcare professionals are encouraged to manage and treat comorbidities. This implies increasing the detection of CV disease in those patients. Thus, it is important to consider simple , easy -to-use, sub-clinical biomarkers over and beyond the guideline -recommended diagnostic procedures to assist in the detection and recognition of CV disease. 1.8.2 Cognitive impairment Cognitive impairment refers to a condition in which individuals experience a decline in their cognitive function (e.g. memory), where deficits do not completely impair 18 independent functioning [106] . In the UK, the rate of cognitive impairment has been increasing. A recent report showed an increasing trend in the prevalence of cognitive impairment (without a diagnosis of dementia) in the general population (aged 65 years) over the past 2 decades , from 36.8% in 1991 to 40.4% in 2011 [107] . Several risk factors are associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, including advanced ageing, hypoxia [108] , systemic predispositions [116] . Thus, interventions which could reduce the risk or even prevent dementia cases, such as childhood education, regular exercise, maintaining social en gagement, and managing CV risk, and smoking cessation, have been suggested [117] . In addition, efforts have also been made to increase awareness and detection of dementia [118] . Cognitive impairment has a significant impact on health and is associated with worse clinical outcomes [119] . Indeed, the presence of cognitive impairment is recognised as a precursor to established dementia [120, 121] , despite not all patients with cognitive impairment will eventually develop dementia [122] . A previous study showed that approximately 30% of patients with confirmed cognitive developed dementia over a median of 5 -year follow up [122] . Therefore, important to understand the relationship between cognitive impairment and dementia and identify any modifiable risk factors. What remains unclear, however, is what clinical features might predict the progression to dementia . Making a diagnosis of dementia is ideally made by a comprehensive cognitive test/assessment, which is not often performed in GP practices. Although GP doctors have been supported and encouraged to take an independent role in diagnosing 19 dementia, there is a hesitance in using the term \"dementia\" [123, 124] . Therefore, it is assumed that doctors may use the term \"cognitive impairment\" in place of the term \"dementia\" more often. This, in turn, may lead to under -or overestimation of the true prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia. Furthermore, determining the severity of the cognitive impairment (e.g. mild, moderate, etc) can also be missed if no cognitive assessment being performed. This may limit timely appropriate interventions, as well as providing services that are structured t o meet patients' needs . Although cognitive impairment and COPD have been studied as individual entities, current evidence sugges ts they often co -exist and may also be inter -related . Indeed, COPD is associated with hypoxemia, hypercapnia, smoking, and CV di sease; all of which increase the risk of neuronal injury, and therefore, cognitive impairment and subsequent dementia [106] . Other risk factors have also been proposed, which include systematic inflammation and oxidative stress [106] . However, it is unlikely these factors to fully account for the presence of cognitive impairment and dementia in COPD. Impaired cognitive function in people with COPD is an important determinant of clinical outcomes. A recen t observational study, including 157 patients with COPD referred to a pulmonary rehabilitation program, showed that patients with COPD and co-existing cognitive impairment were less likely to adhere to pulmonary rehabilitation , compared to patients without cognitive impairment (23% vs 10%) [125] . However, PR was effective for patients who completed the program (even in those with cognitive impairmen t). This suggests that interventions should be taken to reduce the drop -out rates in those patients in order to bring greater benefits. 20 Cognitive impairment also has a significant impact on dependency and self - management in COPD. A systematic review including 13 studies demonstrated that patients with COPD and cognitive impairment need more assistance in many aspects of daily life activities, and also have improper inhaler technique [126] . Proper inhaler use is a major element for effective self -management, and also for optimising drug delivery [127] . However, there have been no specific recommenda tions on inhaler use for patients with COPD and co -existing cognitive impairment. Therefore, systematic assessment of the cognitive function in patients with COPD is of clinical importance , as it can make a clear distinction between patients with poor adherence due to cognitive impairment, and those with improper techniques [128] . Current estimates of cognitive impairment in patients with COPD are largely heterogeneous, depending on the study population a nd methods used to assess cognitive function [129] . Establishing accurate epidemiology of cognitive impairment in people with COPD has relevant clinical implications. This is because cognitive impairment increases the burden of COPD and raises the concern of the increased risk of subsequent dementia. A broader understanding of t he association between COPD and cognitive impairment may; therefore, help identify any modifiable risk factors early in the course of the illness, allowing for timely interventions to avoid or at least minimise the risk of progressing to clinical dementia. Moreover, it may also help reduce the negative impact of cognitive impairment on COPD populations. 1.8.3 Dementia Dementia is a devastating condition, defined as the development of multiple cognitive impairments that significantly interfere with social activi ties and occupational functioning. It is a progressive and irreversible disease, which contributes substantially 21 to the health and economic burdens [130] . Currently, there are more than 40 million people suffering from dementia around the world , but the prevalence is projected to increase to 135 million p eople by 2050 [131] . In the general popu lation, 5-8% of people over 70 years old and 15 -60% of people over 80 years old are more likely to develop dementia worldwide [132] . Whereas a growing body of literature has investigated the association between COPD and cognitive impairment, studies on dementia in patients with COPD are generally lacking. A recent systematic review, including 3 Taiwanese studies, reported that patients with COPD were at increased risk of dementia. However, the studies included in the latter systematic review are limited by some methodological flaws such as including patients with asthma [133] , undefined follow -up period [134] , and inadequate matching group [135] . In addition, another major limitation for the existing studies is the methodology used for COPD ascertainment [136-138]. Rusanen et al. showed that a diagnosis of COPD in midlife was associated with increas ed risk of mild cognitive impairment/dementia (HR: 1.85, 95% 1.05 to 3.28) [136] . By contrast, a COPD diagnosed in later life (> 65 years) was inversely associated (although not significant) with dementia (HR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.08 to 1.24). Howeve r, it is important to note that the latter study defined COPD based on self -reported history as opposed to a COPD diagnosis that is objectively confirmed, which further limit the applicability of the findings. The findings of the existing studies regardin g the association between COPD and dementia have also been inconsistent. A recent analysis from the ARIC study, including 14,184 subjects aged 45 years, with a median follow -up of 23 years, showed a nonsignificant risk of dementia in patients with COPD ( n= 2,490) compared 22 to subjects to 1.27) [137] . In contrast, a Chinese study, with a short follow -up (3 years), showed that a self -reported COPD diagnosis in older subjects (mean age: 82.9 years) was associated with an increased risk of dementia (adjusted HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.33) [138] . Given the heterogeneity in the current literature, there is a need to further explore the relationship between COPD with cognitive impair ment and dementia. Up to date, there are no previous population -based studies, which investigated the prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia in patients with COPD in the UK. 1.8.4 Depression The co -existence of poor mental health in COPD has a significant effect on health and prognosis. Depression is among the most common and modifiable comorbidities in COPD, contributing to impaired quality of life, poor adherence to medications and pulmonary rehabilitation [139, 140] , and increased risk of death [141] . Depression is frequent , even in patients with mild COPD [142] . The reported prevalence varies across studies, as a result of differences in terms of the study's population and design. It is estimated that depression affects 27% [143] to 40% [144] of patients with stable COPD. The prevalence of depression also increases in line with the severity of COPD . Data from the ECLIPSE study showed that patients with more severe COPD (defined based on GOLD) had a higher prevalence of depression compared with lower COPD stage [145] . Furthermore, older studies indicated that patients with COPD are at increased risk of depression [146-148] and that patients with severe COPD (defined as oxygen use) are associated with a two-fold high er risk 23 of depression compared with mild COPD (defined as patients who received no drug treatment) [147] . Although the current guidelines recommend recognising depression in patients with COPD [40], there has been no evidence that depression is currently part of the standard assessment. Depress ive symptoms may remain undiagnosed in patients with COPD; thus, undertreated [149] , ultimately to the detriment of patients. Current evidence suggests that more than 60% of patients with COPD and depression receive no treatments [150] . Identifying depression as early as possible allows healthcare providers to develop appropriate strategies that meet patients' needs and guide the choice of pharmacological and non -pharmacological therapies. Therefore, it is important to recognise depression and be vigilant to symptoms to ensure that it is appropriately managed alongside COPD. The current COPD guidelines (e.g. GOLD) indicate that the management of comorb idities in the presence of COPD should be done according to usual care [1]. This means that depression (when co -exists with COPD) should be managed using the existing guidelines for depression . However, it is important to be cautious when managing these patients , especially when prescribing anti depressants. As such, i t is crucial to guide the choice of pharmacological treatment , as the risk of drug interactions may be increased , leading to ad verse events. Recent evidence suggests that antidepressan ts are associated with an increase d risk of respiratory -related morbidities (e.g. pneumonia , emergency vis its, and hosp italisations ) in patients with COPD compared to patients with COPD who do not use antidepressants [151] ; however, this require s further investigation. 24 1.9 Circulating Biomarkers There has been growing interest in identifying clinically relevant biomarkers in COPD. According to the National Institutes of Health, biomarkers are defined as \" a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention \" [152] . Unlike a physiological measure (FEV 1 and FVC), biological markers are considered to be substances. The clinical applications of biomarkers can include predicting the disease's course and severity, determining prognosis, categorising different clinical phenotypes, monitoring drug response, and assessing the pathophysiology of disease [153] . Potential characteristics of a clinically useful biomarker are to be safe, precise, reproducible, measurable, inexpensive, and easy to implement into clinical practice [152, 154, 155] . However, it is acknowledged that new biomarkers development is extremely challenging, as in many cases, biomarkers may fail because of poor reproducibility. For the selected biomarkers in this thesis, the purpose was not to reproduce previous findings; but rather, to increase understanding of the role of simple clinically relevant biomarkers. Promoting CV disease prevention or at least minimising low CV risks have been of great interest [156] . Although, as previously discussed, there is an increased burden of CV disease in patients with COPD, there is inadequate information on how to assess the CV state in patients with COPD . There is also uncertainty regarding the optimal method for assessing CV risk in patients with COPD. The clinical presentation of COPD is largely heterogeneous , making it unlikely for a single marker to capture the increased risk of CV abnormalities. Thus, c hanges in patient care are needed , so that the CV risk in patients with COPD are addressed . This 25 implies using a multi -dimensional approach, where other measures should be made available to address CV risk as opposed to merely assessi ng the lung function status in patients with COPD [157-159]. The field of biomarkers in COPD has received great interest. It is indeed of clinical importance to assess the CV abnormalities in patients with COPD. Several biomarkers have been investigated in the literature, including C -reactive protein (CRP), fibrinog en, surfactant protein [160-162]. Indeed, the role of CRP as a CV biomarker has been reported in the literature - that i s increased CRP level is associated with increased risk of CV disease [163, 164] . In the setting of COPD, however, there seems to be inconsistency across studies. While some literature suggests that CRP relates to CV risk in patients with COPD [165, 166] , another suggests otherwise. Findings from a recent multicentre study (n= 729) showed that neither CRP nor fibrinogen were associated with the non -invasive CV risk measure (as measured by aortic PWV) in patients with COPD [167] . It is worth noting that fibrinogen is the only biomarker with approval as a drug development tool for COPD [168] . Nevertheless, identifying inflammatory comorbidities, such CV disease, by fibrinogen remains not fully understood [169] . Therefore, there is a need to identify biomarkers that can help improve CV risk detection in patients with COPD. Herein, two biological markers that have shown to have a predictive CV risk values in other disease groups and in the general population are explored in patients with COPD. These include soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End -products (sRAGE) and Microalbuminuria (MAB). In the following sections, the structure and clinical utility of these biomarkers will be briefly highlighted. 26 1.9.1 Adva nced Glycation End -products (AGEs) Advanced Glycation End -products (AGEs) are a heterogeneous group of compounds, which are irr eversi bly formed by a non -enzymatic glycation and oxidation reactions of lipids and proteins. Typically, AGEs are formed at a slo w rate and accumulate in tissues with chronological ageing. The rate of this process accelerates under oxidative and inflammatory stress, leading to increased levels of AGEs; thereby contributing to age-related pathogenesis [170-172]. A previous prospective population -based study including subjects over the age of 65 years (n=1013) showed that increased AGEs was associated with increased risk of CV mortality (HR:1.84; 95% CI: 1.30 - 2.60) compared to subjects with lower AGEs [173] . 1.9.2 Receptor for Advanced Glycation End -products (RAGE) The receptor for advanced glycation end -products (RAGE) is a mem ber of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell -surface, and a pattern -recognition receptor that interacts with multiple ligands [174] ; one of which is AGEs. RAGE is at highest baseline level in the lungs, including proximal and distal airways [175, 176] . However, it is expressed at a very low or undetectable level in most other body tissues [175] . Where soever its ligands accumulate, RAGE is overexpressed . This can be seen in conditions associated with inflammation, such as CV disease and COPD. 1.9.3 Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End -products (sRAGE) RAGE exists in two isoforms, namely membrane (mRAGE) and solubl e (sRAGE). The physiological function of sRAGE is not yet fully understood . However, it has been sugg ested that sRAGE can act as a decoy receptor for RAGE ligands by blocking the binding of AGEs to RAGE. 27 1.9.3.1 Soluble RAGE and COPD The role of AGE and RAGE in both the airways and circulation has been studied in COPD. AGEs levels have shown to be significantly elevated in patients with COPD. [177] . Ferhani et al. also reported that smokers with COPD have significantly increased levels of RAGE, especially in their proximal and distal airways, compared to non -smokers and smokers without COPD. In contrast, studies have consistently shown that sRAGE levels are reduced in patients with COPD, in comparison to subjects without COPD [178-181]. Be sides, reduced sRAGE levels are directly associated with FEV 1 [179, 182 -184], and inversely associated with GOLD severity [181] . A weak association between lower sRAGE levels and FEV 1/FVC decline over 4 years has also been reported [178] . 1.9.3.2 Soluble RAGE and CV disease Studies on the associations between sRAGE and CV events are largely heterogeneous, with some studies showing inverse associations between sRAGE with CV disease [172, 185, 186] , while others are showing positive associations [187, 188] . The discrepancies across studies are attributed to different study designs and populations. A recent 3 -year longitudinal study, involving 933 patients with CV disease demonstrated that increased sRAGE was associated with a new CV event [189] . Furthermore, Nin et al. indicated that elevated sRAGE at baseline in subjects with type 1 diabetes (n= 339) free of CV disease was associated with increased risk of incident CV disease and all -cause mortality [170] . It is worth noting, though, that this association has also been shown in subjects without diabetes [190, 191] . Whether sRAGE is related to the CV status in patients with COPD remains unknown. 28 1.9.4 Microalbuminuria (MAB) Microalbuminuria (MAB) is defined as a moderate increase in urinary albumin (protein) above the normoalbuminuria range. The clinical threshold, which d efines MAB, is based on increased urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) of 2.5 mg/mmol in males and 3.5 mg/mmol in females. Increased UACR above the level of MAB is termed \"macroalbuminuria (UACR > 30 mg/mmol) \", and it is likely to be associated with bot h significant kidney damage and CV disease. 1.9.4.1 Microalbuminuria and CV disease Microalbuminuria is considered the hallmark of early kidney damage in individuals with diabetes [192] , independent of the overall measure of kidney function the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [193] . In addition, MAB is is an indicator of increased CV risk and a predictor for mortality in the general population [194-197]. MAB has also been related to arterial stiffness - a non -invasi ve physiological CV measure and a predictor of CV events (assessed by pulse wave velocity) - in individuals with diabetes, hypertension, and in subjects from the general population [198-200]. Furthermore, e ven a small increase in UACR within the normal limits is still associated with an increased risk of renal and CV disease [201] . A collaborative meta -analysis, involving 105,872 from general population indicated that an albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) of 1.1 mg/mmol (which is below the threshold of microalbuminuria ) was associated with a 20% amplified risk of all-cause mortality [202]. These findings highlight that MAB can be used in other disease groups associated with increased CV risk; one of which is COPD. 29 1.9.4.2 Microalbuminuria and COPD The limited number of studies which investigated the prevalence of MAB in patients with COPD have s hown that MAB is frequent in patients at times of exacerbations [203, 204] and at clinical stability; although the prevalence varies across studies [205- 207]. John et al. demonstrated that patients with COPD (n=52) at clinical stability had glomerular damage evidenced by increased UACR, and associated with aortic stiffness in patients with COPD, compared to smokers withou COPD (n=34) [208] from the Nord -Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study involving 3,129 participants also reported that patients with COPD and co nfirmed MAB (n=136) were at 54% increased risk of all - cause mortality, compared to patients with COPD without MAB (n=495) [209] . Of importance though, these results remained the same even after excluding CV disease at baseline. Microalbumin uria may be a potential marker to detect patients with COPD at increased CV risk and mortality; nevertheless, further investigations are needed. 30 1.10 Summary and aims of the studies in this thesis COPD presents a significant public health issue, with increased prevalence, morbidity, and mortality globally. COPD is associated with a number of comorbidities, including CV disease, cognitive impairment, dementia, and depression. These comorbidities have a considerable impact on disease management and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Increase the understanding of these comorbidities has important management implications for the multidisciplinary team who manage COPD across primary and secondary care. Although a significant proportion of patients with COPD suffer and die from CV disease, assessment of CV status is neither performed at diagnosis nor during follow - up. Simple, clinically relevant biomarkers may help identify patients at increased CV risk and assist in assessing and diagnosing patients in clinical settings. T wo possible biomarkers are investigated in this thesis, which might have a role in COPD related to prognostication/presence of CV comorbidities: 1) soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation -products (sRAGE) and 2) Microalbuminuria (MAB). Cognitive impa irment and dementia are common in COPD, yet there are considerable disparities in the report of their prevalence and incidence within the general COPD population. Further, the awareness of the increased burden of cognitive impairment and dementia in patien ts with COPD emphasises the need for more research. Also, depression is amongst the understudied key comorbidities in COPD, with serious impacts on health and prognosis. This introduction underlines important gaps in our understanding of COPD comorbiditie s and circulating biomarkers. Reviewing the existing literature has 31 enabled me to address these gaps by applying different methodologies from clinical and epidemiological perspectives. Thus, the specific aims of this thesis are: 1- To explore the potential ro le of sRAGE as a cardiovascular (CV) biomarker, in patients with COPD from the ERICA multicentre cohort of stable patients Chapter 2 ). 2- To determine the prevalence of microalbuminuria (MAB) and explore the role of MAB as a CV biomarker in patients with COPD at clinical stability, using data from the ERICA cohort (Chapter 3 ). 3- To report the prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia at the time of COPD diagnosis, compared to subjects without COPD, using primary care data within The Health Improvement Network (THIN) (Chapter 4 ). 4- To determine the incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia in patients with COPD, compared to subjects without COPD, using the THIN database (Chapter 4 ) 5- To determine the incidence of newly diagnosed depression or antidepressant prescription following a diagnosis of COPD and compare this to subjects without COPD using the THIN database (Chapter 5 ). 6- To evaluate the association between antidepressant prescription and respiratory -related morbidity (pneumonia and COPD exacerbations) in patients with COPD, using the THIN database (Chapter 6 ). 32 Chapter 2 Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (sRAGE) and Cardiorespiratory Physiology in COPD: the ERICA Study 33 2.1 INTRODUCTION It is well -established that patients with COPD are at increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease independent of age, gender , smoking and other common risk factors [87, 97]. Whilst CV disease is a known cause of morbidity [87] and mortality [73] in COPD, there is no systematic assessment of CV status in routine practice. Thus, a shift in patient care is needed to actively assess and screen CV risk in patients with COPD. Given the impact of CV disease on COPD, early detection is important. Although CV risk scores (which use algorithms to predict CV risk) have been developed to identify those at increased CV risk and to guide treatment [210, 211] , they do not include COPD, which gives a cause for concern that CV risk estimation may not be optimal in COPD [212] . Other methods for assessing the CV risk have been suggested. Aortic stiffness, determined by aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), is a non -invasive measure of vascular function and an independent marker for increased CV risk in both the general population and in patients with COPD [213-215]; however, it is not part of routine clinical practice. Carotid intima -media thickness (CIMT), a surrogate for subclinical atherosclerosis, is another subcli nical marker that has been associated with increased CV risk and mortality in COPD patients [216, 217] . However, the use of CIMT in clinical settings is limited, owing to its high cost an d technical nature. The identification of CV biomarkers using a fresh approach to aid the assessment of patients with increased CV risk is therefore of interest. Advanced Glycation End -products (AGEs), its receptor (RAGE) and soluble receptor (sRAGE) have been implicated in CV disease [218] . AGEs are markers of inflammatory and oxidative stress which can damage tissues (e.g. collagen and elastin) by modifying protein function and structure through cross -linking between molecules 34 or by binding with it receptor - RAGE [219] . sRAGE, which can be detected in blood samples, has predictive valu e for CV risk in other disease groups [170, 188, 189] and may, therefore, be applicable as a CV biomarker in COPD. The role of AGEs, RAGE (in the airways) , and sRAGE (in the circulating) in COPD has been considered [177, 179, 220] . Current associations of COPD with sRAGE [179, 181] . RAGE appears to have a pathogenic role in COPD whilst sRAGE appears to be protective. In a case -control study, Ferhani et al. demonstrated that patients with COPD (n = 30) have increased levels of RAGE, especially in their proximal and distal airways (bronchial tissues) , compared to never smokers (n = 20) and smokers without COPD (n = 20) [220] . On the other hand , sRAGE is found at lower levels in patients with COPD compared to those without COPD [178-180]. Smith et al. reported that the reduction in sRAGE levels in patients with COPD was independently associated with the degree of airflow obstruction, as defined by FEV 1 [179] . John et al. also reported direct associations between sRAGE and spirometric measures but not with aortic stiffness [221] ; however , the role of sRAGE as a CV biomarker in COPD has not been fully explored. Given the existing literature, it is hypothesised that sRAGE is independently related to measures of CV risk and lung function. The aim of this chapter is to evaluate whether sRAGE is associated with measures of both CV and lung functional status in patients with COPD in the 'Evaluating the Role of Inflammation in Chronic Airway disease' (ERI CA) cohort. 35 2.2 METHODS 2.2.1 Design The ERICA study is an observational, longitudinal study that was conducted at five centres across the UK (Nottingham, Cambridge, London, Liverpool and Cardiff) and supported by Innovate UK (formerly the Technology Strategy Board). This chapter provides an analysis of the baseline, cross -sectional data of one aspec t of the ERICA study. The patient recruitment and data collection were conducted by research personnel at the five universities prior to the commencement o f my PhD. 2.2.2 Subjects The ERICA study has been described in detail in the literature [222] . Briefly, the study included 729 patients with confirmed COPD (GOLD II -IV). All subjects provided written inform ed consent. The study was approved by the Cambridge South East Research Ethics Committee (REC: 11/EE/0357), and the research and development departments at each participating site [222] . The ERICA study was registered with the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio. The original ERICA study was powered based on tertiary analysis of two key variables: aortic pulse wave velocity and quadriceps maximal volitional contraction, with an estimated sample of 800 patients. Additional information can be found in the original pr otocol [222] . 2.2.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Patients were included if they were clinically diagnosed with COPD, had a post - bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1) of 80% of predicted values, had a baseline FEV 1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of <0.7, were 36 40 years of age or older, had a smoking history of 10 pack years, and were clinically stable (no hospitalisation or exacerbation) for at least four weeks prior to the study commencement. Participants were excluded if they were unable to provide written consent, were deficient in alpha -1 antitrypsin, had neurological or muscular disorders, were pregnant or were participating in a trial of an exper imental drug. Patients with other self -reported comorbidities, such as diabetes, cerebrovascular disease or ischaemic heart disease (IHD) were deliberately not excluded to be representative of clinical practice. 2.2.4 Measurements All study measurements were conducted at baseline over two visits. Details of the standardised procedures and outcome measures that were used in all participating centres are described elsewhere [222] . Measurements of interest that are relevant to this study are described in this chapter. Cardiovascular measure ments Blood Pressure Blood pressure (BP) was measured in the non -dominant arm in the supine position after 10 minutes of rest, and an average of the final two out of three measurements (separated by a 1 -minute interval) was recorded. A further recording wa s considered if the difference between the second and third readings was greater than 5mm Hg. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP) were calculated . Heart rate (HR) was also measured. The calculations of MAP and PP were conducted as follows: MAP = ((2 x diastolic blood pressure) + systolic blood pressure ) \u00f7 3 PP= systolic blood pressure - diastolic 37 Aortic pulse wave velocity Aortic (carotid -femoral) pulse wave velocity (PWV) was calculated via SphygmoCor\u00ae system (AtCor,West Ryde, Australia), using a piezoelectric tonometer placed over the artery and Electrocardiogram (ECG) gating as described previously [222] . Patients fasted for at least 4 hours and refrained from bronchodilators for at least 6 hours before the aortic PWV measurement. Carotid intima -media thickness High -resolution B -mode ultrasound imaging using a 7 -12 MHz linear probe [222] was applied to determine the carotid intimal medial thickness (CIMT) of the right and left common carotid arteries, measured at 1 cm from the carotid bulb. Measurements were obtained following 10 minutes of supine rest. Each artery had three 10 -second loops recordings. The highest values for the right and left CIMT were recorded, and the mean was used in the analysis. Image analysis was conducted using Vascular Tools 5 software (Medica l Imaging Application LLC, Coralville, USA). Anthropometry and lung function Height and weight were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Fat - free mass (FFM) was determined using bioelectric impedance (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). A he ight squared fat -free mass index (FFMI) was calculated. Post-bronchodilator spirometry was performed within 1 hour of administration of the patient's bronchodilator to determine the post -bronchodilator FEV FEV 1/FVC ratio. Blood parameters, bioche mistry and other measurements Venous blood samples were drawn from a peripheral vein by venepuncture after four hours of fasting and six hours of refraining from medications [222] . Plasma sRAGE 38 levels in the venous blood samples were determined using an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method in batched samples following storage at -80 degrees celsius . Cholesterol profiles were also o btained. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated [223] . Detailed histories, including comorbidities, medication and smoking, were recorded. Participants completed the COPD assessment tool (CAT) questionnaire [224] . 2.2.5 Statistics Data were analysed using Stata (version 15) statistical software. The results are presented as number (%) or arithmetic mean (SD) for categorical and conti nuous variables, respectively. The normality of the data was graphically assessed. Within group differences (e.g. smokers vs ex -smokers) in the mean (SD) sRAGE levels were analysed using parametric tests (independent sample t -test and one -way analysis of variance (ANOVA)). The primary analyses tested the associations between sRAGE and CV measures (aortic PWV and CIMT ), sRAGE with aortic PWV, CIMT , lung function measures and other factors was determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Multiple linear regression was performed to assess whether sRAGE was independently associated with aortic PWV , CIMT, and lung function measures, with adjustment for potential confounders. Confounders were considered as such if they changed the regression coefficient by 10%. Known CV risk factors (e.g. smoking) have also been considered for their confounding effects. All potential covariates were assessed in separate regression models. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. For assessing the association with aortic PWV and CIMT, adjustments were made for BMI, FEV 1% predicted, smoking status , smoking history, pulse pressure and self -reported comorbidities (diabetes, cerebrovascular disease or 39 IHD). For assessing the association of sRAGE with FEV 1% predicted, adjustments were made for BMI , smoking status, smoking history and the presence of self -reported comorbidities. A priori confounders such as age and gender were considered regardless of their confounding effects. These associations were assessed in all patients with COPD and then in those without self -reported comorbidities (diabetes, cerebrovascular disease or IHD). 40 2.3 RESULTS Out of a total of 746 p atients screened, 729 met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 677 subjects were included in this analysis, representing those with a sRAGE result ( Figure 2-1). The mean (SD) age of the study population was 67 (8) years, and there were more males (62%) than females. A third of the cohort were current smokers and the mean (SD) FEV 1% predicted was 52. 4% (16%). The population had levels of sRAGE 1056 (543.2) pg/ml, and CIMT of 0.78 (0.2) mm.

In all patients, there was a positive weak correlation between sRAGE and pulse pressure (r = 0.13; p < 0.001), and inverse correlations with heart rate (r = -0.11; p = 0.002) and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.09; p = 0.022). Similar correlations were also observed in the subset without comorbidities, as shown in Table 2-3. 44 Table 2-2.

Similarly, there was no statistical significant difference in sRAGE levels in those with diabetes (n = 79) and those without (n = 593 ; 1006 [475.7] vs. 1064 [553.2] pg/mL; p = 0.375). sRAGE levels were also compared in current (n = 208) and former smokers (n = 466). There was no statistical difference in the mean (SD) sRAGE levels in current = 0.428) and the smoking was not associated with sRAGE ( r= -0.05; p = 0.195). 46 Association of sRAGE with lung function measures The mean sRAGE levels for each of the GOLD stages of COPD (II, III, IV) are presented in Table 2-4. As seen , there was a progressive decrease in the sRAGE level as the GOLD severity increased ( p = 0.001). Even after adjusting for confounders, a more advanced COPD stage was associated with reduced sRAGE compared to less severe COPD, Table 2-5.

This was also seen in patients without self -reported comorbidities for FEV 1% predicted (r = 0.11; p = 0.14; n = 512) and FEV 1/FVC (r = 0.14; p = 0.001; n = 512).

In the subset of patients without either diabetes, cerebrovascular disease or ischaemic heart disease (n = 514), sRAGE remained independently associated with FEV pg/mL; Table 2-5). 47 Table 2-5.

However, neither aortic stiffness nor carotid intima -media thickness were associated with sRAGE, despite separate reports in the literature supporting the role of sRAGE in both COPD and CVD [172, 179] . Therefore, this study does not support the application of sRAGE as a clinical CV biomarker in patients with COPD. sRAGE and CV risk in COPD sRAGE has been studied in several other chronic inflammatory conditions, including CV disease, a common COPD comorbidity. However, the literature on the associations of sRAGE with CV events is inconsistent with studies showing both direct and inverse associations [186, 225] . These discrepancies are attributed to study designs (e.g., cross - sectional and longitudinal), study populations, and ethnic groups. However, increased sRAGE levels have been associated with CV events in some disease groups [188-190, 226]. Nin et al. demonstrated that elevated sRAGE at baseline in subjects with type 1 diabetes (n = 339) free of CV disease, followed for 12 years, was associated with an increased risk of CV disease and mortality [170] . Recently, a 3 -year longitudinal study of patients with proven CV disease (n = 933) demonstrated that elevated sRAGE was associated with new CV events [189] , highlighting the possibility that sRAGE may have different relationships in different disease states. It is well -established that patients with COPD are at increased CV risk. Current evidence shows that patients with COPD have increased aortic stiffness and CIMT relative to subjects without COPD. Contrary to expectations, the present study found no associations between sRAGE and subclinical vascular measures (aortic PWV or 49 CIMT), or with CV dis ease or diabetes. This suggests that sRAGE is unlikely to be a useful clinical marker to address the CV status in COPD, adding further evidence to the existing literature [221] . Although a study by John and colleagues [221] demonstrated a weak association between aortic stiffness (PWV) and skin AGEs (which are increased in COPD), they failed to find an association with sRAGE. Whereas some literature shows reduced sRAGE levels in patients with COPD [178, 179, 181] , the opposite appears to be true in CV disease [189] , which may explain the lack of association here. Furthermore, the finding that there was no difference in sRAGE levels in patients with and without IHD sugge sts that the reduced sRAGE consistently reported in COPD is unlikely to be attributed to the presence of CV disease, in line with the existing literature [179] . However, it is still important to consider the likelihood of the presence of subclinical CV disease in patients with COPD, which emphasises the n eed for a new approach for CV disease prognostication. sRAGE in patients with COPD and lung function There has been recent interest in the possible role of sRAGE in predicting disease progression and assisting in phenotyping in subjects with COPD [227] . Current research shows that sRAGE levels are lower in patients with stable COPD compa red to subjects without COPD [179, 181] . Smith et al. reported that patients with COPD (GOLD II or worse) have reduced sRAGE levels c ompared to healthy controls [179] . The mechanisms behind the reduced sRAGE levels that are consistently found in patients with COPD are currently unknown. Although this study did n ot have a comparator group (e.g., control), the mean (SD) sRAGE levels presented in this study are comparable to those reported from previous studies in patients with stable COPD [184, 221] . Gopal et sRAGE of 1042.41 (928.81) pg/mL in 50 patients with stable COPD (GOLD I -IV; n = 146) compared to 1477.66 (668.68) pg/mL in healthy controls (n=81) [184] . The finding that lower sRAGE is independently associated with lung function (FEV 1) is concordant with the current literature [179, 181] . This study also found an inverse association between sRAGE and COPD severity, extending the findings from a previous study [181] . Gopal et al. demonstrated that reduced sRAGE level in patients with COPD is related to lung function, and patients with COPD receiving long -term oxygen therapy have lower levels of sRAGE than patients not recei ving oxygen [184] . The longitudinal association of sRAGE and lung function has also been studied. Iwamoto et al. reported that reduced sRAGE was correlated with a greater lung function decline (FEV 1/FVC), particularly in smokers with COPD (n = 51) [178] . However, the correlations were mainly weak, with a marked variation in the sRAGE levels of patients with COPD and significant overlap between patients with COPD and non-COPD subjects. In contrast, recent data from the SUMMIT trial, including 1,673 subjec ts, showed no association between sRAGE at baseline and lung function decline over 3 months [228] , thus raising questions over the clinical utility of sRAGE in predicting the decline in lung function in patients with COPD. Although statistically significant associations are important for research, they do not necessarily mean that they are of clinical importance. For a single biom arker (e.g. sRAGE) to be used in clinical practice, it must provide important information beyond that obtained using everyday practice procedures. Therefore, a realistic interpretation of the role of sRAGE as a biomarker in COPD should be considered. This study found no difference in the sRAGE levels in current and ex -smokers; although the impact of smoking on sRAGE levels is not fully understood. However, it 51 is important to note that this study does not have a control group to determine whether smoking is the exact cause of reduced sRAGE commonly seen in patients with COPD. Nevertheless, in a study conducted by Smith and colleagues, sRAGE levels were similar in healthy subjects who ever smoked and in those who never smoked, and significantly greater than t hose in patients with COPD [179] . In the latter study, multip le linear regression analysis did not show that a previous smoking history was associated with sRAGE, suggesting other mechanisms to the reduced sRAGE in patients with COPD. Even in the studies that have shown reduced sRAGE among smokers (young control sub jects, old control subjects, and patients with COPD), it is likely that the reduction is a consequence of recent smoking (within 2 hours of a blood sample) instead of chronic exposure, as suggested by Pouwels and colleges [229] . The latter study also showed th at there was no difference in sRAGE levels between active and never smokers [229] . While some literature shows no difference in sRAGE levels between smokers and non -smokers [179, 230] showed lower sRAGE among smokers [178, 231] , which could, again, be attributed to recent smoking effect within the smoking gro ups. Thus, whether the reduced sRAGE commonly seen in patients with COPD is caused by smoking - per se, is to be determined . 2.4.1 Strengths and limitations of the study This study is one of a few to have examined the relationship between sRAGE and CV measures i n COPD. The strengths of this study are its well -defined inclusion criteria and analyses with adjustments for relevant physiological confounders and CV risk factors. In addition, this study included patients with co -existing comorbidities, making it repres entative of typical patients with COPD . However, the main limitation of this analysis is its cross -sectional nature with regards to the physiological markers; thus, it does not allow the determination of causality, despite follow -up being ongoing. 52 Another limitation is that some data for key measures were missing for some of the patients. However, these patients had similar characteristics to the rest of the patients who were included in the analyses, and the number of patients included in each analysis was also reported. It is worth mentioning that participants in the ERICA were allowed to perform some of the study measurements over either a single or two visits (within three months), meaning that some markers (including sRAGE) may have been measured on a separate day to aortic PWV and CIMT. 2.5 CONCLUSION In conclusion, this study has shown that sRAGE is associated with simple spirometric lung functio n but not with physiological CV measures, CV disease or diabetes in the ERICA cohort . This study does not support sRAGE being a clinical CV biomarker in patients with COPD. 53 Chapter 3 Microalbuminuria in Patients with COPD: A Cross -sectional Analysis from the ERICA Study 54 3.1 INTRODUCTION Although the current COPD guidelines recommend recognising CV disease in patients with COPD [1], there is no d etailed information on when and how to screen/assess for CV risk in patients with COPD. This considerable gap has been highlighted in the literature [157, 158] , reinforcing that CV risk should be assessed in COPD. The identification of easy -to-use CV markers in COPD is the subject of increased research interest. Such markers could, therefore, help identify patients at increased CV risk, understand CV disease pathophysiology, offer t argets for intervention and for that particular phenotype [232] . creatinine ratio (UACR), is regarded as an early inde x for microvascular impairment, reflecting vascular abnormalities of the glomeruli [233] . In other words, the kidneys act as a window to the vasculature. The presence of MAB is not only considered the hallmark of renal damage i n patients with diabetes [234] but has also been associated with CV events and mortality in sub jects from the general population [195, 235] . Therefore, it is proposed as a potential biomarker , which could identify patients with COPD at increased CV risk and may also be a target for CV risk reduction. Only a few studies in the literature have evaluated the prevalence of MAB in patients with COPD at clinical stability [205-209, 236] . These studies reported that MAB is common in patients with COPD, but the prevalence varies, depending on the study design, sample size [207] and study population age, which may affect UACR [206] , and whether the co -existence of COPD associated comorbidities (which are likely to affect the prevalence) was considered [209] . The presence of MAB has been associated with all -cause mortality in patients with COPD, compared to patients without MAB, 55 even after excluding patients with CV comorbidities [209] ; highlighting the significant impact of MAB on patients with COPD . The a ssociations of MAB with indices of macrovascular complications, such as aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and CIMT, have been reported in several conditions (e.g., diabetes and hypertension) and in the general population [198-200]. However, very few investigations have evaluated these relationships in patients with COPD. In a small cross -sectional study, John et al. showed that, compared with non -COPD subjects (n = 34), patients with COPD (n = 52) had increased UACR, being related to increased arterial stiffness, suggesting potential subclinical renal damage [208] . Nevertheless, the full extent of the relationship requires further investigation. Based on the existing literature, it is hypothesised that MAB, as measured by increased UACR, is prevalent in patients with COPD and is related to macrovascular indices (aortic PWV and CIMT), indicating subclinical glomerular damage and potential CV events. The objectives of this chapter are: 1- To determine and compare the prevalence of MAB in patients with COPD with and without co -existing COPD comorbidities (diabetes, cerebrovascular disease and ischaemic heart disease). 2- To assess the relationship of aortic stiffness and carot id intima -media thickness with urinary albumin creatinine ratio as an indicator for the presence of subclinical glomerular injury and CV events in all patients and then in those without comorbidities. 56 3.2 METHODS 3.2.1 Study design and participants This study used data obtained from the previously described ERICA cohort [222] (Chapter 2). The cross -sectional baseline data from four of the five participating centres were analysed. Data from patients with confirmed COPD recruited from the Nottingham, Cambridge, London and Liverpool study sites were included. Data from the Cardiff site was not available. All data collection w as performed by research personnel at the participating universities prior to my commencing this PhD. 3.2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria The inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in Chapter 2 (subsection 2.2.3 .). Briefly, patients with COPD (GOLD II -IV) confirmed by post -bronchodilator spirometry were included. Patients had to be clinically stable, which means that they experienced no exacerbation in the four weeks prior to recruitment. Patients with co - existing comorbidities were not excluded. 3.2.3 Measurements Details of all procedures and measurements are described elsewhere [222] . Variables related to this analysis are described below. Anthropometry measures and lung function The anthropom etry and lung function measures are described in detail in Chapter 2. In brief, BMI was calculated from height and weight. FFMI was calculated from a height squared . Post -bronchodilator spirometry was performed to determine FEV 1, FVC, and the FEV 1/FVC ratio. In addition, resting oxygen saturation was also measured. 57 Detailed biochemistry Spot urine samples were collected after 4 hours of fasting and stored for later determination of urinary albumin, protein and creatinine. All samples were analysed by N ottingham University Hospitals Trust clinical laboratories. From this, the urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) and protein obtained. Clinical microalbuminuria (MAB) thresholds of 2.5 mg/mmol for males and 3.5 mg/mmol for females were used. Macroalbuminuria was defined as UACR >30 mg/mmol. Venous blood samples were drawn after four hours of fasting and six hours of refraining from medications and analysed for urea, electrolytes, creatinine, total cholesterol, HDL choleste rol and triglycerides. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated [223] . Cardiovascular measurements Cardiovascular measurements were described in Chapter 2. Blood pressure was measured in the supine position after 10 minutes of rest. From this, MAP and PP wer e calculated . Aortic pulse wave velocity Aortic stiffness was assessed based on the aortic (carotid -femoral) pulse wave CIMT was measured using B -mode ultrasound with a 7 -12 MHz linear probe [222] . The largest values for the right and left bilateral CIMT were obtained, and the mean of the left and right values was used in the analysis. 58 Self-reported comorbidity Self-reported history of comorbidities, such as ischaemic heart disease, diabetes and cerebrovascular disease, was recorded. Other measurements Medication and smoking history were recorded. 3.2.4 Statistics The data are summarised as relative frequencies for categorical data and arithm etic mean (SD) for normally distributed continuous variables where appropriate. The normality of the data was assessed graphically. Non -normally distributed (e.g. positively skewed) continuous data (UACR, urine albumin, urine creatinine, urine protein and UPCR) were log 10 transformed in order to perform parametric analysis. The results of these variables were back -transformed to obtain the geometric mean (SD). In this study, the COPD patients were divided into two groups: those with and without comorbiditie s. Independent sample t -tests were performed to compare the mean differences between groups for continuous variables, and the chi -squared test was used for categorical variables. The prevalence of MAB in patients with and without comorbidities was calcula ted. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for MAB in patients with COPD with and without comorbidities, with adjustments for confounders. Confounders were considered as such if they changed the OR by 10% . The model was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking and MAP. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. 59 Multiple linear regression models were then applied to estimate the dependence of log 10 UACR on aortic PWV and CIMT, with adjustments for potential confounders. All known and expected confounders were assessed in separate regression models and then included in the final models if they altered the regression coefficient by 10%. Known risk fa ctors for increased CV risk have also been considered as potential confounders. For determining the association with aortic PWV, adjustments were made for age, sex, BMI, oxygen saturation, eGFR, MAP, smoking status and comorbidities. For the association wi th CIMT, adjustments were made for age, sex, BMI, MAP, smoking status, and comorbidities . These analyses were done in 1) all subjects (excluding those with macroalbuminuria), and then 2) in patients without any co-existing comorbidities (in order to minimi se the residual confounding of underlying disease). A priori confounders such as age and gender were considered regardless of their confounding effects. only complete cases were considered , and the number of observations included in each analysis was reported . Data management and analyses were done using Stata (version 15) statistical software. 3.2.4.1 Sensitivity analyses In the sensitivity analyses, clinical characteristics and haemodynamic and vascular measures (aortic PWV and CIMT) were compared in patients with clinical macroalbuminuria versus patients without macroalbuminuria. The sensitivity analyses were conducted as the clinical threshold of MAB is defined as UACR of 2.5 mg/mmol for males and 3.5 mg/mmol for females, a lthough a small increase in UACR within the normal limit is still associated with CV risk. 60 3.3 RESULTS Of the 729 patients in the ERICA cohort, 335 patients were included in the current study, representing those with urine samples and hence UACR data ( Figure 3-1). For information, patients studied at Cardiff did not have available urine. Three further patients were excluded because they had macroalbuminuria. Of the 332 remaining, 68 patients had at l east one comorbidity (diabetes, cerebrovascular disease or IHD). There were a total of 56 (17%) patients with a clinical threshold of MAB. Baseline characteristics for the whole study population are presented in Table 3-1. The baseline characteristics for the sample included in this analysis (n = 332) are similar to those for the subjects included in the ERICA cohort (n = 729) in terms of age, gender, BMI, lung function and haemodynamic measures. 61 Subjects included in the ERICA study (n = 729) Subjects with urine data (n = 335) Subjects included in the cross - sectional analysis (n = 332) Subjects excluded because they did not have urine data (n = 394) Subjects excluded because they had UACR > 30 mg/mmol (n = 3) Patients with comorbidities (n = 68) Patients without comorbidities (n = 264) Figure 3-1.

Of all patients, there were 30 patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min. Of those, there were 12 patients with comorbidities and 18 patients without c omorbidities. The geometric mean (SD) for UACR was significantly greater for patients with COPD and comorbidities (1.17 [3.5] mg/mmol) compared (0.76 [3.1] mg/mmol; p = 0.008). The difference remained significant following adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking and MAP (adjusted [ 95% CI] of 1.49 [ 1.09 - 2.06]; n = 320; p = 0.013; Table 3-3). The proportion of patients with clinical MAB was greater for those with COPD and comorbidities (n = 15/68; 22%) than for those without comorbidities (n = 41/264; 15.5%) but the difference di d not reach statistical significance (p = 0.200). Furthermore, the odds of having clinical MAB were not significantly different between patients with and without comorbidities (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.89; 95% CI 0.91 = 320; p = 0.083; Table 3-3). Haemodynamic measures were mostly similar between patients with and without comorbidities. The mean (SD) aortic PWV was greater in patients with comorbidities (10.94 than in those = 0.037).

Log 10 UACR was associated with both aortic PWV and CIMT following adjusting for age and sex in all subjects or in patients without comorbidities. However, in the fully adjusted models, neithe r aortic PWV nor CIMT were associated with log 10 UACR in all subjects or in patients without comorbidities ( Table 3-4). Table 3-4.

The demogra phics and clinical characteristics were largely similar between the two groups ( Table 3-6). The mean aortic PWV was significantly greater for patients with MAB (11.51 m/s) compared to patients without MAB (10.03 m/s; p = 0.019). Even following adjustment for confounders, the aortic PWV was 1.03 m/s higher in patients with MAB than pat ients without MAB (adjusted : 1.03 m/s; 95% CI: 0.12 1.96; n = 263; p = 0.038; Table 3-7). However, there was no difference in CIMT in patients with and without MAB. 69 Table 3-6.

The prevalence of microalbuminuria was also greater in patients with comorbidities, although this did not reach statistical significance. However, the associations of log 10 UACR with aortic PW V and CIMT were nullified, becoming non -statistically significant, after adjustments for known confounders. Only a few studies in the literature have reported the prevalence of MAB in COPD at clinical stability [205-207, 209, 236] . Current estimates of the prevalence of MAB in patients with COPD vary across studies, depending on sample size, population age, COPD severity and whether co -existing comorbidities were considered. For instance, Casanova et al. showed that the prevalence of MAB in patients with COPD was 24% compared with 6% in smokers without COPD [206] . However, age was markedly different between groups, which is likely to affect UACR and, consequently, the prevalence of MAB. The overall prevalence of MAB reported in this study at 17% (22% in patients with comorbidities) is sligh tly higher than the prevalence reported by Johan and colleagues at 13%, using similar inclusion criteria [208] . However, Johan's study included patients with GOLD I (unlike this study where patients with GOLD II and worse were included). This suggests that MAB is common in patients with COPD regardless of the co -existing comorbidities and level of severity. It wa s a little unexpected not to find an independent association for log 10 UACR with aortic PWV and CIMT, following adjustments aortic and CIMT are well -recognised markers increased CV risk in people with COPD [214- 217] and have also been associated with MAB in a n umber of conditions as well as in 72 the general population [198-200]. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the association between UACR and aortic PWV or CIMT in patients with COPD. In a previous study, John et al. reported an association between aortic PWV and UACR in patients with COPD, independe nt of common risk factors [208] . In their study, 29% (15/52) of patients with COPD had an eGFR < 60 ml/min (mean eGFR = 67 ml/min; mean age = 68 years), demonstrating that a large proportion of patients have renal dysfunction, and highlighting the increased risk of CV events [238] . In contrast, only 9% (30/332) of patients included in this study had an eGFR < 60 ml/min (mean = 84.7 ml/min; mean age = 68 years). In fact, there is no apparent reason that the eGFR noted by John et al. should be different from the eGFR reported in this study , as the age and clinical characteristics were largely similar, except that patients in the ERICA cohort were recruited across five centres (four included in this analysis), and that the cross - sectional measurements were performed over either one or two vis its. Another point to consider for the lack of associations between UACR and aortic PWV is that the aortic PWV reported in this study was generally lower than in previous literature [208] . John and colleagues reported a higher aortic PWV in patients with confirmed microalbuminuria (mean = 12.3 m/sec) compared to the aortic PWV of 11.5 m/sec found in this study [208] . Indeed, current evidence demonstrates that an increase of 1 m/sec in aortic PWV is associated with a 14% increase in total CV events and a 15% increase in CV mortality [239] . The differences in the patient characteristics across studies are likely to produce different results. It is also possible that the lack of associations reported here is beca use patients had a low UACR, and their haemodynamic measures were generally within the normal range (including aortic PWV and CIMT). In addition, given that a third of the study population were on blood 73 pressure medications, which are known to reduce aorti c stiffness and microalbuminuria [240] , may also explain the lack of associations. Despite the lack of associations between UACR and aortic PWV or CIMT, it is important to emphasise that the existence of MAB, by itself, is an indicator of increased CV risk and a predictor for mortality in the general population [194-197]. This study showed that MAB was prevalent even in p atients with COPD without known comorbidities. Romundstad et al. demonstrated that patients with COPD and MAB were at 54% increased risk of all-cause mortality (but not CV mortality) compared to patients without MAB [209] . Interestingly, the risk also remains (49% increased risk) even after excluding patients with self -reported CV disease [209] . Therefore, periodic MAB monitoring for potential renal impairment, CV events and mortality should be considered for patients with COPD. Current evidence suggests that albuminuria is a continuum and that kidney injury and CV disease can still occur even below the clinical threshold for microalbuminuria [241-243]. A collaborative meta -analysis showed albumin creatinine ratio of 1.1 mg/mmol (which is below the clinical threshold of MAB) was associated with a 20% increased risk of all -cause mortality in the general population, compared with a urine albumin creatinine ratio of 0.6 mg/mmol [202] . It has also been suggested that an increase in UACR of 3.5 mg/g ( 0.4 mg/mmol) is associated with a 6% increase in CV risk [197] . In this context, it is important to consider the minimal increase in UACR in patients with COPD. Indeed, this study showed that patients with self - reported comorbidities have a significantly higher UACR compared to those without (although both were within the normal range), highlighting the potential increased risk of subsequen t CV events and mortality. 74 In addition to the macrovascular abnormalities associated with increased arterial stiffness, it has also been linked to microvascular damage (e.g. renal dysfunction) [244, 245]. Studies have shown that elevated arterial stiffness is an independent risk factor for a renal function decline in patients with kidney disease [246, 247]. The present study demonstrated that patients with COPD and MAB (which is a marker of renal impa irment) had significantly higher aortic PWV compared to patients without MAB. Indeed, i ncreased aortic stiffness contributes to greater pressure and oscillation exposure in the renal system [248] and, since the kidneys are very sensitive, they are more likely to be affected by the excessive blood pressure [249] , potentially lea ding to injured glomerular capillaries. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the increase in aortic stiffness mechanistically leads to the development of MAB. Nevertheless, the clinical prognostic implications of the microvascular state sho uld be considered in COPD management . The prevalence of patients with COPD having renal impairment has been highlighted in the literature [250-254]. Incalzi et al. showed that patients with COPD have increased prevalence of chronic renal failure (both overt and concealed), defined as (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to age -matched subjects without COPD [250] . However, identifying renal impairment based on eGFR alone is likely to underestimate the true prevalence as its role in the elderly is still under debate [255] . This does not imply that eGFR should not be taken into consideration when assessing renal function, but rather it should be interpre ted with caution. M icroalbuminuria usually occurs before any loss of GFR. In addition, it is considered the most important indicator for renal impairment and has also been associated with worse clinical outcomes, independent of eGFR [193, 195, 235, 256] . 75 3.4.1 Clinical implications Increasing evidence suggests that COPD and CV disease often co -exist [97]. Current COPD guidelines recognise CV disease as one of the most common comorbidities in patients with COPD and suggest that it should be routinely assessed and managed [1]. Although no specific recommendations have been made on how to do so, healthcare professionals are encouraged to manage comorbidities (C V disease in this instance) as if the patients do not have COPD. This, however, implies recognising, diagnosing and assessing the co -existing comorbidity in the first place. For instance, if kidney function is influenced by changes in the haemodynamic stat us or vice versa, it is therefore important to assess the interplay between micro - and macro -vascular states in patients with COPD. The utilisation of biological markers not only helps identify patients at increased CV risk but also provides a route for ta rgeted therapy for that particular phenotype. Indeed, MAB is considered as a therapeutic target in the clinical management of patients with diabetes and hypertension [257, 258] . Thus, MAB could provide an opportunity for early and appropriate interventions before the development of a major CV disease in patients with COPD. 3.4.2 Strengths and limitations The main strengths of this study are its well -defined inclusion criteria and adjustments for known physiological confounders. Additionally, this study included patients with confirmed COPD with c o-existing comorbidities, such as diabetes, cerebrovascular disease and ischaemic heart disease, a different approach that has not been widely used in previous studies. It is thus representative of typical patients with COPD seen in clinical settings. Howe ver, the current study has some limitations. First, the cross -76 sectional nature of the study did not allow assessment for any causality. Second, the patients with COPD and comorbidities were significantly older than the patients without comorbidities, which could explain the higher UACR observed in patients with comorbidities. However, age and gender were adjusted for in the multivariable analysis and UACR was still higher. Another limitation is that some key measures were missing for some of the patients, w hich may lead to potential bias, loss of power and therefore an underestimation to the examined associations. It is acknowledged that missing data is a common issue in epidemiological research and should therefore be dealt with appropriately. It is neverth eless important to mention that the complete case analysis approach used in this chapter was appropriate, as the complete cases (patients included in these analyses) have similar characteristics to those who were missing (patients included in the ERICA coh ort). In addition, only data (urine samples) from 4 of the 5 recruiting centres for ERICA were available for this analysis and thus included in this chapter. This study has also reported the number of observations included in each analysis and carried a nu mber of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the main findings. 3.5 CONCLUSION Although there is evidence of increased UACR in patients with co -existing comorbidities, UACR was not found to be strongly associated with aortic stiffness or carotid intima -media thickness in the ERICA cohort. However, microalbuminuria was still prevalent in all patients with COPD, highlighting a potential risk of sub - glomerular damage and subsequent CV events. Therefore, screening for MAB and early interventio n to optimise the CV status should be considered. 77 Chapter 4 Dementia and Cognitive Impairment in Patients with COPD: A UK Population -based Study 78 4.1 INTRODUCTION Cognitive impairment contributes to greater functional disability [259, 260] , increased need for care services [119] , lower adherence to complex medication regimens [261], difficulties in managing chronic diseases [262] , worse clinical outcomes [263] and predicts mortality in certain COPD populations [264] . Potential causes contributing to impaired cognitive state in patients with COPD are likely multiple and include ageing, co-existent cardiovascular (CV) disease, smoking, hypoxemia and hypercapnia [106] Despite an between cognitive impairment and COPD [129, 265, 266] , the prevalence of cognitive impairment in COPD remains uncertain . Cognitive impairment is estimated to affect between 4% to 61% of patients with COPD [262, 267], depending on the study populations and assessment methods [129, 268] . However, it remains less clear how this compares to age - and sex-matched subjects without COPD. Current literature also suggests that the prevalence increase in line with severity of COPD, although severity measures have not been consistent across studies [129, 268] . The existing studies investigating the prevalence of cognitive impairment in COPD are limited by methodological differences, such as study design, population age, inadequate matching group, and short follow -up [269-272]. Thus, the estim ated prevalence is caveated. Cognitive impairment represents a spectrum leading to dementia in a proportion of patients [122] ; however, not all patients with confirmed cognitive impairment will eventually progress to dementia . Current literature on the association between COPD and dementia are generally scarce. However, it is suggested that COPD increases the risk of cognitive impairment and subsequent dementia [136, 138] . Although these prior studies provide some information on the relationship between COPD and dementia, they utilised a self -reported history of COPD or had a short foll ow-up time. Current 79 evidence suggests that patients with COPD and cognitive impairment are at increased risk of developing dementia [271] . Identifying the proportion of patients with COPD at increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia is important in understanding the broader clinical spectrum of COPD and in providing services that are structured to meet patie nt needs. The association between COPD and either cognitive impairment or dementia remains less clear. The hypothesises of this chapter are 1) patients with COPD would have a greater proportion of coded cognitive impairment and dementia at the time of CO PD diagnosis /index date compared to subjects without COPD, and 2) they are at increased risk of incident cognitive impairment and dementia following COPD diagnosis /index date. The aims of this chapter are twofold: 1- To report the prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia at the time of COPD diagnosis in patients with COPD and matched subjects without COPD. 2- To determine the incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia following a diagnosis of COPD in patients with COPD and matched subje cts without COPD. 80 4.2 METHODS 4.2.1 Study design Aim 1: A case -control study was used to describe and report the prevalence of cognitive impairment at the time of COPD diagnosis. A similar study design was also conducted to report the prevalence of dementia. Aim 2: A matched cohort study was conducted to determine the incidence of cognitive impairment following COPD diagnosis/ index date in patients with COPD and subjects without COPD. The incidence of dementia was also determined using the same study design. 4.2.2 Data source The cohort information was obtained using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) . See subsection 4.2.2.1 . 4.2.2.1 Description of The Health Improvement Network (THIN) The THIN is a large , representative UK database , which contains longi tudinal fully anonymised patient s' ele ctronic health records (>12 million people ) from over 550 general practices (GPs) and covering more than 6% of the UK population , using Vision computer software [273] . The data collection in THIN started in January 2003 . This was after the partnership between the Epidemiology and Pharmacology Information Core (EPIC) ( which provides the primary care data) and In Practice Systems ( which develope d the software used in GP practices). A significant proportion of people whose records are recorded within THIN are sti ll actively contributing data. Historical data may also be present for those who have died or left the GP practice. 81 All information obtained from primary care visits to a GP, or any other healthcare professional s at practices participating in THIN is recorded in the database. Data are stored in several files (patient, medical, therapy, additional health details , and postcode variable indicator ), created by individual practice, and linked to each other by a unique identifier (patient, consultation, or staff) . Patients' data within THIN include demographics, medications, past medical history, diagnostic results, and lifestyle characteristics [274] . Clinical Information within THIN is recorded using hierarchical READ codes , and medication information is re corded using drug codes . The recruitment of practices in THIN is done through the partnership between the two companies (EPIC and I n practice Systems ). Participating practices in THIN are paid for the utilisation of their data. It is important to note that practices must meet minimum quality standards for data recording , sugg ested by EPIC, in order to join THIN. Such standards are subject to routine adjustments to meet the changes in NHS requirement for data collection and storage. Failure to meet the required quality of record ings can result in a suspension of that practice until problems are resolved. If problems persist, that practice may be excluded from THIN. The version of the THIN data used in this thesis was provided by the University of Nottingham, Division Respiratory medicine and Division of epidemiology and public health. The initial data preparation - pulling the raw data from THIN - which contains records of all patients with CO PD and subjects without COPD , was organised by Dr. Gibson prior to commencing this PhD. The candidate performed subsequent data extractions and p erfor med all data analyses. 82 4.2.3 Ethical approval Ethical approval for this study was provided by an independent Scientific Review Committee (SRC), reference number - 17THIN095. 4.2.4 Study population The index population comprised individuals aged 40 years with a first-time COPD diagnosis ( defined based READ codes; appendi x 9-2) from 1st April 2006 to 31st December 2015, with 1 year of record prior to the diagnosis of COP D. Up to four comparison subjects without a diagnosis of COPD were matched for each patient with COPD by age, gender and GP practice. The beginning of the study period (01 -04- 2006) was chosen based on the initial introduction of dementia coding to the quality and outcomes framework ( QOF) [275] . 4.2.5 Outcome definitions 1- Cognitive impairment was defined based on READ codes. In this study, the term cognitive impairment does not include a diagnosis of dementia (READ coded) , as cognitive impairment does not necessarily lead to a diagnosis of dementia. 2- A diagnosis of dementia was defined based on READ codes. An expert geriatrician ( Prof. Adam Gordon ) was consulted to help identify all available Read codes related to dementia. An inclusive approach was taken where any potentially relevant diagnosis was considered. ( Read codes are available in appendices 9 -3 & 9 -4). 3- Either cognitive impairment or dementia was also considered as a separate outcome (see subsection 4.2.7.1 ). In the absence of the systematic assessment in GP practice, these terms may have been used synonymously. It is also 83 important to note that anyone with a diagnosis of dementia is, by definition, cognitively impaired. Therefore, it was important to consid er such an outcome. 4.2.6 Outcome measures and follow -up Prevalence The prevalence of cognitive impairment was defined as the first of any READ code recorded prior to, at, or 6 months after the index date. This was determined in patients with COPD and subjects without COPD. The prevalence of coded dementia was similarly determined. Incidence 1- Cognitive impairment: subjects with a code of cognitive impairment and dementia recorded prior to, at, or 6 months after the index date were excluded. Subjects were then followed -up from 6 months after the index date until either they received a cognitive impairment Read code (first READ code), left the GP practice, died or reached the end of the follow -up (31/12/2015), whichever came first. 2- Dementia: subjects with a former diagnosis of dementia recorded prior to, at, or 6 months after the index were excluded from analyses related to dementia incidence. Incident dementia was defined as the first READ coded recorded from 6 months after the index date. 84 Explanatory variables and potential confounders A number of explanatory variables were identified at baseline. Definition of variables Age at diagnosis was determined and categorised as follows: < 60, 60 -69, 70 - 79, and 80 years and older. Body mass index (BMI) was determined within 2 years (before and after) of index date. BMI consisted of documented and computed values. Where there was no documented BMI, where possible, BMI was calculated from the height and weight records. The BMI was then categorised as follows: (underweight data were under \"no records\". The closest record of MRC dyspnoea score [37], 1 year either side of the index date, was obtained. The MRC score was categorized as follows: 1, 2, 3 or 4 -5. A further category of \"no records\" was then added for any subject without available data. For smoking, the most recent record to COPD diagnosis, whether prior or after the index date, was used. The smoking status was categorized into 3 main categories: never smoked, ex -smoker, and current smoker. A 4th category \"unknown \" was then added for subjects without available smoking data. Individuals who were initially recorded as \"current smoker\" then \"never smoked\" were recorded as Comorbidity Index (CCI) [276, 277] , excluding dementia and cardiovascular (CV) disease (congestive heart failure, ischemic heart 85 disease, and peripheral vascular disease), was determined before or at the index date. A modified CCI was categorised as follows: 0 -1, 2, 3, and 4. CCI is an approach to classif y comorbid conditions, where each comorbidity is assigned to score ( from 1 to 6). (Appendix 9 -7). For alcohol, the most recent record to COPD diagnosis was determined, whether prior to or at the index date. Alcohol status was categorised into three main groups as follows: lifelong teetotaller, ex -drinker, and current drinker. Subjects with no available data were categorised under \"no records\". Townsend score (a measurement of social cla ss) [278] was determined before or at the index date. It was classified as follows: 1 (least deprived), 2, 3, 4, and 5 (most deprived). The Townsend score combines information from d ifferent categories , such as unemployment, car ownership, homeownership, and overcrowding. Having been prescribed at least one prescription of corticosteroids within one year (prior and after) of the index date was considered as a risk factor. Individua l comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease were determined prior to, at, or 6 months after the index date. (Append ices 9-9 & 9-10). 86 4.2.7 Statistical analysis Aim 1: The prevalence of cognitive impairment was obtained by calculating the proportion of individuals who had coded cognitive impairment within the COPD and without COPD population before, at, or 6 months within the index date. McNemar test was used to compare categorical data, including the prevalence of cognitive impairment between groups. A p<0.05 was considered significant. Multivariable c onditional logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for the prevalence of cognitive impairment for both groups (patients with COPD and subjects without COPD). The OR of the prevalence of cognitive impairment was assessed in a multiple conditional logistic regression to adjust for accepted confou nders. Confounders were considered in the final model if they independently changed the OR for cognitive impairment by 5%. All covariates were assessed in separate regression models. Aim 2: Those with a coded cognitive impairment and/or coded dementia at baseline (prior, at, or within 6 months after the index date) were excluded from analysis related to cognitive impairment incidence. The incidence of cognitive impairment was defined as the time from 6 months after the index date to the diagnosis of cog nitive impairment, leaving the GP clinic, death, or end of the follow up (31/12/2015), whichever comes first. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for cognitive impairment in patients with COPD and matched subjects. Survival analysis and Kaplan -Meier plots were performed to compare the incidence of cognitive impai rment between patients with COPD and subjects without COPD. Potential confounders as above were considered in the final model (for each outcome) if they changed the HR by 5% or more . Each confounder was assessed in a sperate model 87 (one at a time), with removing the existing potential confounder before adding the next one. Potential confounders include BMI, MRC dyspnoea score, smoking status, modified CCI, Townsend score, corticosteroi d prescription, and CV disease . The assumption of cox regression model was checked using Schoenfeld residuals . The same analyses were then conduc ted for dementia in place of cognitive impairment in subjects without a former code of dementia. Data manag ement and statistical analyses were conducted using STATA version 15.0 software . 4.2.7.1 Sensitivity analyses Several sensitivity analyses were carried. 1- The prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment were compared within patients with COPD based on MRC dyspnoea score (1 -3 vs 4 -5). Similarly, analysis for dementia was conducted in place of cognitive impairment. 2- The prevalence and incidence of coded va scular dementia were determined in patients with COPD and subjects without COPD. 3- A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the difference in the prevalence and incidence of dementia in patients with COPD and their matched subjects without COPD at two different incident COPD diagnosis timeframes: 1) 01 -01-2004 (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [279] COPD guideline published in 2004 ) to 31 -12-2015 and 2) 01 -04-2012 (the enhancement of dementia coding in QOF [280] ) to 31 -12-2015 in individuals who are 65 years and older. 4- The cumulative prevalence of either cognitive impairment/dementia or both were determined in patients with COP D and subjects without COPD from 01 - 04-2006 onwards to 31 -12-2015. 88 5- The incidence of either cognitive impairment or dementia was also determined in patients with COPD and subjects without COPD, excluding subjects with a former code of cognitive impairment a nd dementia. 89 4.3 RESULTS A total of 65,068 patients with COPD and 249,166 subjects without COPD were included in the analyses (Figure 4-1). The baseline characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 4-1. There were more males than females (53% vs 47%). The mean (SD) at diagnosis was 65 (10.9) years. The median follow -up period was 4.3 years across both groups. C o-morbidities were greater in p atients with COPD compared to subjects without COPD. Figure 4. 1.

The proportion of cognitive impairment without a diagnosis of dementia was significantly greater for patients with COPD (n= 2,629; 4. 1%) than for subjects without COPD (n=7,883; 3. 2%), p<0.001. Cognitive impairment remained more prevalent in patients with COPD after adjustment for age, gender, and GP practice (OR: 1.32 (95% CI: 1.26 to 1.39, p<0.001); Table 4-2). This association was then diminished by the effect of smoking, CV disease, and modified CCI in the fully adjusted model (adjusted OR [aOR]: 0.97 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.09, p=0.629), Table 4-2). 93 Table 4-2.

The prevalence of dementia was less frequently recorded in patients with COPD , compared to subjects without A sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of vascular dementia at index d ate in patients with COPD and subjects without COPD. There were less patients with COPD with vascular dementia compared to subjects without COPD vs n=214 (0.33%); the prevalence of vascular dement ia was not different between patients with COPD without p=0.663; Table 4-4). The difference in the prevalence of dementia was assessed at two incident COPD diagnosis timeframes: 1) 01 -01-2004 to 31 -12-2015, and 2) 01 -04-2012 to 31 -12- 2015. In the first timeframe (2004 -2015), the prevalence of coded dementia was lower in patients wi th COPD (n=80,874) compared to subjects 0.59 to 0.80; P<0.001). In older subjects ( 65 years old) included from 2012 onwards to 2015, the prevalence of coded dementia was not statistically different between pat ients with COPD patients (n=12,932) and subjects 4-3.

The prevalence of cognitive impairment at COPD diagnosis in patients with MRC score 4 -5 remained significantly greater, even after ad justment for 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.28; p=0. 034). In the fully adjusted models, there was a significantly greater prevalence of dementia (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.75; p=0.018), and either cognitive impairment or dementia (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.31; p=0.008) in patients with an MRC score of 4-5 compared with those with an MRC score 1 -3 (Table 4-7). 101 Table 4-7.

Of patients with COPD, 5,059 (8.3%) had a recorded incidence of cogn itive impairment (without a diagnosis of dementia) compared to 14,514 (6.4%) subjects without COPD, p<0.001. The incidence rate of cognitive impairment in patients with COPD was 23.1 per 1,000 person -years (95% CI: 22.4 to 23.4) compared to 16.3 per 1,00 0 person -years (95% CI: 16.1 to 16.4) in subjects without COPD. The time to first recorded incidence of cognitive impairment was significantly shorter in patients with COPD compared to non-COPD subjects, P<0.001, Figure 4-2. In the fully adjusted model, patients with COPD, compared with subjects without COPD, were significantly more likely to have an incident diagnosis of cognitive impairment (adjusted HR [aHR]: 1.17 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.23); p<0.00 1; Table 4-8). 103 Figure 4-2.

Of patients with COPD, 1,041 (1.6%) were recorded with incident dementia compared to 4,158 (1.7%) subjects without COPD, p=0.099. The incidence rate was 4.4 per 1,000 person -years for patients with COPD and subjects without COPD. The incidence of dementia was not statistically different between patients with COPD and subjects without COPD following adjustments for age, gender , and GP practice (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.09; p=0.665). Following adjustments for confounders, the incidence of coded dementia in patients with COPD was less than in non -COPD Table 4-9). Similar proportions of patients in both groups with cognitive impairment developed dementia (around 7.8%). In patients with COPD, those with diagnosed cognitive impairment were nearly nine times more likely to develop dementia than those without cognitive impairment (aHR: 8.85; 95% CI: 7.42 -10.54). A similar finding was also observed in subjects without COPD. There were more patients with COPD with coded vascular dementia (n=386; 0.6%) ce rate of vascular dementia in patients with COPD was 1.6 per 1,000 person -years (95% CI: 1.5 to 1.8) compared to 1.3 per 1,000 person -years (95% CI: 1.2 to 1.4) in subjects without COPD. The incidence of vascular dementia was greater in patients with COP D than non-COPD subjects matched for age, gender and GP (HR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.14 -1.46). 106 In the fully this association was diminished (aHR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.89 - 1.33; p = 0.388; Table 4-10). A sensitivity analysis was conducted in subjects who were identified from 2004 until 2015. The incidence of dementia was less frequently coded in patients with COPD compared to subjects without COPD (aHR 0.76; 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.81; p<0.001). In contrast, subjects who were older than 65 years with an incident diagnosis of COPD from 01 -04-2012 to 31 -12-2015 did not show any differences even after adjusting for the same confounders (aHR 1.11; 95% CI: 4-9.

This has resulted in a total of 61,569 patients with COPD and 227,995 subjects without COPD. Demographics and clinical characteristics remained similar. There were more patients with COPD with either coded cognitive impairment or dementia (n=5,971; 9.7%) compared to subjects without COPD (n=17,961; 7.3%), p<0.001. The incidence rate of either cognitive impairment or dementia in patients with COPD was 27.2 per 1,000 person -years (95% CI: -20.7) in subjects without COPD.

After excluding subjects with former coded cognitive impairment and/or dementia, there were 36,246 patients with MRC score 1 -3 and 4,608 with MRC score 4 -5. The incidence of cognitive impairment was greater in p atients with MRC dyspnoea score 4 -5 (n=444; 9.6%) score 1 (n=3,146; 8.7%), p<0.031. Following COPD diagnosis, patients with MRC score 4 -5 were 11% more likely to have a recorded incidence of cognitive impairment (aHR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02 - 1.22; p=0.030) following adjustment for age, gender , and socioeconomic class. Further adjustments have diminished the relationship (Table 4-12). There were 37,942 patients with MRC score 1 -3, and 4,932 patients with MRC score 4-5 included in the dementia analysis. Patients with MRC score 4 -5 were 27% more likely to have a recorded incidence of dementia compared to patients with MRC score 1-3 Table 4-12.

The incidence of cognitive impairment was significantly greater in patients with COPD. In contrast, the prevalence and incidence of coded dementia were significantly less in patient s with COPD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate this in patients with COPD using UK electronic GP records. Prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment in COPD Although a large body of literature has investigated the prevalence of cognitive impairment in COPD, there is no consensus on the overall prevalence. Cognitive impairment is present in 4% of older patients (65 years old) with mild COPD [262] and up to 61% in patients with COPD and s evere hypoxemia [267] . This wide variation in the current estimates is attributed to the severity of COPD [268] , whether cognitive impairment was systematically assessed or self -reported, and the use of different diagnostic criteria and tools for cognitive impairment [129] . In addition, studies had different threshold definitions for cognitive impairment, even when using the same cognitive assessment tool . A unique aspect of this study is that it reported the prevale nce of cognitive impairment at the time of COPD diagnosis, and included all patients with COPD, which therefore, making it a representative sample to the general populations of COPD. However, the proportion of coded cognitive impairment at COPD diagnosis in the GP electronic health records presented in this study (4 .1%) was far lower than the proportion in clinical studies at 50% when cognitive impairment 114 was systematically assessed [281, 282] . This gives a cause for concern of subclinical underdiagnosed cognitive impairme nt, which may lead to a delayed intervention and consequently, a missed opportunity to alleviate the negative effect s of cognitive impairment on this vulnerable population. Current evidence suggests that patients with COPD are at amplified risk of cognitive impairment and even dementia. The finding that patients with COPD had a higher incidence of cognitive impairment is consistent with prior literature [136, 137, 283] . A previous study from Finland showed that a diagnosis of COPD in midlife was associated with 85% increased risk of mild cognitive impairment/dementia in later life [136] . However, the latter study incorporated self -reported COPD as opposed to a COPD diagnosis that is objectively confirmed. The present study also found that patients with COPD and cognitive impairment were at a greater risk of dementia compared with patients with COPD without cognitive impairment. In this context, establishing accurate estimates of the proportion of patients with C OPD and cognitive impairment could help to further understand the clinical relevance of cognitive decline in patients with COPD and identify a high -risk group. This is also important to allow for appropriate therapeutic interventions and changes in lifesty le, which could prevent or delay the cognitive deterioration to clinical dementia. The prevalence of c ognitive impairment has been associated with COPD severity. Grant et al. showed that the prevalence of cognitive impairment was 27% in patients with mild hypoxemia compared to 62% in patients with severe hypoxemia [267] . A recent systemati c review showed that the relationship between cognitive impairment and COPD severity (as measured by GOLD and blood gases) is mainly seen in patients with severe and very severe COPD [268] . In a longitudinal study, Hung et al. reported that patients with severe COPD (defined by oxygen use and limited physical activity) 115 were associated with a rapid cognitive decline [271] , highlighting the potential increased risk of subsequent dementia. Using MRC dyspnoea score as a severity measure [37], this study is consistent that those with more breathlessness were at greater ri sk of cognitive impairment and dementia compared to those with a better MRC score. This finding has important clinical implications, as cognitive impairment and dementia interfere with patient's ability to adhere to their medications and manage their own d isease [261, 284] , which may consequently lead to worse health outcomes [264] . A major pitfall in studying the association of COPD severity with cognitive impairment and dementia is the possibility of misdiagnosis of COPD. To explain, patients with cognitive impairment/dementia may not be able to follow in structions to perform spirometry, which may lead to erroneous estimation to lung function [269] ; and consequently a misdiagnosis of COPD and its severity. This highlights the challenge in accurately assessing the relationship between cognitive impairment and COPD sev erity, and partly accounts for the observed discrepancies in the prevalence s of cognitive impairment in COPD across study populations (e.g. severe and very severe airflow obstruction). Prevalence and Incidence of Dementia in COPD There is growing evidence linking cognitive impairment with COPD . Nevertheless, the literature on dementia in COPD is lacking, and prior studies are also limited by study population [138] , self -reported assessment of COPD [136] , undefined f ollow -up 138] , and inadequate matching grou p [135] . The most surprising finding in this study is that the prevalence and incidence of dementia were significantly lower in patients with COPD. Although at first glance , these findings 116 suggest that patients with COPD may be at lower risk of dementia, there is a likeliho od that a dementia diagnosis in patients with COPD has been unintentionally missed. It is likely that COPD symptoms may predominate and be the central focus during GP visits. In addition, doctors may find limited explanatory value in attaching a label of dementia to cognitive impairment in the context of multi -system functional decline as COPD progresses. It is, however, possible that treatment opportunities and, in many jurisdictions, the opportunity to access dementia -specific services are being missed, ultimately to the detriment of the patient. Therefore, the formalisation of dementia might not be addressed accordingly. These findings reinforce the need for a systematic assessment of the cognitive state of patients with COPD during routine clinical follo w up. In this study, the cumulative prevalence and incidence of either cognitive impairment or dementia have been investigated as a separate outcome. This is because the term \"cognitive impairment\" varies across studies. For instance, Rusanen et al. define \"cognitive impairment\" as the presence of either mild cognitive impairment or dementia [136] . In contrast, a recent systematic review has investigated the prevalence of cognitive impairment, by excluding any study that reported a diagnosis of dementia [129] . Since the analyses of this chapter are based on primary care data (GP records), where comprehensive cognitive assessment may not be performed, recording of these conditions (cognitive impairment and dementia) in the medical records may vary across practices. This means that dementia diagnosis may have been coded as cognitive impairment and vice versa. Thus, it was important to investigate whether this - coding limitations - might have i nfluenced the findings. This study found that patients with COPD were at increased incident risk of either cognitive states. However, 117 a clear distinction between these cognitive states can only be confirmed by performing a systematic assessment . Analysis f rom the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) study (n=2,000) showed that a self -reported diagnosis of COPD in later life ( 65 years) was inversely related, although not significant, to mild cognitive impairment/dementia [136] . The findings of the latter study were attributed to survival bias as opposed to the effect of COPD. As COPD and cognitive impairment are both associated with an increased risk of death in their own, it is reasonable to assume that the risk of death will be even greater if both conditions coexist. Indeed, cognitive impairment increases the risk of mortality in certain COPD populations [264] . Furthermore, dementia is a progressive condition and may take decades to develop. In the co -existence of COPD with cognitive impairment, there is a possibil ity that patients may die before they even receive a diagnosis of dementia. Patients with COPD usually present with a smoking history and have a wide range of comorbidities, one of which is CV disease . As expected, in this study, the proportions of current smoking and CV disease were greater in patients with COPD , and these confounders attenuated the association with vascular dementia. Because COPD and CV comorbidities share similar risk factors and patients with COPD are more likely to be predisposed to cardiovascular events [97], it is, therefore, difficult to determine whether COPD is associated with increased risk of vascular dementia. Although it is unlikely for CV comorbidities or smoking per se to account for vascular dementia in COPD, it is important to encourage healthcare p rofessionals to identify and manage any modifiable risk factors. 118 4.4.1 Clinical Implications Both COPD and dementia are public health threats with severe impacts on health and prognosis. Therefore, prevention and treatment for both conditions are of clin ical importance. The findings of the current study showed that COPD is associated with increased risk of incident cognitive impairment or dementia. This association was independent of age, gender, and other risk factors, suggesting that COPD may causally be associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment, and even dementia. Recent data from the ARIC study demonstrated that reduced lung function (COPD pattern) was associated with greater risk of either mild cognitive impairment or dementia [137]; in agreement with findin gs of the current study. It is important to mention that cognitive impairment and dementia in patients with COPD are not only caused - per se- by COPD alone, but rather, it is due to multiple factors. To explain, CV risk and smoking, which are highly preva lent in patients with COPD and contribute to the increased risk of dementia, could play an important role in the increased risk of dementia in COPD. Thus, it is crucial to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation, as it improves lung function and redu ces the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. In addition, the presence of multiple comorbidities, which is also common in patients with COPD, could also magnify the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in those with COPD. Proper management of t hese comorbidities with appropriate interventions could reduce the risk . The increased understanding of the relationships between COPD with cognitive impairment and dementia has important clinical implications. First, cognitive impairment and dementia have a considerabl e impact on the clinical management of COPD. Cognitively impaired patients have poor adherence to their medications regimens, incorrect use of inhaler techniques [261] , which could result in an increased 119 risk of exacerbation and worse health outcomes [285] . Cognitive impairment and dementia also affect the self -management skills in patients with COPD. Indeed, patients with COPD need to adopt healthy lifestyles (e.g. stop smoking, healthy diet, and be physically active). However, these behavioural changes require healthy cognitive function, which may be limited or even compl etely impaired in patients with dementia. The co -existence of cognitive impairment in patients with COPD also interfere with participation and adherence to pulmonary rehabilitation programs [125] . In contrast, patients with dementia may not even be referred to a PR program in the first place. 4.4.2 Strengths and limitations A strength of this study is that using electronic primary care health records provides a representative sample for the general UK COPD population [273] . The data source includes longitudinal data on various potential risk factors, such as demographic factors and medical cond itions. Further, the analyses adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders. Patients with COPD from 2006 onwards were included, after QOF had been already established, meaning that COPD diagnoses were based on spirometry [286] . However, there is still a possibility of COPD misdiagnosis [287] . In addition, retrospective analyses based on medical records that were mainly collected for administrative purposes rather than research are subject to some limitations. T here is a possibility that free text (which is largely inaccessible for research due to issues around patient confidentiality) instead of R EAD codes may be used to record this information . Although QOF was introduced to improve the quality of recording, some variables used in this study may have changed from the last recorded coded entry, such as self -reported smoking. This study has investigated the impact of COPD severity on cognitive impairment and dementia using MRC dyspnoea score as oppos ed to lung 120 function measures; the latter is poorly recorded in the THIN database. It is however important to mention that dyspnoea is not specific for COPD and may also exist in other conditions, heart failure, for instance. The possibility of residual con founding of important risk factors, such as hypoxia, hypercapnia, oxidative stress, and inflammation, cannot be excluded. Information on oxygen saturations, oxygen therapy, and inflammatory markers are not well recorded in the utilised database (THIN); thu s, these factors could not be adjusted for in the analyses . 4.5 CONCLUSION Cognitive impairment was more prevalent in patients with COPD than in subjects without COPD. Moreover, the incidence of cognitive impairment was also greater . In contrast, the prevalen ce and incidence of coded dementia were lower in patients with COPD, highlighting the potential likelihood of under -diagnosis of dementia with a missed opportunity for proper intervention , and underlining the need to accurately estimate the proportion of patients with COPD and dementia with a systematic assessment. 121 Chapter 5 Incidence of Depression and Antidepressant Prescription in Patients with COPD: A Large UK Population -based Coho rt Study 122 5.1 INTRODUCTION It is increasingly recognised that the presence of comorbidities play a major role in COPD prognosis and greatly contribute to the severity of the disease [1]. Depression is amongst the most common comorbidit ies in COPD, result ing in impaired quality of life [288] , poor adherence to medication regimens and pulmonary 140], increased risk of COPD exacerbation [289] , and mortality [141]. Given this, the UK National Institute for Health and C are Excellence (NICE) COPD guidelines encourage identifying and managing depression [40]. The reported p revalence of depression in COPD ranges from 15% to 36%, depending on the study popula tion and methodological designs [143] . However, there is no recent work on the incidence rate of a new onset of depression following a diagnosis of COPD . Previous studies are also limited to small sample size [146] , short follow -up period [148] , and inconsistency of definitions for depression [290] . An earlier UK population -based study reported that the incidence rate of depression in patients with COPD was 16.2 per 1,000 person -years on data from 1995 to 2005 [147] . However , this predomina ntly predated the publication of the first UK COPD and depression NICE guidelines in December 2004 [291, 292] and the introduction of GP Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF); both of which have impacted on the clinical management and recording of COPD and depression [293] . Mechanisms underlying the association between depression in COPD are not fully understood. Risk factors associated with increased prevalence of depression in COPD are likely multiple and include age, female gender , and smoking [142, 143, 294] . The COPD severity has also been associated with an increased prevalence of depression ; however, studies have not been consistent on severity definition [290] . Breathlessness 123 (dyspnoea) is a core symptom in COPD and has been associated with worse depression symptoms [294] . Lower socioeconomic class is another risk factor that could also contribute to the increased risk of depression in patients with COPD. In fact, separate literature has previously shown that lower socioeconomic class is associated with COPD as well as with depression [28, 295] . Whether the incidence of depression among patients with COPD may be explained, at least in part, through socioeconomic class is worth exploring. This study hypothesised that the incidence of depression or antidepressant prescription in patients with COPD would be greater than in subjects without COPD. Th is chapter aims to 1) determine the incidence of newly diagnosed depression or antidepressant prescription following a diagnosis of COPD and compare this to subjects witho ut COPD using a large primary care database ; and 2) to assess the incidence of antidepressant prescription in patients with COPD and incident depression compared to those with incident depression from the general population. 124 5.2 METHODS 5.2.1 Study design A matched cohort study was conducted to assess the incidence of depression , antidepressant prescription, or either in patients with COPD compared to subjects without COPD . 5.2.2 Data source The d ata source for this study has been fully described in the previous chapter . (See subsection 4.2.2 ). 5.2.3 Study populations The study population comprised individuals aged 40 years with a COPD diagnosis from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2015, with 1 year of record prior to the COPD diagnosis. In addition, a comparison group free of COPD was identified at random from THIN . To create a matched cohort, each patient with COPD was matched by age, gender and GP surgery to up to four subjects free of COPD, and each subject without COPD was assigned the same index date as the matched patients with COPD. Subjects with a missing diagnosis date were excluded from this study. Further, those who were censored o r left the GP surgery before index date were also excluded. 5.2.4 Ethical approval Ethical approval for this study was obtained by an independent Scientific Review Committee (SRC), reference number - 18THIN098 -A1. 125 5.2.5 Follow -up and outcome definitions Patients with COPD and subjects without COPD with a code of depression prior to index date were excluded. Also, subjects with antidep ressant prescription codes of more than 2 years prior to COPD diagnosis/ index date were excluded. Subjects were followed up form COPD diagnosis/index date until either they experienced the outcome of interest (first recorded depression , antidepressant prescription or either ), left the GP practice, died or reached the end of the follow -up (31/12/2015), whichever came first . Diagnosis for depression was solely defined based on READ codes (Appendix 9 -11). Antidepressant s were defined based on drug codes (Appendix 9 -12). The incident of either depression or antidepressant was also investigated as a sperate outcome, as antidepressant prescription might have been coded with a depression episode , and also to account for the under -diagnosed (under and confounders A series of explanatory variables were determined at baseline , including age, gender and Townsend social deprivation score [278] . In addition, clinical variables such as smoking status and the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale [37] were recorded closest to the index date (whether prior to, or after index date). A modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was determined before or at index date. Body mass index (BMI) was determined within 2 years (before and after) of index date . 5.2.7 Statistical analyses Demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with COPD and subjects without COPD were described at baseline in terms of frequency or mean and standard 126 deviation as appropriate. Categorical data were compared using McNemar test. P <0.05 was considered significant. Incidence rates were estimated for both patients with COPD and subjects without COPD . Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to evaluate the risk of incident depression, antidepressant, or either following COPD diagnosis. The assumption of cox regression model was checked using Schoenfeld residuals . Only the first event following the index date was considered. Person -time commenced at the index date and ended when either the outcome of interest (depression, antidepressant prescription, or either) occurred, subjects left the GP clinic, subjects died, or end of the study period ( 31/12/2015), whichever came first. Confounders were included in the final model if they independently changed the HR for depression, antidepressant prescription, or either by 5% . All covariates were assessed in separate regres sion models. 5.2.7.1 Sensitivity analyses The incidence of the first antidepressant prescription within 1 -month following incident depression was calculated and compared between 1) patients with COPD and incident depression and 2) subjects without COPD and incident depression . To assess the impact of severity, incidence of depression, antidepressant prescription, or either was calculated amongst patients with COPD using the MRC dyspnoea score (1-3 vs 4-5) at time of diagnosis . Since socioeconomic class has been associated with both COPD and depression, this study assessed the incidence of depression , antidepressant, or either based on socioeconomic class (high (1-2) vs low (3-5)) amongst patients with COP D. STATA 15.0 software was used for data management and statistical analyses. 127 5.3 RESULTS There were 80,874 patients with COPD and 308,999 subjects without COPD identified in THIN from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2015 (Figure 5-1). After excluding those with either former coded depression or antidepressant prescription, there were 44,362 patients with COPD and 124,140 subjects without COPD. The mean (SD) age at index date was 6 7.6 (10.5) years , and 65% were males. The median follow -up period was 5. 95 years across the groups. The characteristics of the subjects included in the analyses are presented in Table 5-1. Figure 5. 1.

In addition, the risk of depression is further increased in patients with worse breathlessness and in those with a lower socioeconomic class. This study provides contemporaneous information with the current practice of managing patients with COPD. Studies on the incidence of depression following COPD is currently old. The findings that the incidence rate of depression was greater for patients with COPD compared to subjects without COPD is consistent with existing literature. However , the incidence of depression in the GP medical records reported in this study at 4.9% is slightly lower than the incidence reported in other population -based and clinical studies at 6% to 14%, respectively [146, 297] . The difference is attributed to methodological differences such as sample size , follow -up period, definitions depression, and study designs. This large population -based study was conducted after the publication of NICE COPD guidelines and introduction of QOF recommendations for COPD ; thus, reporting the incidence rate of depression according to the current primary care practice. Several risk factors are contributing to increased risk of depression in patients with COPD; one of which is COPD severity [290] . Using MRC dyspnoea score as a severity measure, the findings that patients with COPD and more breathlessness dyspnoea score were at a greater risk of incident depression are concordant with current literature . Yohannes et al. found that the odds of a new onset of depression was greater in patients with 2 modified MRC score compared to patients with less breathlessness 140 in a 3 -year follow up study [297] . However, t his does not imply that less breathless patients with COPD are not at risk of depression . Indeed, dyspnoea has been sugg ested as an important risk factor for depression in patients with COPD [36]. Breathlessness is the most burdensome symptom in COPD and is highly prev alent, even in patients with mild airflow limitation [34]. Therefore , it is vital to consider the psychological impact of COPD severity, particularly dyspnoea, and use targeted interventions. As expected, this study found that patients with COPD from lower socioeconomic status were at increased risk of depression compared to those in the higher class ; consistent with previous reports linking low socioeconomic status to increased prevalence of COPD [28], depression [295, 298], and adverse health outcomes [299] . Patients living at more deprived areas are likely to be exposed to several stressors, including financial strain, poor housing , lower level of health literacy, and social isolation . In addition, there are also healthcare inequalities , with patients from more deprived areas having poor health care access , ultimately to the detriment of the patient [300] . Indeed, Steiner et al . found that patients with COPD from more deprived areas were less likely to adhere to pulmonary rehabilitation [301] . The latter study suggested that poor adherence may be due to lack of transport but may also be because these patients are less likely to be referred in the first place. Taken together , the findings of this study suggest that healthcare system s should understand the impact of social disadvantage and be determined to provide equity when addressing issues in patients with COPD . With regard to depression, this study found that 51% of patients with incident depression were prescribed antidepressant, a proportion that is far lower than previously reported (88%) [147] . The difference in these figures can be attributed to methodological differences (e.g. sample size) but can also be due to a change in clinical 141 practice after the initiative of the NICE guideline [302] . Antidepressant is not the sole treatment for depression [302] , and the current depression NICE guideline recommends a stepwise approach when managing depression starting with the least intrusive and most effective approach first. Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions may be the first-line therapy for treating depression in patients with COPD . Establishing that patients with COPD are a high -risk group of depression highligh ts that healthcare professionals involving in the management of COPD need to be aware of this association at the annual review , thereby permitting appropriate treatment strategies and improving the quality of life in this population . Pulmonary rehabilitation, the cornerstone of care in patients with COPD, should be considered in all patients with COPD, particularly for those with MRC dyspnoea score of 3-5 [58] and is effective in reducing dyspn oea, and has also been shown to improv e depression in COPD [58, 303] . 5.4.1 Strength and limitations The current large -scale population -based study has several strengths. Firstly, the primary care database is large and provides a representative sample of patients with COPD within the UK [273] ; thus, offering high external validity and genera lisability . Secondly, patients with COPD from 2004 onwards were included after the initiatives of NICE guide lines and QOF . Thirdly, this study adjusted for a wide range of relevant confounders, in addition to matching patients with COPD to subjects without COPD by age, gender , and GP practice; thus, reducing sources of bias . Regarding limitations, the actual incidence rate of depression might be underestimated, as it may be recorded as a free -text instead of READ -codes; therefore, 142 unlikely to appear in the search. In addition, some variables reported in QOF are subject to reporting bias. For instance, smoking, which is a self -reported, may have changed from the last recorded coded entry. This study only consider ed the first incident of depression or antidepressant prescription and did not consider repeated events. Another limitation is that the THIN database has some missing data, particularly on MRC dyspnoea score, which i t may have led to inaccurate estimation. However, only those with MRC dyspnoea score were included in the MRC analysis. 5.5 CONCLUSION This large population -based study demonstrated an increased risk of incident depression and antidepressant prescription in patients with confirmed COPD. This indicates that healthcare providers should be vigilant to this association and target accordingly. 143 Chapter 6 Association between Antidepressants and Respiratory Related Morbidity in Patients with COPD: A Self-Controlled Case Series 144 6.1 INTRODUCTION Poor mental health in patients with COPD has a significant impact on health and prognosis. In some cases, antidepressants may be needed for these patients , and the current guidelines recommend using selective serotonin There is growing evidence that antidepressants may be associated with respiratory harm in patients with COPD, even with SSRI/SNRI, which hav e better overall safety and acceptability records compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) [151, 304] . In fact, each antidepressant class has its own side -effects. The anticholinergic component of TCAs is associated with dry mouth [305] , which may potentially lead to increased risk of pneumonia amongst elderly [306] . Current st atistics show that up to 30% of antidepressant (SSRs/SNRIs) users experience side -effects of vomiting and nausea [307, 308] , which are risk factors for aspiration pneumonia, and may also contribute to COPD exacerbation. In addition, SSRs/SNRIs may also have immunosuppressant effects, which can lower the threshold of infection [309, 310] , making antidepressant recipients (from patients with COPD) more likely to experience a COPD exacerbation. A recent population -based study examined the association between antidepressant use and adverse respiratory events i n the 90 days following antidepressant (SSRI/SNRI) prescription [151] . The findings showed that new users of SSRIs and/or SNRIs with COPD ha d increased risks of hospitalisation, emergency visits, pneumonia and mortality compared to non -users [151] , highlighting a potential concern of antidepressant use in patients with COPD. However, these fin dings are subject to some limitations such as residual confounding and unmeasured factors . A major issue of studying such an association using traditional observational approach (e.g. cohort study) is the problem of uncontrolled confounding effects. Thus, utilising more 145 sophisticated analyses to eliminate \"between -person\" confounding and to furthe r investigate these associations are worthwhile. The aim of this chapter is to investigate whether antidepressants are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and COPD exacerbation using primary care electronic health records within the UK. 146 6.2 METHOD S 6.2.1 Study Design A self -controlled case series (SCCS) study design was used to examine the association between incident pneumonia and COPD exacerbation and antidepressant prescription in patients with a diagnosis of COPD. 6.2.1.1 An overview of the SCCS design The SCCS method is a type of cohort study developed to investigate potential associations between transient exposures and acute outcomes. It estimates the relative incidence of an outcome in the exposure risk periods (exposed periods), with incidenc e during other baseline times (unexposed) within a person [311] . The main question , therefore, becomes \"when\" as opposed to \"who\". A clear definition (e.g. precise timing) of the risk periods (exposed periods) is required for the SCCS, as it i s best suited to investigate the temporal association between a time -varying exposure and an outcome event [311, 312] . The analysis is based only on data from cases (e.g. patients with COPD with a record of antidepressant prescription and who have the outcome of interest). The baseline (unexposed) period may include time both before and after the risk periods. The SCCS estimates the incidence rate ratio (IRR) that is, the rate of an event in a given 'exposed time' compared to the rate of an event in 'unexposed times'. The relative incidence is therefore estimated using a conditional Poisson model of the total number of events and exposures which each 'case' has experienced over a pre - determined observation period. The SCCS was initially devel oped to study vaccine safety in a variety of settings where control groups are not readily available [313] . Since then, it has been extensively applied in different situations in pharmaco -147 epidemiology studies, including studies that used UK primary car e data (e.g. THIN) [314-317]. Recently, the SCCS method has been used in studying the incident risk of cardiovascular events associated with infection and inflammation [318, 319] . A major advantage of SCCS is, as the name suggests , that it is self -controlled each participant acts as his/her own control meaning that it accounts for all constant (fixed) confounders (e.g. sex, socioeconomic status, genetics) over the period of observation. In other words, the influence of confounding between subjects is eliminated [311, 320] . In addition, the SCCS allows for the assessment of risk alteration with exposure' duration an d provides a statistical power comparable to that of a cohort study [313] . 6.2.1.2 Selection of the SCCS method in this study The decision to select the SCCS method to assess the association between antidepressant prescription and respiratory -related morbidity (pneumonia and COPD exacerbation) was made for two main reasons. First, there are several possible confounding sources when studying the association between the use of antidepressants and pneumo nia and COPD exacerbation, including sex, socioeconomic status, and co - existing comorbidities. This is in addition to other unknown/unmeasured confounders which may affect the association and are challenging to determine from electronic health records. How ever, the SCCS implicitly accounts for these factors as it is based on within -person comparisons. Secondly, the SCCS method permits the study of the duration of hypothesised increased risk in relation to the transient exposure (antidepressant prescription) . Although this study could have been conducted using a cohort approach, confounding effects would have been introduced. There is also another within -person study design 148 (e.g. case cross -over (CCO) design) which could have been used to eliminate between - person confounding effects associated with cohort study [321] , and th erefore to conduct this study. In brief, the CCO is analogous to a case -control study, in which all persons who have the outcome of interest (e.g. pneumonia and COPD exacerbation) are identified, and the exposure (antidepressant prescription) during risk p eriod(s) immediately prior to the event is compared with the individual's exposure at an earlier time (control periods) [321, 322] . However, the CCO design requires a strong stationary assumption that is the exposure must have a stable (exchangeable) prevalence over s uccessive time periods intervals (risk periods and baseline periods) [322] , which is unlikely to be the case in this study. Some key features of the SCCS highlighted by Whitaker et al . [312, 320, 323] are as follows: It is based on cases only, and the estimates of incidence related to different periods (exposed vs non -exposed). It controls for non -varying confounders. It can be applied to rare acute events and recurrent events. 6.2.2 Data source and study population The cohort inform ation was obtained using the THIN dataset, which contains anonymised patients records from over 550 GP practices within the UK [273] . See subsection 4.2.2 . The study included all individuals aged 40 years with a new READ -coded COPD diagnosis between 1/01/2004 and 31/12/2015, who have at least one year of data prior to their COPD diagnosis [286] and have at least one record of anti -depressant prescription/dispensing. From those with antidepressant prescription(s), we included 149 all individuals (cases) with the outcomes of interest (pneumonia and COPD exacerbation) in the SCCS analyses. Outcomes (pneumonia and COPD exacerbations) were identified using a list of READ codes. See subsection 6.2.6 . 6.2.3 Ethical approval Ethical approval for this study was provided by an independent Scientific Review Committee (SRC), reference number - 18THIN098. 6.2.4 Exposure definition The exposure of interest was the prescription of any antidepressant. Antidepressant prescriptions were further divided into four classes: SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and collectively all together ( Appendix 9 -12). Data on antidepressant prescriptions were extracted for all cases in the study population. Detailed recordings of the length of prescriptions are not always found in THIN. In practice, patients are unlikely to collect the subsequent medication prescribe d on exactly the day after the last day of the previous dispensing. Rather, they may collect it earlier (overlap between two prescriptions) or later (time gap between two prescriptions). To account for these irregularities, it is advised to allow for a cer tain number of days between prescriptions [324] . Therefore, to constitute a new episode of antidepressants, a 90 -day interval between prescriptions was used, as it has consistently been used in primary care studies [316] , and also according to the standard practice in the UK [325] . Thus, th is study made a conservative assumption , in which prescriptions were part of the same episode if they were dated within 90 days of the previous prescription. 150 6.2.5 Exposed and unexposed periods definitions The follow -up was defined as finishing when patients left the GP practice , date of death, or end of the study period. The core of the SCCS is to estimate the relative incidence risk amongst different risk periods to that in the baseline periods. The outcomes for each case were estimated during 7 different periods ( Figure 6-1). Following a previous study [151] , the decision was made to include a 90 -day \"hypothesised risk window\" following the day of the first prescription. The selection of the 90 -day risk period was made because this study intended to assess the acute effects of antidepressant related adverse e vents, and since it is acknowledged that antidepressant may take several weeks before it reaches its full effects. To assess the temporal changes associated with antidepressant prescription, this period (90 -day) was then divided into 3 segments of 30 days each, where the risk of each period was assessed individually . A period of a variable -length was also included to cover the remainder period of that episode, followed by a 90 -day washout period after the end of the antidepressant episode/course. In a situa tion where a new episode of antidepressant was started within these last two periods, the exposure statuses associated with that episode had taken over. Figure 6. 1. Diagram representing the study design 151 1- The time when cases are not exposed to antidepressants (baseline). 2- A 30 -day pre -exposure period including the first prescription date. Since antidepressants may be prescribed for anxiety or depression caused by the outcomes (pneumonia or COPD exacerbation), this period was added to correct for event -dependent exposure - that is to remove any pneumonia or exacerbation that might have led to prescribing an antidepressant. One approach to account for \"a temporary increase in exposure after an event\" is to consider a pre -exposure risk period [311] . (See subsection: 6.2.7.1 Assumptions and sensitivity analyses) . 3- A 30 -day period following the 1st prescription date (from day 1 to day 30 on treatment ). 4- A 30 -day period (from day 31 to day 60 on treatment ). 5- A 30 -day period (from day 61 to day 90 on treatment ). 6- The remainder of that course to cover the entire exposure period (from day 91 until the end of that course). 7- A 90 -day washout period following the end of th at course. 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 1 Beginning of the observation period Date of first prescription End of last prescription within the same episode End of observation period Figure 6-1. Diagram representing the study design 152 6.2.6 Outcome definitions Two outcomes were assessed. Firstly, we assessed th e association between antidepressants with READ -coded pneumonia ( Appendix 9 -13). All events of pneumonia were considered, and a new event was considered as such if at least 90 days had elapsed from the previous incidence of pneumonia. This was determined a fter considering the number of days between pneumonia episodes and in line with current literature [326, 327] . Analyses for multiple events assume that an event is independent within an individual, meaning that an occurrence of an event must not change the probability of the follow ing event (see subsection: 6.2.10. Assumption and sensitivity analyses). Secondly, we assessed the association between antidepressants and COPD exacerbation. Incidents of COPD exacerbation were defined based on algorithms constructed from multiple READ and drug codes as follows: \"1) a medical diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) or acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), or 2) a prescription of COPD -specific antibiotic combined with oral corticosteroids (OCS) for 5 -14 days, or 3) a record of two or more respiratory symptoms of AECOPD along with a prescription of COPD -specific antibiotics and/or OCS on the same day \" [328] . A new COPD exacerbation episode was considered as such if at least 8 weeks (56 days) had elapsed from the previous coded exacerbation [67]. READ and drug codes for construct ing COPD exacerbation s are available in the appendices (Appendix 9 -14). 153 6.2.7 Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics and demographics were summarised as relative frequencies for categorical data and mean (SD) for normally distributed continuous variables as appropriate. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) for the outcomes (pneumonia and COPD exacerbat ion) were calculated using fixed -effects Poisson regression by comparing the incidence ratio during each exposure period with the incidence when the same individual was unexposed (baseline), with an adjustment for age (3 -year bands) [320] . The age -adjusted IRR for each antidepressant class was calculated individually, as well as when all antidepressants were collectively combined f or each outcome. STATA 15.0 software was used for data management and statistical analyses. 154 6.2.7.1 Assumptions and sensitivity analyses For the SCCS model to be valid, the following key assumptions must be fulfilled: 1- The occurrence of an outcome must not alter the probability of subsequent exposure so that there is no short term -dependency between the outcome and the subsequent exposure. As both pneumonia and COPD exacerbation s are associated with depression and anxiety [329, 330] , which therefore might increase the probability of antidepressants prescriptions, there is a potential short -term dependency that may lead to change in prescription. To account for this, Whitaker et al. proposed including a pre -exposure risk period to remove any outcome events that may have led to antidepressant prescription [312] . This approach has been widely used in previous studies [315-317, 326] . Therefore, a 30 -day pre -exposure period was included, where in there is a significant difference in the IRR at the 30 -day pre -exposure period would indicate that the event has influenced the probability of subsequent exposure. 2- The second assumption is that an event should not alter the probability of a subsequent event (occurrence of outc omes is independent), especially for modelling multiple events. Since COPD exacerbation is known to increase the risk of a future exacerbation [66], and pneumonia may also increase the probability of a future event, the assumption might be violated. To overcome this assumption, however, Whitaker et al . proposed another strategy that is to limit the analysis to the first event [312, 323] . Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted restricting the analysis to the first outcome event (e.g. pneumonia and COPD exacerbation). This approach is only valid for rare outcomes, such that the probability of an independent recurrence is trivial relative to that of an outcome -dependent (clustered) recurrence. It is unlikely 155 that COPD exacerbations meet this assumption, so the true independent IRR with antidepressant use is likely to lie between the two estimates. 3- The outcome should not increase the probability of observation censoring; in other words, it does not lead to increased risk of death which will inevitably alter the probability of subsequent exposures. Indeed, both outcomes (pneumonia and COPD exacerbation) are as sociated with increased risk of death; thus, the assumption might be violated. A number of approaches have been proposed to circumvent this assumption. Where the exposure of interest is a single fixed event and the exposure statuses that would have applied post- censorship are known, censored observations may simply be extended to encompass the additional exposed time [331] ; however, this approach is not viable in this case as the exposur e period is of variable duration. An alternative case-series model applicable to event -dependent censoring is available [332] . However, this model relies on the assumption that events are rare and non - recurrent, which is inapplicable to the present study data. Therefore, t his study opted to carry out a secondary analysis using a simpler approach wherein patients who died following an event were excluded, similar to previous studies [317, 318, 326, 333, 334] . Thus, the primary analyses were repeated in patients whose follow -up was not censored because of death for 1) 6 months, and 2) 12 months following the outcome event, to observe whether this resulted in a change in the effect size. 156 6.3 RESULTS Of the 31,253 patients with COPD with at least one record of antidepressant prescription during the study period, 1,969 individuals who had a coded pneumonia, and 18,483 individuals with COPD exacerbation were included in the SCCS analyses (Figure 6-2). The mean age (SD) was 65 (11) years , and more than 50% were females. The baseline characteristics of the study participants are summarised in Table 6-1.

The median number of pneumonia events is 1 (IQR: 1 -2) per patent. The risk of pneumonia was compared across several risk periods. Compared to an unexposed period, collective antidepressant, SSRI/SNRI, and TCA prescriptions showed marked associations with pneumonia throughout al l risk periods. However, the associations were then diminished after withdrawal from the treatment. The 90 -day period following any antidepressant prescription was associated with a 79% increased risk of pneumonia (age -adjusted IRR 1.79, 95% CI: 1.54 to 2 .07). The risk also persisted throughout the remainder period (age -adjusted IRR 1.88, 95% CI: 1.68 to 2.11). The initiation of SSRI/SNRI and TCAs, separately, were also associated with increased risk of pneumonia that extended to the remainder period ( Table 6-2). In the sensitivity analysis, when restricting the analysis to the first event of pneumonia following antidepressant prescription, the risk remai ned across all risk periods and persisted to the remainder period for collective antidepressants, SSRI/SNRI and TCAs. However, no associations were observed after withdrawal of the treatment. Following pneumonia, there were 295 and 388 patients censored wi thin 6 and 12 months, respectively. In those who were not censored within 6 months after incident pneumonia, there was a 48% (1.26 to 1.75) increased risk of pneumonia in the 90 days following the prescription of any antidepressant. In this analyses, the results and trends were mostly similar to the primary analyses but slightly lower in magnitude ( Table 6-4 & Table 6-5). 159 Table 6-2.

COPD exacerbation The results of the association of antidepressant use and COPD exacerbation are shown in Table 6 -6. There were 18,483 patients with COPD identified who had been prescribed antidepressants and had 1 COPD exacerbation event. The median number of COPD exacerbations was 3 (IQR; 2 -6) events per patient, using validated definitions suggested by Rothnie and colleagues [328] . Compared to a period when patients were not exposed to antidepressant, there was a 16% increased risk of COPD exacerbation (age -adjusted IRR= 1.16, 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.20) in the fir st 90 days following any antidepressant prescription that slightly increased in the remainder period (age -adjusted IRR= 1.38, 95% CI: 1.34 to 1.41), but the association was diminished after 90 days from stopping the treatment. Similar trends were observed in SSRI/SNRI and TCAs ( Table 6-6). The 90 days following antidepressant prescription were associated with increased risk of the first event of COPD exacerbation (age -adjusted IRR= 1.41, 95% CI: 1.34 to 1.49; Table 6-7) The risk has also extended throughout the remainder period, but then diminished in the washout period. To assess the impact of COPD exacerbation on increasing the probability of censoring, the ana lyses were repeated in those who were not censored within 6 and 12 months after COPD exacerbation. The results showed that there were 1331 and 2,078 patients censored within 6 and 12 months, respectively, following a COPD exacerbation. There was 12% increa sed risk of COPD exacerbation in the 90 days following any antidepressants in those whose observations were not censored within 6 and 12 months after COPD exacerbation, compared to unexposed periods ( Table 6-8 & Table 6-9). The risk persisted through the remainder period.164 Table 6-6.

ate of prescription until the end of the course) 6- 90 days washout: A 90 -day pe riod starting the day after the end of the course and continuing for 90 days (day 1 after the end of the course until day 90 after the end of the course). In this self -controlled case series study utilising primary care data , there were increased risks of both pneumonia and COPD exacerbations in the 90 days following the use of antidepressants , including SSRIs or SNRIs, and TCAs among patients with COPD. The increased risk remained even when the analyses were restricted to the first event. However, the risk of pneumonia and COPD exacerbation both diminished once antide pressants are discontinued. This study provides important information on the potential adverse reactions of antidepressants in patients with COPD and adds to the body of literature. There has been growing evidence that antidepressants may lead to respirat ory-related adverse events in patients with COPD. The current study found that there is an increased risk of pneumonia in the 90 -day following antidepressant prescription and was also extended as long as patients with COPD were receiving antidepressants. Although this study further supports findings from a previous study that SSRI o r SNRI users with COPD have increased risk of pneumonia compared to non -users [151] , the risk of pneumonia reported in this study was of a greater m agnitude and longer period . In addition, this study also explored these associations in other antidepressant classes and identifying precise timing and duration of amplified risk ; something has not been investigated before. The causal link between antidepressants and the development of pneumonia has not been established . However, there is evidence suggesting that depression/anxiety (which are highly prevalent in COPD [143, 296] , and may be accompanied with antidepressants) is independently associated with increased risk of respiratory infection and pneumonia [335] . A previous study reported a 3 -fold increased risk of 169 pneumonia in the 90 -day period after hospitalisation for depression [336] , highlighting the possibility that antidepressants contribute to the increased risk. Furthermore , Hennessy et al. found an association between antidepressants and increased risk of pneumonia, despite the nullified association upon further adjustments [337] . There is also a possibil ity that the side effects associated with antidepressants, such as dry mouth, vomiting, and nausea, may contribute to increased risk of pneumonia (e.g. aspiration pneumonia) [307, 308, 338] . It is possible, however, that the increased pneumonia risk observed here may be additive to the risk associated with COPD, as COPD itself is associated with increased risk of pneumonia [339] . COPD exacerbation is an important event in the natural history of COPD. On average, patients with COPD may experience two exacerbation e pisodes every year [340] . This study found an increased risk of COPD exacerbation in the 90-day period following antidepressant prescriptions , which has also extended during the time when patients were on continues antidepressant . In contrast, a previous study has shown that new users (patients with COPD) of antidepressant (SSRI/SNRI) were at lower risk of COPD exacerbation compared to non -users in the 90 -day following antidepressant , owning this to increased and competing risk of other respiratory events and death [151] . Crucially, the current study compared the incidence relative risk of COPD exacerbation during antidepressant exposure periods with the patients' own stable period, not the risk of COPD exacerbation between individuals. Although having a history of COPD exacerbation is the greatest risk factor of future exacerbations [66], this study found a similar relationship there is an increased risk of COPD exacerbation following antidepressant prescriptions when the analysis was restricted to the first COPD exacerbation event, strengthening the robustness of the presented findings. 170 6.4.1 Strengths and validity of the SCCS method The use of case -only study designs, such as SCCS, has been widely employed in pharmaco -epidemiological studies. It circumvents the problem of selecting an appropriate comparator group and minimises the effect of unmeasured and unknown confounding that may be seen in the traditional observational designs (e.g. case -control and cohort studies). This is an important point to consider, as there may be systematic differences between subjects. However, the SCCS accounts for the time -independent confounder, making the estimation more robust than traditional observational designs. Indeed, the statistical power of the SCCS is comparable to that of a cohort study [341] . Furthermore, the SCCS method also provides an opportunity to assess the temporal changes in outcome (e.g. pneumonia and COPD exacerbation) risk associated with antidepressants prescriptions, something which has not been fully explored before. Although t he initial research question of this study may seem to violate some assumptions of the SCCS, this study used recommended approaches to overcome these issues, such as 1) including a pre -exposure period, 2) studying the first event, and 3) excluding those wh ose observations were censored because of death. The 30 -day pre - exposure period was designed to exclude any outcomes (e.g. pneumonia and COPD exacerbation) that might have led to prescriptions of antidepressants. It is unsurprising that the IRRs of both p neumonia and COPD exacerbation were significantly increased in this period. This is because both outcomes (pneumonia and COPD exacerbation) have been associated with depression [329, 330] , which therefore might increase the probability of antidepressant prescriptions. Because the day of the antidepressant prescription was included in the 30-day pre-exposure period, it is also possible that the increased IRRs were due t o behavio ural art efact (e.g. GPs may continue a prescription 171 that started in secondary care) as opposed to the antidepressants causing the pneumonia or COPD exacerbation events. Therefore, it was essential to consider such an adjustment. The validity of the SCCS analytical approach relies on whether recurrent events occur independently. In an ideal world, the model allows outcomes (pneumonia and COPD exacerbation) to be recurrent, but they must be independent. However , independence is not always present in practice. In fact, the greatest risk factor of COPD exacerbation is a history of previous exacerbation [66]. In this instance, bias might be introduced. It is simpler, however, to consider a non -recurrent event as the first event, even when recurrence is unlikel y to happen [323] . Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by studying the first event, and the results were consistent with the primary analyses; thus, satisfying thi s assumption. Another critical assumption for the SCCS method is that both the distribution of exposure and the observation period must be independent of the time of the event. In other words, the occurrence of an event must not censor or disrupt the exposure process, which is inevitable in the case of death [342] . If an event is associated with increased risk of mortality, such as pneumonia or COPD exacerbation, there is a chance that the observation period might be altered, and exposures (e.g. antidepressant) will not be observed. This could possibly produce a biased estimate (e.g. inflation of the IRRs) of pneumonia or COPD exacerbation [331] , although a violation of the assumption does not always result in severe bias. It is therefore important to have an applicable method to a ccount for this. It is also worth noting that the alternative approach (which assumes non -recurrence) is equally problematic, as the median number of COPD exacerbations in this study was 3. However, this issue 172 was circumvented by excluding patients whose observations were censored within 6 and 12 months of their outcome event. This approach has been widely used in the literature [318, 326, 333, 334] , as it ensures that only cases who were followed until the end of the observation period were included, and therefore meeting the requirement of the assumption. The results for the 90 -day \"risk window\" were consistent with the primary analyses, although lower in magnitude due to loss of power. 6.4.2 Strengths and limitations of the study This study has several strengths. First, the primary care database is large and provides a representative sample of patients with COPD within the UK [273] . Second, the use of within -individual comparison has control for time -independent confounders such as sex, socioeconomic status, and genetics ; thus, providing a robust estimate. Third, this study used validated definitions for COPD exacerbation in electronic health records [328] . However, this study has some limitations. Although the SCCS does not account for time -varying confounders , this study accounted for these by adjust ing for age - bands . Another limitation is that some lifestyle exposures are not regularly updated, making it difficult to exclude confounding factors that are known to accompany the issue of antidepressant prescription. For instance, smoking consumption may become more frequent during depression or anxiety episodes (and hence antidepressant prescription), which could consequently confound the observed relationship. In addition, it was difficul t to determine whether patients collected and/or adhered to their antidepressants as prescribed. In fact, THIN does not provide information on whether the antidepressants were dispensed. Moreover, the current analysis only studied pneumonia and COPD exacer bation events reported in general practice but could not determine events that required hospital admission. 173 6.4.3 Clinical implications The findings of this study should be interpreted with caution. Instead of completely avoiding prescribing antidepressants to patients with COPD, the findings should raise awareness of the potential respiratory adverse effects associated with antidepressants. Clinicians should adopt a meticulous approach when managing patients with COPD and poor mental health. This includes expla ining both the condition and the side effects of the treatment. It is also important for clinicians to stay vigilant and accept the challenges of antidepressants by monitoring each patient closely following the prescription of the treatment. On the other h and, these findings also highlight the importance of considering non -pharmacological therapies that have been shown to improve mental health disorders such as psychological support [343] . 6.5 CONCLUSION Compared to the stable period, antidepressants were associated with increased risk of pneumonia and COPD exacerbation in the 90 days following a prescription of antidepressants. If cause and effect relationships are confirmed, clinicians should be cautious when prescribing antidepressants and aware of the potential adverse effects. 174 Chapter 7 Summary of conclusions, implications, and suggested future studies 175 7.1 Summary of findings Research in this thesis contributes to the body of knowledge on COPD comorbidities and clinical biomarkers. The findings of each study have led to the following conclusions: 7.1.1 Clinical circulating biomarkers In a cross -sectional analysis, soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End - products (sRAGE) was not a ssociated with aortic stiffness, carotid intimal media thickness, or coexistent cardiovascular disease in patients with COPD, but there was a weak association between sRAGE and FEV 1% predicted. Patients with COPD and either diabetes, isch aemic heart disea se, or cerebrovascular disease have increased urinary albumin creatinine ratio compared to patients without these conditions. The prevalence of clinical microalbuminuria in patients with COPD and either diabetes, isch aemic heart disease, or cerebrovascular disease was 22%, and it was 15% in patients without these comorbidities. The associations of urinary albumin creatinine ratio with aortic stiffness and carotid intimal media thickness in all patients with COPD were nullified when adjusted for known confo unders. Aortic stiffness was significantly greater in patients with clinical microalbuminuria compared to patients without microalbuminuria. 176 7.1.2 COPD comorbidities A UK -population -based study demonstrates that the prevalence of cognitive impairment at the time of COPD diagnosis was greater than in subjects without COPD, matched by age, gender, and GP practice. Patients with COPD were more likely to have an incident diagnosis of cognitive impairment (incident rate: 23.1 per 1,000 person -years), compared to subjects without COPD (incident rate: 16.3 per 1,000 person -years). The prevalence and incidence of dementia were less frequently recorded in patients with COPD c ompared to matched subjects without COPD. Patients with COPD and worse breathlessness were associated with a greater prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia compared to patients with less breathlessness. In a large cohort study, the risk of incident depression following a COPD diagnosis was greater (incidence rate: 11.4 per 1,000 person -years) than in subjects without COPD (incidence rate: 5.7 per 1,000 person -years) matched by age, gender, and GP practice. Patients with COPD with lower socioeconomic status had a greater risk of depression compared to patients with COPD with higher socioeconomic class. Patients with COPD and worse breathlessness were associated with increased risk of incident depression comp ared to patients with less breathlessness. Antidepressant use was associated with increased risks of pneumonia and COPD exacerbations in patients with COPD, relative to a period of unexposed to antidepressants. 177 The risks of pneumonia and COPD exacerbatio ns both diminished once antidepressants were discontinued. The co-exist ence of comorbidities presents a significant challenge in the clinical management of COPD, impacting on patients' health status and affecting the rate of hospitalisations, exacerbati ons, and mortality [69-74]. Increased knowledge of the burden of COPD comorbidities helps in developing appropriate interventions, improving clinical practice, and reframing guidelines. The findings of this thesis highlight important aspects of recognising, understanding, and manag ing comorbidities in patients with COPD. The following sections will discuss the implications of the thesis findings and provide recommendations for future research. 7.2 Implications of findings 7.2.1 Cardiovascular risk prognostication in COPD Cardiovascular (CV) disease is recognised as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD [73, 87] , yet the CV state is not routinely assessed. The burden of CV events in patients with COPD can be significantly ameliorated by preventative strategies (primary and secondary preventions). However, this implies recognising CV disease and CV risk factors (e .g. smoking, cholesterol, and hypertension), and taking necessary actions as early as possible. Cardiovascular disease often remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients with COPD [344] . This may be attributed to the lack of clinical guidelines for managing CV disease in patients with COPD. Although the current COPD guidelines recommend recognising CV disease in patients with COPD [1], there has been no practical gu idance or specific information on when and how to screen/assess for CV 178 risk. This issue has been highlighted in the literature which emphasises on routine assessment to the CV state in patients with COPD [157-159]. We, therefore, should be continuously seeking opportunities for CV risk identification and pr evention in primary care as well as in secondary care clinics. Current recommendations suggest that management of CV disease in patients with COPD should be performed using its own individual guidelines (as if the patient does not have COPD), which have been developed by those specialists. This, however, contrasts oth er guidelines for other disease groups (e.g. kidney disease, diabetes, and arthritis) where specific recommendations are made available for assessing and managing CV disease [345-347]. As an example, individuals with diabetes (without CV disease) are routinely assessed for the presence of microalbuminuria to identify patients at increased risk of renal impairment and/or future CV events [346] . Patients with COPD are at 2 to 5 times in creased risk of CV diseases [97], which is compar able or even greater than these conditions (e.g. subjects with diabetes are at two times increased risk of CV disease) [348] . Therefore, there needs to be more i nformation available on how to perform a CV risk assessment in patients with COPD; and more importantly, how to integrate it into clinical practice. In current practice, there are considerable gaps in the CV risk detection/prognostication in patients with COPD. Active detection for CV risk should be considered for all patients with COPD. Identifying new and simple biomarkers that can be used to aid the detection of patients with increased CV risk is also of clinical importance. Indeed, if patients at incre ased CV risk are identified, we can apply preventive strategies before the development of any major CV events. This, in turn, would improve the clinical outcomes of patients, reduce morbidity, hospitalisation, 179 mortality, and the economic burden. However, i t is important to note that preventative strategies (primary and secondary) for CV risk reduction would not be successful if patients do not adhere to medical advice. Indeed, current guidelines state that the most important and effective way to prevent CV risk is by promoting a healthy lifestyle, which includes smoking cessation, physical activity and appropriate diet. These lifestyle modifications should be considered before any pharmacological therapies . Two biological circulating markers have been invest igated in this thesis: blood (soluble RAGE) and urine (microalbuminuria). First, soluble RAGE was not associated with physiological measures of increased CV risk in the ERICA cohort. These findings, although contrary to expectations, do not support that so luble RAGE being a biomarker to address the CV status in patients with COPD. However, these findings add to the existing literature [221] . Second, microalbuminuria is frequent in patie nts with COPD, highlighting the potential risk of sub -clinical renal damage and future CV events [192, 196, 197] Screening for microalbuminuria non -invasive, and inexpensive; an d can , therefore, be performed routinely to aid the detection of micro - and macro -vascular abnormalities in patients with COPD. In addition, patients with COPD and confirmed microalbuminuria have increased aortic stiffness compared to those without microal buminuria (as shown in this thesis), which also reinforces the need to intervene. Optimising the CV state in patients with COPD using aggressive interventions to target microalbuminuria is a potential area of future research. 7.2.2 Cognitive impairment and dementia in COPD Cognitive impairment and subsequent dementia have negative impacts on COPD clinical outcomes. Nevertheless , little consideration is given for timely detection and 180 early intervention within the frame of respiratory assessmen t. Indeed, early identification of cognitively impaired patients is of clinical importance, as it allows for appropriate therapeutic interventions and change in lifestyle (e.g. physical activity, healthy nutrition, and social interaction), which could prev ent or at least minimise the cognitive deterioration to clinical dementia. Dementia is a devastating, irreversible condition, impacting on all aspects of life for both patients and caregivers. Individuals with COPD are at increased risk of neuronal damage leading to cognitive impairment and even subsequent dementia. Establishing an early diagnosis of dementia permits patients to access service that meets their needs. Therefore, healthcare providers involved in the management of COPD should be aware of the increased burden of cognitive impairment and dementia. The increased prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment in patients with COPD should extend the clinical focus to identify and manage modifiable risk factors contributing to the development of cognitive impairment and subsequent dementia. For instance , smoking, CV disease, and hypoxemia are common risk factors linked to cognitive impairment in COPD [265] , and should , therefore , be evaluated and managed during routine follow -up. Given that cognitive impairment, by itself, is a major risk factor leading to dementia, it is very likely that in the settings of COPD, where the prevalence of smoking and CV disease is high, the risk of dementia will be magnified. This is of clinical importance, particularly as there are no curative therapies for dementia. Early interventions (e.g. smoking cessation, oxygen therapy, and change in lifestyle) to manage these modifiable risk factors should , therefore, be prioritized. Early intervention also permits dealing with functional impairments, which can pose a barrier to the clinical management of COPD. Cognitive impairment and dementia 181 significantly affect adherence to medication regimens [261] . For instance, if planning and sequencing (e.g. praxic skills) are impaired, it is unlikely for the patient to be able to self -administer their inhalation therapies. Moreover, patients with COPD and cognitive impairment are less likely to gain benefits from pulmonary rehabilitation programs due to increased functional dependence and poor adherence to instructions [125] , whereas patients with confirmed dementia will not be referred at the first place. Cognitive impairment also leads to problems with educational achievements and smoki ng-abstinence; all of which are vital elements of pulmonary rehabilitation. In these contexts, pulmonary rehabilitation programs may be tailored to meet patients' needs in order to bring greater benefits. Furthermore, cognitive impairment and dementia also ha ve a considerabl e impact on dependency and self -management in COPD [126] . Having adequate cognitive functioning is necessary for patients with COPD to maintain independence, uptake information properly, follow instructions, and adhere to medication regimens, which underpin effective care. However, failure to maintain these functions leads to reduce the effectiveness of treatment, which may result in worse outcomes. Given the considerable impacts of cognitive impairment and dementia on patients with COPD, it is of importance to consider active cognitive screening/assessment. Otherwise, cognitive impairment and dementia will remain under - or even un - diagnosed, with a missed opportunity for timely intervention. Cognitive screening can be performed using a brief cognitive assess ment, which will indicate the presence and severity of cognitive impairment , and help determine the type and amount of required support and assistance. Further consideration should also be given to patients presenting with severe respiratory symptoms and c omorbidities. 182 It is important to mention here that the evidence of screening and systematic assessment for cognitive impairment and dementia in patients with COPD is currently scarce. In addition, there are also other factors which may interfere with perf orming a systematic assessment, such as high workload, staff shortage, and time constrain ts for patient visit. This opens new doors for researchers to explore the role of cognitive screening/assessment in improving diagnosis for cognitive impairment and d ementia, and whether it needs to be implemented/standardised as a n element of the respiratory assessment in patients with COPD. 7.2.3 Depression in COPD Depression is amongst the most common comorbidit ies in patients with COPD. However, it often remains underdi agnosed and undertreated, which can significantly affect clinical outcomes. Therefore, clinicians caring for patients with COPD should be alert to the existence of depression and aware of its symptoms and consequences. The very first step to improve outco mes and reduce the impact of depression is to identify depression as early as possible. Although the current guidelines recommend recognising depression in patients with COPD [40], there is no evidence that depression is currently part of the standard assessment. Early identificat ion of depression plays a vital role in the clinical management of COPD. It allows healthcare professionals to develop appropriate treatment strategies, guide the choice of pharmacological and non -pharmacological therapies, and minimise the risk of missing critical patients' symptoms; all of which aim to improve clinical outcomes. Patients with COPD are offered routine check -ups, mainly at primary care practices. In other words, health care professionals in direct contact with those patients play an important role in identifying COPD comorbidities, one of which is depression. Given 183 the increased risk of depression, patients with COPD need to be actively screened. To be efficiently performed, screening should be quick and s traightforward . There are several validated screening tools for depression which can be simply incorporated withi n the respiratory assessment. The NICE guideline for depression suggests asking two screening questions: ''during the last month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless?'' and ''during the last month, have you often been bother ed by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?'' [291] . These two questions can be quickly done during COPD assessment, and the answers to these questions will then determine whether further assessment for depression is indicated. 7.2.4 Antidepressants and adverse events in COPD Antidepressants are associated with multiple side effects , and there is a growing concern that they may contribute to increased risk of respiratory -related morbidities such as pneumonia and COPD exacerbations in patients with COPD [151] . Nevertheless, it is important not to deny the relevant outcomes of antidepressants completely . Therefore, a meticulous approach should be considered when prescribing antidepressants to those patie nts. Clinicians are required to stay alert and accept the challenges associated with the therapy. It is also worthwhile that clinicians closely monitor the side effects of antidepressants after prescription. When antidepressants are needed, it is essential to adopt the concept \"start low and go slow\" to allow patients to tolerate the drug. As patients with COPD often co -exist with multiple comorbidities, prescribers should keep in mind the possible side effects and drug interactions. Prescribers should also educ ate patients about antidepressants and possible adverse effects and how to manage them. Regular follow -ups after the initiation of antidepressant are vital, particularly at 184 the first and early stages of the treatment. Thereafter, periodic follow -ups (e.g. phone call) may suffice. When managing mental health in patients with COPD, pharmac ological int erventions (e.g. ant idepressants) should not be the sole treatment. Patients with COPD and poor mental health may benefit from other forms of non -pharmacologica l interventions such as cognitive psychological therapies and pulmonary rehabilitation. The current clinical guidelines promote a stepwise approach for poor mental health that is starting with the least intrusive and most effective approach [291] . 7.3 Recommendation for future research This thesis has investigated important but inadequately researched aspects of COPD comorbidities and circulating biomarkers. The following sections will suggest directions for future research to build -up on the presented work. 7.3.1 Microalbuminuria in COPD Since microalbuminuria is common in patients with COPD, studies should be conducted to understand the risk factors of the development of microalbuminuria in patients with COPD and confirmed microalbuminuria. Furthermore, determining whether microalbuminuria is a potential target in the m anagement of patients with COPD at clinical stability and at times of exacerbation is also a potential area for future research. Indeed, aggressive interventions for CV risk factors (e.g. lowering blood pressure, promoting smoking cessation, reducing high cholesterol level, and maintain a healthy lifestyle) are recommended in patients with diabetes and hypertension with confirmed microalbuminuria [257, 258] . Since MAB was prevalent (even in patients without self -reported comorbidities), it is worthwhile to investigate whether similar 185 aggressive interventions will improve microalbuminuria (and thus the increased CV risk) and clinical outcomes in patients with COPD. It is, however, important to mention that some pharmacological therapies that are used to treat CV disease may alter the natural history of COPD; therefore, careful consideration for this issue should be applied. 7.3.2 Cognitive impairment and dementia in COPD Understanding the cognitive decline in patients with COPD should be considered for future research. Althoug h a previous study suggested that a self -reported diagnosis of severe COPD was associated with a cognitive decline (assessed by a questionnaire) over time [271] , this association is yet to be confirmed. A future longitudinal study should be carried to confirm this association using objective measures to determine COPD severity and assess the impact of which on cognitive function. Understanding such an association will promote more research to d evelop interventions to slow this rate of decline. A need also exists for mechanistic studies looking to understand the factors associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in COPD. Further work should consider the contribution of comorbidities (e.g. CV disease), hypoxemia, and smoking in relation to cognitive impairment, and which factors affect the cognitive function in COPD the most. An important area to explore is the role of screening of cognitive impairment in patients with C OPD at primary care settings. Whether screening/assessment for cognitive impairment and dementia will improve diagnosis at an early stage, and whether this will promote better care (e.g. opportunity to intervene) and consequently modify /alter the trajector y to dementia. For instance, whether screening for cognitive 186 impairment will offer a tailored smoking cession program to those patients, and whether this will slow the rate of decline to dementia. It is also worth knowing whether screening for cognitive im pairment and dementia will identify a group of patients with COPD , who are struggling with poor adherence to medication or i mproper techniques for inhaled medications. This can be done by taking a group of patients with COPD , who are failing to use their medications and perform a cognitive assessment to determine the commonality of cognitive impairment in that group. Furthermore, understanding the acceptability (e.g. so cial, economic, and health benefits and challenges) of cognitive screening in patients with COPD and/or a certain group of COPD is also worth consideration. 7.3.3 Depression in COPD Given the increased risk of depression in patients with COPD, future research i nto effective treatment should be considered. Thus, there is a need to understand whether pharmacological or psychological treatments, alone or in combination, are more effective than exercise alone. The evidence of pulmonary rehabilitation in improving depressive symptoms is well -established. However, what remains unknown is how to maximise benefits during a pulmonary rehabilitation program. There is also a need to understand barriers and facilitators for pulmonary rehabilitation adherence, the possibility of uptake and completion in patients with COPD and depression. In other words, whether these outcomes are associated with depression in patients with COPD. Another area worth considering is to understand which other add -on interventions (e.g. psychological therapy) in conjunction with PR in comparison to PR alone are more beneficial to those patients. A future randomised controlled trial should be conducted to address this. 187 7.3.4 Antidepressants in COPD Given that antidepressant use is associated wit h increased risks of both pneumonia and COPD exacerbations, there is a need to understand the mechanisms of these associations further . This can be done by a lab -based approach to understand the pathological pathways. In addition, it remains unknown whethe r patients with COPD are aware of the side effects associated with antidepressant s and whether they are also aware of other forms of non -pharmacological treatments for their mental illness. A cross -sectional, self -administered questionnaire can be used to evaluate patient s' awareness. A further understanding of the observed relationships is required. An observational approach using other appropriate databases (from primary and secondary care) to explore the risk of hospitalisation and mortality in patient s with COPD after use of antidepressants is of interest. 7.4 Concluding remarks COPD is associated with multiple comorbidities, which have a substantial effect on health and prognosis. This PhD has utilised different methodologies and datasets to address several areas related to COPD comorbidities , which have not been adequately researched. Increase the understanding of com orbid conditions in patients with COPD has important implications. The findings outlined in this thesis advance ou r knowledge of different aspects of COPD comorbidities and biomarkers , and provide new evidence into the clinical management of COPD . There is still a need to understand the mechanisms linking these comorbidities to COPD and , how these comorbidities should be assessed and managed in the clinical settings. 188 Chapter 8 REFERENCES 189 1.
