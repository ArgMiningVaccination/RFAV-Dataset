Jan Dostal lays out four steps for the development of spiritual thinking, beginning with the expansion of Pure Thinking which can be released via Reverence, into Love, and finally Sacrifice. Anyone working towards a deeper understanding of human existence will invariably encounter many paradoxical and contradicting phenomena - in life just as in Anthroposophy and the work of Rudolf Steiner. Jan Dostal makes it clear that we have to view such paradoxes as the very foundations for a realistic way of knowing - the many layered and contradictory facets of life cannot simply be captured in schemes and theories. By applying our contempaltive capacities as well as developing higher cognitive powers, such polarities and contradictions can live side by side offering a more complete view. 130 pages. 210 x 150 mm. 8 x 6 inches.
