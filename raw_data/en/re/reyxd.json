INTRODVCTlON Medicine is both an art and a science. It encompasses prophylaxis or prevention. diagnosis. and finally treatment (both curative and palliative) . Preventive medicine is especially impOl1ant and has been neglected as a major factor in health care. In fact, it is well docllmented but lillie known that must of the health gains (expressed as life expectancy. morbidity. and mortality) auributed to modern medicine are principally due to advancements in diet and sanitation. rather than to the more complex tcchnologics \u00b7\\~.b.9,I(I.\". Preventive medicine as a natural measure of therapeutic stresses the involvement of the individual in his own health care. This is accomplished by educating the patient as to proper nutrit ion, hygiene and physical activities 5, 1O.l$. Equally important are the psychologic and spiritual factors as these can greatly influence the discaselR. Curative medicine is as important as the preventive One. In the process of healing. natural approache~ have been used. The natural art of therapeutics is not a new approach in thefield of medicine. rat her it is as old as people have been the inhabitants of this planet. Man Page 54-The Journal oIIMA-Vol. 13-Apri17981 has done his best in protecting himself from diseases and in preventing himselJ from sickness. Preventive and curative app-roaches have been used by man to keep himself healthy, happy and strong . Some of these so-called \"primitive\" measures have been shown to be scientifically sound and have thus been added to the \"modern\" therapeutic regimen~. Some approaches were considered to be nalUral (c.g. herbs. natural foods. elc.) while others were oriented towards the use of drugs and synthetic remedies . Anyone studying or practicing medicine realizes that he is at best providing some therapy to impede the cJisease process so that the body can take over and effect a cure with the mercy of Allah. In an Islamic sense. the health care practitioner mllst be viewed as an agent through which Allah acts. He must not delude himself into a position of exaggera ted se If -im porta nee. In this paper the authors wish to approach the subject of natural therapeutics in medicine vis-a-vis the 1~lamic approach of good and sound health. The paper , .... i11 a.lso include some aspects of t he following: types of natural therapeutics . diet as an approach to natural healing and coUeges that deal with natural therapeutics. The paper does include some recommendations related to natural approache!> in medicine for the Muslim world. Such a paper is helpful to all tho.e concerned about sound health of the individuals including those groups dealing with tht' allopathic and the natural medicine. This research is of great help to all those colleges teaching medicine and especially those colleges tcaching natural therapeutics. It is a source of help to the physicians, patients. hospitals , grocery stores. health food stores and the like. This paper is of great assistance to the Third World. i.e., [he emerging nations whose technological resources are meager, and whose health delivery approaches are more (lr less still oriented towards the natural therapeutic methods. It is the hope of the authors that an eclectic approach he adopted by the Third W()rld. i.c. to pick up the best of every discipline. [t is hoped that the Third World nations will establish an INSTITUTE OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY which will catalog the entire spectrum of medical approaches including the \"natural\" methods. If the Third World nations establish such a health institute based on the natural approaches. they will undoubtedly help save themselves money, time, effort and the more expensive technology. This will lead to better healing and finally faster and better results. II. ISLAM.IC V1EWS ON THERAPEUTICS Islam is a way of life to live, a system to be followcd. a code of cthjcs and a conslitutioJ) 10 be applied in the daily life of every person. As such, Islam has many conslruetive ideas to offer in the fields of health and medicine . In order to find out what Isl<lnl teaches. one has to read the Qur'an and the Hadith. Allah says in the Qur'an in Surah the POCIS (Ash-Shu'ara') about healing from ~ ~W~.r l,.jl,\" (A. : Y') AI~ I \" ... and when I sicken. then He (Allah) heals me (26:80) ... As far as the prophet is concerned, relakd to the healing or diseas\u00ab::s, it was reported by Jabir bin Abdullah disease there is a cure. and when the cure matches the disease, the person recovers by the will of Allah ... \" The prophet also said about the healing of (!.p I l.. It was by Hurairah thaI the Prophet (pbuh) said: \"Allah never inflicts a disease unless he makes a eure for it. .. \" As far as the trealment of diseases it was reported by Usamah 'J I I ... ,..~ ,-J~' ~ J;:..... \". carne to him asking: '0 messenger of Allah: Do we take medicine for treatment'!' He said: 'Yes, Oh you the servants of Allah, take medicine. as Allah Almighty has not created a disease without having created a cure for it except one disease.' They asked. 'What it is?' He In another \"Allah never inflicts a disease without providing a cure; only those wllo were awa.re of it knew it, whereas I hose who were not aware, were ignorant or it.\" As far as the preventive approach ill health. Prophet (pbuh) ~aid: C~.)~ ..:.r preVenllOn IS better than a ton of treatmcnt. .. Hence. healing medicine is an art and a science. It i\\ done through prevenlion (prophylaxis). diagnosis. treatment. and cure. In so doing. the individual may rrolong his happy life and reduce the degree and the rate of OCcurrence of illness. Islam encompasses all Ihese approaches so that a person may stay healthy. happy and strong. III. LIMITATIONS OF DRUG THERAPY Drug therapy has become the concern of many people2,l2, The reasons are obvious. among which are the following: A. Most drug therapy must be closely monitored and carefully dosed. This dose may have to be alrered frequently d ue to the nature of the particular disca~e process or other concomitant ones Ihe patient may have. B. Even so, toxic effects may occur. Often one has to weigh the advantages of drug use against the side effects. The choice is not always clear. C. Therapeutic drugs are usual.1y much more expensive than preventative measure!s. D. The choice whelher or not to u\"e drug prescriptions depends greatly on Ihe disease process. Acute, life-t hreatening diseases usuaJly require such intervention. However. for chronic. non-curable diseases (such as arthritis) the rationale for drug prescriptions is much more subjective . The psychologic makeup of the patient is likely 10 playa large role in the decision LO use a drug4.~,23. IV, TYPES OF NATURAL THERAPI<:lIT1CS Among the natural healing treatment s are the following: A. Preventive medicine B. Dietetic approach C. Folk medicine D. Hakim's medicine The Journal of IMA-Vol . 13-ApriI1981-Page 55 E. Chiropractic F. Naturopathy G. Naprapathy H. Homeopathy In dealing with this subject. Islam's approach to healing is an eclectic one. i.e., one is to lise the best of every discipline so that the health of the individual will be preserved. V. DIET AND NATURAL HEALING As far as the diet is concerned. Islam has laid down the foundation in the Qur'an and the SlInnah for the best approach in keeping good health. This approach is mainly through selection of the best. preventive methods. and to be aware of any harmful drugs. The following is a summ~lry of the principal ideas of Islam relating to diet and health: A. Allah askcd everyone to eat what is lawful (Hal.tal). The Qur'an states in Surah AI-Baqarah (the cow): ~ V\" W '-r.-' l\" ) ul, ~ I \"Ye people: eat of what is on earth, lawful and wholesome\" (2: 168). Read also (5:91). B. People are to ENJOY their food as it affects their personality character. Enjoying the eating of food is a matter of worship as any otheraspcct of life in Islam. C. Muslims are to SELECT the best quality of food. In ths regard Allah says in the QlIf'an in Surah AI-Kahf (The Cave): ~..l.J1 ~, .,j, send ye thcn OnC of you with this money of yours to the town: let him find out which is the bc~t food (to be had) ... \" (18:19). O. M uf>lims a rc to EAT the best food after selecting the best. Allah says in the Qur'an in Surah Al\u00ad A 'rar (TIle Heights) ,.5 L.;:; t--b 0-1\".J5'\u00b7 ( 11. : Y ) ~I; ~ I \"Eat of the good foods we have provided for you.\" (7: 160). E. The best approach in the process of prevention is the concept oj' MODERATION in eating habits. The Qur'an states emphatically this idea in Smah AI-A'raJ (The 'i I\u00b7 v.r-',.,.-J 1 \"Eat and drink. but waste not by excess. for God loves not the prodigals.\" (7:31). F. Regarding the idea of moderation through diet it is mentioned in Smah Taha whereby Allah says: ..,; I,..a..b:; 'i, 4.,..b ~ I ~ (AI :,..)~ \"Eat of the good things we have provided fOf your sustenance, but commit no excess therein.\" (20:81) G. Another approach that Islam demands from its followers is the idea of TOTAL ABSTl N ENCE of food and drinks for one whole month from dawn to sunset. The benefits of fasting have been tested and documented 2Y,15,16.1\u00b7/ especially in biochemistry, physiology. clinical therapeutics, clinical nutrition. etc. it is beyond doubt that fasting helps the individual to get rid of most of the toxins in his body. At the same time fasting increases productivity and by its fruga lity curbs inlla tion. I n this regard. it would be a good idea to point out here \\vhat Islam says in this regard. Allah says in the Qur'an in Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow): ye who telieve! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you. that ye may learn self-restraint\" i,e. to have Taqwa (2: 183). The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: I~ I\".~\u00b7 \"Fast (the month of Ramadan) so that to heal your bodies from diseases.\" The word Taqwa has been explained in many aspects some of which are relatcd to he.alth and disease, food and dietetics. physical fitness, etc. Finally. it has been explained to mean: self-training, self-restraint, ~elf-control. self-discipline. sclf\u00ad education and self-evaluation. It shOUld also be mentioned here that the personality. behavior, and performance of the individual is affected by the food eaten~ and. therefore. one has to select the best lype of food for his good health. There is thus a linkage between physical and mental health. A proverb related to this subject has been narrated saying: .. A sound mind is a sound body and vice versa.\" It is difficult to reason well while one is pbysicaJly sick. Similarly, mentai illness may adversely affect various body fUllctions (e.g. ulcer)'S,19. This dual. complementary approach to mental and physical health is exemplified by Islamic views towards the nursing of infants. The advantages of breast feeding are numerous since the mother transfers many nutrients. hormones, and even antibodies through suckling'4. The particular amino acid composition of human milk may accelerate and even increase cognitive development in the inrant'~. In addition. one must not forget how this close physical contact strengthens the emotional relationship between the mother and childlJ.'4. In this regard. Allah says in the l.....r,..k C\". 0,J.....; \"The mothers shall give suck 10 their offspring for two whole years if the father desires to comp\\(;te thc tcrm. But he shall bear the COS! of their food and clothing on equitable terms. No soul shall have a burden laid Oil it greater than it can bear. No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child. nor fa ther on account of his child. An heir shall be chargeable in the same way. If Ihey both decide on weaning. by mutual coment. and after due consultation. there is no blame on them. If yc decide on a foster mother for your offspring. there is no blame on you. provided ye pay (the mother) what ye offered. on equitable terms. But fear God and know that God sees well what ye do.\" (2:233) VI. COLLEGES FOR NATllRAL THERAPEUTICS A. Definitions I. Allopathy \"SubSlituitive therapy\" auxotherapy; a therapeutic system in which disease is treated by producing a morbid reaction of another kind or in another part -a method of substitution. \"21 2. Naturopathy \"A system of therapeutics in which neither surgical nor medical agents are use-d, dependence being placed only on natural forces. '''21 3.

Podiatry Medical treatment, the specialty that includes the diagnosis and/or medical, surgical, mechanical, physical, and adjunctive treatment of the disease, injuries and defects of the human root.~1 12. Hakim Hakim is an Arabic word. Literally, it means: a wise and a knowledgeable person. In pmctice it is meant a physician without a formal education or a degree. His knowledge is through pcrsonaltuloringas well as through inheritance. The \"medicine\" that a Hakim pr.lctices is composed of a combination of herbal medicine, homeopathy, nafuropathy, chiropractic and olhers. This type of\"medicine\" is still practiced in most of the \"Developing Nations\". B. Types of Colleges There are many colleges and institutes in North America dcaling with natural healing. Among which are the following: I. Naturopathic Medicine College 2. Chiropractic Collegcs (eighteen colleges in North America). 3. Naprapathy College 4. Homeopathy College C. General Information The General Information including the course of study for these colleges of naturalthcrapeutics are found at the end of this article in the Appendices. VU. RECOMMENDATIONS ON NATURAL FOODS A. Natural Foods There are four different lypes of vitamins sold as '\"natural.\" These are: I. An extract of food concentrated so that the vitamin is in higher quantity than the original food -examples: Heart muscle as a source of B vitamins, liver and yeast as sources of B vitamins, rose hips and edible organ meats as sources of vitamin C. 2. Highly concentrated crystals or purified vitamins altered somewhat, but extracted from foods -examples: Vitamin E acetate from vegetable oils. from 8-12 as cobalamin concentratc. 3. Synthetic vitamins for which the starting materials are natural material -examples: Ascorbic Page 58-The Journal of IMA-Vol. 13-Apri11981 acid from corn sugar. Vitamin A from citral, derived from lemon grass. 4. If a natural base such as yeast is included, the addition of synthetic vitamins may not prevent the product from being called \"namral.\" Many food ~upplements include ground up deposits of rock from the desert as sources of minerals and these are called \"natural\" minerals becasue they come from natural rock deposits. B. Reading Labels When reading labels. one has to be careful for the following: I. Look for Dieiary Balance a. Are the vitamins present in proportion to their individual recommended daily intakes? b. Do B-complex formulas include all the B-complex vitamins, and are they adjusted to recommended amounts? c. Are ingredients listed in amounts of active components? d. Are insignificant amounts of vitamins included for advertising purposes? e. How much \"window dressing\" is: used? f. Are ingredients adjusted to \"cost\" rather tban requirements? 2. Know your preferences for sources 3. Look for expiration dates 4. How well are they assimilated? 5. Know what you mean by \"natural\" \"organic\" a. All vitamins are organic molecules and fall into this chemical classification. VIII. RECOMMENDA TIO!ljS TO THE MUSLIM WORLD It is recommended that the Muslim World look into the concept, phjlosophy and benefits of the natural and practical implications. It is also recommended that the ministries of public health in cooperation with the ministries of higher education should establish coUcges of natural healingans. Such colleges should include aU lypes of natural healing including the old Arab Hakim. folk medicine. homeopathy, naturopathy, chiropractic, naprapathy and the like. It is recommended that they take into considerat ion an eclectic approach as we.1I as the needs of thc M Ilslims everywhere: urban and rural areas. Since most of the peopl.e in the Mw;lim World are inclined \\.0 a natural approach of healing, such a project could be very successful, very beneficial, less expensive and much safer to the lives of the individuals. IX. OATH OF A MUSLIM PHYSICIAN For the first time in the history of America. a professional group such as the Islamic Medical Association of the USA and Canada (IMA) adopted a professional oath in 1977. This oath is known as \"The Oath of a Muslim Physician\". This oath has been adopted in English and Arabic languages and is used yearly by the members or the IMA in their annual conventions. The followingis the oath in the English language: \"Praise be to Allah (God), the Teacher. the Unique. Majesty of the heavens. lhe exalted. the glorious. Glory be to Him. the Eternal Being who created the Universe and all the creatures within. and the only Being who containeth the infinity and the ctemity. We serve no other god besides Thee and regard idolatry as an abominable injustice. Give us the strength to bc truthful, honest, modest. merciJul and objective . Givc us the fortitude to admit our mistakes, to amend our ways and to forgive the wrongs of others. Give us the wisdom to comfort and counsel all towards peace and harmony. Give us the understanding that ours IS a profession sacred that deals with your most precious gifts of IiJe and intellect. Therefore, make us worthy of thjs favoured station with honor, dignity and piety so that we may devotc Our lives in serving mankind. poor or rich, wise or illiterate. Muslim or non-Muslim. black or white, with patience and tolerance with virtue and reverence. with knowledge and vigilance. with thy love io our hearts and compassion for thy servants. thy most precious creation. Hereby we take this oath in thy name. the Creatorofall the Heavens and thecarth and follow lhy counsel as thou have revealed to Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). \"Whoever killeth a human being, not in lieu of another human being nor because of mischief on earth. as if he hath killed all mankind . And if he saveth a human life. he hath saved the life of all mankind .\" (Qur'an 5:32) The following is the Arabic version of the same oath: .-L-J I ' . ~ b.1J I..J.....:,J l..;.r I If r\".,J) ~ ~ If l. I J' J 'J I I.J' lS.; 1-..,...... ....r W I I..r,.. I X. SUMMARY The subject of \"Natural Therapeutics\" has become important in our daily life. This article has dealt with this subject vis-a-vis the Islamic approach of good and sound health. The paper included types of therapeutics , limitations of drug therapy. colleges dealing with natural therapeutics. recommendations on natural foods. recommendation s of tlte Muslim World and an \"Oath of a Muslim Physician\" . One of the important points brought out in this paper is the e.clectic approach which should be adopted through the establishment of an institute of health delivery. XI. APPENDICES The following include colleges for natural therapeutics. Some major information about them as well as the courses offered by those colleges. These appendices are important in evaluating the effectiveness of tbese colleges in training practitioners to hand Ie patients. APPENDIX ONE: CHIROPRACTIC MEDICINE Chiropractic medicine gives particular attention to the relationship of the structural and neurological aspects of the body in health and disease. Its therapeutics utilize adjustive and manjpulative procedures. physiological therapeutics, dietary supplementation. kinesiology and rehabilitative procedures, and other druglcss procedures to aid in restoration of anatomicnl relationships and physiologic capabilities. The Journal of IMA-Vol. 13-ApriI1981-Page 59 -The study of chiropractic medicine requires four and a half years and includes ~tucly of both the basic sciences (anatomy. embryology. chemistry . biochemistry. microbiology. psychology. and pathology) as well as clinical medicine. chiropractic manipulation. radiology. nutrition. and acupuncture and direct. supervised clinical experience. APPENDIX TWO: NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE Nalllropa!hic medicine is a distinct system of healing -a philosophy. science. art. and practice which seeks to promote health through education and the rational use of natural agents. As a separate profession. naturopathic medicine incorporate s all natural methods of healing. including such things as botanical medicines. homeopathy . nutritional therapy. medical electricity , psychology. and manipulative therapies. The human body possesses tremendou s power to heal itself through mechanisms of homeostasis - restoring balance in structure and function and adapting to environmental changes. The naturopathic physician uses those therapeutic substances and techniques which act in harmony with Ihe body's self\u00ad healing procc:;ses and avoids trealments which arc designed to counteract or supervene them. Ideally. naturopathic methods arc applied as a means of stimulating and enhancing this \"healing power of nature. \" The study of naturopathy requires four years. The first t\\>;\"o years emphasize basic medical sciences and include courses lTl biochemistry. microbiology, pathology. anawmy (gross amI microscopic). physiology. immunology. public health. first aid and emergency medicine. and physical diagnosis . The last two years concentrate on clinical practice and include courses in clinical diagnosis. radiology. pharmacology, psychology. physiot herapy, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics . manipulative therapy. acupunctur e. orthopedics. urology. and dermatology . In addition. clinical exlernships give direct experience in the practicc of this branch of medicine. APPENDIX THREE: NAPRAPATHY Naprapathy is a system of manually applied movements, both passive and active. designed to bring motion. with consequent release of iension, into abnormally lensed and rigid ligaments . muscles and articulations of the human body. These tissues and structures are normally moveable . ncxible and resilient. Naprapathy contends that a favorable internal environment is elisential for growth, development and maintenance of all normal health. Naprapathy's procedure s assist the body to maintain thili favorable internal environment by releasing points of tension Page 60-The Journal of IMA-Vol. 13-Apri11981 and by (he usc of rational dietary and hygienic measures . The study of naprapathy requires three years after two years of undergraduate study. Course work includes anatomy. genetics. chemistry and biochemistry, microbiology. nutrition. physiology, pathology. kinesiology. and botanical studies. and naprapathic physiology and practice. The third year concentrates mainly on clinical practice. XII. BrBUOGRAPHY I. Aikman. L. \"Naiure'~ Healing Arts: From Folk Medicine to Modern Drugs.\" Natollal Geographic Society Books. 1977. 2.
