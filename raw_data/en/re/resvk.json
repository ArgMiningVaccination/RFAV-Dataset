So how can you best avoid the flu? This what an influenza expert suggested last year: \"Move to a solitary location in the middle of a desert, stay away from everybody and lock yourself in a house,\" Ian Barr, acting director of the World Health Organisation's influenza centre at the Doherty Institute, said. He was being flippant, if you didn't realise, but he was making the point that flu is incredibly infectious, and if you're around a lot of people, or if you commute into the city every day, you are invariably going to be exposed to the disease in some form. But Dr Barr did offer a more pragmatic strategy: \"get yourself vaccinated\". How does the vaccination work? Government-subsidised vaccines are available through the national influenza program to those most at risk, such as the elderly, children under three years, people with chronic health conditions and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Otherwise, you can get an appointment with your general practitioner. It costs about $15 for the trivalent vaccine and $25 for the quadrivalent. As the names suggest, one protects against three strains and the other safeguards against the four most virulent varieties. \"If you want the best coverage, then quadrivalent is the way to go,\" Dr Barr says. The dominant flu strains vary each year and sometimes new mutations literally go viral, which means the protection has to be added to the vaccines. This is what happened last year. After a particularly bad European flu season in which a new variation spread like [that dress meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thedress-what-color-is-this-dress), the vaccine was delayed here while scientists worked some protection against it into the concoction. Reporter Liam Mannix gets a flu shot. When should I get vaccinated? It is best to get vaccinated once a year, preferably around this time of autumn. Children were disproportionately represented in flu cases in Australia in 2015, so take the kids along too. Is there a vaccine against man flu? No, but apparently [man flu isn't actually a thing](http://blogs.newcastle.edu.au/blog/2013/05/07/newcastle-researchers-question-manflu-myth/). Any other strategies? Proper hygiene helps. Incidentally, the World Health Organisation has just released some [new guidelines](http://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Hand_Hygiene_Why_How_and_When_Brochure.pdf) on the best hand-washing technique to keep germs at bay. Here are their instructions: What was last year like for flu? [Last year was a record year for flu](http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/2015-a-record-year-for-flu-cases-20150915-gjmxif.html) in Australia. There were more than 100,000 confirmed cases, a 50 per cent increase on 2014's levels. However, this is partially because reporting has been getting better since 2009's swine flu scare, and the data only goes back about 20 years. And about one quarter of all cases were children younger than 10, whose classrooms are virtually incubation chambers for flu. And what does this year look like? The 2015-16 flu season in the northern hemisphere wasn't as bad as the previous period's and peaked somewhat later than usual, but Dr Barr says it is hard to gauge what this will mean for us. As for this year's figures, we're tracking very similar to mid-April 2015 in terms of the number of flu case. Is there anything I can do to prevent an outbreak? A nifty citizen science project called [Flutracking](http://www.flutracking.net/) has been running for more than a decade, which asks you to occasionally record where you are and if you are experiencing flu symptoms. If enough people sign on, this collective information could potentially be used to help epidemiologists work out where outbreaks are happening and how the disease spreads through a population. If you sign up, you'll even get a warning if a lot of people are recording their mood as \"coughing and spluttering\" in your area.
