Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform . Foreword The Affordable Care Act opened the door to quality care for millions of Americans who had previously been shut out of our health care system. A companion to this report , \"Covered California's First Five Years: Improving Access, Affordability and Accountability \", provides an overview of how California \u2014 the state government, Covered California, and other stakeholders \u2014 are working together to use the tools provided by the Affordable Care Act to lower costs for consumers and provide meaningful choice and coverage that truly meets consumers' needs . The sta te is now building on and going beyond the Affordable Care Act on the path toward universal coverage. This report details how for more than five years, Covered California has held itself accountable as a public entity charged with assuring consumers get th e right care at the right time, while we hold the 11 health insurance companies we have chosen to contract with accountable for making sure that consumers receive high -quality care and that both insurers and providers are implementing the delivery system r eforms needed to improve care for all Californians. For Covered California, accountability means making sure health plans are meeting consumers' needs today and seeing that they are taking concerted and deliberate action to improve how health care is paid for, organized and delivered in California . The goal of this accountability is to have a health care system that truly addresses the triple aim of improving health, delivering better -quality care and lowering costs. This report focuses on how contracte d health insurers are held accountable for assuring quality care and for promoting delivery system reform. Chapter 1 describes the framework that now guides this work. Chapters 2 through 6 describe how Covered California holds insurers accountable for assu ring quality care, including not only the specific measures used to track performance, but also the progress that has been made overall and by individual insurers on these measures. Chapters 8 through 11 then summarize the approaches to holding each health insurer accountable for advancing health care delivery reform. We share this report not because we believe our work is done, but rather because it is just beginning. Improving health care quality and lowering underlying health costs is long -term pursuit. That pursuit is central to Covered California's mission , and this report identifies progress made and areas of needed attention as we move forward. Peter V.

The contract is designed to hold insurers accountable for ensur ing that people get the right care at the right time and that care is individualized for their specific needs, while seeking to improve how care is delivered and promot ing care that is increasingly high -quality, equitable and cost-effective.2 The current Atta chment 7 is composed of nine articles; each article has a distinct focus , including ensuring networks are based on value and reducing health disparities. In addition, multiple articles have elements related to quality improvement, network management and delivery system reform requirements. Attachment 7 includes a number of initiatives that require concerted, multi -year efforts of health insurance companies across the California delivery system. Insurers report annually and as part of quarterly review meetin gs with Covered California on their Attachment 7 performance. Covered California staff review and assess the information submitted for both contract compliance purposes and to assess the success of the Attachment 7 initiatives in achieving the priority out comes of quality care and effectively delivering that care. Covered California is working to update its health insurance company contract terms for the 202 2-2024 plan years and is seeking to refresh its requirements for the future that continue to address the \"Triple Aim\" of lowering costs, improving quality and improving health outco mes, with a focus on reducing health disparities . This update will include a revised framework for Attachment 7 that is organized and composed of two main strategies: Assuring Quality Care and Effective Care Delivery. This report describe s the progress Covered California contracted health insurance companies have made between 2014 and 20193 in implementing the requirements within the curr ent Attachment 7 organized by the revised framework described in Figure 1 . Covered California's Framework for Holding Plans Accountable for Quality Care and Delivery Reform Framework . Assuring Quality Care Covered California is committed to ensuring that care is individualized and equitable for not only those people currently needing or receiving treatment, but for those who are working to stay healthy. The 1 The term \"health insurance companies\" or \"insurers\" refers to the organizations providing health coverage and \"health plan\" refer s to the health coverage products they provide, such as an HMO plan vs. a PPO plan. 2 Beginning with the inaugural 2014 plan y ear and updated in 2017, Covered California set forth standards and strategies for quality improvement and delivery system reform in its QHP issuer contract, specifically in the section of the contract titled \"Attachment 7: Quality, Network Management, Del ivery System Standards Strategy\".

Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform CHAPTER 1 COVERED CALIFORNIA 2 Figure 1. Covered California's Framework for Holdin g Plans Accountable for Quality Care and Delivery Reform Framework concept of individualized , equitable care4 means regardless of one's circumstances, race, gender, where one lives or other socioeconomic factors \u2014 and for some decisions where more than one evidence -based treatment is available, based on one's values and preferences \u2014 every individual deserves the best possible care that is personalized for them and delivered in the right setting at the right time, d oes not cause harm and is the most cost -effective possible. These goals are consistent with the six domains of health care quality identified by the Institute of Medicine :5 safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable and patient -centered (STEEEP) . In add ition to assuring quality care for th ose insured through the marketplace, Covered California will continue its efforts to identify and reduce racial and ethnic health disparities for the entire population . What follow s are the organizing domains for assu ring quality care beyond the cross -cutting concept that all care should be individualized and equitable : Health promotion and prevention : Everyone is encouraged to receive preventive care services and health screening s and use support tools that promote a healthy lifestyle. This includes everything from regular checkups to smoking cessation and dietary programs. Mental health and substance use disorder treatment : Identifying, engaging and supporting through treatment people with mental health conditions and substance use disorders and ensuring that they are provided with timely and effective care that is integrated with their other health care needs. 4 In the current contract, Covered California focused health equity efforts on reduction of health disparities. While inclusive of health disparities reduction, the revised framework o f Individualized , Equitable Care is intended to capture the broad goal of care that is individualized to address an individual's health needs. 5 Committee on Quality Health Care in America, Institute of Medicine. (2001). Crossing the quality chasm: a new health system for the 21st century. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform CHAPTER 1 COVERED CALIFORNIA 3 Acute, chronic and other conditions : Actively managing care for people with acute conditions, which are defined as illness es or disease s that are short term and last typically a few days to weeks, such as an infection or an injury; chronic conditions, which typically develop slowly over time and last months to years , such as diabetes, most cancers, cardiovas cular disease, and infectious diseases like Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV); and other conditions that are temporary, such as pregnancy or gestational diabetes. Complex care: Effectively managing very complex conditions for individuals that require a multitude of specialty, high -cost treatments \u2014 such as cancer or transplants \u2014 or require end of life care. These are individuals who need to be manage d effectively or seen in ver y specialized settings by providers who know how to manage their condition well and can provide coordinated interventions. The concept of individualized , equitable care as it applies to the speci fic care domains is illustrated in Figure 2 . Covered California's Domains for Assuring Contracted Health Plans Deliver Quality Care , recognizing that some members with mental health, substance use disorders or multiple chronic conditions need care in multiple domains . Figure 2. Covered California's Domains for Assuring Contracted Health Plans Deliver Quality Care Effective Care Delivery In addition to addressing various populations and the care they receive, Covered California also focuses on effective care delivery strategies and its contractual requirements promote improving the way care is delivered for our enrollees and all Californians , whether it is provided by a primary care physician, hospital, clinic or other provider. What follow s are the organizing strategies for effective care delivery: Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform CHAPTER 1 COVERED CALIFORNIA 4 Effective primary car e: The foundation of providing appropriate and equitable care is built on team -based, data -driven primary care that is well integrated, coordinated and continuous. While many consumers benefit from an ongoing continuous relationship with a single physician, there is strong evidence that primary care through well-integrated sites of care or delivery systems are more effective . Promotion of integrated delivery systems and account able care organization s: Effectively caring for and managing a person's health requires an integrated care system that can coordinate across providers, sites and time for a variety of conditions while delivering good outcomes and quality at an affordable c ost. Networks based on value : All clinicians, providers, hospitals and sites of care are selected and regularly assessed based on how those individuals or institutions provide care that is safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable, and patient -centered . Ideally, every network is composed of integrated systems, effective primary care and designed considering the value it provides. Regardless of the organizing strategies \u2014 whether focused on primary care, an integrated delivery system or the overall netwo rk \u2014 Covered California aims to ensur e the interventions that patients receive are both appropriate and delivered through sites and services that meet their needs : Appropriate intervention s: The use of clinical interventions, such as prescription s, procedu res, diagnostic tests and devices that are rooted in the STEEEP domains and based on strong evidence and shared decision -making . Sites and expanded approaches to care delivery : Covered California supports patients in getting health interventions and treatments in the most appropriate setting . That means assuring quality care is delivered not only in hospitals, whether on an in -patient or outpatient basis , but in ambulatory settings such as a doctor's office , urgent care facil ities, retail facilities such as drop - in clinics , at home , or through telehealth . Expanded approaches to care delivery also include who provides care in addition to physicians , such as registered nurses, pharmacists, midwives or other non -licensed provider s like community health workers. Key Drivers of Quality Care and Effective Delivery Covered California recognizes that moving health reform forward in an impactful way within a delivery system shared among many purchasers and health insurance companies will require aligning with other purchasers and working with all relevant payers in a way that reduces the burden on providers. When considering the key drivers of quality care and effective delivery, Covered California has looked to the National Quality S trategy6 and mirrored many of the same levers initially noted in 2011. Many of these levers or drivers are specifically articulated as expectations of health insurers in Attachment 7 as ways to assure individuals get the right care . Insurers are working to improve the delivery system over time. However, some of the \"community drivers \" that are identified may be outside of the scope of an individual insurer's responsibility or Covered California's contract. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize these dr ivers are a part of the context within which health care is delivered and the quality of health that consumers experience. Examples of community drivers are de tailed after the roster of drivers specific to health insurer's work. Key drivers include: 6 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. (2011) 2011 Report to Congress: National Strategy for Quality Improvement in Heal th Care. Retrieved from https://www.ahrq.gov/workingforquality/reports/2011 -annual -report.html Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform CHAPTER 1 COVERED CALIFORNIA 5 1. Benefi t design : Helping consumers make informed decisions by standardizing benefit designs , so they are easier to understand and compare , and incentivize access to the right care at the right time . Benefit design may include incentives to encourage patients to use particular providers or particular sites of care or formulary and other designs to encourage providers to select particular interventions as appropriate . 2. Measurement for improvement, choice and accounta bility : Provid ing meaningful and actionable performance feedback to providers, insurers and the public to improve care and compare treatment results, cost and patient experiences for consumers. 3. Payment: Reward ing and incentiviz ing delivery of high -quality , patient -centered care that promotes better health, quality improvement and value while also fostering innovation, improving efficiency and adopting evidence -based practices. 4. Patient -centered social needs : Identifying , and, as needed, addressing patient -centered support for non -medical services, recognizing that many people may face barriers that prevent them from staying healthy and receiving the right care at the right time, such as food insecurity , housing insecurity and lack of transportation to their d octor . 5. Patient and consumer engagement : Increas ing support for and the level of participation by patients and consumers in managing their health and making their personal health care decisions. 6. Data sharing : Making patient data available and accessible to support clinical care and coordination, decrease health care costs, reduce paperwork, improve outcomes and give patients more control over their health care. 7. Data analytics : Inspecting, transforming and modeling data to discover timely and reliable information that will aid in a patient or provider's decision -making processes. 8. Administrative simplification and provider burden reduction : Implementing system changes to maximize the time providers spend with patients and minimize unnecessary administrative burden. 9. Certification, accreditation and regulatio n: Employing e xisting regulatory and accreditation processes and work with other agencies and departments to ensure approache s meet safety and quality standards. For example, California's Department s of Insurance and Managed Health Care enforce the regulatory standards that Covered California relies on for network adequacy . The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) , among others, conducts health plan accreditation. 10. Quality improvement and technical assistance : Promoting initiatives that will lead to better patient outcomes and better care delivery approaches , strengthening the evidence base to inform better decision -making and f ostering learning environments that offer training, resources, tools and guidance to help organizations achieve quality improvement goals. Beyond the drivers of more effective care and healthier populations that relate to what an individual insur er can do or be held accountable for , Covered California recognizes and seeks to better understand the impact of broader social and structural issues on health status, care and care delivery. Community health drivers include: Workforce: Investing in people to prepare the next generation of health care professionals and support lifelong learning for providers. Community -wide social determinants : Addressing structural social and economic influences that impact individual and group differen ces in health. Population and public health : Increasing the health of a community through broad interventions that address public health, homelessness o r food insecurity.Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 2 COVERED CALIFORNIA 6 ASSURING QUALITY CARE Chapter 2: Individualized, Equitable Care \u2014 Best Possible Care for All Covered California's overarching goal is to ensure that everyone receives the best possible health care . This goal entails striving to ensure that care is personalized, does not cause harm, is delivered in the right setting at the right time, and is as cost effective as possible. For decisions where more than one evidence -based treatment is available, the goal is to support individuals in choosing treatment based on their values and preferences. In the framework proposed by the Institute of Medicine 20 years ago, everyone should receive care that is safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable, and patient - centere d (often captured by the acronym \"STEEEP\") .7 Unfortunately, the quality of care delivered in the United States varies dramatically . Of the elements related to the Institute of Medicine's framework, the domain that has too often not been given central focus is the charge to ensure that care is equitable. Addressing health equity and disparities in health care has been integral to Covered California's mission. Given that focus, after reviewing some important overall indicators of how health plans are generally meeting consumers' needs, much of this chapter specifically addresses Covered California's focus on the issue of equity. The other domains of the STEEEP framework are addressed throughout the report and are integral to Covered California's approach. The Quality Rating System (QRS) , which includes performance measures based both on clinical measures and on patients' reported experience of getting care, provides a global pict ure of how Covered California's health plans are doing at providing the best possible care . In this chapter, the Global and Summary Components of the 7 Committee on Quality Health Care in America, Institute of Medicine. (2001). Crossing the quality chasm: a new health sy stem for the 21st century. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press. Covered California enrollees are generally very satisfied with their experience with their health plans and their health care, with the vast majority enrolled in plans that score above the 50th percentile for enrollee satisfaction with their health care and plan. Global Quality Ratings have improved since their launch in 2016, but a dip in 2019 has generated further scrutiny. Covered California has launched a long - term initiative to reduce health disparities. In response to contractual requirements , 93 percent of enrollees are in plans that were at or above the 80 percent requirement for enrollee self -identification o f race/ethnicity . All 11 insurers are analyzing disparities in care for patients with diabetes, hypertension, asthma and depression for all of their lines of business , not just Covered California , and planning targeted interventions . Gaps in quality by rac e/ethnicity were found for all insurers \u2014 but were not consistent (e.g., for some insurers African Americans warranted targeted interventions for diabetes, and Latinos in others). Racial and ethnic disparities are generally smaller than the differences i n quality across plans: enrollment in Sharp Health Plan or Kaiser Permanente is a better predictor of receiving good care than race or ethnicity is. Nevertheless, all insurers have identified a disparity where a targeted intervention can improve help reduce disparities and improve health. Highlights Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 2 COVERED CALIFORNIA 7 health plan quality ratings are presented, along with two measures that relate to enrollee satisfaction with their health plan and their care. Social, economic and geographic disparities in health and health care pose a particularly serious challenge to the goal of ensuring the best possible care for all. Because social and environmental factors are powerful d eterminants not only of the care individuals receive but also of their underlying health, reducing disparities requires efforts within the health care delivery system and in the broader community. Covered California r ecogni zes that meaningful progress will require multi -pronged and multi -year efforts . Covered California is working to reduc e disparities and promote health equity. To this end, Covered California has hired a new health equity officer who plans, implements and integrates Covered California's health equity agenda with Covered California's quality improvement and delivery system reform efforts. The health equity officer leads the work of the new Population Care Unit within the Plan Management Division, which is composed of staff positions dedicat ed to quality improvement, health equity and social determinants of health. Covered California is work ing with health plans to reduce health disparities and promote health equity by: (1) identifying the race /ethnicity of all enrollees; (2) collecting data on diabetes, hypertension, asthma and depression to measure how quality varies by race /ethnicity; (3) conducting population health -improvement activities and interventions to narrow observed disparities in care; and (4) promoting community health initiatives that foster better health, healthier environments, and promote healthy behaviors. This chapter describes how Covered California has moved forward in each of these areas. This chapter on individualized, equitable care is organized as follows: Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Section 2. Health Plan -Reported Measures for Health Disparities Section 3. Implications for the Future Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Health Plan Measures Reported to the Quality Rating System This section presents performance data reported by health insurance companies for contract requirements and includes assessments and observations by Covered California. One key mechanism used by Covered California for health plan oversight and accountability is public reporting of global and individual health plan quality -performance measures to the Center s for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Marketplace Quality Rating System (QRS). In th e current contract requirements, health plans are required to: 1. Annually collect and report to Covered California for each product type the measure numerator, denominator and rates for its QRS data, including Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures, Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey data and other performance data . 2. Submit HEDIS and CAHPS scores to include the measure numerator, denominator and rate for the required measures set reported to NCQA Quality Compass and the Department of Health Care Services ( DHCS ), for each product type for which it has data in California. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 2 COVERED CALIFORNIA 8 Global and Summary Component Health Plan Quality Ratings The Marketplace QRS global quality ratings show how health plans compare on helping members get the right medical care and on member -reported experiences of care and service. Covered California displays each health plan's QRS rating to enrollees through the plan shopping experience and on coveredca.com. Plans are rated on a scale of one to five stars. To assign the star rating, each h ealth plan's results are compared to about 200 marketplace health plans nationwide. A five -star plan means that health plan scored among the top plans nationwide; a one -star rating means the plan's score was among the lowest. QRS is composed of a global q uality rating s and summary component ratings for three major aspects of health plan performance.8 Each health plan's product (HMO, PPO, EPO ) receives a separate QRS rating. Global quality rating : The global quality rating is a roll -up of three summary comp onents per the following weighting: Summary Components Weights Getting Right Care (HEDIS) 66% Members' Experience (CAHPS) 17% Plan Services (HEDIS and CAHPS) 17% A global quality rating is constructed for each health plan that has at least two of the three component scores, and one of the scores must be for the \"Getting the right care \" component : Getting the right care : Each year, a sample of members from each hea lth plan is selected , and their records are checked to compare their medical care with national standards for care and evidence -based treatments. More than 30 HEDIS measures are tracked using medical charts and billing records sent by providers and hospitals. These quality measures include how well the health plan and its providers care for enrollees , such as control ling high blood pressure, lower ing cholesterol and get ting the right medications. Members' care experience : Members' experiences wit h their doctor and care are based on the CAHPS survey that asks about members' recent experiences when visiting the doctor and getting medical care. About one of every five people who receive a survey in the mail or by phone provide s a response, with about 250 members from each plan completing surveys. CAHPS surveys are currently only available in English or Spanish, but insurers are encouraged to translate the surveys into other languages that reflect their patient population. Translation guidelines are re adily available from CMS . Plan services for members : A sample of plan members' records is checked to see if patients got unnecessary care \u2014 services that could be harmful and wasteful. The CAHPS member survey is also used to report on members' experiences in getting help and information from the insurer's customer service staff. 8 See the Appendix 2 for the complete list of measures used to determine each summary component rating of QRS. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 2 COVERED CALIFORNIA 9 The QRS ratings of Covered California health plans ha ve generally improved over time , but there was a downward trend in 2019 .9 For the 201 9 reporting year, which represents the 20 18 measurement year, the overall trend is lower star ratings compared to 2018 : for the global rating, only one plan has a 5 -star rating and one plan has a 4 -star rating while most have 2 and 3 -star ratings (see Table 1. Global Quality Ratings by Reportable Products for Individual and CCSB Markets, 2016 -2019 ). Table 1.

Covered California health plans generally performed well on the Plan Services for Members component rating , with all plans receiving a 3 -star rating or above on this component. 9 The 201 8 reporting year, which represent ed the 201 7 measurement year, was impacted by a federal statistical methodology that appears to have inflated star ratings for that year. Covered California is working with CMS to achieve a more stable methodology that will allow better year -to-year comparisons of star ratings based on changes in performance. This affected only the star rating, not the underlying measure scores reported below.

Source: Covered California Health Plan QRS Reporting Enrollee Satisfaction With Their Health Care and Health Plan Assuring that care is patient -centered requires assessment of a range of elements, including the extent to which patients receive the right c are, at the right time , and in the most appropriate setting. As discussed in Chapter 10: Appropriate Interventions, it also means that care provided is informed and based on the patient's preferences and their understanding of the implications of their cho ices. At a high level, however, a starting point of making sure care is patient -centered is considering patient voices in assessing health plans' performance. Among the health plan measures reported to the Marketplace Quality Rating System are Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measures that reflect consumers' perspectives and their reported experience with care received. These Marketplace Quality Rating System (QRS) standard performance measures are a key mechanism used by Covered California for health plan oversight and accountability . To more sharply focus health plan accountability efforts, Covered California examined over 40 measures used by QRS and is proposin g to prioritize a subset of 13 measures that were selected based on the following criteria: (1) health impact ; (2) extent of health plan variation; (3) performance improvement opportunity; (4) alignment with other California accountability programs; and (5) balance across domains of care , such as prevention, chronic illness care and behavioral health. Three of the 13 measures overlap with the measures currently collected by race/ethnicity for health disparities reduction interventions as discussed in Sectio n 2 of this chapter. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 2 COVERED CALIFORNIA 11 The following tables display the priority measures for individualized, equitable care in the QRS measure set and include the Covered California weighted average, the highest - and lowest -performing plans, plan-specific performance and national percentiles for all marketplace plans: 1. Rating of Health Plan (Table 3) . 2. Rating of All Health Care (Table 4) . These t wo CAHPS questions the reflect consumers' overall satisfaction with their health plan and the care they received . As evident from each of these measures, there is generally high satisfaction among Covered California enrollees with their health plans (with 95 percent of enrollees reporting satisfaction that is above the 50th percentile nationally) and with the ir care (75 percent of enrollees reporting satisfaction that is above the 50th percentile nationally) .

Reducing health disparities is part of Covered California's vision and mission statement and has the potential to benefit all Ca lifornians (with over 4 million consumers served to date through Covered California10) and because the populations measured and targeted for improvement by health insurance companies include all of their enrollees under age 65 across all lines of business. While disparities are influenced by social and economic factors beyond the control of the health care deli very system, there is agreement and evidence that health care disparities can be narrowed through quality improvement activities tailored to the needs of specific populations and targeting select measures at the health plan level. To this end , Covered California has laid out a health disparities and health equity agenda centered on four requirements : 1. Promoting community health initiatives that foster better health, healthier environments and healthy behaviors . 2. Identifying the race or ethnicity of all enrollee s through self -identification or imputed methodology . 3. Collecting data by race/ethnicity for disease control and management measures for asthma, depression, diabetes and hypertension \u2014 conditions with especially high levels of morbidity and mortalit y experienced by disadvantaged populations . 4. Conducting population -health improvement activities and interventions to narrow observed disparities in care . See Section 2 for information on h ealth plan progress in conducting interventions to narrow observed disparities in care and collecting data by race/ethnicity for disease control and management measures for asthma, depression, diabetes and hypertension . Promoting Community Health Initiatives That Foster Better Health, Healthier Environments, and Promotion of Healthy Behavior s Under contract requirements, Covered California included requirements for engagement and promotion of community -wide initiatives that foster better health, healthier environments, and the promotion of healthy behaviors across the comm unity. Covered California specifically encourage d community health initiatives that have undergone or are being piloted through systematic review to determine 10 This figure only includes on -exchange enrollment since 2014.

Covered California's Mission and Vision Covered California's vision is to improve the health of all Californians by assuring their access to affordable, high quality care. Covered California's mission is to increase the number of insured Californians, improve health care quality, lower costs, and reduce health disp arities through an innovative, competitive marketplace that empowers consumers to choose the health plan and providers that give them the best value. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 2 COVERED CALIFORNIA 15 effectiveness in promoting health and preventing disease, injury or disability and have been recommended by the Community Preventive Services Ta sk Force. Such programs may include: 1. Partnerships with local, state, or federal public health departments such as Let's Get Healthy California . 2. CMS Accountable Health Communities . 3. Organizations that operate preventive and other health programs , such as Cal Fresh . 4. Hospital activities undertaken under the Community Health Needs Assessment required every three years under the Affordable Care Act. Table 5. Covered California Insurer Activities to Improve Community Health , 2018 shows health insurer report ed initiatives, programs and projects that improve community health apart from the health delivery system. Health insurance company involvement in external -facing activities is used by Covered California to identify potential disparity -reduction opportunit ies. Identifying the Race or Ethnicity of All Enrollees Understanding disparities in care requires data collection on demographics and other social determinants of health. Health insurance companies vary in the degree to which demographic data is collected and integrated into member records. While state law requires health insurance companies to collect race, ethnicity, and language data, insurers use different methods to obtain this information and have different rates for the percentage of membership self -identifying race /ethnicity (i.e. race/ethnicity self-identification rates).11 Before the initiatives described below, no purchaser or state agency in California monitored the success of collecting s elf-identification rates and there had been no broad attempt to use the data to evaluate disparities in care. To achieve high self -identification rates across all health insurance companies , Covered California set a goal for all insurers to achieve identif ication of at least 80 percent of all Covered California membership by year-end 2019 and encouraged use of various data collection methods beyond the membership enrollment application to identify race/ethnicity . Starting with the 2018 plan year, insurers w ere assessed on a contract performance standard for the self -identification rate and receive d financial penalties or credits based on whether they achieve d the target. Insurers proposed intermediate milestones for the performance standard for the 2018 plan year and will be assessed on whether they achieve d a target of 80 percent in 2019. Based on analysis of data gathered for this performance standard, eight insurers have achieved the 80 percent target as of 2018 and some have exceeded 95 percent. Insurers have attributed the increased identification rates to improved data collection and incorporation of best practices for asking enrollees for race/ethnicity information. 11 Senate Bill 853, Chapter 717, Statutes of 2009.

The race/ethnicity question in the Covered California enrollment application is voluntary and is included in the enrollment file sent to insurers . Beyond enrollment data, insurers have re ported receiving data from providers, customer service, health risk assessments and website registration . Methods for data collection vary by insurer , resulting in considerable variation during 2015 -18 in how well each insurer met Covered California's goal s for ensuring race/ethnicity identification for quality improvement purposes.12 While all insurers have demonstrated improvement towards the 2019 target, it is important to note that these rates represent Covered California membership only. As discussed in Section 2 . Health Plan - Reported Measures for Health Disparities, an objective of the health equity agenda is to track and trend a select set disparities measures that include a health insurance company's full book of business excluding Medicare . Larger nu mbers are necessary to be able to accurately measure performance, especially for relatively small minority populations. Identification of member race/ethnicity when reporting health disparities measures is similarly challenging. For this reason, Covered Ca lifornia has encouraged insurers to supplement self -reported identification with a proxy methodology based on surname and census track . Covered California will continue to work with insurers to improve and validate self -identification of race and ethnicity . Section 2. Health Plan Reported Measures and Efforts to Narrow Health Disparities Many of Covered California's contracted health insurance companies have been actively engaged in efforts t o understand and address health care disparities for many years. These efforts are reflected in a range of activities . Four of Covered California's health insurance companies , Health Net, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Southern California, L.A. Care and Molina Healthcare , representing 36 percent (503,220 out of 1,384,030) of enrollment in 2018 earned the National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA) Distinction in Multicultural Health Care (MHC), a program that recognizes organizations that provide cu lturally and linguistically sensitive services and work to reduce disparities in health and health care.13 In 2017, Covered California began an initiative to measure and seek improvement in health equity across all contracted insurers . In collaboration wit h health insurance companies and consumer 12 In 2018, Covered California examined current self -identification rates in the Covered California enrollment file to compare to insurer reported rates. Covered California's self -identification rate in 2017 was 75.5 percent across all insurers . In theory, insurer reported rates should be equal to or higher than the rate provided in the enrollment file, assuming all data is transferred to the insurer and the insurer's other avenues of data collection suppleme nt the race/ethnicity field in its membership file. In practice, some insurers have reported considerably lower rates and are currently evaluating internal data collection to understand the discrepancies. Covered Calif ornia is also aware of some errors in the 834 data transmission related to race/ethnicity categorization and is acti vely working on a system change request to appropriately identify membership answering this question in the enrollment application. 13 See more: https://www.ncqa.org/ programs/health -plans/multicultural -health -care-mhc/ . Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 2 COVERED CALIFORNIA 18 stakeholders, Covered California targeted four conditions that affect large numbers of consumers , have serious potentially avoidable complications, and for which there is strong evidence of racial or ethnic disparities: Asthm a: Although asthma affects all populations, the burden of this disease falls disproportionately on minority populations: the prevalence of childhood asthma is 12 .7 percent among non -Hispanic blacks compared to 8 percent among non -Hispanic whites and 6.4 percent among Hispanics . Even m ore striking , the asthma mortality rate among non -Hispanic black children is nearly eight times that of non -Hispanic whites.14 Depression : National surveys indicate that nearly one in six Americans has experienced a major depressive episode, with many experiencing multiple episodes. Depression is a leading cause of disability and death , largely related to the nearly tenfold highe r risk of suicide among those with depression.15 Depression is undertreated in all populations, but more so among minorities. Although 40 percent of non -Latino whites with depression failed to receive treatment, 64 percent of Latinos, 69 percent of Asians, and 59 percent of African Americans failed to receive any treatment.16 Diabetes: While diabetes affects almost 10 percent of the U.S. population overall, the prevalence in Hispanics (11.9 percent) and African Americans (13.4 percent) is much hig her than it is in non -Hispanic Whites. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death and contributes to an increased risk of heart attacks, stroke, amputation and kidney disease.17 Hypertension : Almost one third of adults have hypertension (high blood pre ssure), a major risk factor for heart attacks (the leading cause of death in the U.S.) and strokes (the seventh leading cause of death). The prevalence of hypertension among non -Hispanic blacks (41 percent) is substantially higher than among whites (29 per cent) or Hispanics (28 percent). Among those with hypertension, the proportion who were well controlled differed dramatically: whites at 53 percent, non -Hispanic blacks at 43 percent and Hispanics at 30 percent.18 Because of the public health importance of these conditions and the serious disparities in health and health care that have been documented and the potential for targeted interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality, Covered California selected 14 measures related to these conditio ns to track , of which five are National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures and nine are based on Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI). Importantly, t hese measures are now being reported by insurers annually not only for Covered California's enrollees , but also for all non-Medicare commercial 14 Forno, E., and Celed\u00f3n, J. C.

Covered California Insurer \"All- Plan\" Reported Measures for Health Disparities ). Data for the full non -Medicare population was required for the following principal reasons: (1) narrowing disparities requires quality improvement intervention s regardless of coverage type ; (2) the la rger population size makes measurement of disparities more accurate ; and (3) high turnover in the individual market results in consumers transitioning to other sources of coverage, such as employer - based coverage or Medi -Cal. These markets are served by th e same health insurance companies that participate in Covered California . During the first year of reporting for plan year 2015, insurers reported on 10 measures, and an additional four measures were phased in for plan year 2016. Insurers will continue reporting the data for all 14 measures through plan year 2020 as Covered California continues to evaluate insurer's data and the progress of planned interventions . Table 7.

In addition to serving different geographies with known variation s among them, each insurer has a very different mix of population served ranging from Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 2 COVERED CALIFORNIA 20 predominantly employer -based commercial enrollees to predominantly Medi -Cal enrollees . Insurers also have varying quality of data, most aggregating 400 -person HEDIS samples for each line of business but some having access to robust clinical data from electronic health records. For these reasons and more as detailed in Appendix 1: Limitations and Major Caveats about Health Disparities Data, Covered California has determined that the results cannot be used to compare p erformance across plans. However, Covered California and each insurer found actionable difference s in measures across race/ethnicity groups that justify interventions. In addition, one of the key observations was that the apparent dispa rities based on race/ethnicity were in almost all cases far smaller than the differences in care or treatment across health plans \u2014 with enrollment in Kaiser Permanente or Sharp Health Plan being a far better predictor of receiving good care than race/ethn icity. This observation was consistent with Covered California's findings regarding the generally superior care provided by integrated delivery systems (see Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 ). The following sections present high -level summaries of key trends based on preliminary analysis of insurer -reported data and examples of disparity reduction proposals. Conducting Population Health Improvement Activities and Interventions to Narrow Observe d Disparities in Care After collect ion and submi ssion of three years of baseline data for the indicators of potential gaps in care related to the four conditions , Covered California has work ed with each insurer to select a quality improvement project aimed at narrowing a health care disparity found in the baseline data related to the four target conditions . Covered California has met with each insurer to discuss opportunities for conducting quality improvement activities and in terventions to na rrow each health insurer's specific observed health care disparities. In 2020, e ach Covered California insurer will implement a quality improvement project aimed at narrowing a health care disparity and will periodically report their progress. Covered California will h old insurers accountable for narrowing the selected disparity while maintaining or improving outcomes for targeted enrollees , which in most cases encompasses more than just Covered Cali fornia members \u2014 sometimes including all commercial enrollees and other enrollees in the individual market or all Medi -Cal enrollees . In addition to data reporting and analysis, insurers are reporting progress on infrastructure and staffing enhancements needed to develop their health care disparity reduction project, as well as related and aligned activities to support this Covered California initiative. These activities range in scope and scale: some represent the next phase of multi -year efforts while o thers are starting by proposing time -limited or smaller scale projects. The following are examples of activities reported by insurer s: Enhanced member education, messaging, incentives and self -management tools . Enhanced provider education and clinical guid ance reminders . Streamlin ed data collection processes to increase reporting and monitoring quality . Focused partnerships with community stakeholders . Disease registry development and sharing between providers and insurers . Outreach events and mobile care in at -risk communities . Enhanced care team support for affected populations.

The Covered California initiative to promote health equity through individualized, equitable care for all is just beginning. As described in this chapter, finding appropriate data to use as a baseline for building strategies has been and will continue to b e a challenge until all insurers have more complete clinical data. Despite these challenges, insurers have found actionable disparities and early initiatives are underway. As with other efforts to improve the performance of the health care system, addressi ng disparities in health and health care can best be accomplished by using data and evidence to understand the underlying causes of poor performance and by working with all involved to develop, test and spread successful interventions. Even accounting fo r differences in measurement and populations , the findings regarding disparities in care suggest that on some measures, the more integrated health insurance companies report better quality scores for all groups - to levels that are among the best in the co untry. While some of these insurers have long invested in and hired staff to support culturally competent care , these findings suggest that integrated and coordinated approaches to care delivery may reduce racial or ethnic disparities on some measures of q uality . Covered California is evaluat ing progress and identify ing opportunities for expansion of its health equity program in the future , including potentially analyzing health outcomes based on other demographic categories such as: (1) income; (2) disability status; (3) sexual orientation; (4) gender identity; and (5) limited English proficiency (LEP). Since the data is collected across all lines of business, Covered California will seek collaboration with other purchasers, especially the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) , which oversees California's Medi -Cal program that serves over approximately one third of the entire California population. Covered California is also c onsidering encouraging all insurers to acquire the National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA) Distinction in Multicultural Health Care (MHC) as this program recognizes organizations that provide culturally and linguistically sensitive services and that work to reduce disp arities in health and health care. In the current contract, Covered California requires its insurers to engage in and report on efforts to impact the health of populations beyond their enrollees . Both the data provided by th e insurers and research conducted by Health Management Associates ( HMA ) did not find evidence of the efficacy of such interventions.19 There is, however, evidence of the impact of health insurance companies focusing on specific social determinants of health for enroll ed populations \u2014 such as providing transportation or food assistance for insured individuals with particular needs. Given these findings, Covered California is reassessing the contractual expectations of its insurers for addressing social determinants of health. Covered California has a potentially critical role to play in promoting broad engagement among public and private purchasers to address health equity . In work commissioned by Covered California, PricewaterhouseCoopers found that while focusing on health equity and disparities was a priority for public purchasers, very few private purchasers consider this issue a priority.20 19 The most current best evidence is documented in Chapter 1, Health Equity: Reducing Disparities, of a companion Covered Califo rnia report, Current Best Evidence and Performance Measures for Improving Quality of Care and Delivery System Reform . 20 \"Health Purchaser Strategies for Improving Quality of Care and Delivery System Reform.\" Review conducted for Covered California by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 3 COVERED CALIFORNIA 25 Chapter 3: Health Promotion and Prevention Health Promotion and Prevention relates to health insurance company activities to encourage all enrollees to receive preventive care services and health screenings and use tools that promote a healthy lifestyle. This includes everything from regular checkups to smoking cessation and dietary programs. This chapter on Health Promotion and Prevention is organized as follows: Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Section 2. Health Plan Measures Reported to the Marketplace Quality Rating System Section 3. Implications for the Future Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Qualified Health Plan Experience presents performance data reported by health insurance companies for contract requirements and includes assessments and observations by Covered California. Prevention and wellness are key components of high -value health care. Research shows that treating those who are sick is often far costlier and less effective than preventing disease from occurring and keeping populations healthy. Prevention occurs at three levels, each of which is important in promoting e nrollee health and wellness and each of which is represented in Covered California's prevention reporting and requirements. Primary Prevention: Primary prevention focuses on intervening before a health event occur s. Promotion of healthy behaviors and vaccinations are forms of primary prevention that insurers play a role in promoting. Intervening on risk factors for disease, like obesity or smoking status, is also a form of primary prevention. Secondary Prevention: Secondary prevention includes screening f or diseases to identify diseases at an early stage. The positive impact of timely screening for Kaiser Permanente frequently performed at or above the 90th percentile nationally on preventive screening measures while most other plans performed in the 25th to 90th percentile . For the three HEDIS preventive care measures Covered California identified as priority measures \u2014 breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening \u2014 not only was there wide variation observed among plans over the past four years , but from two to six health plans repor ted performance below the 25th percentile nationally \u2014 highlighting both the need and opportunity for improvement . Across insurers, there exist robust health communication processes to inform enrollees about health and wellness benefits. Insurers offered information about free preventive services, offered a 24/7 telephonic nurse line, inbound and outbound telephonic coaching, as well as member reminders. Contract requirements call for reporting on tobacco cessation and obesity management programs, but this data was incomplete due to the lack of access to clinical data for most insurers. Covered California is looking at the feasibility of (1) better collection of clinical data to improve enrollee identification or requiring insurers to do so and (2) better tracking of program availability and participation rates. Covered California is assess ing what factors contribute to better performance among some providers in non-Kaiser Permanente insurers and how Kaiser Permanente 's performance can be replicated across California. Highlights Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 3 COVERED CALIFORNIA 26 cancer, for example, is well documented. This screening helps providers identify and treat cancers early, before symptoms appear. Tertiary Prevention: Tertiary prevention focuses on m anaging diseases after a diagnosis to help slow or stop disease progression and prevent debilitating or other negative impacts of disease. Covered California's prevention and wellness requirements are centered on identifying enroll ees who are eligible for certain preventive and wellness benefits , notifying enrollees about the availability of these services , and making sure those eligible receive appropriate services. Proactively identifying and notifying enrollees eligible for prevention and wellness benefits, monitoring health status and making appropriate referrals, and ensuring at -risk enrollees receive proactive coordinated care all center around making sure people get the right preventive care when they need it at all three levels of prevention, instead of waiting until more serious and costly manifestations of disease prompt care. Covered California has identified several priority disease areas for reporting, incl uding those with significant evidence around the importance of prevention. Under contract requirements , insurers are required to report the following: 1. Utilization of tobacco cessation intervention services; 2. Utilization of obesity management services; 3. Processes for communicating health and wellness benefits to enrollees and providers and the way they incorporate and use of enrollee -specific health and wellness information ; and 4. Utilization of necessary preventive services through the following select HEDIS m easure s: breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, and chlamydia screening for women. Tobacco Cessation Covered California h ealth insurance companies reported significant data challenges in reporting both the number of tobacco dependent enrollees and participati on rates in smoking cessation programs. Integrated delivery systems, such as Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan , reported the most consistent data year -over-year, likely due to having access to clin ical data that confirms a diagnosis of tobacco dependency. Other insurers were hampered by data challenges that include a lack of access to clinical data, inability to track physician referrals to tobacco cessation programs or educational classes offered b y medical groups that are not documented or billed on a claim, reliance on enrollee provided data in health risk assessments that are not universally administered , and inability to track by lines of business , such as Covered California membership . Given th is set of challenges, the available data reported for both Covered California enrollees and members in all lines of business (inclusive of Covered California) ranged between less than 1 percent to as high as 70 percent.21 Covered California cautions these figures are likely incomplete . Future requirements in this area will need to consider the feasibility of (1) collecting clinical data to improve identification of tobacco dependent members and (2) better trac king of program availability and participation rates. 21 Health plans reporting participation rates on the high end of the range generally had a far smaller number of enrollees ident ified as tobacco dependent. Covered California did not calculate a weighted average participation rate due to incomplete reporting and data collection challenges. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 3 COVERED CALIFORNIA 27 Obesity Management Covered California health insurance companies experienced a similar set of challenges for tracking obese members; the most important of which is the lack of access to clinical data that documents a diagnosis of obesity. Some insurers also reported they do not track specific lines of business, such as Covered California membership, for participation in weight management programs. Some insurers relied on data through health risk assessments, wellness portals, and self -referrals by enrollees. Given this set of challenges, the available 2018 data reported for Covered California enrollees ranged between less than 1 percent to roughly 40 percent. For m embers in all lines of business (inclusive of Covered California),22 the 2018 data ranged between roughly 1 percent to nearly 20 percent. Again, Covered California cautions these figures are likely incomplete. Future requirements in this area will need to c onsider the feasibility of (1) collecting clinical data to improve identification of obese members and (2) better tracking of program availability and participation rates. Processes for Communicating Health and Wellness Benefits Through annual reporting , health insurance companies report ed the methods used to communicat e health and wellness benefits to enrollees using pre -defined categories , such as customized printed materials about free preventive services or 24/7 telephonic nurse lines. Table 12. Processes for Communicating Health and Wellness Benefits for Commercial and Covered California Enrollees , 2016 summarizes this data which reflects insurers' activities in 2016 as this information was not required in later reporting . Health communication processes offered to enrollees are relatively consistent across health insurance companies . Most or all insurers offered information, both template and customized, about free preventive services, offer ed a 24/7 telephonic nurse line, inbound and outbound telephonic coaching, as well as member care service reminders. While not universally used, most health insurance companies report ed using nurse lines for specific populations (i.e. , complex conditions or oncology patients) as well as interacti ve voice response (I VR) member care/service reminders (offered by 7 out of 12 insurers ). 22 Health plans reporting participation rates on the high end of the range generally had a far smaller number of enrollees ident ified as tobacco dependent. Covered California did not calculate a weighted average participati on rate due to incomplete reporting and data collection challenges.

Health Plan Measures Reported to the Marketplace Quality Rating System Health Plan Measures Reported to the Marketplace Quality Rating System detail s health plan performance on Healthcare Effectiveness Data Information Set (HEDIS) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measures reported to the Center s for Medicaid and Medicare Services' Quality Rating System (QRS). These sta ndard performance measures are a key mechanism used by Covered California for health plan oversight and accountability . To more sharply focus health plan accountability efforts, Covered California examined over 40 measures used by QRS and is proposing to p rioritize a subset of 1 3 measures that were selected based on the following criteria: (1) health impact ; (2) extent of health plan variation; (3) performance improvement opportunity; (4) alignment with other California accountability programs; and (5) bala nce across domains of care , such as prevention, chronic illness care and behavioral health. Three of the 13 measures also overlap with the measures currently collected by race/ethnicity for health disparities reduction interventions as discussed in Chapter 2. The following tables display the three measures for Health Promotion and Prevention in the QRS measure set that Covered California has identified as priority measures (with eight a dditional measures detailed in Appendix 2: Additional Health Plan Measures Reported to the Quality Rating System ). 23 The 11 health insurance companies in Covered California are: Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California, Chinese Community Health Plan, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, L.A. Care, Moli na Healthcare, Oscar Health, Sharp Health Plan, Valley Health Plan, and Western Health Advantage.

For the Health Promotion and Prevention measures, some of the overall observations include: Kaiser Permanente frequently performed at or above the 90th percentile nationally on preventive screening measures while most other pl ans performed in the 25th to 90th percentile. For the three HEDIS preventive care measures Covered California identified as priority measures \u2014 breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening \u2014 not only was there wide variation observed among plans over the past four years, but from two to six health plans reported performance below the 25th percentile nationally \u2014 highlighting both the need and opportunity for improvement .

Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 3 COVERED CALIFORNIA 33 Section 3. Implications for the Future Covered California included reporting requirements related to smoking cessation and obesity management programs because substantial evidence shows that effective interventions can improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs.24 Based on the inability of insurers to provide information on program participation in a consistent manner, Covered California is consider ing other ways to promote these services including exploring the feasibility of (1) collecting clinical data to improve enrollee identification or (2) bet ter tracking of program availability and participation rates and perhaps using large databases that predict public health risks by census track . Covered California is work ing with insurers to ensure these health promotion and prevention programs are offere d in the languages spoken by their enrollees and further promote the availability of translation services. In the major areas related to health plan measures of screening, the main observation from the reporting over the past four years is that there is w ide variation among the plans. Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan frequently report screening rate scores that are in the top 90th percentile in the nation; while other most of the other plans have lower scores - ranging from the 25th to just above th e 50th percentile. The fact that several health plans performed below the 25th percentile nationally on cancer screenings and on other preventive care measures detailed in Appendix 2 \u2014 in particular , six health plans had a breast cancer screening rate score below the 25th percentile \u2014 is concerning and warrants concerted efforts from both Covered California and the health plans to address. Low screening rates could be partially attributed to poor data collection techniques and lack of patient education and engagement. Covered California is engag ing with its contracted health plans to develop strategies to improve their screening rates. The ability of integrated systems , such as Kaiser Permanente and Sh arp Health Plan, to achieve such positive results i s a clear indicator of what is possible with well-coordinated and integrated care. In future years, Covered California should assess what factors can contribute to better performance among non -integrated plans and how the performance of integrated systems can be replicated across California. Covered California will seek to foster national benchmark performance across all plans. 24 The most current best evidence is documented in Chapter 2, Health Promotion and Prevention, of a companion Covered California report, Current Best Evidence and Performance Measures for Improving Quality of Care and Delivery System Reform .

This chapter on Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Treatment is organized as follows: Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Section 2. Health Plan Measures Reported to the Marketplace Quality Rating System Section 3. Implications for the Future Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Qualified Health Plan Experience presents performance data reported by insurers for contract requirements and includes assessments and observations by Covered California. Covered California recognizes the critical importance of mental health and substance use disorder treatment, collectively \"behavioral health services,\" in improving health outcomes and reducing costs. Consistent with the ACA's expansion of mental health and substance use disorder services and promotion of integrating these services into ma instream health care, Covered California requires insurers to report progress on: 1. Making behavioral health services available to enrollees; 2. Integrating behavioral health services with medical services; and 3. Reporting the percent of enrollees cared for in an integrated behavioral health model. In the absence of an established best practice for integrating medical and behavioral health services in 2016, the current contract requirements largely focus on gathering qualitative information about health insuran ce company strategies. Covered California has summarized strategies reported by insurers but For the adult behavioral health measures, t here is wide variation in performance among the plans over the past four years with most health plans performing poorly . For two of three priority measures in 2019, six or more plans performed below the 25th percentile. For each of the three measures, only one plan performed at or above the 90th percentile nationally. Covered Calif ornia is actively engag ing with insurers on how to improve in these areas. To promote access to and availability of behavioral health services, insurers report a range of activities, including increasing provider capacity, implementing telehealth services, and adopting new CPT codes that support care collaboration. Insurers are pursuing a broad spectrum of behavioral health integration efforts, including co -location of services, increased coordination with carve -out vendors, and embedded behavioral health staff in primary care clinics. The percent of enrollees cared for under an integrated behavioral health model appears to have increased between 2015 and 2018. Requirements for f uture reporting are being revised to better support tracking and trending of behavioral health integration. Covered California is exploring how best to use patien t-reported outcome measures to track improvement in behavioral health care. Monitoring outcomes for behavioral health is a major gap in assessing performance of insurers and the delivery system. Highlights Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALIT Y CARE CHAPTER 4 COVERED CALIFORNIA 35 notes that these qualitative descriptions will benefit from standardized definitions to better quantify adoption in future reporting. Promoting Availability of B ehavioral Health Services, 2015 , 2017 and 20 1825 The following are strategies one or more health insurance companies adopted to promote the availability of behavioral health services during 2015 , 2017 and 20 18: Added a full -time Behavioral Health Medical Director to the physician leadership team; added mental health providers, psychiatrists (including with bilingual skills), and medical social workers to the provider network; Increased access in the following ways: o Offered more appointments through expanded hours and expand ed and improved facilities where mental health and wellness care is provided; o Allow enrollees to self -refer to behavioral health providers instead of requiring prior authorization; o Provided open ac cess to free -standing network for professional and facility behavioral health providers; o Offered a telehealth program, with some offering a 24/7 program for behavioral health services, including programs to improve psychiatry access; o Annually monitored ac cess through provider -to-member ratios, provider surveys, member experience surveys, grievances and appeals and HEDIS results ; o Required underperforming providers to implement a corrective action plan; o Offered classes on behavioral health; and o Provided onl ine patient portals. Adopted Psychiatric Care Collaborative Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to Physician Fee schedules and removed prior authorization requirements for behavioral health outpatient services; Expanded opioid treatment and implemen ted a disease management program for depression; Carve -out or subcontracted vendors educated primary care physicians about behavioral health services via hotlines, online toolkits, and provided access to Behavioral Health Integration specialists and Commun ity Transition coordinators some of whom were also on the medical staff of physician organizations; and Deployed an electronic care management program that provides virtual psychiatric support and financial incentives to improve care for patients with be havioral health issues, including screenings and online consultations. 25 Data only available for plan year 2015 and plan years 2017 -18.

Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALIT Y CARE CHAPTER 4 COVERED CALIFORNIA 36 Integrating Behavioral Health Services with Primary Care, 2015 , 2017 and 20 1826 The following are strategies one or more health insurance companies engaged in to integrate behavioral health services with primary care during 2015 , 2017 and 20 18: Developed a universal consent form to allow data sharing between primary care and behavioral health providers ; Primary care physicians and behavioral health providers coordinated care through the same medical record or through an e -management model that facilitated communication and electronic data sharing. Leverage d an integrated data warehouse (medical, behavioral health, pharmacy, etc.) to identify gaps in care and at -risk members for interv entions by case managers ; Primary care physicians referred directly to behavioral health case management programs for assistance with complex care patients; case management departments at the plan level helped facilitate referrals to medical groups or prov iders; outpatient behavioral health departments that were in the same physical location as primary care, pharmacy, and specialty services helped facilitated primary care physician referrals and team -based care; Implemented a \"Feedback -Informed Care\" model which involves soliciting an enrollee's feedback about the therapy process and allowing them to direct their care ; Implemented a pay -for-performance program that connected primary care physicians with behavioral health provide rs to coordinate on referrals and care coordination; Integrated behavioral health with providers participating in Accountable Care Organization (ACO ) models; Worked with a health system to integrate psychiatrists within primary care clinics; Provided care management following discharge from an inpatient setting; Implemented a co -management strategy that involves integrated clinical rounds between medical and behavioral health teams; and Managed behavioral health needs through carve -out vendors or delegated providers as follows: o Enhanced coordination of behavioral and physical health care through housing carve -out vendors onsite, monthly joint clinical rounds or weekly integration meetings with co - located providers. o Carve -out vendors monitored outco mes, such as case management volume and engagement, utilization management trends, and quality of care issues. o Shared data with carve -out vendors to monitor drug interactions and compliance. o Held periodic meetings with delegated behavioral health provider s to focus on a variety of topics, including data, best practices, communication and collaboration, referral processes, HEDIS measures performance, and CAHPS E xperience of Care and Health Outcomes (E CHO ) survey results. 26 Data only available for plan year 2015 and plan years 2017 -18.

It is important to note that this measure also does not capture the range of health insurance company activities for behavioral health integration. As the percent of enrollees cared for in an IBHM is a quantitative measur e, the following numbers should be viewed with caution since (1) there has not been a standard definition for an IBHM and (2) insurers reported incomplete data and Covered California observed year-to-year inconsistencies . In 2015, 2 percent of Covered California enrollees were cared for in an IBHM; with individual insurers ranging from 0 to 6 percent.28 Based on incomplete numbers for 2018 , enrollees cared for in an IBHM model appears to have increased to 11 percent , with reporting insurers ranging from 0 to 34 percent. Given the challenges observed to date, requirements for future reporting will be based on standardized best practices to s upport tracking and trending adoption of behavioral health integration.

For the priority adult behavioral health measures, there is wide variation in performance among the health plans over the past four years with most plans performing poorly. For two of three priority measures in 2019 (Antidepressant Medication Management and Initiation and Engagement of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse or Dependence Treatment ), six or more plans performed below the 25th percentile. For each of the three measures, only one plan performed at or above the 90th percentile nationally. Covered California recognizes that there are additional behavioral health measures, such as Utilization of the P atient Health Questionnaire -9 to Monitor Depression Symptoms for Adolescents and Adults , that use clinical data to monit or patient s at the time of diagnosis and outcomes over time and therefore better represent the quality of care for depression . However, slow progress has been made in California in collecting clinical or patient reported outcome measures through 2018. Until most health insurance companies are collecting clinical data-based measures , Covered California must rely on the existing behavioral health measure s.

Implications for the Future Covered California included reporting requirements rela ted to mental health and substance use disorder treatment services because of the significant unmet needs of enrollees and the increasing evidence that integrati ng primary care and behavioral health services improve s health outcomes and deliver s a return on investment by reducing downstream health care costs. Several models including collaborative care, co -location and telehealth have demonstrated success.29 While insurers report a wide array of approaches to promoting the availability of behavioral health services and the integration of behavioral health services with primary care, it is difficult to measure if these efforts are translating to better behavior al health care or outcomes for consumers. Covered California is determining how to promote better measurement and accountability in this area which may involve standardized definitions and use of best practices to support tracking and trending of available services and adoption of behavioral health integration. For measures of behavioral health quality , the main observation from the reporting over the past four years is that there is wide variation among the plans and while some scores reflect high percenti le ranking, for many measures there are multiple health plans that are performing poorly compared to national benchmark data. For the priority adult behavioral health measures, there is wide variation in performance among the health plans over the past fou r years with most plans performing poorly. For two of three priority measures in 2019 (Antidepressant Medication Management and Initiation and Engagement of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse or Dependence Treatment ), six or more plans performed below the 25th percentile. For each of the three measures, only one plan performed at or above the 90th percentile nationally. This is concerning and warrants further concerted efforts from both Covered California and its contracted health plans to address. Covered Calif ornia is engag ing with health plans on adopting best practices for behavioral health care and develop ing strategies to improve their performance on these behavioral health measures . Covered California is also seeking to improve behavioral health measureme nt. The current HEDIS behavioral health measures in the QRS measure set should be replaced or updated . None assess behavioral health status or outcomes making performance assessment of health insurance companies and the delivery system difficult . Covered California is exploring how best to use patient -reported outcome measures for behavioral health. One promising measure is the use of the Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9) because it can be used to both identify patients with depression symptom s and monitor their outcomes over time . However, slow progress has been made in California because this measure relies on collecting clinical data. There is significant opportunity for collaboration on spreading integrated behavioral health models and collecting clinical data through statewide collaboratives including the Integrated Healthcare Association and California Quality Collaborative . 29 The most current best evidence is documented in Chapter 3, Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Treatment, of a companion Covered California report, Current Best Evidence and Performance Measures for Improving Quali ty of Care and Delivery System Reform .

In addition, this chapter, Acute, Chronic and Other Conditions , encompasses subpopulations covered in subject chapters of this report: Chapter 4: Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Treatment; Chapter 6: Complex Care; Chapter 7: Promotion of Effectiv e Primary Care; and Chapter 10: Appropriate Interventions. This chapter on Acute, Chronic, and Other Conditions is organized as follows: Section 1. Health Plan Measures Reported to the Marketplace Quality Rating System Section 2. Implications for the Fu ture Section 1. Health Plan Measures Reported to the Marketplace Quality Rating System As described in previous chapters , one key mechanism used by Covered California for health insurance company oversight and accountability is public reporting of global and individual health plan quality performance measures to the Center s for Medicaid and Medicare Services' Marketplace Quality Rating System (QRS). To more sharply focus health plan accountability efforts, Covered California examined over 40 measures used by QRS and is proposing to prioritize a subset of 1 3 measures. The following tables display the priority measures for Acute, Chronic and Other Condition measures in the QRS measure set (with 1 1 additional measures detailed in Appendix 2: Additional Health Plan Measures Reported to the Quality Rating System ) and include the Covered California weighted average, highest and lowest performing plans, plan -specific perfo rmance, as well as national percentiles for all Marketplace plans: 1. Comprehensive Diabetes Care: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Control (<8.0%) (Table 19) For the measures related to care for chronic conditions , there is wide variation among plans, with Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan being among the 90th percentile natio nally, while other plans have a range of scores. The ability of these integrated delivery systems to achieve such positive results is a clear indicator of what is possible with well - coordinated and integrated care. Covered California is assess ing what fact ors contribute to better performance among non-integrated systems and how this performance can be replicated across California. Enrollee satisfaction with their health plan and care is comparable to nationwide results for most Covered California plans. However, compared to the nation, enrollees report less favorably about their access to care and how well their care is coordinated. For these two priority CAHPS Measures, Access to Care and Care Coordination, most plans' scores cluster around the national 5 0th percentile or below the 25th percentile. CAHPS results for marketplace plans nationwide are highly compressed with only a few points difference among percentile and all results are relatively high compared to other measures.

For the measures related to care for chronic conditions, there is wide variation among plans, with Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan being among the 90th percentile nationally, while other plans have a range of scores. The a bility of these integrated delivery systems to achieve such positive results is a clear indicator of what is possible with well -coordinated and integrated care. Covered California is assessing what factors contribute to better performance among non -integra ted systems and how this performance can be replicated across California. The wide variation in performance is particularly meaningful for measures related to managing diabetes and hypertension that target the opportunities to improve the morbidity and mo rtality attributable to these conditions. Better performance on these indicators means there would be fewer adverse events and more lives saved. A 1 percent reduction in HbA1c reduces diabetes -related deaths by 21 percent and myocardial infarction s (heart attacks) by 14 percent.30 For every 10 percent reduction in HbA1c (e.g., 10 to 9 or 9 to 8 ) the risk of progression to blindness fell 44 percent, progression to kidney failure fell 25 percent, and loss of sensation in the feet by 30 perce nt.31 Another study estimated the effect of having all health plans nationally achieve the 90th percentile on measures focused on diabetes and cardiovascular disease found it would result in 2.3 million fewer heart attacks (a reduction of 22 percent), 800,0 00 fewer strokes (a reduction of 12 percent) as well as reduced incidence of several 30 Stratton, I.

Covered California health insurers generally have worse scores than the rest of the nation on the Access to Care and Care Coordination measures, with the majority of insurers below the 25th percentile and none above the 50th. It is important to note that the CAHPS results for marketplace plans nationwide are highly compressed with onl y a few points difference among each percentile and all results are relatively high compared to other measures . Also, California's demographic diversity includes greater numbers of people in race/ethnicity groups who tend to give plans lower scores. This suggests insurers may not meet the needs of all groups equally. Covered California sees these enrollee -experience scores as reason for both concern and future research. Covered California is work ing with its health insurance companies to assure improvement in these areas and is seek ing to expand the number and sources of measures that can best assess consumers' experience in access to care, care coordination and other impor tant quality domains. 32 Note these estimates are from a 2008 study based on the Ar chimedes simulation model .

If the actual readmission rate is lower than the expected readmission rate, the plan is performing better at reducing readmissions than expected and the plan would have a measure value less than 100 . A plan can have a measure value above 100 if their observed rate was greater than their expected rate meaning the ir performance was worse than expected. A lower rate indicates better performance.

Implications for the Future For these health plan measures for addressing chronic illnesses, the main observation from the reporting over the past four years is that there is wide variation among the plans. Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan freque ntly report providing services or getting results that are in the top 90th percentile in the nation , while other plans have lower scores - ranging from the 25th to just above the 50th percentile. The wide variation in performance is particularly meaningful for measures related to managing diabetes and hypertension that do a remarkable job of targeting the opportunities to improve the morbidity and mortality attributable to those conditions. Improve ment in performance across all California plans would be potentially life -saving and clinically meaningful for hundreds of thousands of Californians . The ability of integrated delivery systems to achieve such positive results i s a clear indicator of what is possible with well -coordinated and integrated care. Covered California is assess ing what factors contribute to better performance among non -integrated systems and how this performance can be replicated across California. Covered California identified four priority CAHPS measures. For two of these measures \u2014 overall satisfaction with care and with their health plan \u2014 most Covered California health plans perform above the 50th percentile compared to national marketplace plans (see Chapter 2: Individualized, Equitable Care ). It is co ncerning that 8 health plans score below the 25th percentile on members' Access to Care and that 1 1 health plans score below the 25th percentile for Care Coordination. It is important to note that the CAHPS results for marketplace plans nationwide are high ly compressed with only a few points difference among each percentile and all results are relatively high compared to other measures . Covered California sees these enrollee -experience scores as reason for both concern and future research and is work ing with its health insurance companies to assure improvement in these areas . Covered California is also seek ing to expand the number and sources of measures that can best assess consumers' experience in access to care , care coordination and other important quali ty domains.Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 6 COVERED CALIFORNIA 52 Chapter 6: Complex Care Complex Care involves effectively managing very complex conditions for individuals that require a multitude of specialty, high -cost treatments - such as rare cancers or transplants - or require end of life care. These indivi duals need to be managed effectively , provided well -coordinated care, or be seen in very specialized settings. This chapter on Complex Care presents performance data reported by health insurance companies for contract requirements and includes assessments and observations by Covered California. This chapter is organized as follows: Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Section 2. Implications for the Future Section 1: Qualified Health Plan Experience Qualified Health Plan Experience presen ts performance data reported by health insurance companies for contract requirements and includes assessments and observations by Covered California. The current contract requirements for Complex Care largely focus on health plan processes for effectively managing at -risk enr ollees with complex conditions, defined as: \"clinical conditions that are of a complex nature that typically involve ongoing case management support from appropriately trained clinical staff. Frequently, individuals have multiple chroni c clinical conditions that complicate management (\"polychronic\") or may have a complex, infrequent specialty condition that requires specialized expertise for optimal management.\"34 It has been shown that when high -risk enrollees are identified early, the y are most likely to benefit from 34 See Glossary of Key Terms for Attachment 7 to Covered California 2017 Qualified Health Plan Contract: Quality, Network Manage ment, and Delivery System Standards, and Improvement Strategy : https://hbex.coveredca.com/insurance -companies/PDFs/Attachment -7- Amended -for-2019.pdf . All insurers leverage medical and pharmacy claims as well as demographic information to identify high-cost or high -risk patients for various care and case management support, but there is no consistent measurement of the efficacy of their efforts, primarily due to the lack of standard population identification or quality measures for complex care. All insurers contracted with Centers of Excellence (COE), with the most common treatments being cancer care and bariatric surgery. Identification and performance measurement for COEs is not standardized. Only one insurer had a formal steerage program for transpla nts while most insurers promote their COEs by relying on member interactions with the service center or care management team. Most health plans offer ed Health Risk Assessments (HRAs) to determine enrollee health status on a voluntary basis, but completion rates are very low. A large -scale effort to support at -risk enrollees in effective coverage transitions coordinated by Covered California and insurers occurred when Anthem exited multiple rating regions in 2018, affecting nearly 137,000 consumers. Highlights Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 6 COVERED CALIFORNIA 53 well-coordinated care. As such, Covered California has the following requirements for health plans to address complex care: 1. Coordinating treatment for enrollees with conditions that required high specialized management, such as transplant patients, and the use of Centers of Excellence (COEs) for these enrollees ; 2. Collecting information to monitor enrollee health status; 3. Tracking changes in health status and the use of health risk assessments; 4. Supporting at-risk enrollees requiring transition; and 5. Identification and services for at-risk enrollees. Centers of Excellence Health insurance companies are required to report on how enrollees with conditions that require highly specialized management, like transplant patie nts and burn patients, are managed by providers with documented special experience and proficiency based on volume and outcome data, such as Centers of Excellence (COEs). Centers of Excellence allow for complex care patients to be seen in very specialized settings, such as National Cancer Institute designated cancer centers. Although there are no standards for identifying COEs, d escribed below are common themes discussed by insurers about the process for use and promotion of COEs to enrollees with special ized conditions, as well as the strategy for including COEs in each insurer's network (see Table 24. Covered California Insurer Processes and Strategies for Use of Centers of Excellence, 2015, 2017 and 2018 ). All insurers contract with COEs but only one insurer has a formal steerage program to direct enrollees to COEs for transplants . Most health insurance companies promote COEs through enrollee interactions with their service centers or care management teams. Other insure rs simply note that COEs are available in their Evidence of Coverage documents. Table 24.

N ine insurers provided access to at least one type of COE specializing in transplants, eight health plans offered a COE for cancer care, seven health plans offered a COE for bariatric surgery, and six plans offered a COE for burn care (see Table 25. Covered California Enrollees' Access to Centers of Excellence for Specialized Conditions, 2015, 2017 and 2018 ). A lower number of health plans offered COEs for cardiac care and orthopedics (such as hip and knee surgery). Table 25.

Additional health plans may contract with COEs for these conditions. Source: Covered California Staff Analysis of Qualified Health Plan Submitted Data Collecting Information to Monitor Enrollee Health Status Health insurance companies are required to describe how they collect and report, at both the indiv idual and aggregate levels, changes in enrollee health status . For example, reporting by insurers may include a comparative analysis of health status improvements across geographic regions and demographic groups. Health insurance companies are required to describe their process to monitor and track health status, which may include identifying individuals who show a decline in health status, and referral of such enrollees to care management programs. In 2018 , eight insurers described a system for collectin g data on enrollee health status (either a clinical system for determining health status or the use of a survey). All insurers leveraged medical and pharmacy claims as well as demographic information to identify high -cost or high -risk patients for various care and case management support. Integrated delivery systems , such as Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan, leveraged acce ss to more clinical data, such as lab results. Health risk assessments (HRA s) can be used in concert with clinical data for predictive modeling for early intervention. HRAs are an important tool that can accurately stratify individuals with the highest risk because they capture both physical and behavioral health needs as well as social needs. 36 Data only available for plan year 2015 and plan years 2017 -18. Covered California waived data collection for plan year 2016. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 6 COVERED CALIFORNIA 55 Determining Enrollee Health Status and Use of Health Risk Assessments Health insurance companies are required to describe their capabilities in collecting informat ion about enrollees' health status and behaviors for health promotion and improved care management. If the insurer used health risk assessments to determine health status, the following requirements apply: 1. The assessment must be offered in all threshold languages to enrollees over the age of 18, including those that have previously completed such an assessment; 2. The assessment tool must adequately evaluate an enrollee's current health status and provide a mechanism to conduct ongoing monitoring for future intervention(s); and 3. Enrollees should be made aware at the beginning of the assessment about how information collected may be used, that they may opt in to receive information from the insurer , and that participation in the assessment is optional. Most insurers offered HRAs on a voluntary basis, but completion rates reported by insurers for 201 8 were very low . HRA completion rates ranged from 0 to 38 percent with 8 of the 11 insurers reporting under 6 percent completion. While HRA completion rates were low for the overall population , insurers had several activities and capabilities that support ed HRAs and best evidence supports targeted HRA collection for at -risk individuals (see Table 26. Covered California Insurer Activities and Capabilities Supporting Health Risk Assessments , 2018 ).37 Most health insurance companies took multiple steps to address at -risk behaviors reported in a n HRA . Eleven insurers generated a personalized report after completion which provided members specific actions they can take to lower their risk and directed them to a targeted intervention mo dule. Three insurers auto-enrolled members into a disease management program and two allowed members the option to send assessment results to their physician. Given the lack of data, health insurance companies reported limited ability to proactively link e nrollees with smoking cessation or weight management programs that they all offer. Table 26.

This requirement for supporting at -risk enrollees is broader than the continu ity of care requirements in state law. Covered California's contracts with the majority of health insurance companies in California which places it in the unique position to better facilitate transitions of care for this population that will result in enro llees receiving the right care at the right time. Covere d California is particularly concerned about transitions for the following \"at -risk\" enrollees: 1. Individuals in the middle of acute treatment, third trimester pregnancy, or those who would otherwise q ualify for continuity of care under California law; 2. Individuals in case management programs; 3. Individuals in disease management programs ; and 4. Individuals on maintenance prescription drugs for a chronic condition. If enrollees experience a service area dis ruption, Covered California may automatically transition the enrollee into a different health insurance company to avoid gaps in coverage and facilitate care transitions. If this occurs, the insurer terminating the enrollee has several requirements, includ ing conducting outreach to the affected enrollee, obtaining authorization to send personal health information to the receiving health insurance company , and collaborating with impacted providers. Identification and Services for At -Risk Enrollees Health insurance companies are required to identify and proactively manage enrollees with existing and newly diagnosed chronic conditions, including \"at -risk enrollees\" with diabetes, asthma, heart disease, or hypertension , who are most likely to benefit from well -coordinated care. Insurers must agree to support disease management activities at the insurer or provider level that meet standards of accrediting programs such as NCQA. Health insurance co mpanies provide Covered California with a documented process, care management plan and strategy for targeting and managing at -risk enrollees. Such documentation may include (but is not limited to) methods to identify and target at -risk enrollees, descripti on of predictive analytic capabilities, member communication plans, care and network strategies, and data on the number of enrollees identified as well as the types of services provided. Most health insurance companies reported identifying at -risk enrolle es with algorithms and other proprietary technology based on claims and utilization data.38 Some insurers describe d using demographic data, HRA data, hospital discharge data, clinical data, and nurse advice line and provider referral data. 38 No data was summarized in a table for 2018 due to specific proprietary technologies mentioned and because four out of 11 insurers explained what data they collected but did n ot explain how they analyzed the data for at -risk enrollee identification. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform ASSURING QUALITY CARE CHAPTER 6 COVERED CALIFORNIA 57 The type of services offered to at -risk enrollees var ies substantially across insurers (see Table 27. Types of Interventions for Covered California At-Risk Enrollees Eligible for Case Management, 201 8). All health insurance companies offered some level of live outbound telephonic coaching to members. Most offered member -specific reminders for health maintenance services ( 10 of 11) or face -to-face visits ( six of 11). Online interactive self -management support was less common, with four of 11 plans offering it to high -risk or all enrollees . Supporting At -Risk Enrollees Transitioning between Covered California Insurers: Experience Assuring Care Transitions for over 135,000 Californians in 2018 In much of the nation, there has been substantial instability in insurers serving different states' individual mark et. One of the risks of insurers exiting markets is the potential for disruption of care for those with complex health care needs. California has been marked by stability among its insurers. The only significant disruption from an insurer changing its serv ice areas occurred when Anthem exited multiple rating regions in 2018, affecting nearly 137,000 consumers \u2014 about 10 percent of Covered California enrollees \u2014 while remaining in large portions of the state . Covered California worked closely with Anthem and all other health insurers receiving transitioning enrollees to assure effective transitions . Carrying out an effective transition of Anthem enrollees required partnership and collaboration among Covered California staff, the health insurance companies receiving transitioning enrollees, and Anthem. Covered California and receiving insurers began working with Anthem staff months before the transitions in coverage to ensure appropriate and seamless continuity and transitions of care to protect the most vul nerable populations. The goal was to identify enrollees with specific care needs and to transfer information about enrollee's care needs to the receiving insurer. This collaboration required Anthem and receiving insurers to agree to identifying an appropr iate level of data required for transitioning enrollees, parameters on data sharing and use and processes to receive and act upon consumer information. At -risk enrollees included those undergoing ca se or disease management services as well as those with pr egnancy/maternity and specialty medication needs. The data sharing resulted in receiving insurers having sufficient information to do timely consumer outreach. This outreach was of utmost benefit to consumers who would have otherwise navigated the health care system alone.

Source: Covered California Staff Analysis of Qualified Health Plan Submitted Data Section 2: Implications for the Future Measurement of performance in caring for enrollees requiring complex care requires further development. Covered California found no standard quality measures for Complex Care to include in this chapter . The current Marketplace Quality Rating System measure set has one measure for behavioral health subpopulations, Follow Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness (FUH) (HEDIS), which is presented in Chapter 4. The Plan A ll-Cause Readmission s measure , which is presented in Chapter 5, may include complex care patients but does not specifically measure care management processes or outcomes. In a Covered California sponsored report released in July 2019, Current Best Evidence and Performance Measures for Improving Quality Care and Delivery System Reform , Health Ma nagement Associates (HMA) recommended a hybrid method of population stratification starting with automated data to identify high cost enrollees combined with survey data such as HRAs, behavioral health screening, screening for social needs or measuring pat ient activation to determine enrollees who are likely to continue to be high -risk and high -cost. In the same report, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) recommended that Covered California use its claims data warehouse to track rates of inpatient and Emergency De partment use and Emergency Department follow -up among complex care patients. PwC also recommended that Covered California consider the Transition of Care HEDIS measure which would require collection of discharge information that includes test results . Cove red California is working with health insurance companies and other stakeholders to establish best practices for population identification and management including a standardized approach to defining and measuring performance of Centers of Excellence.

While many consumers benefit from an ongoing continuous relationship with a single physician, others may be able to receive e ffective primary care through sites of care or delivery systems that are well - integrated. This chapter on Promotion of Effective Primary Care presents performance data for current contract requirements reported by health insurance companies for the 2015 -18 plan years and includes assessments and observations by Covered California. This chapter is organized as follows: Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Section 2: Health Plan Measures Reported to the Marketplace Quality Rating System Section 3. Imp lications for the Future Section 1: Qualified Health Plan Experience Covered Califor nia believes promoting the Triple Aim and promoting health equity requires a foundation of effectively delivered primary care, which the Institute of Medicine defines as follows: \"the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal he alth needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community.\"39 To this end, Covered California promotes effective primary care with the following requirements : 39 Institute of Medicine. 1994. Defining Primary Care: An Interim Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/9153. Starting in 2017, virtually all Covered California's enrollees either selected or were matched with a primary c are provider \u2014 including all enrollees in PPO model plans . Covered California is assessing the impact of this novel effort. While virtually all primary care provided in Kaiser Permanente is delivered by patient -centered medical home- recognized practices, outside of th is system, enrollment served by PCMHs increased from 3 percent to 11 percent between 2016 and 2018. Several insurers are supporting primary care providers in clinical transformation to advanced primary care , though not meeting PCMH standards . Measurement of primary care performance will likely need to go beyond PCMH recognition process measures to include outcomes. Based on the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network Alternative Payment Model Framework, 10 insurers now have Positive Incentives or Strong Incentives for transitioning from volume - based to value -based primary care payment. Significant increases were observed for shared savings and capitati on-based payments between 2015 -18. However, further assessment is needed to determine the extent to which capitation to medical groups or physician organizations cascades to individual providers. For insurers to continue to adopt value - based primary care payment or to increase investment, measurement of primary care performance will likely need to include outcome s. Highlights Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 7 COVERED CALIFORNIA 60 1. Ensure that all enrollees either select or be matched with a primary care physician (PCP) within 60 days of enrollment; 2. Insurers are required to have an increasing percentage of their enrollees cared for in patient - centered medical home models and a nnually report the number and percent of enrol lees who obtain their care in a patient -centered medical home (PCMH); and 3. Describe how the insurer's payment strategy supports primary care physicians in adopting accessible, data -driven, team -based care with accountability for meeting the Triple Aim goals of enhanced quality, improved outcomes and lower costs. Primary Care Physician Matching In January 2017, Covered California required that all enrollees in preferred provider organizations (PPO), health maintenance organizations (HMO), and exclusive provi der organizations (EPO) , be matched to a primary care physician (PCP) or other primary care clinician, such as a nurse practitioner , upon enrollment . The purpose of the requirement was to bring the PCP match concept to the PPO and EPO environment and give enrollees a single point of contact who can help them navigate the health care system. A primary care physician can provide continuity and address m ost health care needs, helps consumers select the proper specialist, coordinates their care with other providers and ensures they understand their treatment options. While having a PCP can help select and coordinate care across specialty providers , enrolle es in PPO and EPO plans can still choose to navigate the health care system on their own without permission from their PCP to seek treatment or a referral to see a specialist. Since 2017 , virtually all Covered California's enrollees, over 99 percent, eithe r selected or were matched with a PCP upon enrollment which was nearly a 30 -percentage point increase from the 2016 baseline rate of 70 percent. Covered California believes this PCP match will ultimately help people get better access to care in a timelier manner. However, many enrollees may need more explanation of why working with their PCP is beneficial. Covered California is currently working with its plans to examine the data to understand the patient experience and clinical and financial effec ts of this program . Covered California will look to examine outcomes of clinical measures that may improve with a strong foundation in primary care . Promoting Enrollment in Patient -Centered Medical Homes A growing body of evidence shows that advanced mod els of primary care, which include patient - centered medical home s (PCMHs ), greatly imp rove the care delivered to patients and support Triple Aim goals. Advanced primary care models utilize a patient -centered, accessible, team -based approach to care delivery, enrollee engagement and data -driven improvement, as well as integration of care management , behavioral health and community resources for patients with complex conditions. Under the existing contract requirement, insurers are required to have an increasing portion of enrollees who Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 7 COVERED CALIFORNIA 61 obtain their care in a PCMH model and plans must use formal recognition programs to assess which providers are PCMHs.40 While there have been significant increases in the percentage of enrollees seen in PCMH settings, health insurance companies report that many in their primary care networks believe the current requirement tied to PCMH recognition is too limited and burdensome . As of 2018, about 40 percent of Covered California enrollees received primary care through prov iders that met PCMH standards. The great majority of that enrollment, however, was through Kaiser Permanente, which represented 82 percent of total PCMH enrollment in 2018. The percentage of enrollees cared for by PCMH -recognized practices, outside of the Kaiser Permanente system, increased threefold from 3 percent to 11 percent between 2016 and 2018, an 8 -point increase (see Table 28. Percentage of Covered California Enrollees Cared for in Patient Centered Medical Homes, 2016 -18). When looking at all insurers during the three years, the percent of Covered California enrollees who were cared for in PCMHs increased from 25 percent in 201 5 to 40 percent in 2018. One of Sharp Health Plan 's integrated medical groups achieved PCMH recognition in 2018 to comply with the Covered California requirement and this change accounts for most of the overall increase outside K aiser Permanente . The perce nt of Sharp Health Plan enrollees cared for in a PCMH increased from 15 percent in 2017 to 66 percent in 2018. Table 28.

The formal PCMH recognition programs largely document process improvement without measuring outcomes. Many advanced primary care practices have not sought formal recognition and many that have been recognized have implemented process improvements, but these may not have led to improvement in clinical quality or reduced cost. Additionally, s everal health in surance companies are focusing on primary care practice transformation programs that include practice coaching to support primary care providers in improving quality and efficiency rather than requiring or promoting PCMH recognition. Based on this feedback from health insurance companies and providers, Covered California is e xamining alternative approaches to promote improvements in primary care and assuring more enrollees benefit from these programs . Payment Strategies that Promote Effective Primary Care The Affordable Care Act included several demonstration projects and grants to test payment reforms that would shift volume -driven Fee -for-Service (FFS) payments to methods that link provider payment 40 The current contract requir ements list the following recognition programs: a) National Committee for Quality Assurance PCMH recognition; b) The Joint Commission Primary Care Medical Home certification; c) Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc . Medical Home accred itation; and d) URAC PCMH Certification. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 7 COVERED CALIFORNIA 62 with performance on cost and quality. To measure health insurance company progress in payment strategies that promote accountability for Triple Aim goals, Covered California leveraged the four categories in the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network (HCP LAN) Alternative Payment Model (APM) Framework41 (see Table 29. Covered California Assessment of Primary Care Payment Strategies Based on the HCP LAN Alternative Payment Model Framework , 2015 , 2017 and 20 18). While PCMHs are delivery models, not payment models, the Alternative Payment Model Framework notes that PCMHs and advanced primary care need the support of value -based payment models . Shifting payments from FFS to payments that increasingly hold primary care providers financially at -risk for high -quality care creates incentives for managing cost an d quality. In assess ing payment strategies, Covered California requires its contracted health plans to pay increasingly based on \"Category 3: Shared Savings\" and \"Category 4: Population -based Payment ,\" which Covered California reports below as having Posit ive Incentives and Strong Incentives , respectively. As of 2018 , Covered California assessment found that 10 health insurance companies were paying providers with either Positive Incentives or Strong Incentives for value - an increase of two insurers from 2015 . More insurers are now assessed to have Positive Incentives or Strong Incentives . Table 29.

Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 7 COVERED CALIFORNIA 63 Source: Covered California Staff Analysis of Qualified Health Plan Submitted Data As expected, payment strategies to PCPs vary widely (see Figure 4. Covered California Insurer Payment Strategies for Primary Care Providers, 2015 - 2018 ), but from 2015 to 2018 there has been a significant increase in payment to providers being based on ca pitation (increasing from 41 percent to 53 percent) and shared savings (increasing from 8 percent to 18 percent). The decline in payments to primary care providers based on fee -for-service and the fact that Covered California plans now pay 71 percent of pr imary care providers using capitation or shared savings is important progress. At the same time, based on discussions with insurers and provider groups, there is reason to be concerned that capitation payments made to medical groups or physician organizati ons may not cascade to individual providers, many of whom continue to be largely paid on a fee -for-service basis.

Source: California Staff Analysis of Qualified Health Plan Submitted Data According to the HCP LAN, in calendar year 2018, about 56 percent of national commercial market total health care payments were FFS (Category 1 ), 14 percent of payments were FFS with a link to quality ( Category 2), 28 percent of payments were shared saving s (Category 3) and only 2 percent of payments were population -based payments or capitation.43 This data is collected through surveys of 43 Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network.

Although this data represents all commercial health care payments, it suggest s that Covered California insurers have made significant progress in moving towards capitation or population -based payment and away from FFS payments for primary care pr oviders compared to the rest of the nation . In 2018, o nly 22 percent of Covered California insurer's primary care payment s were FFS compared to the national rate of 5 6 percent FFS for all health care payments for the commercial market . Interaction of Paym ent Strategies , Patient -Centered Medical Homes , and Promotion of Advanced Primary Care At this time, there is not enough information to establish a link b etween payment strategies and the percent of members cared for in a PCMH. There appears to be a clearer relationship between increased enrollment in a PCMH model and whether the plan is part of an integrated delivery system. Some health insurance companie s assessed by Covered California to have Strong Incentives for their payment strategies also had a higher percent of enrollees cared for in PCMHs (e.g., Kaiser Permanente pays 100 percent of its primary care physicians a population -based payment, which is considered a Category 4 APM, and 100 percent of its providers are PCMH recognized ). Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan , both fully integrated delivery systems, are high outliers for enrollment in a PCMH model. However, the other nine health insurance companies of which some are considered to have Weak Incentives because they paid their providers FFS, had similar percentag es of enrollees cared for in a PCMH as those with Strong Incentives or Positive Incentives . In some instances, it was also difficult to attribute a relationship between specific payment strategies and enrollees cared for in a PCMH because some providers simultaneously received enhanced reimbursements fo r PCMH recognition from other payers, such as Medi -Cal. Strategies to Enroll or Attribute Enrollees to Patient -Centered Medical Homes Although not definitive, there may be a relationship between promoting PCMH -recognized providers to enrollees and the percent of enrollees cared for in a PCMH. Between 2015 and 201 8, most health insurance companies did not actively promote PCMH providers t o enrollees or actively assign or match enrollees to PMCHs. The few insurers that listed PCMH recognition in provider directories were observed to have higher rates of enrollees cared for in a PCMH. Section 2: Health Plan Measures Reported to the Marketpla ce Quality Rating System Health Plan Measures Reported to the Marketplace Quality Rating System detail s health plan performance on Healthcare Effectiveness Data Information Set (HEDIS) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measures reported to the Center s for Medicaid and Medicare Services' Quality Rating System (QRS). These st andard performance measures are a key mechanism used by Covered California for health plan oversight and accountability. See Appendix 2: Additional Health Plan Measures Reported to the Quality Rating System , for Quality Rating System measures that pertai n to Promotion of Effective Primary Care : 1. Rating of Personal Doctor (CAHPS) (Table A21) 2. Rating of Specialist (CAHPS) (Table A22) The patient experience reporting of enrollees Rating of Personal Doctor showed wide variation but was marked by the fact that 9 of 11 health plans \u2014 representing 89 percent of enrollees \u2014 had ratings Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 7 COVERED CALIFORNIA 65 below the 25th percentile nationally. However, the range of scores is exceedingly narrow ; for Rating of Personal Doctor, a raw score below 86 is below the 25th percentile, while a raw score of 90 is the 90th percentile. Section 3: Implications for the Future Ensuring all enrollees have a PCP , regardless of their health plan product, provides a single point of contact to help them navigate the health care system . Covered California is evaluat ing the impact of PCP matching in EPO and PPO plans based on outcomes including utilization, continuity of care, cost and quality that may improve with a strong foundation in primary care. Covered California continues to work with insurers to help all enrollees understand the value of primary care. Further assessment is needed to determine the extent to which capitation to medical groups or physician organizations cascades to individual providers. Covered California will continue to require health insurance companies to increasingly implement value -based payments for primary care providers like shared savings and population -based payment or capitation . One of the biggest barrier s to full adoption of advanced primary care, despite the changes to payment structure described above , appears to be inadequate revenue or resources to support well-rounded care team s, underscoring the importance of continued efforts at prima ry care payment reform . For health insurance companies to make these investments, measurement of performance will likely need to go beyond the PCMH recognition process measures to include outcome measures that reflect the impact advanced primary care can have improving quality , enhancing the patient experience , and reducing total cost of care and documenting a return on investment for insurers that increase primary care payment such that it account s for a larger share of the overall health care budget .Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 8 COVERED CALIFORNIA 66 Chapter 8: Promotion of Integrated Delivery Systems and Accountabl e Care Organizations Promotion of integrated delivery systems and accountable care organizations is premised on the increasing evidence that effectively caring for and managing a person's health requires an integrated care system that can coordinate across providers, sites and times for a variety of conditions while delivering good outcomes and quality at an affordable cost.44, 45 This chapter on Promotion of Integrated Delivery Systems and Accountable Care Organizations presents performance data reported by health insurance companies for contract requirements and includes assessments and observations by Covered California. This chapter is organized as follows: Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Section 2. Implications for the Future Section 1: Qualified Health Plan Experience Covered California has the following requirements for integrated delivery systems (IDSs) or accountable care organizations (ACOs) : 1. Increase enrollment over time and r eport the number and percent of enrollees who are managed under an IDS or ACO as well as provide comparison reporting for other lines of business; 44 Covered California's recently completed evidence review affirmed the value and positive impact on quality and cost of effecti ve care integration and some models of Accountable Care Organization (see Current Best Evidence and Performance Measures for Improving Quality Care and Delivery System Reform ). In addition, recent data from the Integrated Health Care Association (IHA) Cost and Quality Atlas, shows clinical quality was higher for ACO and HMO members compared to PPO members for commercial plans (see https://atlas.iha.org/story/aco ). 45 An integrated delivery system (IDS) is a network of physicians and healthcare facilities that provide a continuum of healthca re services managed under one organization or one parent company. Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are groups of physicians and healthcare facilities that share financial and medical responsibility for providing coordinated care, with financial incentiv es to provide high - quality care and to limit avoidable, unnecessary spending. In 2018, 60 percent of Covered California enrollees were cared for in an Integrated Delivery System (IDS) or an Accountable Care Organization (ACO), which represents a 12 -point increase from 2015. After excluding the fully -integrated delivery systems, Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan, 25 percent of Cover ed California enrollees were cared for in an ACO, which represents a 4 -point increase from 2015 and far exceeds state and national benchmarks . Nine insurers reported offering technical support, data sharing support, or promoting participation in health information exchanges for providers in 2018 , an increase from four insurers in 2015. Covered California has also seen a steady increase in the number of insure rs using other common components of integrated coordinated care such as population health management support and holding providers accountable using standard quality measure sets. Insurers are required to report 2018 performance based on the IHA Commercial ACO measures by year-end 2019, which will allow better understanding of performance variation of different ACO models and inform future contract requirements. Highlights Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 8 COVERED CALIFORNIA 67 2. Provide details on the key design characteristics of existing or planned integrated systems of care and how these systems of care compare to the definiti on in the Covered California contract ; and 3. Report performance of different ACO models for all lines of business using the IHA Commercial ACO Measure Set once data becomes available for plan year 2018 . Percent of Enrollees in an Integrated Delivery System or Accountable Care Organization Covered California requires health insurance companies to report the number and percent of enrollees who are managed under an IDS or ACO as well as provide comparison reporting for the ir other lines of business. Insurers are also are required to demonstrate an increase in the percent of enrollees who obtain their care in an IDS or ACO model between 2017 and 2019. Nationally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is leading a drive to implement value-based payment models including integrated and coordinated delivery models such as ACOs. Leavitt Partners tracks the growth and spread of ACOs including the new models supported by CMS and their commercial and Medicaid analogs.46 As of 2018, 10 percent of the U .S. population or 32.7 million Americans were cared for in ACOs in the commercial, Medicaid and Medicare markets . This includes every state , with penetration ranging from 2 percent to over 20 percent. Leavitt Partners report s that between 10 to 15 percent of Californians are cared for in such models. In 2018 , 60 percent of Covered California enrollees were cared for in an IDS or ACO, which represents a 12-point increase from 2015 ( see Figure 5. Covered California Enrollment in Integrated Delivery Systems or Accountable Care Organizations, 2015 and 2018 ).47 Figure 5.

Two insurers , Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan, are fully integrated delivery systems and account for about 60 percent of the overall number.48 As of 2018, a fter excluding enrollment in Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan, 25 percent of Covered California enrollees among the other insurers were cared for in an ACO, which represents a 2-percentage point increase from 2015 . It is this latter statistic that is most comparable to the national data from Leavitt Partners; ba sed on this report, California has greater penetration of these new models than the U .S. and Covered California penetration exceeds the rest of California even excluding those enrolled with Kaiser Permanente or Sharp Health Plan . Health Plan Components of Integrated Delivery Systems or Accountable Care Organizations Covered California places great importance on the adoption and expansion of integrated, coordinated and accountable systems of care. As such, health insurance companies are required to provide details on existing or planned integrated systems of care and how these systems of care compare to the following definition: 1. A system of population -based care coordinated across the continuum including multi -discipline physician pr actices, hospitals and ancillary providers ; and 2. Having combined risk sharing arrangements and incentives between the health insurance company and providers, and among providers across specialties and institutional boundaries, holding the ACO accountable fo r nationally recognized evidence -based clinical, financial, and operational performance, as well as incentives for improvements in population outcomes. Based on the descriptions of their IDS or ACO models provided by insurers , Covered California has ident ified several components many insurers are using in their respective models. In 2018, most insurers (nine out of 12) reported offering technical support, data sharing support, or promoting participation in health information exchanges for providers, an inc rease from four insurers in 2015 (see Table 30. Components of Covered California Insurer 's Support for Integrated Delivery Systems or Accountable Care Organizations, 2015 , 2017 and 20 18). Covered California has also seen a steady increase in the number of health insurance companies using other common components like population health management support and holding providers accountable using standard quality measure sets. 48 In Covered California, Kaiser Permanen te and Sharp Health are fully integrated delivery systems while other health plans base their ACO model on existing provider organizations, such as integrated medical group and hospitals.

Comparing Performance of Different ACO Models using the Integrated Healthcare Association Commercial ACO Measure Set The Integrated Health care Association (IHA) has developed a Commercial ACO Measure Set51 derived from their long -standing physician organization performance measures which has been widely adopted in California . While it is early to assess ACO performance in California as there is enormous variation in the structure of ACO contracts and many h ave only a few years of performance, IHA has begun to report on results from using the Commercial ACO Measure Set for 85 ACO contracts in California based on 2017 performance . In the charts below, IHA reports performance for three mutually exclusive gro ups: members cared for by ACOs representing a mix of models built on both HMO and PPO platforms, members cared for by provider organizations under capitated, delegated HMO contracts (excluding Kaiser Permanente medical groups), and members cared for by phy sicians under PPO contracts aggregated across the 19 Covered California pricing regions (see Figure 6. California Commercial ACO Performance Compared to HMOs and PPOs, 2017 ). Based on IHA analysis, ACOs provide care that is the same quality at a somewhat lower cost than either HMO s or PPO s. 49 Data only available for plan year 2015 and plan years 2017 -18.

The IHA Commercial ACO Measure Set r eports for performance based on 2018 were recently released and health insurance companies are required to report these results to Covered California . The variation in performance among ACO contracts wi ll be examined in cooperation with IHA , insurance companies and provider organization s and compared to the design elements MedPAC and others52 have cited as predict ors of success including two -sided risk, physician leadership (as compared to hospital leader ship) and greater emphasis on advanced primary care.53 Section 2: Implications for the Future Outside of the integrated delivery systems, Covered California 's contracted health insurance companies that share overlapping networks are implementing a variety of ACO models or components of ACO models within their networks. Covered California enrollment in ACOs , excluding integrated delivery systems, exceeds comparisons in California and the nation. Performance variation among ACO mod els may be attributed to design elements such as the structure of financial incentives including downside risk, the role of physicians in sponsorship and leadership structure, the percent of budget spent in primary care and the sophistication of population health and case management 52 The most current best evidence is documented in Chapter 8, Promotion of Integrated Delivery Systems and Accountable Care Organizations, of a companion Covered California report, Current Best Evidence and Performance Measures for Improving Quality of Care and Delivery System Reform . 53 Primary Care Collaborative.

IHA is building a registry based on such elements for all ACOs they measure. As discussed above, Covered California is work ing with insurers to use the performance data from the IHA Commercial ACO measure set to esta blish correlations with the design elements in the registry of ACO characteristics to determine best practices and inform future contract requirements. This report cites several ways in which integrated delivery systems are outperforming network model health plans . The success of ACOs in replicating the performance of integrated delivery systems may depend on alignment in adopting common best practice design elements. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accoun table for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 9 COVERED CALIFORNIA 73 Chapter 9: Networks Based on Value As a major strategy for effective care delivery, Covered California requires health insurance companies to select and regularly assess all clinicians, providers, hospitals and sites of care to ensure that care is safe, ti mely, effective, efficient, equitable, and patient -centered. Ideally, every network is designed to integrate and coordinate care , provides effective primary care and maximizes its value to enrollees . For many consumers, whether the provider they want to see is in their network or not is the first sign of value. Assuring consumers have access to the full range of providers and treatments and that networks are composed of a range of quality providers is a central part of Covered California's review and selection process of its contracted insurers (see \"Covered California Network Composition Review\"). Covered California works to ensure health plan networks are designed and maintained with a deliberate stra tegy to promote better quality, lower cost, improved health and health equity. This chapter on Networks Based on Value presents performance data and processes reported by health plans for contract requirements and includes assessments and observations by Covered California. This chapter is organized as follows: Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Section 2. Implications for the Future Section 1: Qualified Health Plan Experience Covered Ca lifornia's requirements for \"Networks Based on Value\" inclu de multiple elements related to ensuring that network design and selection of providers considers quality and patient experience in addition to cost and efficiency. Under current contract requirements, insurers report progress to Covered California for th e following: 1. The factors used to select providers and hospitals in the health plan network, including cost, clinical quality, patient reported experience, or other factors . Between 2015 and 2018, more health insurance companies were assessed as having Considered Comprehensive Factors (cost, quality, and patient experience) or Considered Cost Only as criter ia for selecting or contracting with providers and hospitals. For selecting providers, most insurers noted using provider credentialing, member satisfaction results , grievances and appeals information, and quality based on HEDIS measures. Fewer insurers reported using referral patterns to hospitals, value or cost reduction, or IHA Align Measure Perform (AMP) program results for selecting providers. All insurers indicated that a hospital's designation as a Center of Excellence was a selection factor and most reviewed and tracked publicly reported quality data from the Leapfrog Group, CMS Hospital Compare, and other quality -based organizations to determine whether to contract with a hospital. Fewer insurers reported evaluations of cost or participation in quality collaboratives as a factor in hospital selection. Hospital acquired infection rates are now reviewed routinely by health plans with their contracted hosp itals. Cal Hospital Compare has provided health plans four partially overlapping lists of hospitals with consistently low performance. Covered California is track ing and learn ing how insurers use these lists to determine next steps. Highlights Covered California Holding Health Plans Accoun table for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 9 COVERED CALIFORNIA 74 2. Adopt policies and procedures to only contract with providers and hospitals that d emonstrate quality and promote safety at a reasonable price . Based on a definition provided by Covered California, develop plans to exclude \"outlier poor performers\" on either cost or quality or document the rationale for continued contracting with poor pe rformers, including any improvement efforts the provider or hospital has undertaken by year -end 2020 . 3. Demonstrate action on high cost providers54 by annually reporting the following: a. The factors a health plan considers in assessing the relative unit prices and total costs of care; b. The extent to which the reasons for cost factors are adjusted or analyzed by elements such as area of service, population served, market dominance, services provided by the facility (e.g., trauma or tertiary), or other factors; c. How such factors are used in the selection of providers and hospitals; and d. Identification of specific hospitals and their distribution by cost deciles or other ways providers and hospitals are grouped by costs, e.g., as a percentage of Medicare costs. There are few best practices broadly adopted for managing networks based on value. Integrated delivery systems such as Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan have largely exclusive networks of hospitals and me dical groups. This chapter includes an assessment of these integrated delivery systems but largely focuses on the various strategies adopted by health insurance companies that do not have fully integrated delivery systems and often have overlapping hospita l and provider networks . Covered California adopted a common stra tegy in assessing hospital quality based on publicly reported data described in the \"Sites and Expanded Approaches to Care Delivery\" chapter. The hospital quality and safety requirements serve as a foundation on which insurers can build networks based on value. In addition to requiring insurers to design their networks based on value, Covered California conducts annual reviews of each health plan's network (see Covered California Network Composition Review ). 54 Covered Californ ia also requires health plans to report on the use of cost transparency tools as one of the s trategies to ensure providers are not charging unduly high prices . See Chapter 10, Appropriate Interventions for health plan reporting on this topic. Covered California Network Composition Review As part of its annual contracting cycles, Covered California assesses network composition including the number and types of physicians, medical groups and hospitals that are unique to particular health plans or available through multiple plans. Covered Cal ifornia also assesses the geographical distribution of health plan networks through drive times to hospitals and other indicators of how a health plan's distribution of providers assures consumers have timely access to care. Covered California coordinates with the California Department of Managed Health Care and the California Department of Insurance to ensure each health plan's network meets network adequacy standards and time and distance standards. Covered California also requires its contracted insurer s to include Essential Community Providers (ECPs) who serve low -income and medically underserved communities in their provider networks. Covered California provides insurers a list of ECPs each year that includes federally designated 340B providers, Califo rnia disproportionate share hospitals, federally qualified health centers and Indian health and Tribal health organizations, among others. Each year, Covered California assesses the degree to which health plans have included a variety of ECPs in their netw orks.

Assessment of Factors Used by Covered California Insurers to Select Physician Organizations and Individual Providers, 2015 , 2017 and 20 18), Covered California assessed the number of health insurance companies using cost, quality and patie nt experience as criteria for selecting or contracting with a provider.55 Between 2015 and 201 8, Covered California assessment of provider selection factors found that the number of insurers that Considered Comprehensive Factors or Considered Cost Only increased from seven to 10. Table 31. Assessment of Factors Used by Covered California Insurers to Select Physician Organi zations and Individual Providers, 2015 , 2017 and 20 1856 Source: Covered California Staff Analysis of Qualified Health Plan Submitted Data For plan years 2017 and 2018, health insurance companies were asked generally about factors used to select providers.57 For both years, m ost insurers reported using provider credentialing, member satisfaction results and grievances and appeals information, and quality or HEDIS measures for selecting providers. While six Covered California insurers formally participate in IHA's Align Measure Perform (AMP) program , few insurers described using AMP program results for selecting providers during 2017 -18.58 Three insurers reported reviewing referral p atterns of providers or provider groups to determine whether they refer to in -network hospitals or have established referral patterns to in -network hospitals. Only two insurers cited c ost savings o r cost reduction as a factor for selecting providers. Factors Used by Insurers to Select Hospitals Covered California assessed and categorized the number of health insurance companies using cost, quality and patient experience as criteria for selecting or contracting with hospitals (see Table 32. Assessment of Factors Used by Covered California Insurers to Select Hospitals, 2015, 2017 and 55 The 11 health insurance companies in Covered California are: Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California, Chinese Community Health Plan, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, L.A. Care, Molina Healthcare, Oscar Health, Sharp Health Plan, Valley Health Plan, and W estern Health Advantage. In the tables below, Health Net is counted twice because its reports data separately for Health Net Life (P PO/EPO products) and Health Net of California (HMO/HSP products). 56 Data only available for plan year 2015 and plan year 2017 -18. Covered California did not ask this question in the Certification Application for plan year 2016. 57 Information described here is based on insurers' narrative responses to questions in the Certification Application. Covered California asked generally about factors considered and did not specifically prompt insurers about each of them. As such, insurers could be using a factor to select providers but m ay not have described it. 58 For the IHA AMP program, one insurer does not formally participate but reviews the program results as a provider selection factor and another insurer is planning to participate but does not formally participate currently.

While many insurers do not currently use comprehensive factors in hospital selection, most insurers have been actively engaged in work to promote improvement in hospital quality performance as described in Chapter 11: Sites and Expanded Approaches to Care .

Several health plans also reviewed and tracked publicly reported quality data from the Leapfrog Group, CMS Hospital Compare, and other quality -based organizations to determine whether to contract with a hospital. Health insurance compa nies considered the cost or prices charged by a hospital when determining whether to contract with them. For example, some insurers evaluated costs as a percentage of Medicare rates and used Diagnosis -Related Group (DRG) case -mix adjusted cost per discharge to identify and group hospitals by cost deciles. Similarly, other insurers developed cost indices for hospitals and used a combination of cost and quality measures to determine whether to remove the hospital from t heir network. One insurer reported hospital participat ion in collaboratives , such as the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative , as a factor for contracting with hospital s during 2017 -18. 59 The 11 health insurance companies in Covered California are: Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California, Chinese Community Health Plan, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, L.A. Care, Molina Healthcare, Oscar Health, Sharp Health Plan, Valley Health Plan, and W estern Health Advantage. In the tables below, Health Net is counted twice because its reports data separately for Health Net Life ( PPO/EPO products) and Health Net of California (HMO/HSP products). 60 Data only available for plan year 2015 and plan year 2 017-18.

To support insurers in meet ing the requirement to exclude hospital outlier poor performers, Covered California has worked with Cal Hospital Compare to determine if there is a valid way to define outlier poor performance for hospitals in a way that can be implemented consistently acr oss all insurers . This definition is based on specific measures of cost and quality, national benchmarks, analysis of variation in California performance, best evidence for quality improvement, and effective stakeholder engagement. Based on their review, Cal Hospital Compare found n o single c omposite measure meeting these criteria was available so they provided insurers with four distinct lists of hospitals with consistently low performance based on: 1. The Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction Program (HACRP) through CMS that uses s ix publicly available measures in to publicly report and financially penalize hospitals that perform in the bottom 25 percent of all hospitals nationally ; 2. An honor roll of top hospital performers developed by Cal Hospital Compare using the CMS HACRP metrics; 3. The Leapf rog Group's Hospital Safety Score; and 4. A report from the California Department of Public Health focused only on Hospital Associated Infections. These tools do not meet the requirement for a single composite system, and none include key safety concerns wher e there is no standard publicly reported measure, like Adverse Drug Events . However, these four lists provide \"signals of concern\" and the measures on these lists include the five Hospital Associated Infection s (HA Is) that Covered California has focused on . The greater the number of \"low performance\" lists a hospital appears on, the greater the concern. These lists are not yet publicly reported but have been provided to insurer s for use in hospital negotiations. Insurers are responsible to notify Covered California which if any of these hospitals will be excluded from their networks or reasons for continued inclusion by year -end 2020. Covered California's requirements for hospital quality and safety serve as a foundation for which health insurance companies can build networ ks based on v alue. As such, the requirement for excluding \"outlier poor performers\" and describ ing the factors they use to select hospital s is related to the requirement for insurers to work with hospitals to improve quality and safety, described in Chapte r 11: Sites and Expanded Approaches to Care . Assessing Relative Unit Prices and Total Costs of Care Covered California supports strategies that promote a competitive market with restraint on prices and provides access to high quality care. Health insurance companies consider a range of processes and factors when assessing the relative unit prices and total costs of care at the hospital, medical group, or provider level . Insurer reported data shows that most insurers compared the cost of p roviders and hospitals to other similar providers in the market or region when assessing the costs of providers (see Table 3 3. Covered California Insurer's Process and Factors for Assessing Costs of Providers and Hospitals, 2015, 2017 and 2018 ). Most insurers also used specific fee schedules or fee schedules based on a percent of Medicare reimbursement in their contract s with providers. Three health insurance companies annually adjusted capitation payments to providers and hospitals or paid as a Covered California Holding Health Plans Accoun table for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 9 COVERED CALIFORNIA 78 percent of premium. One insurer used Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD ) data to understand the cost -to-charge ratios of specific hospitals . Table 33.

In managing variation, enrollees should be assured that any provider they go to for care will meet high standards for quality an d cost management. Variation in hospital performance was a first target since performance is publicly reported for several key safety measures. Insurers joined Covered California in focusing on a common set of measures in hospital performance evaluation an d contracting. As reported in Chapter 11, this effort has led to improvements in hospital quality and safety . Covered California plans to continue to work with insurers , other purchasers, hospitals and other stakeholders to assess what can be done to estab lish common summary quality and cost hospital performance indicators that would appropriately be used for purposes of either targeting hospitals for improvement or exclusion from Covered California networks. Covered California is also partnering with the Integrated Healthcare Association's (IHA) California Regional Health Care Cost and Quality Atlas to profile insurer's physicians and physician organization networks based on the wide variation in clinical quality, satisfaction, and tot al cost of care across the 19 Covered California regions by insurance type. Covered California encourages insurers to use the IHA Atlas data to profile their networks by displaying the cost and quality of physician organizations and physicians that serve H MO, EPO and PPO enrollees . Covered California is work ing with other purchasers, insurers , physician organizations and other stakeholders to define or create a standard for low-quality and high -cost physician organizations that could be the basis for targeted improvement or removing such physician organizations from their networks . As with variation in hospital networks, the first priority will be to seek ways to align efforts to improve care. 62 Data only available for plan year 2015 and plan year 2017 -18.

Appropriate Interventions is an expansive topic, but this chapter, focuses on the following : (1) pharmacy utilization management ; (2) consumer and patient engagement , which includes the use of cost transparency tools and shared decision - making; (3) addressing overuse of care through Smart Care California ; and (4) appropriate use of service s, as measured through standard measures in the M arketplace Quality Rating System. This chapter on Appropriate Interventions is organized as follows: Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Section 2. Health Plan Measures Reported to the Marketplace Quality Rating System Section 3. Implications for the Future Section 1. Qualified Health Plan Experience Qualified Health Plan Experience presents performance data reported by health insurance companies for contract requirements and includes assessments and observations by Covered California. 63 Committee on Quality Health Care in America, Institute of Medicine. (2001). Crossing the quality chasm: a new health system f or the 21st century. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press. In 2018, ten insurers consid ered value in pharmacy formulary management and ten insurers used at least one third -party value assessment methodology (e.g. ICER Value Assessment Framework). All health insurance companies use a systematic, evidence -based process for monitoring off -label use of pharmaceuticals. Virtually all of Covered California enrollees have access to cost transparency tools to assist consumer decision making about treatments or procedures (ten of 11 insurers covering 99 percent of enrollees). Insurers are approaching completion of implementation of many of the recommended Smart Care California improvements to reduce opioid overuse including limiting the quantity of tablets in first prescriptions, removing barriers to medication -assisted treatme nt and drugs used to reverse overdoses. This collaborative work with other California state purchasers has contributed to reduced opioid prescribing and increased prescribing for buprenorphine, the leading medication to treat opioid disorders. Covered Cali fornia is continuing to expand the scope and nature of its efforts to reduce waste and assure patients are only getting medically necessary care. Highlights Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIV ERY CHAPTER 10 COVERED CALIFORNIA 80 Pharmacy Utilization Management One component of appropriate interventions is the appropriate use of prescriptions and how health insurance companies consider cost and quality in determining their drug lists or formularies. Drug costs continue to increase at a higher rate than other health care costs for generics, name brands and specialty drugs across all insurance markets. Health insurance companies can put downward pressure on drug spending through a variety of mechanisms. Covered Califor nia requires insurers to describe ways they are working to achieve value in drug spending, ranging from formulary decision making to decision support tools. Covered California collects information on health insurance company activities to inform its analysis of the relative ef ficacy of different strategies . As part of contract requirements on achieving value in prescription drug spend, insurers annually report the following: 1. How they currently consider value in formulary selection; 2. If independent value assessment methodologies are used, which ones are used; 3. If and how construction of formularies is based on total cost of care; 4. If and how off -label use is monitored ; and 5. The extent of decision support provided to prescribers and members. Because insurers reported information in a narrative format, further data would be needed to assess the effectiveness and impact of their activities , which may be facilitated by the addition of cost data to the information currently submitted by insurers to Covered Califo rnia. Ten of 11 health insurance companies consider ed value in pharmacy formulary management in 2018 (see Table 34. Covered California Insurer's Consideration of Value in Formulary and Value Assessment Methods, 2017 and 2018 ). Nine insurers described the use of a value assessment methodology as part of their Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P andT) Committee, which all insurers are required to use. Health insurance companies also report on the use of the following third-party value assessment methodologies : Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP) NCCN Resource Treatment Options (ASCO VF) ACC/AHA Cost/Va lue Methodology in Clinical Practice Guidelines Oregon State Health Evidence Review Commission Prioritization Methodology Premera Value Based Drug Formulary (Premera VBF) DrugAbacus Institute for Economic Review (ICER ) Value Assessment Framework (ICER VF) Real Endpoints Blue Cross/Blue Shield Technology Evaluation Center International Assessment Processes (e.g., United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE )) Eight of 11 insurers used at leas t one third -party value assessment methodology as part of its P andT Committee process in 2018. Seven insurers consider value assessment in formulary tier placement. Health insurance companies use one of several different independent value assessment methodologies listed, but the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) assessment is the most commonly used . ICER is considered to have a strong methodology compared to others and emphasizes Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIV ERY CHAPTER 10 COVERED CALIFORNIA 81 transpar ency, conflict -free funding, and actionable activities for plans that consider the total cost of care. ICER also includes a framework for evaluating short and long -term budget impacts, and includes a \"value -based price benchmark,\" reflecting how each drug should be priced to appropriately reflect long-term improved patient outcomes.

Covered California Insurer's Consideration of Total Cost of Care in F ormulary, Off -Label Use Monitoring and Decision Support for Providers and Consumers , 2017 and 2018 ). All 11 health insurance companies engaged in systematic, evidence -based process for monitoring off - label use of pharmaceuticals , which reflects state law requirements for using nationally recognized sources for evidence -based off label monitoring. In 2018, nine of 11 insurers provided member -specific decision support for both prescribers and consumers, of which seven provided this support at the point -of-care. Several new software products have recently become available and are now being used by Covered California's insurers to allow physicians to see pricing information on drugs they are prescribing and the availability of cheaper, equally effec tive a lternatives. Examples of these software tools include Gemini Health's Drug -Cost Transparency Service, Sure Scripts Real -Time Prescription Benefit, and OptumRx's PreCheck MyScript. Table 35.

As part of its requirements for demonstrating action on high cost providers, Covered California required insurers to repo rt on their efforts to make variation in provider or hospital cost transparent to consumers and the use of cost transparency tools by consumers.64 Cost transparency tools have the potential to reduce costs by enabling patients to switch to lower priced providers and publicly acknowledging high -priced providers which could lead to these providers reducing their prices.65 Covered California require d health insurance companies with more than 100,000 enrollees to deploy online tools and 10 of the 11 in surers now do so, representing 99 percent of Covered California enrollees. Table 36. Covered California Insurer's Use of Cost Transparency Tools, 2015 , 2017 and 2018 describes the number of insurers that use cost transparency tools , what services are provi ded, and the percentage of enrollees with access to each type of tool . As of 2018 , the tools offered to the most enrollees were Online Procedure and Treatment Cost Estimators, which were available through three different health plans to about 70 percent of enrollees. Other tools include Provider -Specific Cost Information which three hea lth plans provide to about 21 percent of enrollees. Table 36.

Covered California did not ask this question in the Certification Application for plan year 2016. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIV ERY CHAPTER 10 COVERED CALIFORNIA 83 7.5 percent of consumers. There are not standard national benchmarks to assess the volume and type of consumer utilization of cost transparency tools, so Covered California is in the process of determining how best to assess what volume and type of utilization best meets consumers' needs. While there is growing research on how best to effectively engage consumers in their care, discussions about value should both educate consumers and help them work with their providers to make be tter choices to align their preferences and likely outcomes.67 However, there are currently no standard benchmarks related to use of consumers tools and definitions of the types of users . Similarly, there are multiple definitions for consumer engagement, wi th all assuming that consumers have the knowledge and skills to understand and participate in the engagement process .68 Covered California is reviewing these issue s and the available evidence to inform future contract expectations. Shared Decision -Making There is clear evidence that for many \"preference -sensitive \" conditions, clinicians do not regularly elicit patients' preferences or provide information to support informed patient decision -making. Too often variation in care tracks with provider preference s rather than those of patients. Shared decision -making engages patients in bringing their values and preferences to bear often with the help of decision aids that present the basic science of the condition being treated, the various options for treatment and the tradeoffs such as quality or length of life. Shared decision -making is designed for preference -sensitive conditions, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and knee and hip replacements where more than one evidence -based treatment is available or where the evidence is incomplete or uncertain. Variation in treatment of these conditions based on patient preferences is important and the Covered California contract requirements included reporting how insurers support shared decision -making including th e proportion of patients with preference sensitive conditions who have used a decision aid. The requirement for health insurance companies to report on shared decision -making was put on hold to enable health insurance companies to focus on cost and quality tools and implement the Smart Care initiatives described below . Based on Covered California's ongoing discussions with insurers , several have contracts with vendors that publish decision aids and are using them in case management. Evidence documents that when patients use decision aids to support shared decision -making with their clinician at the time and place decisions are made, their knowledge of th eir options improves , and they feel better about what matters to them .69 There are a variety of vendors for decision aids which vary in quality and evidence supporting their effectiveness. Each insurance company and many medical groups have made their own vendor selections and therefore offer different tools. None has achieved implementation at scale and it's unlikely they will with this diversity. Covered California has an opportunity over the next several years to work with stakeholders across the deliver y system to consider selecting a single vendor and to support broad adoption of shared decision -making at the point of care . 67 S, Delbanco, T.

Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIV ERY CHAPTER 10 COVERED CALIFORNIA 84 Addressing Overuse of Care through Smart Care California In 2015, Covered California joined the other state purchasers , the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) , to form a multi - stakeholder workgroup called Smart Care California to address overuse of services that result when evidence -based practices are not being followed. This multi -stakeholder work group is facilitated by the Integrated Healthcare Association ( IHA), with funding and thought leadership from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF). Smart Care California selected three areas of focus from the list of Choosing Wisely guidelines published by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation in cooperation with other specialty societies: (1) low -risk (nulliparous term, singleton, vertex (NTSV)) deliveries performed without medical indication; (2) opioid overuse and misuse; and (3) imaging for low back pain.70 Health insurance companies are invi ted to participate in the development of improvement strategies and are required to adopt the guidelines developed by Smart Care California. All insurers are participating either as regular attendees or by implementing guidelines published by Smart Care California . Work is underway for adopting best practices for payment for maternity services as well as for combatting the opioid crisis. At this time, Smart Care has focused on these two areas, while overuse of imaging for low back pain, which would entail a large -scale effort to change the care patterns of thousands of physicians across California , has been on hold while resource and other implementation challenges are considered. The measure for imaging for low back pain will still be collected in Marketpla ce QRS and other quality measurement programs. Health insurance companies' efforts to reduce low -risk C -section deliveries are impacting the entire maternity population served at each plan's network hospitals , not just Covered California's enrolled popula tion. In addition, Covered California, DHCS, and CalPERS are collaboratively engaged in efforts to reduce low -risk C -sections , so the same initiatives are positively impacting their hospitals and care regardless of the source of the consumer's coverage . Further discussion of efforts to reduce low -risk C - sections is included in Chapter 11: Sites and Expanded Approaches to Care Delivery. Smart Care California Efforts to Reduce Opioid Overuse The Smart Care California work group has surveyed health insurance companies on their efforts to reduce opioid overuse in four categories : (1) preventing new starts ; (2) managing pain safely ; (3) treating addiction ; and (4) stopping death. Comparison of performance in these areas are based on aggregated s urvey data from Covered California, CalPERS and DHCS is provided in Figure 9. Smart Care California Purchaser Level Performance on Opioid Overuse Reduction , 2018 . Covered California insurers are approaching completion of implementation for many of the recommended improvements including limiting the quantity of tablets in first prescriptions, removing barriers to medication -assisted treatment and for drugs used to reverse overdoses. The table below reflects remarkable improvement as none of these recommendations were practices before Smart Care California published their guidelines. This survey will continue to be conducted annually. According to the Smart Care survey, all 11 Covered Californ ia insurers now implement quantity limits for new starts of opioids and nine Covered California insurers have removed prior authorization for physical therapy for back pain, improving timely patient access to care and preventing new starts of opioid medica tions. The survey also indicates that more than half of insurers have increased access to 70 See more: https://www.iha.org/our -work/insights/smart -care-california . Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIV ERY CHAPTER 10 COVERED CALIFORNIA 85 behavioral health services for patients with chronic pain, while two insurers are in the planning stages to increase access. These improvements have the potential to greatly aide in curbing the opioid epidemic in the state. Figure 9. Smart Care California Purchaser Level Performance on Opioid Overuse Reduction , 2018 Source: Smart Care California, 2019 As seen below in Figure 10. California 2010 -2018 Progress on Opioid Overuse Reduction , prescribing for opioids is falling and prescribing for buprenorphine, the leading medication to treat opioid disorders, is rising. But overdose deaths remain high. The reason overdoses are still such a threat appears t o be Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIV ERY CHAPTER 10 COVERED CALIFORNIA 86 that street drugs are replacing prescription drugs as the cause of death.71 This data implies that neither California or the nation has found the right balance for treating opioid addiction. Opioid prescriptions appear to have fallen faster than capaci ty for treatment has expanded. Figure 10: California 201 0-2018 Progress on Opioid Overuse Reduction Source: California Health Care Foundation analysis of data from the California Department of Public Health www.cdph.ca.gov/opioiddashboard Much more needs to be done to support providers in reducing opioid prescriptions safely including expanding access to medication assisted treatment. While efforts to addre ss the opioid epidemic have benefited from many sectors focusing needed attention on this problem, Covered California believes the Smart Care initiative is an example of how improvement can be encouraged when major purchasers \u2014 in this case Medi -Cal, CalPE RS and Covered California \u2014 align to work with insurers and providers to meet a common clinical need. Additionally, Covered California is more closely t racking opioid use and medication assisted treatment use through its Healthcare Evidence Initiative database.

Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIV ERY CHAPTER 10 COVERED CALIFORNIA 87 See Appendix 2: Additional Health Plan Measures Reported to the Quality Rating System , for six Quality Rating System measures that pertain to Appropriate Interventions : 1. Avoidance of Antibiotic Treatment in Adults with Acute Bronchitis (Table A23) 2. Appropriate Testing for Children with Pharyngitis (Table A24) 3. Appropriate Treatment for Children with Upper Respiratory Infection (Table A25) 4. Use of Imaging Studies for Low Back Pain (Table A26) 5. Annual Monitoring for Patients on Persistent Medications (Table A27) 6. Access to Information (Table A28) These measures address the both the overuse of low value services and the appropriate use of services. The first three m easures above reflect efforts to reduce overuse of antibiotics which is resulting in wide spread resistance to potentially lifesaving treatment. Imaging for low back pain, especially CT and MR I scans, should only be used when considering surgery for intractable pain or neurologic complications related to low back pain . Many patients with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis are on complex medications with potential side - effects. Standard routine monit oring , as measured by Annual Monitoring for Patients on Persistent Medications , may be overlooked if not tracked and implemented systematic ally. As detailed under the section on shared decision -making, supporting patients with the right information to part ner with their providers to decide on appropriate inter ventions for their care is critical not only for preference sensitive care but to increase adherence to evidence -based c are. Section 3: Implications for the Future There is good evidence that a very high proportion of care delivered is unwarranted or delivered poorly; some diagnostic tests are overused, and there is limited information available to assess relative efficacy and value of many drugs , devices and even some surgical interventions . Genetic testing is starting to show value in guiding clinical decisions and \"personalized\" approaches to cancer care are being developed and tested. All these innovations come with extraordinary costs and only preliminary understanding of which patients will benefit the most. Shared decision making requires that there is active and transparent information sharing between consumers and their providers. Cost and quality tools provide consumers with the knowledge to better engage with their own health decision ma king, but even among the tools that are available today there is little success engaging patients or providers in their adoption . Future improvements in technology and data sharing will lead to better consumer engagement. Covered California is continu ing to monitor insurers to ensure that consumers are being provided the most reliable tools and information so that they can receive the best care at the right time. Covered California has an opportunity over the next several years to work with stakeholders acr oss the delivery system to consider selecting a single vendor and to support broad adoption of shared decision -making at the point of care. Over the next few years, a wide range of innovations in care delivery will have dramatic impacts on how care is provided, and the quality and cost of that care. Covered California has shown how purchasers, payers and providers can work together in adopting best practices to reduc e variation in hospital performance and address overuse of opioids . Decision support to providers and patients at the point of care is particularly promising, whether through consumer cost tools integrated with the medical record, shared decision -making de cision aids or point of care software integrated with electronic health record order entry to support adherence to formularies, bringing this information to where decisions are made Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIV ERY CHAPTER 10 COVERED CALIFORNIA 88 appears to be critical to successful adoption. Covered California is asses sing the extent to which its contractual requirements can assist in prioritizing and standardizing implementation of best practices to benefit all Californians.

Expanded approaches to care delivery also includes who provides care in addition to physicians including clinically appropriate providers such as registered nurses, pharmacists, midwives , nurse practitioners, physician assistants or non -licensed providers like community health workers. This chapter on Sites and Expanded Approaches to Care Delivery has a different organization. \"Sites\" refer to the traditional medical care settings of hospitals and physician offices. Care in physician offices is covered in Chapter 7: Promotion o f Effective Primary Care, while Chapter 10: Appropriate Interventions, examines various clinical interventions largely delivered in or ordered by physician offices, to ensure they are rooted in the Institute of Medicine's six aims for safe, timely, effecti ve, efficient, equitable and patient -centered care.72 Hospital care is a broad topic and can include a range of system level reforms. This chapter focuses on publicly reported performance data that health insurance companies are using to establish contract requirements for hospital quality and safety, which are (1) within a n insurer's oversight authority ; (2) help foster alignment across contracted insurers and their contracted hospitals; and (3) benefit from the availability of publicl y reported hospital performance data reflecting the experi ence of the hospital 's entire patient population. Covered California has worked with hospitals and the California Hospital Association to select measures for which coaching programs , 72 Committee on Quality Health Care in America, Institute of Medicine.

The California Department of Public Health reports that as of 2018 there has been a statistically significant reduction in major types of hospital associated infection rates in California hospitals ( CLABSI, SSI, MRSA, and C. difficile bacterial ). Covered Ca lifornia's contract requirements \u2014 aligned with those of CMS and other purchasers \u2014 insurer engagement , and work with improvement collaboratives have contributed to 3,392 infections avoided, 251 lives saved and over $62M in one - year cost savings. Covered C alifornia's support for appropriate C -Sections helped 56% of California hospitals achieve the national goal of NTSV C -section rates of 23.9% or lower in 2018, represent ing a 12-point improvement from 2015 , avoiding 7 ,200 C -sections over 3 years . The number of insurers that participated in the Smart Care California collaborative, increased from six to all 11 by 2017 with full participation continu ing since then. Similarly, the number of insurers that participated in Partnership for Patients collab orative increased from two to ten insurers between 2016 and 2018. For insurer engagement of network hospitals, 10 insurers were assessed as having Full Engagement or Engaged for hospital safety in 2018. For maternity care, all 11 insurers were assessed as Full Engagement or Engaged for maternity care in 2018.

For expanded approaches to care delivery, current requirements pertaining to (1) telehealth and (2) Centers of Excellence are discussed , while Covered California has not developed reporting or contract requirements related to many of the existing and evolving sites of care or approaches . Qualified Health Plan Experience For hospital quality and safety , Covered California has the following requirements of contracted health plans :73 1. Encouraging hospital participation in quality improvement collaboratives and coaching programs 2. Reducing the avoidable hospital associated infections (HAIs) starting with the me trics included in the CMS Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction Program (HACRP) a. Catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) b. Central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) c. Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) difficile bacterial infection ) (CDI) e. Surgical site infection of the colon (SSI Colon) 3. Reducing low -risk, nulliparous term singleton vertex (NTSV) C -section rates to 23.9 percent or lower (a national Healthy People 2020 goal) ;74 4. Expanding value -based payments for hospital quality and maternity care including: a. Tying two percent of hospital payments to value by the end of 2019 b. Eliminating financial incentives for hospitals or physicians to perform C -Sections ; and 5. Excluding a hospital from their network initially by year -end 2020 if the hospital is an outlier poor performer and not working to improve safety and maternity care. For expanded approaches to care delivery , Covered California requires health plans to use technology, including telehealth and remote home monitoring ,75 to assist in higher quality, accessible, patient -centered care . Hospital Quality and Safety Encouraging Hospital Participation in Coaching Programs and Collaboratives Health insurance companies are required to encourage hospitals to participate in the Partnership for Patients coaching program, which is funded by the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support designated Hospital Improvement Innovation Networks (HIINs).76 In California, there are 5 HIINs which engage individual hospitals and systems to participate in train ings to reduce hospital associated infections, adverse drug events, falls, pressure ulcers, and other negative health events that occur in hospital settings.77 This encouragement can be accomplished through hospital administrator 73 Currently, hospital quality and safety performance are tracked at general acute care (GAC) hospitals, because specialized hospitals (such as long -term care) have different performance benchmarks and variables to consider. 74 First pregnancy (nulliparous), full term, no twins or beyond (singleto n), and head down (vertex) or NTSV pregnancies are generally thought of as low See more: https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics -objectives/ topic/maternal -infant -and-child-health 75 Telehealth services can include remote monitoring when used for disease management in between visits. 76 See more : https://partnershipforpatients.cms.gov/about -the-partnership/aboutthepartnershipforpatients.html . 77 In California, the five HIINs are: (1) Health Services Advisory Group, which is managed by the Hospital Quality Institute, (2 ) Dignity, (3) Vizient (created by the VHA/UHC merger), (4) Children's Hospitals' Solutions for Patient Safety, and (5) Premiere Inc. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 11 COVERED CALIFORNIA 91 engagement, letter campaigns to providers, contracting discussions, and other creative means that communicate the importance and urgency of reducing the incidence of avoidable negative health events in hospitals . Covered California also require s insurers to engage with their network hospitals to promote awareness of (1) NTSV C-section rates, (2) availability of provider and consumer education, and (3) promote participation in data sharing and coaching offered by the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC), with the goal of reducing NTSV C -sections to the nation al Healthy People 2020 target of 23.9 percent of deliveries or lower. The CMQCC is a multi -stakeholder organization that provide s real time data sharing, quality improvement toolkits, and coaching collaboratives to improve maternal and neonatal health in s everal measure areas, including NTSV C -sections. Additionally, Smart Care California built consensus around a menu of payment structures to promote the goal of ending financial incentive s for providing NTSV C -Sections : (1) blended case rates; (2) low risk C-section reduction as a metric for payment incentive programs; or (3) population -based payment models.78 As shown in Table 37. Covered California Insurer Participation in Improvement Collaboratives , the number of insurers that participated in Smart Care California increased from six to 11 between 2016 and 20 17 and this trend of full participation continued through 2018. Similarly, the number of insurers that participated in Partnership for Patients increased from two to ten health plans between 2016 and 2018. Table 37.

Insurer activities range from sending tailored mail to hospitals, physicians and administrative staff, tracking measures and discussing performance in regular hospital quality meetings or contract renewal meetings, including pa rticipation in coaching programs as a metric in hospital incentive programs, hosting webinars, adjusting website content for members and providers, and visiting hospitals to distribute materials.

Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 11 COVERED CALIFORNIA 92 found the number of insurers with Full Engagement for hospital safety tripled from three to nine between 2016 and 20 17. As of 2018, 10 insurers had Full Engagement or were Engaged for Hospital Safety . For maternity care, most insurers have consistently had Full Engagement from 2016 to 20 18, with all plans having Full Engagement or Engaged as of 2018. Table 38.

Publicly reported data on hospital participation in quality improvement programs shows a positive trend over the past four years, with 148 hospitals participating in 2014 to 251 hospitals in 2018 ( see Figure A 2. California Hospital s Involved in Hospital Quality Institute Hospital I mprovement Innovation Networks, 2014 -18 in Appendix 4: Additional Publicly Reported Hospital Quality and Safety Data ). Participation in the five HIIN improvement programs is near universal, with fewer than ten acute care hospitals in California not partici pating, according to the Hospital Quality Institute. Collectively Reducing Avoidable Hospital Associated Infections Covered California has focused on aligned and collaborative efforts to promote hospital safety based on the recognition that improving hospi tal performance in this area requires a comprehensive and cross -payer approach. Every day, about one in 25 hospital patients nationally contracts at least one hospital associated infection (HAI).80 These infections can significan tly delay recovery, increase the expense of a hospital stay, and even result in death. Of the approximately two million American patients who acquire a HAI annually, an estimated 90,000 will die.81 Before implementation of the Partnership for Patients program, 80 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Expert review of pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research, 9(5), 417 -422. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 11 COVERED CALIFORNIA 93 it was estimated that HAIs and other avoidable hospital complicat ions were associated with more than 400,000 deaths per year.82,83 Not only are HAIs harmful, they are also a burden on the healthcare system. The cost of a single case can range from just under $1,000 to nearly $50,000, with costs borne by insurers, employers, and patients through out -of-pocket expenses.84 Depending upon the type of infe ction, the direct cost of HAIs to hospitals range s from $28 billion to $45 billion.85 Measures to track HAIs are readily av ailable through CMS Hospital Compare, California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and Cal Hospital Compare. Covered California determined the five HAIs to focus on through cons ultation with stakeholders and subject matter experts including CDPH, Cal Hos pital Compare, Hospital Quality Institute (a quality improvement center within the California Hospital Association), Center s for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), insurers , and consumer advocates. The criteria for selecting these measures were: Clinica l importance; Robust, publicly available performance data; Alignment with other purchasers including CMS; Wide variation in performance among California hospitals; and Availability of coaching collaboratives with change packages to support improvement for free or minimal cost to hospitals. Understanding Hospital Performance Variation to Target Quality Improvement Efforts Covered California assist s insurers in understanding hospital performance variation to enable better targeting of hospitals for engagement and quality improvement. Covered California displays hospital performance through graphic distributions where every California hospital's measure score is represented by a dot, and dots are color coded to denote in - or out -of-network status. The goal of these graphs is to bring attention to the variation in hospital performance on each HAI and to help insurers know which hospitals to focus on in their eng agement and quality improvement efforts. For example, below Figure 11. Sample of One Covered California Insure r's Hospital Associated Infection Incidence for Catheter -associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) \u2014 In-Network and Out -of-Network Hospitals, 2018 shows the performance of a n insurer's 2018 network for C AUTI standardized infection ratios. The hospitals identified by blue dots on the right -hand side of the chart represent in -network hospitals for this insure r that have infection rates above the risk adjusted expected rate . Covered California's identification and display of hospital infection rates provides additional information for insurers to use in their design of networks and in their engagement with hosp itals to encourage participati on in quality improvement initiatives. 82 James, J.

To develop tailored approaches for targeting network hospitals for improvement, insurers can also leverage the 201 8 HAI reports from CDPH ,86 which list hospitals with better or worse HAI incidence than the national baseline by county (see Appendix 4: Additi onal Publicly Reported Hospital Quality and Safety Data ). Publicly reported data on HAIs are reported at the hospital level , not the insurer level, through CDPH data on infection rate trends. According to the CDPH, there has been a statistically significant reduction in CLABSI, SSI, MRSA, and C . difficile bacterial infection rates between 2015 and 201 8 (see Figure 12. Hospital Associated Infection Incidence in California Hospitals, 2015 -18).87 For these four HAI measures, the above chart shows a steady drop over three years, of which C. Difficile infections were the last to show progress, but as of 2018 has dropped 41 percent since 2015. The rates are express ed as a ratio of observed over a risk adjusted expected rate based on national standards. For all infection rates to be falling and for all rates to be below the national expected ratio of 1.0 reflects concerted effort among many stakeholders in California and represents remarkable progress. CDPH does not include hospital CAUTI information in its analysis. 86 See more: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/AnnualHAIReport s.aspx . 87 For additional data, see C.

November 2019. It is challenging to calculate the impact of hospital infections that have been prevented. However, Cal Hospital Compare , with support from IBM Watson , calculated the mortality rates of hospital associated infections and the usual costs of caring for those infections based on evidence from the literature . They have evidence to support this calculation for four of the targeted infections: CLABSI, CAUTI, SSI Colon, and C. Diff. The result, for the twelve months between October 1, 2017 and September 30, 2018 , compared to April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017, shows that 3 ,392 infections were avoided resulting in 251 California n lives saved and $62 million dollars sav ed. It is important to note that Covered California insurer engagement and payment strategy efforts did not create this improvement alone, but the contract requirements were likely helpful contributors to the success.88 Covered California has partnered with existing stakeholder groups and organizations, to implement hospital quality and safety requirements that include a standard set of metrics and several common approaches to quality improvement with aligned expectations across 11 health insurance companies . Prior to 2016, health insurance companies did not find most hospitals receptive to discussion of quality performance in contract discussions and insurer medical management and network management teams were traditionally siloed internal ly. Importantly , under the leadership of the Hospital Quality Institute, the California Hospital Association has taken a lead in increasing the focus on quality. Health insurance companies also report ed that the alignment of 11 insurers with consistent message of insurer accountability for variation and a prioritized set of measures has changed the environment and supported measurable improvement. 88 Of note, these requirements became effective in 2017 but stakeholder discussions on the importance of quality improvement beg an in summer of 2015. Some pla ns began engaging hospitals earlier than 2017 and some as early as summer 2015. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 11 COVERED CALIFORNIA 96 Collectively Reducing Unnecessary C -Sections: Reduce Low -Risk NTSV C -Section Rates to 23.9 Percent or Lower C-sections can be life -saving, but significant numbers of healthy first -time mothers are undergoing this major surgery when it is not medically necessary. Unnecessary C -sections are dangerous for the mother and baby, increasing the risk of complications such as hemorrhage, infection, transfusions, blood clots, respiratory complications, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission .89 Roughly 90 percent of women with a prior C -Section currently deliver by C -section fo r future births, leading to higher risk s of additional complications, including placenta previa or accreta and uterine rupture (which can cause hemorrhage, hysterectomy, or death) .90 Compared to vaginal delivery, babies born by repeat C-section have higher rates of respiratory morbidity and NICU admission rates resulting in longer hospital stays and higher medical costs.91 Covered California holds health insurance companies responsible to manage variation in provider performance across their contracted networks rather than manage to average performance. To that end, insurers are required to engage with their network hospitals to promote awareness of (1) low risk C-section rat es, (2) availability of provider and consumer education, and (3) promote participation in data sharing and coaching offered by the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC), with the goal of reducing NTSV C -sections to 23.9 percent of deliveri es or lower (as set in the national Healthy People 2020 goals). CMQCC gained national attention for contributing to California's decreasing maternal mortality rates and now works to reduce NTSV C -sections. Hospital participation in the CMQCC data collecti on and improvement collaborative is now nearly universal partly due to insurer encouragement and inclusion in contracting discussions with hospitals. As of July 2018, nearly 95 percent of California hospital births occur at hospitals participating in data reporting or collaboratives managed by the Maternal Data Center (MDC) within the CMQCC (see Figure A3: Percentage of California Hospital Births at CMQCC Participating Hospitals in Appendix 4: Additional Publicly Reported Hospital Quality and Safety Data ).92 Progress to reduce NTSV C -sections has been substantial between 2015 and 201 8. In 2015, the variation in C -section rates for NTSV deliveries among maternity hospitals in California was enormous, ranging from 1 0 to 75.8 percent . Figure 13. Distribution of NTSV C -section Rates for Hospitals that Reported to the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, 2018 shows the range of NTSV C - section rates for hospitals reporting to CMQCC in 2018. The range was 6.2 to 41.1 percent with an aggrega ted rate of 23.3 percent and a median of 23.2 percent, which are both below the Healthy People 2020 target of 23.9 percent . The absence of the highest outliers signifies substantial change in maternity practice in the state of California. 89 J. P.

As of the first half of 2019 , the number hospitals that participate in CMQCC and meet the NTSV C- section target was 63 percent (compared to 44 percent in 2015) and there has been a 22 percent decrease in the percent of hospitals with a rate above 26 percent (42 percent in 2015) (see Figure 14.

Hospitals with C -Sections Rates Below 23.9 Percent or Above 26 Percent Report ed to the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, 2018 Source: CMQCC Maternal Data Center , 2019 Expand Value -based Payments for Hospitals and Maternity Care Just as Covered California promotes changes in how physicians are paid to foster payments that encourage coordination and advanced primary care (see Chapter 7: Promoti on of Effective Primary Care) , it requires insurers to change payments to improve hospital quality and maternity care. Health plans are required to adopt payment methods that (1) tie at least two percent of hospital payments to value , and (2) eliminate financial incentives for hospital facilities or physic ians to perform C -Sections. Hospital Payments: Health insurance companies are required to adjust payments to hospitals so that at least two percent of overall hospital payments are tied to value for each product by the end of 2019 and increasing over the following years to at least 6 percent by year -end 2023. This can be accomplished by either withholding payment pending documentation of quality performance, bonuses, or a combination of both depending on the circumstances at each hospital. Health insuranc e companies are required to include the five specific HAI measures and the NTSV C -section measure, but insurers are given flexibility to include appropriate additional metrics based on their judgment and priorities such as patient satisfaction, additional clinical quality measures, safety, or readmissions. However, the entire two percent cannot be attributed to readmissions due to concern that hospitals serving a disproportionate share of disadvantaged populations may be inadvertently harmed. Maternity Car e Payments: Health insurance companies are encouraged to adjust labor and delivery payments to physicians and hospitals so that by year -end 2019 payment does not incentivize performing C -sections. To provide guidance to hospitals and insurers , Smart Care C alifornia, a public - private multi -stakeholder workgroup led by California state purchasers, built consensus around the following payment structures: (1) blended case rates; (2) low risk C -section reduction as a metric for Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 11 COVERED CALIFORNIA 99 payment incentive programs; or (3) population -based payment models.94 While Smart Care California emphasizes blended case rates, any of the payment structures would fulfill the requirement for payment to not incentivize performing C -sections . As described in Table 40. Covered California Insurer Engagement in Changing Payments to Hospitals, 2016 -18, most insurers have been Re-contracting with value -based payments for hospitals. As of 2018, 10 insurers were Active ly Re-contracting or Re-contracting . The percent of network hospitals with value -based payments from the insurer is an indicator for the extent to which the insurer is scaling the program. Data reported for 2018 indicates wide variation in the extent to which an insurer's network hospitals have value -based payment s, after excluding insurers with integrated delivery systems ( Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan ). Four insurers reported between 20 to 100 percent of hospitals have value -based payment contracts, two insurers reported less than 10 percent of hospitals have value -based payment contracts , and four insurers reported that 0 percent of network hospitals have value -based payment contracts. For value -based payments for NTSV C-Sections , health plans made significant progress, from six health plan s assessed as Active ly Re-contracting or Re-contracting in 2016 to 10 health plans in 2018.

Covered California has worked with some insurers to amend their contract on this requirement, either because they function as a capitated integ rated delivery system that has a payment structure aligned with quality performance or their population is too sm all to be the basis for leverage in contract negotiations to change the business model. The common elements in amendments involve continuing to track measures, engaging hospitals to improve and continually making efforts to change payment if not already al igned. In summary, Covered California has worked with the California Hospital Association, Cal Hospital Compare , CMQCC and Smart Care California, all multi -stakeholder forums that include insurers , to adopt a focused list of maternity and safety metrics f or hospitals. By working together and aligning 11 insurers on a common set of metrics and payment structure, quality performance is now part of hospital contract discussions in way s it was not in prior years. The state is seeing reductions in NTSV C - sectio ns and avoidable hospital associated infections. 94 Smart Care California. October 2017. Aligning Birth Payment to Reduce Unnecessary C -Section.

Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 11 COVERED CALIFORNIA 100 Covered California's requirements link hospital payment reform with hospital improvement efforts. Hospital performance is improving faster than implementation of hospital payment reforms. Sustaining these improvements in hospital quality and safety will be reinforced as payment is gradually more aligned with quality and safety goals. Expanded Approaches to Care Delivery Telehealth Health insurance companies are required to report the extent to which the y support and use technology to assist in higher quality, accessible, patient -centered care and the utilization for enrollees on the number of unique patients and number of separate services provided for telehealth. Health insurance companies must describe whether these models are implemented in association with patient -centered medical homes, integrated delivery systems or accountable care organization models of care or are independently implemented. All Covered California insurers offered a telehealth or web -based service in 2018, but they vary in their capabilities. Most insurers that offered a telehealth service in 201 8 used a vendor with two insurers offering telehealth visits only through contracted medical groups and not as a free -standi ng program (see Table 41. Covered California Insurer Telehealth Capabilities, 2015, 2017 and 2018 ). The percent of enrollees with a telehealth visit for Covered California insurers ranged from 0 percent to 59 percent in 2018. The high outlier, Kaiser Permanente , an integrated delivery system that uses telehealth as part of their model, reported that 59 percent of enrollees used telehealth or had a web visit in 2018 . Oscar Health Plan reported that 17 percent of enrollees used t elehealth or a web visit in 2018. Oscar Health Plan consistently and actively promotes the use of telehealth to its enrollees. Most other insurers report ed that fewer than 10 percent of enrollees had engaged with care through telehealth . Table 4 1.

Source: Covered California Staff Analysis of Qualified Health Plan Submitted Data Implications for the Future Improving hospital quality and safety through reducing HAI s and NTSV C -section rates will continue to be areas of focus for Covered California . Addition al measure s will be incorporated as they are publicly reported. As acute care appropriately moves from the hospital to hospital outpatient centers and to ambulatory surgery centers, Covered California will support efforts to obtain and publicly report on the quality of care delivered in these sites. Covered California is exploring opportunities to measu re volume, both in the number of patients served and the number of services delivered, as a proxy for safety at all sites of care . In addition, Covered California reco gnizes the need to look at additional measures or indications of health care quality or safety, including what other measures or indicators of appropriate care should be used. The adoption of telehealth services , retail or convenience clinics and Centers of Excellence are examples of using alternative sites of care or expanded approaches to care delivery beyond the traditional hospital and physician office. Others include care at home and expanded use of technology such as eConsult and Project ECHO to faci litate integration and coordination across specialties and adoption of team -based care. Covered California is work ing with insurers to ensure telehealth or other technology programs are offered in the languages spoken by their enrollees and further promote the availability of translation services. Covered California is assessing how best to evaluate the extent to which t hese programs foster care that improves quality and patient experience while lowering costs . Although this report heavily focuses on the hospital and physician office experience, Covered California recognizes that health care is being delivered to consume rs outside of these traditional venues. Moving forward, Covered California will be evaluating quality outcomes from sites such as outpatient surgery centers, birthing centers, retail clinics and home care services. More and more consumers are turning to these non -traditional care sites and Covered California has an obligation to ensure that these sites meet its high-quality standards while keeping health care costs affordable. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform EFFECTIVE CARE DELIVERY CHAPTER 11 COVERED CALIFORNIA 102 Chapter 12: Summary and Implications for the Future This report presents the initial findings of insurer progress towards meeting Covered California's contractual requirements to assure quality care and promote delivery system reform. The most consistent finding across all domains was the remarkable variat ion in performance with the consistent high performance for Kaiser Permanente and Sharp Health Plan. This was true not only for measures included in the Quality Rating System , but also for disadvantaged populations when profiled for disparities. Hospitals in these integrated systems show much less variation in safety scores and both insurers have adopted best practices in primary care. Their focus on integrated , coordinated care likely explains their performance and reinforces Covered California's intent to promote ACOs to better organize care in the delivery system s of other insurers . While the integrated plans excelled, it was reassuring that , with few exceptions , most performance was between the 25th and 90th percentile nationwide for other plans across a wide range of measures . There are some measures, especially for behavioral health and preventive care, where several plans perform below the 25th percentile. However, Covered California has no outlier poor performing health plans. Covered California worked with insurers to collect baseline data on race and ethnicity for all enrollees under 65 across all lines of business. Despite significant challenges with data quality, each insurer is moving ahead to address health disparities based on actionable differences found across a wide variety of population characteristics. This program is a priority to enhance and expand. All Covered California enrollees now have a primary care physician and a growing number are cared for within Integr ated Delivery Systems or ACOs. Significant work remains to support the implementation of advanced primary care models and to establish best practices for ACOs as they attempt to replicate the success of integrated systems. Covered California holds h ealth insurance companies accountable to manage variation in performance in addition to reporting overall average measurement through the Quality Rating System . Hospital performance was an initial focus using publicly reported data and supported by collaborativ e programs improving safety and maternity care. There has been important progress made demonstrating the value of alignment across multiple purchasers and payers as well as significant leadership from providers. Hospital care in California is safer as a r esult. Covered California has established a framework and approach to systematic improvement that has started to show important results: slower cost growth , modest improvement in quality measures, adoption of more effective primary care models, progress to ward implementation of integrated delivery systems and ACO s and, through collaboration with others, substantial gains in patient safety. Moreover, by requiring all insurers to stratify performance measures by race and ethnicity, Covered California has set the stage for achieving progress in reducing disparities . Much remains to be done, especially in the arena of consistent and effective measurement that support s quality improvement strategies for better health outcomes. Covered California acknowledges that efforts to meet the long -term goals of consistent measurement would potentially increase administrat ive burden initially for providers and hospitals but if done effectively and carefully , would establish consistent data measurement across insurers and purchasers that targets improvement opportunities for the delivery system in quality, cost, effectivenes s and equity . In the end, this would be expected to reduce administrative burden and complexity. Covered California is committed to working collaboratively and transparently to ensure that we contribute to a state where \"Health Care for All\" means that all Californians receive the best possible care .

Covered California cautions that it has several limitations and major caveats: These are baseline results not reported for accountability : Insurers have been required to collec t ethnic and racial identity by law in California since 2003. The results were used only to determine which language translation services were needed. This is the first time ethnic and racial identity information has been used to stratify clinical outcomes data for the purpose of defining and addressing disparities. It has taken three years to establish a baseline for which strategies are being developed to reduce disparities. Varying populations by insurer : Health insurance companies collected data for t heir entire populations under 65 regardless of line of business. Because each insurer has different proportions of commercial and Medi -Cal populations, the results cannot be compared between insurers . No formal audit proces s: While insurers were encouraged to follow the measures specifications for HEDIS and PQI, t he data reported by insurers has not been verified through a third-party audit as it would be for reporting to the National Committee for Quality Assurance's Quality Compass. Third -party auditors examine information practices and control procedure, sampling methods and procedures, data integrity, compliance with HEDIS specifications, analytic file production, and reporting and documentation. Variation in data quality and collection : Data quality varies by insurer , with some missing key data elements such as identification of certain groups (e.g., Native Hawaiian) and ability to identify claims using the measure specifications for admissions. Most insurers aggregated th eir 400-person HEDIS samples across all lines of business and a few had access to robust clinical data from electronic health records. HEDIS samples are drawn to represent the entire population but may not represent the ethnic and racial diversity of the p lan's population. Small denominators : Because the health disparities measures are based on a subset of individuals with a diagnosed chronic condition and reported by six race/ethnicity categories, this results in small denominators among some groups for certain measures and make it difficult to identify actual differences in care and outcomes. Some admissions measures and American Indian/Alaskan Native populations are especially impacted by small denominators. As a result, no insurer proposed an admission measure as a focus of disparity reduction efforts. However, admissions are important enough that further work is needed to determine if interventions might be appropriate despite the small numbers. Interpretation of data and identifying health Care dispar ities: Health insurance companies report the numerators, denominators, and rates by race/ethnicity for each measure, and early discussions between Covered California and insurers have centered on observed rate differences in admissions, disease control, and medication management between ra ce/ethnicity groups. An observed rate difference may require further analysis to consider confounding factors and statistical significance.

A priority set of 1 3 measures were presented in the subject chapters of this report. How to Interpret Quality Performance Data Within the QRS measure set, HEDIS measures rely on claims or encounter data while CAHPS measures are collected as part of the Qualified Health Plan Enrollee Survey. Since insurers can offer multiple products that vary by network type (HMO, PPO, or EPO), the data below shows 16 total plans . The data is listed by year the health plans reported the QRS measure set data such that the 2019 repor ting year data represents health plan performance during the 201 8 calendar year or measurement year and so on. Only data for products meeting CMS participation criteria for QRS score eligibility are displayed in the tables. Blank cells indicate the following: (1) CMS participation criteria were not met for scoring because the health plan did not offer a product for two consecutive years through Covered California; (2) CMS participation criteria were met but denominator size for a given measure was below the minimum threshold for scoring; or (3) the health plan chose not to report the measure (Not Reported/NR). The percentile values provide benchmark information for measure rates, allowing a health plan to compare its results to all other health plans and products nationally. CMS reports benchmark values that include the standardized 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percen tile values for the numerical rates across all health plans and products. To create these benchmark values, CMS uses only measure rates that have met the minimum denominator size criteria for scoring.95 95 Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. (2018).

Well-Child Visits in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Years of Life (Table A20) The following proportion of days covered measures track the percentage of patients adhering to their medications for their cond ition. Once started, adherence to medications long term is important for chronic disease management and to prevent complications. Ideally, adherence or percent of days covered should approach 100 percent , but the measure is met if it was above the 80 perce nt threshold. Barriers to adherence to medications may include limited knowledge or awareness of long -term treatment goals, adverse side effects, financial barriers, or forgetfulness. Covered California Holding Health Plans Accountable for Quality and Delivery System Reform APPENDICIES COVERED CALIFORNIA 118 Proportion of Days Covered (RAS Antagonists) (Pharmacy Quality Alli ance) Diabetes is the most common cause of renal failure. Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) Antagonists protect patients against diabetic kidney disease. This drug also treats high blood pressure which is a common co -morbidity for diabetic patients. Patients typically receive a screening test to determine whether or not they need to be prescribed these medications if not already using them for hypertension. The P harmacy Quality Alliance ( PQA ) Proportion of Days Covered RAS Antagonists measure is the percenta ge of patients 18 years and older who met the proportion of days covered threshold of 80 percent for RAS Antagonists during the measurement period.

It can be spread by healthcare workers and patients when they come in contact with contaminated surfaces. Because CDI can spread quickly among hospitals, clinics and nursing facilities, it is important to understand th e infection rates by counties to inform prevention efforts. The graphic below shows California counties' CDI incidence rates for 2018 p resented as significantly lower, higher, or no different compared with the na tional baseline standardized infection ratio of 1.0 .
