But with so many options available - sage, palo santo, and frankincense, to name a few - how do you know which to use or why to use it? To make it easy to know when and why to use each one, we're breaking down the benefits of some of the most popular herbs and how to combine them together. Copal When to use it: When your space could use a boost of uplifting, positive energy. Why to use it: Copal is a sacred cleansing tool that infuses your spirit and space with positive energy, peace, and high vibrations. It purifies any lower vibrations and replaces them with fresh, new energy. This is the ideal tool to use if you or your home could use a little rejuvenating and revitalizing energy. Dragon's Blood (also called Red Sage) When to use it: When there is toxic, dark energy in your energy field or environment. Why to use it: Dragon's Blood is a natural plant resin that is often applied to the dried sage, giving it a red color and an extremely powerful energy. This is the extra-strength clearing tool you need when there is dark, toxic energy in your energy field or your space. The Dragon's Blood cuts through those dense, heavy energies, leaving you and your home vibrating at a higher frequency. Frankincense When to use it: When you want a protective energy around you and your home. Why to use it: Frankincense is unique in that it both purifies and protects your energy and your environment. It removes negative energy, and also has a sweet aroma that helps to elevate your state. Frankincense raises the vibration of your space and your own energy, helping to block out bad vibes and other unwanted energies. Palo Santo When to use it: After an energy clearing session, or when you want to uplift your energy or your environment. Why to use it: Palo Santo is a popular energy tool, but it is different from most other cleansing tools. Palo Santo, meaning \"holy wood\" in Spanish, calls in blessings and positive energy. That's why Palo Santo is the perfect way to seal your energy or the energy of your home after a clearing session - it adds that extra layer of good vibes once you have cleared out all the unwanted energy. You can also use Palo Santo whenever you want to uplift your spirit or your space, since it has such a high vibrational, healing energy. Empty heading Empty heading Rose When to use it: When you want to create a warm, loving environment for romance, family time, or self-care; when you want to infuse your energy field with love. Why to use it: Dried rose petals bring in loving vibrations and offer a soft and gentle energy. When combined with white sage, the rose petals add an additional energy of love to the energy cleansing session, filling your mind, body, spirit and space with the highest vibrations of love. Rosemary When to use it: When your energy or your space feels foggy or stuffy. Why to use it: Rosemary doesn't just smell refreshing, it actually is refreshing! This herb offers both calming properties and clarity-enhancing properties. When combined with sage, Rosemary helps to purify and cleanse on a deeper level, leaving you and your environment feeling pure and light. Empty heading White Sage When to use it: As part of your regular space clearing practice, before any rituals, meditation or other energy healing practice, or after an illness. Why to use it: Sage is the go-to energy clearing tool, and for good reason. This powerhouse stone works equally well alone as it does in combination with other clearing herbs. The practice of burning sage is known to remove negative or stagnant energy, helping to purify your energy and your environment. This makes it perfect to clear the slate before a crystal ritual, meditation, or other spiritual practice. It is also a perfect tool for your regular space clearing sessions. White Sage also has anti-microbial properties, which is why it is recommended to clear the air after an illness.
