A high level of health protection should be ensured in the definition and implementation of allCommunity policies and activities. Under Article 152 ofthe Treaty, the Community is required to play an activerole by taking measures which cannot be taken by indi-vidual Member States, in accordance with the principle ofsubsidiarity. The Community fully respects the responsi-bilities of the Member States for the organisation anddelivery of health services and medical care.(2) The health sector is characterised on the one hand by itsconsiderable potential for growth, innovation anddynamism, and on the other by the challenges it facesin terms of financial and social sustainability and effi-ciency of the health care systems due, among otherthings, to ageing of the population and to medicaladvances. (3) The programme of Community action in the field ofpublic health (2003-08), adopted by Decision No1786/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of theCouncil ( 4), was the first integrated Community programme in this field, and it has already delivered anumber of important developments and improvements. (4) Continued effort is required in order to meet theobjectives already established by the Community in thefield of public health. It is therefore appropriate toestablish a second programme of Community action onhealth (2008-13) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Programme '). (5) A number of serious cross-border health threats with a possible worldwide dimension exist and new ones areemerging which require further Community action. The Community should treat serious cross-border health threats as a matter of priority. The Programme shouldplace emphasis on strengthening the Community 's overall capacities by further developing cooperationbetween the Member States. Monitoring, early warningand action to combat serious threats to health areimportant areas where an effective and coordinatedresponse to health threats should be promoted atCommunity level. Action to ensure high-quality diag-nostic cooperation between laboratories is essential inorder to respond to health threats. The Programmeshould encourage the establishment of a system ofCommunity reference laboratories. However, such asystem needs to be based on a sound legal base.EN 20.11.2007 Official Journal of the European Union L 301/3 (1) OJ C 88, 11.4.2006, p. 1. (2) OJ C 192, 16.8.2006, p. 8. (3) Opinion of the European Parliament of 16 March 2006 (OJ C 291 E, 30.11.2006, p. 372), Council Common Position of 22 March 2007 (OJ C 103 E, 8.5.2007, p. 11) and Position of the EuropeanParliament of 10 July 2007 (not yet published in the OfficialJournal). Council Decision of 9 October 2007. (4) OJ L 271, 9.10.2002, p. 1. Decision as amended by Decision No 786/2004/EC (OJ L 138, 30.4.2004, p. 7).(6) According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) European Health report 2005, in terms of DisabilityAdjusted Life-Years (DALYs), the most important causesof the burden of disease in the WHO European Regionare non-communicable diseases (NCDs \u201477 % of the total), external causes of injury and poisoning (14 %) andcommunicable diseases (9 %). Seven leading conditions\u2014 ischaemic heart disease, unipolar depressive disorders, cerebrovascular disease, alcohol use disorders, chronic pulmonary disease, lung cancer and road trafficinjuries \u2014account for 34 % of the DALYs in the region. Seven leading risk factors \u2014tobacco, alcohol, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, overweight, low fruit andvegetable intake and physical inactivity \u2014account for 60 % of DALYs. In addition, communicable diseasessuch as HIV/AIDS, influenza, tuberculosis and malariaare also becoming a threat to the health of all peoplein Europe. An important task of the Programme, incooperation, where appropriate, with the CommunityStatistical Programme, should be to identify better themain health burdens in the Community. (7) Eight leading causes of mortality and morbidity fromNCDs in the WHO European Region are cardiovasculardiseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, cancer, digestivediseases, respiratory diseases, sense organ disorders,musculoskeletal diseases and diabetes mellitus. TheProgramme, in synergy with other Community initiativesand funding, should contribute to better knowledge of and information on the prevention, diagnosis and control of major diseases. Accordingly, the Commission maysubmit, during the course of the Programme, proposalsfor pertinent Council Recommendations. The Programmeshould also foster appropriate coordination and synergiesamong Community initiatives regarding the collection ofcomparable data on major diseases, including cancer. (8) Microbial resistance to antibiotics and nosocomialinfections are becoming a threat to health in Europe.The lack of new effective antibiotics as well as themeans to ensure the proper use of existing antibioticsare major concerns. Therefore it is important to collectand analyse relevant data. (9) Strengthening the role of the European Centre forDisease Prevention and Control established by Regulation(EC) No 851/2004 of the European Parliament and ofthe Council ( 1) is important in the fight against com- municable diseases. (10) The Programme should build on the achievements of theprevious Programme for Community action in the fieldof public health (2003-08). It should contribute towards the attainment of a high level of physical and mentalhealth and greater equality in health matters throughoutthe Community by directing actions towards improvingpublic health, preventing human diseases and disorders,and obviating sources of danger to health with a view tocombating morbidity and premature mortality. It shouldfurther contribute to providing citizens with better access to information and thereby increase their ability to make decisions which best cater for their interests. (11) The Programme should place emphasis on improving thehealth condition of children and young people andpromoting a healthy lifestyle and a culture of preventionamong them. (12) The Programme should support the mainstreaming ofhealth objectives in all Community policies and activities,without duplicating work carried out under otherCommunity policies. Coordination with otherCommunity policies and programmes is a key part ofthe objective of mainstreaming health in other policies.In order to promote synergies and avoid duplication,joint actions may be undertaken with relatedCommunity programmes and actions and appropriateuse should be made of other Community funds andprogrammes, including the current and futureCommunity framework programmes for research andtheir outcomes, the Structural Funds, the European Soli-darity Fund, the European strategy for health at work, theprogramme of Community action in the field of consumer policy (2007-13) ( 2), the programme 'Drugs prevention and information ', the programme 'Fight against violence (Daphne) 'and the Community Statistical Programme within their respective activities. (13) Special efforts should be undertaken to ensure coherenceand synergies between the Programme and theCommunity 's external actions, particularly in the areas of avian influenza, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and othercross-border health threats. In addition, there should beinternational cooperation in order to promote generalhealth reform and general health institutional issues inthird countries. (14) Increasing Healthy Life Years (HLY) by preventing diseaseand promoting policies that lead to a healthier way of lifeis important for the well-being of EU citizens and helpsto meet the challenges of the Lisbon process as regardsthe knowledge society and the sustainability of publicfinances, which are under pressure from rising healthcare and social security costs.EN L 301/4 Official Journal of the European Union 20.11.2007 (1) OJ L 142, 30.4.2004, p. 1.(2) Decision No 1926/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 39).(15) The enlargement of the European Union has brought additional concerns in terms of health inequalitieswithin the EU and this is likely to be accentuated byfurther enlargements. This issue should, therefore, beone of the priorities of the Programme. (16) The Programme should help to identify the causes ofhealth inequalities and encourage, among other things,the exchange of best practices to tackle them. (17) It is essential to systematically collect, process andanalyse comparable data, within national constraints,for an effective monitoring of the state of health in theEuropean Union. This would enable the Commission andthe Member States to improve information to the publicand formulate appropriate strategies, policies and actionsto achieve a high level of human health protection.Compatibility and interoperability of the systems and networks for exchanging information and data for the development of public health should be pursued in theactions and support measures. Gender, socioeconomicstatus and age are important health considerations.Data collection should wherever possible build onexisting work, and proposals for new collections shouldbe costed and based on a clear need. The collection ofdata should be in compliance with the relevant legalprovisions on the protection of personal data. (18) Best practice is important because health promotion andprevention should be measured on the basis of efficiencyand effectiveness, and not purely in economic terms. Best practice and latest treatment methods for diseases and injuries should be promoted in order to prevent furtherdeterioration of health, and European reference networksfor specific conditions should be developed. (19) Action should be taken in order to prevent injuriesby collecting data, analysing injury determinants anddisseminating relevant information. (20) Health services are primarily the responsibility of Member States but cooperation at Community level can benefit both patients and health systems. Activitiesfunded by the Programme as well as new proposalsdeveloped as a result of these should have due regardto the Council Conclusions on common values and prin-ciples in European Union Health Systems ( 1) adopted in June 2006 that endorse a statement on the commonvalues and principles of EU Health Systems and invitethe institutions of the European Union to respect them intheir work. The Programme should take due account offuture developments as regards Community action onhealth services as well as the work of the High Level Group on Health Services and Medical Care, whichprovides an important forum for collaboration andexchange of best practice between Member States ' health systems. (21) The Programme should contribute to the collection ofdata, the promotion and development of methods andtools, the establishment of networks and various kinds ofcooperation and the promotion of relevant policies onpatient mobility as well as on the mobility of healthprofessionals. It should facilitate the further developmentof the European e-Health Area, through joint Europeaninitiatives with other EU policy areas, including regionalpolicy, while contributing towards work on qualitycriteria for health-related websites and towards a European health insurance card. Telemedicine should be taken into account as telemedicine applications maycontribute to cross-border care while ensuring medicalcare at home. (22) Environmental pollution is a serious risk to health and amajor source of concern for European citizens. Specialaction should focus on children and other groups which are particularly vulnerable to hazardous environmental conditions. The Programme should complement theactions taken within the European Environment andHealth Action Plan 2004-10. (23) The Programme should address genderrelated and ageing-related health issues. (24) The Programme should recognise the importance of aholistic approach to public health and take intoaccount, where appropriate and where there is scientificor clinical evidence about its efficacy, complementaryand alternative medicine in its actions. (25) The precautionary principle and risk assessment are keyfactors for the protection of human health and shouldtherefore be part of further integration into otherCommunity policies and activities. (26) This Decision establishes, for the entire duration of theProgramme, a financial envelope which constitutes theprime reference within the meaning of point 37 of theInterinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 betweenthe European Parliament, the Council and theCommission on budgetary discipline and soundfinancial management ( 2), for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure.EN 20.11.2007 Official Journal of the European Union L 301/5 (1) OJ C 146, 22.6.2006, p. 1. (2) OJ C 139, 14.6.2006, p. 1.(27) In order to ensure a high level of coordination between actions and initiatives taken by the Community andMember States in the implementation of theProgramme, it is necessary to promote cooperationbetween Member States and to enhance the effectivenessof existing and future networks in the field of publichealth. The participation of national, regional and localauthorities at the appropriate level in accordance with the national systems should be taken into account in regard to the implementation of the Programme. (28) It is necessary to increase EU investment in health and health-related projects. In this regard, Member States are encouraged to identify health improvements as a priorityin their national programmes. Better awareness about thepossibilities of EU funding for health is needed. Exchangeof experience between the Member States on fundinghealth through the Structural Funds should beencouraged. (29) Non-governmental bodies and specialised networks canalso play an important role in meeting the objectives ofthe Programme. In pursuing one or more objectives ofthe Programme, they may require Community contri-butions to enable them to function. Hence, detailed eligi-bility criteria, provisions regarding financial transparencyand the duration of Community contributions for non-governmental bodies and specialised networks qualifyingfor Community support should be set out in accordancewith Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999laying down the procedures for the exercise of im-plementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 1). Such criteria should include the obligations of such bodies and networks in establishing clear objectives,action plans and measurable results representing astrong European dimension and a real added value forthe objectives of the Programme. Given the particularnature of the organisations concerned and in cases ofexceptional utility, it should be possible for the renewalof Community support to the functioning of such bodiesand specialised networks to be exempted from theprinciple of gradual decrease of the extent ofCommunity support. (30) Implementation of the Programme should be carried outin close cooperation with relevant organisations andagencies, in particular with the European Centre forDisease Prevention and Control. (31) The measures necessary for the implementation of thisDecision should be adopted in accordance with Decision1999/468/EC, respecting the need for transparency aswell as a reasonable balance between the differentobjectives of the Programme.(32) The Agreement on the European Economic Area (here-inafter referred to as 'the EEA Agreement ') provides for cooperation in the field of health between the EuropeanCommunity and its Member States, on the one hand, andthe countries of the European Free Trade Associationparticipating in the European Economic Area (hereinafterreferred to as 'the EFTA/EEA countries '), on the other. Provision should also be made to open the Programme to participation by other countries, in particular the neighbouring countries of the Community andcountries that are applying for, are candidates for, orare acceding to, membership of the European Union,taking particular account of the potential for healththreats arising in other countries to have an impactwithin the Community. (33) Appropriate relations with third countries not partici-pating in the Programme should be facilitated in orderto help achieve the objectives of the Programme, takingaccount of any relevant agreements between thosecountries and the Community. This may involve thirdcountries taking forward complementary activities to those financed through the Programme on areas of mutual interest, but should not involve a financial contri-bution under the Programme. (34) It is appropriate to develop cooperation with relevantinternational organisations such as the United Nationsand its specialised agencies, in particular the WHO, aswell as with the Council of Europe and the Organisationfor Economic Cooperation and Development, with aview to implementing the Programme through maxi-mising the effectiveness and efficiency of actionsrelating to health at Community and international level,taking into account the particular capacities and roles ofthe different organisations. (35) The successful implementation of the objectives underthe Programme should be based on good coverage ofthe issues included in the annual work plans, onselection of appropriate actions and funding of projects,which all have an in-built appropriate monitoring andevaluation process in place, and on regular monitoringand evaluation, including independent externalevaluations, which should measure the impact ofactions and demonstrate their contribution to theoverall objectives of the Programme. Programmeevaluation should take into account the fact that theachievement of the Programme objectives may requirea longer time period than the duration of the Programme. (36) The annual work plans should cover the main foreseeable activities to be funded from the Programme through allthe different funding mechanisms, including calls fortender.EN L 301/6 Official Journal of the European Union 20.11.2007 (1) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. Decision as amended by Decision 2006/512/EC (OJ L 200, 22.7.2006, p. 11).(37) Since the objectives of this Decision cannot be sufficient- ly achieved by the Member States due to the trans-national nature of the issues involved, and cantherefore, by reason of the potential for Communityaction to be more efficient and effective than nationalaction alone in protecting the health and safety ofcitizens, be better achieved at Community level, theCommunity may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of pro-portionality, as set out in that Article, this Decisiondoes not go beyond what is necessary in order toachieve those objectives. (38) In accordance with Article 2 of the Treaty, whichprovides that equality between men and women is aprinciple of the Community, and in accordance withArticle 3(2) thereof, which provides that theCommunity shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and topromote equality between men and women in allCommunity activities including the attainment of ahigh level of health protection, all objectives andactions covered by the Programme contribute topromoting a better understanding and recognition ofmen 's and women 's respective needs and approaches to health. (39) It is appropriate to ensure a transition between theProgramme and the previous programme it replaces, inparticular regarding the continuation of multi-annualarrangements for its management, such as the financingof technical and administrative assistance. As of 1January 2014, the technical and administrative assistanceappropriations should cover, if necessary, the expenditurerelated to the management of actions not yet completedby the end of 2013. (40) This Decision replaces Decision No 1786/2002/EC. ThatDecision should therefore be repealed, HAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Article 1 Establishment of the Programme The second programme of 'Community action in the field of health (2008-13) 'covering the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2013 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Programme ') is hereby established.

In Article 7, the reference amount of the programme was proposed to be set at EUR 365,6 million for the period starting in 2007 and ending in 2013. 2.
