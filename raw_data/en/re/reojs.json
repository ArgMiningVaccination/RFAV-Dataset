Although accounts are separately maintained for each fund in the accompanying financ ial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined into fund types. The following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies: A. Fund Accounting The State utilizes Fund Accounting to account for and report on it s financial activities. A fund, which is established for a specific purpose in accordance with the law, is a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenues, and ex penditures or expenses. Funds are grouped into three broad categories as follows: GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS GENERAL FUND A self-balancing set of accounts us ed to account for all financial resources except those required to be accounted for in another fund. SPECIAL REVENUE FUNDS A self-balancing set of account s used to account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources (other than expendable trus ts) that are legally restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. OTHER GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS A self-balancing set of a ccounts used to account for other government financial resources except those required to be accounted for in the General Fund or designated as Special Revenue Funds. PROPRIETARY FUNDS ENTERPRISE FUNDS A self-balancing set of account s used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprises. INTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS A self-balancing set of a ccounts used to account for the financing of goods and services provided by one department to other state departments of governments. PERMANENT AND FIDUCIARY FUNDS PERMANENT FUNDS A self-balancing set of accounts us ed to account primarily for activity related to grants made to the State for schools and public institutions. FIDUCIARY FUNDS A self-balancing set of accounts us ed to account for assets held by the State in a trustee capacity or as an agent for indi viduals, private organizations and other governments. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2011 206 Note 1. - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) B. Basis of Accounting The Annual Financial Report is prepared for funds on a cash basis of accounting in accordance wi th State law. Under the cash basis of accounting, revenues and expenditures are recognized when recor ded in the State's central accounting system, the Arizona Financial Information System (AFIS). No allowance has been made to revenues or expenditures for unrecorded accounts receivable, accounts pay able, deferred revenue or any other bal ance sheet item. Disbursements of appropriated monies, including related operating transfers , are reported as expenditures. The audited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are published annually in the State's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR). C. Reporting Entity The accompanying General Fund cash basis financial st atements include transactions of the following funds and accounts: General Fund - General Operations Department of Revenue Excise and Transaction Privilege Tax Fund Department of Revenue Temporary Transaction Privilege and Use Tax Fund Budget Stabilization Fund School Accountability Account (Proposition 301) D. Fiscal Year Reporting In accordance with A.R.S. \u00a7 35-102, the State operates on a fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending on the subsequent June 30. This report primarily covers Fiscal Y ear 2011 (FY11), the fiscal period ending June 30, 2011. E. Budgets and Appropriations Accounting The State follows these procedures in establishing the budgetary data reflected in the financial statements: 1. Annually the Governor submits to the Legislature a proposed operating and capital outlay budget for the fiscal year commencing the following July 1. This doc ument includes proposed expenditures and the means of financing them. Some agency budgets are approved for two fiscal years at a time on a biennial cycle. 2. Public hearings are then conducted during legislative sessions. 3. Prior to July 1, the budget is enacted through passage and approval of bills containing appropriations. 4. Appropriation accounting is then employed as a management tool to monitor the appropriated monies. Typically, the commitment for continuing appropriations is repor ted as a reservation of Fund Balance. However, this practice was amended for FY10 in Laws 2009, 3 rd Special Session, Chapter 7, sect ion 30, and for FY11 in Laws 2010, 7th Special Session, Chapter 3, section 13. According to the legislation, any continuing appropriations that remained at the end of the fiscal year were to be included in the closing balance as if they had lapsed or revert ed. See Note 3, section C for additional information about this change in accounting policy. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2011 207 Note 1. - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) F. Rounding Differences The information shown in the detail statements has been rounded to the nearest do llar and therefore, minor differences may be found when adding the columns down or the rows across. The rounding differences are inconsequential. Note 2. - Description of Financial Statements A. The accompanying financial statements include a bal ance sheet and statements of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance for the General Fund. The comparative balance sheet for the General Fund displays additional detail in arriving at the amount for total assets and liabilities. The separate line items are composed of Cash With the State Treasurer (which may include cash and cash equivalents), Cash Not With the State Treasurer, and various receivable and payable items. This presentat ion will provide additional transparency of the financial statements and highlight the differ ence between Cash and Fund Balance. B. The Statement of Expenditures - Appr opriation to Actual, Budgetary (Legal) Basi s is presented for all appropriations. The Capital Outlay Statement of Expendi tures - Appropriation to Actual includes all capital appropriations for the General Fund and the Capital Outlay Stabilization Fund. C. Administrative Adjustments are shown as Note 9 to the financial statements. D. The General Fund is presented prominently in the A nnual Financial Report (AFR) due to its significance. The Statements of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Ba lance are presented for all other funds accounted for on the AFIS. The statements include beginning and ending bal ances for the current fiscal year as well as appropriated and non-appropriated activity in each fund. See Note 5 for additional detail on these Statements. Note 3. - Statement of Expenditures - Budgetary to Actual - Description of Selected Columns A. Supplemental Appropriations and Adjustments The column titled Supplemental Appropriations, Mid-Year Reversions and Adjustments shown on the Statement of Expenditures - Appropriations to Actual includes the following: Supplemental and Special Appropriations are either the additional spending authority (appropriation) granted by the Legislature after the general appropriations act is approv ed or other Session Law appropriations granted by the Legislature to a State agency or department for a specific program or purpose. Transfers and adjustments are the movements of m onies or spending authority between funds, departments, programs and within programs in accordanc e with the Arizona Revised Statutes. Mid-year reversions (when applicable) are the return of spending authority (appropriation) originally granted to a State agency or department through the appropriation process prio r to the completion of the granted spending period. B. Lapsed Appropriations In accordance with A.R.S. \u00a7 35-190, except as otherwise provided by law, all appropriations lapse after the close of the fiscal year. The unused spending authority (appropriation) whic h was originally granted to a State agency or department through the appropriation process expires. The term \"reversion\" is sometimes used in reference to these lapsed appropriations. The amount of lapsed appropriations from the General Fund for FY11 is $88,760,099 from General Operations and $1,826 from Capital Outlay. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2011 208 Note 3. - Statement of Expenditures - Budgetary to Actual - Description of Selected Columns (Continued) C. Continuing Appropriations A continuing appropriation is a spending authority that, once established, is automatica lly renewed without further legislative action, period after period, until amended or revoked. In the State of Arizona, continuing appropriations are primarily for construction or other projec ts that take longer than one year to complete. Laws 2010, Chapter 3, section 13 (House Bill 2003, 7th Special Session) st ates that \"any monies appropriated from the state general fund that are exempted from lapsing pursuant to section 35-190, Arizona Revised Statutes, and that remain unexpended and unencumbered at the close of fiscal year 2010-2011 shall be in cluded in the closing balance as if the appropriations had lapsed or otherwise reverted to the st ate general fund.\" Therefore, the Gener al Fund Comparative Balance Sheet - Appropriation (Budget) to Actual reflects no reserve for continuing appropriations at the close of the fiscal year end, but will be re-established and available for expenditures as a conti nuing appropriation at the beginning of the next fiscal year. The detailed Statement of Expenditures Appr opriation to Actual reflects what ar e considered continuing appropriations in the subsequent year. This preserves comparability and consistency within the statements. Accordingly, the total General Fund reserved for continuing appropriations would have been $29,910,194 comp rised of $24,917,327 from General Operations and $4,992,867 from Capital Outlay. When added to the General Fund amount restricted for the School Accountability Act, $10,849,465, the total amount of continuing appropriations (restricted and reserved) would have been $40,759,659. Note 4. - Other Financing Sources A. Temporary Transaction Privilege and Use Tax (TPT). In a special election held on May 18, 2010, proposition 100 was approved by the voters to add a temporary 1% TPT beginning June 1, 2010. It is repealed effective May 31, 2013. For FY11, the State collected $865,045,844 and allocated the collections as outlined in the proposition: two- thirds to public primary and secondary education; one- third for health and human services and public safety purposes. The allocations were as follows: Education Basic State Aid to School Districts $369,234,876 Education Basic State Aid to N on-Profit Charter Schools 206,934,368 Education Basic State Aid to For-Profit Charter Schools 527,985 Health and Human Services - AHCCCS Capitation Payments 72,087,154 Health and Human Services - DES Home & Community Based Services 72,087,154 Health and Human Services - DHS Children's Behavioral Health 36,043,576 Health and Human Services - DHS Se riously Mentally Ill 36,043,576 Public Safety - Department of Co rrections Operations 72,087,155 B. Treasurer's Warrant Notes (TWNs). The State of Arizona did not issue TWNs in FY11. This note is presented for comparative purposes since this activity did occur in FY10. A.R.S. \u00a7 35-185.01 states that TWNs may be issued if no monies are available for payment of warrants or electronic funds trans fer vouchers of the Department of Administration presented to the State Treasurer. A.R. S. \u00a7 35-185.02 addresses the procedures to be used in the issuance and redemption of TWNs. In FY10, the St ate Treasurer issued TWNs totaling $94,648,355,383 and the General Fund paid $3,885,751 in interest and fees on the TW Ns. While the TWNs are considered General Fund, inclusion of those revenues and expenditures would di stort the General Government amounts for normal operations, therefore this activity in FY10 wa s shown as \"Other Financing Sources (Uses).\" The ending FY11 Cash with the State Treasurer for the General Fund was $58,044 (in thousands). This is different from the operating cash which is what the State Treasurer uses to determine if sufficient monies are available to pay warrants. The State Treasurer may use a combinati on of General Fund cash, plus agency funds that are not allowed to be invested with the State Treasurer, plus funds that can be invested with the State Treasurer but are not currently earning interest to determi ne the operating cash available for payments of warrant s. When that combination no longer provides monies for obligations, the State Treasurer begins issuing TWNs. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2011 209 Note 4. - Other Financing Sources (Continued) C. Budget Stabilization Fund. A.R.S. \u00a7 35-144 established the Budget Stabilizat ion Fund (BSF) in 1990. The BSF is sometimes referred to as the rainy day fund. The purpose of the BSF is to normalize (over time) the fluctuations of the State's high and low growth rates. The amount of cash transferred to or from the BSF and the General Fund - General Operations is established by st atutory formula. No operating expenditures may occur in the BSF. Interest earned on pooled investments with the State Treasurer is the basic revenue source of the BSF. The beginning FY11 balance for the BSF was $0. The ending FY11 balanc e for the BSF was $17,850. During FY11, cash was transferred to the BSF from the Consumer Loss Recovery Fund (CLRF). The original transfers from the BSF to CLRF, as authorized by Laws 2000, 7 th Special Session, Chapter 1, Section 37, funded alternative fuel tax credits and alternative fuel cost re imbursements to consumers. D. Lease Purchase Finance Agreement. The State did not enter into a Lease Purchase Finance Agreement in FY11. This note is presented for comparative purposes since this activity did occur in FY10. The State of Arizona undertook the sale and simultaneous lease back of various st ate properties through the iss uance of Certificates of Participation into the public debt market as authorized by Laws 2009, 3 rd Special Session, Chapter 6, Section 32. The legislation authorized net available proceeds of not more than $735,419,300 be deposited into the State General Fund by June 30, 2010. A transfer in to t he General Fund of $735,419,300 took place on January 26, 2010. Subsequently, Laws 2010, 6th Special Session, Chapter 4, Se ction 2 authorized $300,000,000 of net available proceeds to be deposited in the State Gener al Fund by September 30, 2010 from the sale and simultaneous lease back of additional state owned facilities. A transfer to the General Fund of $300,000,000 took place on June 30, 2010. E. Lottery Bond Proceeds. The State of Arizona did not iss ue any lottery bonds in FY11. This note is presented for comparative purposes since this activity did o ccur in FY10. In accordance with Laws 2010, 6 th Special Session, Chapter 4, section 1, Title 5 of the Arizona Revised Statutes was amended to include chapter 5.1. This amendment authorized the sale of the State Lotte ry bonds with the first $450,000,000 of pr oceeds to be deposited into the State General Fund. This transfer into the General Fund took place on June 15, 2010 in the amount of $450,000,000. Note 5. - Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance A.R.S. \u00a7 35-131.E, requires the AFR to include all appropr iated and non-appropriated monies. The General Fund is presented prominently in the AFR due to it s significance. In accordance with the revised statute, the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance presents appropriated and non-appropriated activity for all other funds accounted for on the AFIS as well as beginning and ending balances for each fund. As required, this report includes non-appropriated activity in the same detail as the General Fund. The Statement includes appropriated activity when applicable for each fund but summarized within a si ngle line item labeled \"Appropriated Activity.\" During the course of the report compilation, a number of f unds with negative balances were noted. No analysis of the accounts that comprise the negat ive balances was conducted as to the cause or the resolution. The following funds were noted with negative balances: OTHER GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS: Estate and Unclaimed Property Fund - Department of Revenue (RVA 1520) Criminal Justice Enhancement Fund - State Treasurer TRA 3702) Federal Grant Fund - Department of Environmental Quality (EVA 2000) Department of Health Services (HSA 2000) Federal Economic Recovery Fund - Departm ent of Environmental Quality (2999) Department of Health Services (HSA 2999) Indirect Cost Fund - Department of Environmental Quality (EVA 9000) Special Program Payroll Trust Fund - Historical Society (HIA 3159) STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2011 210 Note 5. - Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance (Continued) SPECIAL REVENUE FUNDS: Institutional and Engineering Control Fund - D epartment of Environmental Quality (EVA 4240) Federal Grant Fund - AHCCCS (HCA 2000) Receivership Liquidation - Insurance Department (IDA 3104) Unarmed Combat Events Fund - Racing Department (RCA 2393) DPS Joint Fund Control Fund - Departm ent of Public Safety (PSA 2085) INTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS: Motor Pool Revolving Fund - Arizona Department of Administration (ADA 4204) ENTERPRISE FUNDS: Arizona Highways Magazine Fund - Depar tment of Transportation (DTA 2031) FIDUCIARY FUNDS: ASRS Administrative Investment Expenses Account - Arizona State Retirement System (RTA 1407) LTD Trust Fund Administration Account - Ar izona State Retirement System (RTA 1408) LGIP - COP Investment Held for Tr ustee - State Treasurer (TRA 3168) Administrative Fund - State Treasurer (TRA 3736) Local Transportation Assistance F und - State Treasurer (TRA 3747) Manufactured Housing Cash Bond Fund - Department of Fire, Building and Life Safety (MMA 3722) Racing Commission Bond Deposit Fund - Ar izona Department of Racing (RCA 3720) Registrar of Contractors Cash Bond Fund - Registrar of Contractors (RGA 3721) Contractor Prompt Pay Complaint Fund - Registrar of Contractors (RGA 3725) Big Game Permit Fund - Arizona Game and Fish Department (GFA 3712) For management reporting purposes, certain accrual adjustments are recorded in the AFIS. This activity is consistent with the statutory or legal basis upon which the AFR is prepared and has not been modified. Current year adjustments to prior year accruals, such as refunds of prior years' expenditures or adjustment s to long-term debts or receivables, are reflected in the Fund Balance report as an adjustment to the beginning fund balance. Addi tionally, other entries are current year transactions and are s hown as GAAP Revenue and GAAP Expenditure Offsets. Revenue offsets are frequently the result of adjustments to amounts recorded as due to other funds. Expenditure offsets are most commonly related to depreciation and adjustment of fixed assets. GAAP Revenue and GAAP Expenditure Offsets are recorded in the Fund Balance Report in their respective revenue and ex penditure columns. Furthermore, a number of funds have year-end cash balances on the AFIS, but other balance sheet a ccounts off-set the cash resulting in a net fund balance of zero. This occurs most commonly with the Credit Card Clearing Fund. Fund activity in the Fund Balance Report is shown on the statew ide fund level. Some funds have activity with more than one agency and the report separates the activity within the fund by agency. Funds with activity in more than one section are listed in both sections and cross-referenced. For co mparison purposes and consistenc y with the Statement of Expenditures - Appropriation to Actual, the Department of Economic Security Federal Grant Fund has not been combined on a statewide level. Detail is pr ovided for each separate grant type.
