Cupping Therapy [Read More](9-description) Cupping therapy is an ancient Chinese form of alternative medicine in which a glass or plastic suction cup is placed on the skin. It is used to mobilize and stimulate the flow of blood in order to promote healing. The cups can remain stationary or be gently moved across the skin. This causes the superficial layers to be slightly drawn into the cup.
