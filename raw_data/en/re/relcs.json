A large number of different organisms are involved in infections of the ear. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are often the cause of otitis media and are implicated in infections of the external ear and otitis externa. Pseudomonas and Gram-negative rods are often found in otitis externa. There are many drug preparations used in the treatment of ENT disorders. Broad-spectrum penicillin such as amoxicillin, especially when combined with clavulanic acid, is often the drug of choice. Most topical drugs used in the nose aim to improve nasal airflow and often relieve rhinorrhoea. Long-term use of these drugs can cause rhinitis medicamentosa; therefore their application should be limited to short courses of 7-10 days. The mainstay of the treatment of rhinitis is topical steroid therapy. Nanosensors for Industrial Applications [Vinod Kumar Khanna](https://taylorandfrancis.com/search-results/?query=Vinod%2BKumar%2BKhanna&tab=books) in [Nanosensors](https://www.routledge.com/isbn/10.1201/9781003025559), 2021 The food, healthcare, automotive, aerospace and consumer industries are the core industries supplying goods to fulfil daily life needs. Nanosensors for food industry are principally those used for detecting the presence of pathogenic bacteria and toxins in food products. Among these bacteria, mention may be made of Salmonella Typhimurium, Clostridium Perfringens, Campylobacter Jejuni A and Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB). Under the nanosensors for healthcare industry, devices for diagnosing cancer of different origins are discussed, namely, breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and leukemia. The nanosensor list for infectious disease indicators comprises Hepatitis B, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, HIV, Zika and novel corona viruses along acid-fast bacilli, S. Pyogenes and Plasmodium falciparum. Nanosensors described for automotive, aerospace and consumer industries include pressure/strain sensors, accelerometers, acoustic and ultrasound sensors, [Masao Miyauchi](https://taylorandfrancis.com/search-results/?query=Masao%2BMiyauchi&tab=books) in [Antibiotics I](https://www.routledge.com/isbn/10.1201/9780429333354), 2020 A novel screening procedure led to isolation of the structurally unique, bacterially produced, monocyclic -lactam antibiotics, typically, nocardicin A in 1976 and sulfazecin in 1981. The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam were compared with those of aztreonam and ceftazidime Both carumonam and aztreonam were less potent than ceftazidime against Gram-positive bacteria. Carumonam was highly active against Gram-negative bacteria, including members of Enterobacteriaceae family, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Haemophilus influenzae . Carumonam was more stable to cephalosporinases, but was slightly less stable than ceftazidime to some penicillinases. Carumonam was not active against Staphylococcus aureus , like aztreonam, but carumonam was weakly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae . A. Imada et al. reported a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, carumonam. The excellent activity of carumonam against Gram-negative bacteria is related to its high affinity for their PBP-3. The PBPs of Staphylococcus aureus showed little affinity to carumonam. Central Diabetes Insipidus in an Infant with Pneumococcal Meningitis complication reported in the neonatal period. Case report: CDI as a complication of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) sepsis and meningitis in a 9-day-old boy is presented. The CDI developed on day 3 after admission and was controlled with nasal vasopressin on the 20th day of admission. Despite antibiotic support, the child died from Acinetobacter sepsis at 4 months of age, but the CDI was well controlled. Conclusion: Newborns with bacterial meningitis can develop CDI as a sequalae. Treatment of the CDI with nasal vasopressin can be successful in this period. To our knowledge, this is the first newborn of CDI associated with S. pneumoniae meningitis. Management of severe non-TB bacterial infection in HIV-infected adults Published in [Expert Review Feasey](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=Contrib&text1=Nicholas%2BA%2BFeasey), [Robert S Heyderman](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=Contrib&text1=Robert%2BS%2BHeyderman) Despite widespread antiretroviral therapy use, severe bacterial infections (SBI) in HIV-infected adults continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality globally. Four main pathogens account for the majority of documented SBI: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typhoidal strains of Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The epidemiology of SBI is dynamic, both in developing countries where, despite dramatic successes in antiretroviral therapy, coverage is far from complete, and in settings in both resource-poor and resource-rich countries where antiretroviral therapy failure is becoming increasingly common. Throughout the world, this complexity is further compounded by rapidly emerging antimicrobial resistance, making management of SBI very challenging in these vulnerable patients. We review the causes and treatment of SBI in HIV-infected people and discuss future developments in this field. Invasive pneumococcal disease in relation to vaccine type serotypes Published in [Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/KHVI), 2019 [Paeton L. Wantuch](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=Contrib&text1=Paeton%2BL.%2BWantuch), [Fikri Y. Avci](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=Contrib&text1=Fikri%2BY.%2BAvci) Since 1983 the world has been introduced to four vaccines combating disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. However, despite vaccination programs disease caused by S. pneumoniae continues to lead to high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Surprisingly, instances of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) are still highly attributed to serotypes found in the current vaccine, such as serotypes 3 and 19A. Conversely, non-conjugate vaccine serotypes, such as 35B, are increasing and of rising interest. The persistence of vaccine type serotypes and the increase in non-conjugate vaccine type serotypes show the need for further research into conjugate vaccine design and the need for novel strategies to combat IPD.
