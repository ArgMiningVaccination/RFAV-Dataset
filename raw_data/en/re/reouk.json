As the University's President, I travel quite often and enjoy telling people about the \"UB advantage.\" Our students embark upon a journey that will prepare them for a career and also pre-pare them to better understand the world and their place in it. Here at UB we have students from 81 different countries and 45 states. Nowhere in America will you find so many students from so many different countries and in so intimate a campus set-ting. Whether you come to UB to acquire a high quality liberal arts education, study inter - national public service, you will begin to interact with people from all corners of the world. The average class size of 16 students helps ensure that every student gets the necessary attention from the professors as well as a chance to participate in exciting, challenging discussions. The cross-fertiliza-tion of cultures and ideas is an everyday ex-perience for our students and creates what biologists call \"hybrid vigor.\" Whether you come to UB to acquire a high quality liberal arts education, a knowledge of computer science and engineering, aca-demic training in business, the arts or the healing sciences, you will certainly leave here with more than that. You will have the opportunity to gain a global perspective on world issues and cultures. We at the University of Bridgeport believe that the object of education, beyond career training, is character development. We en-courage our students to involve themselves in one of our many student clubs, a theater production, student government or commu-nity service. It is often in these extracurricu-lar activities one has the opportunity to ex-plore and develop as yet untapped aspects of our character. The hallmark of a truly educated person is one who applies their knowledge to serving their community. That is what I call the \"UB experience.\" It is our sincere hope that you will come to call UB your home. Our beautiful cam-pus, located in historic New England, has a proud 8 decade long tradition of educat-ing students who have made a difference in the world. We encourage our students to take advantage of the many opportunities afforded them here on campus and in the region. We hope they also take the time to explore nearby New York City's many cul-tural offerings. Enrollment begins a lifelong association with UB, first as students and later as loyal alumni. I always appreciate your feedback and look forward to getting to know you. Sincerely, Neil Albert Salonen ivCorrespondence Mailing Address UNIVERSITY OF BRIDGEPORT Bridgeport, Connecticut 06604 Telephone Number: 203-576-4000 Toll Free in CT: 1-800-972-9488 Toll Free in NY, NJ, PA, MA, NH, VT, RI: 1-800-243-9496 Specific inquiries should be addressed as follows: ADMISSIONS INFORMATION Office of Admissions 126 Park ADMISSIONS (888) UB-CHIRO E-mail: COLLEGE OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE ADMISSIONS (203) 576-4108 E-mail: natmed@bridgeport.edu ACUPUNCTURE INSTITUTE ADMISSIONS (203) 576-4109E-mail: acup@bridgeport.edu AND PAYMENTS Bursar (203) 576-4472Fax: (203) 576-4581E-mail: bursar@bridgeport.edu SCHOLARSHIPS AND STUDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES (203) 576-4570E-mail: finaid@bridgeport.edu STUDY ABROAD (203) 576-4699 E-mail: DEVELOPMENT Dean of Students (203) deanofstudents@bridgeport.eduCOUNSELING SERVICES (203) 576-4175 Fax: (203) 576-4200E-mail: counseling@bridgeport.edu TRANSCRIPTS AND ACADEMIC RECORDS Office of the Registrar (203) 576-4634Fax: (203) 576-4941E-mail: registrar@bridgeport.edu For more information specific to one of he colleges or divisions, you may write or call the appropriate dean or director.

The University promotes academic excel- lence, personal responsibility and commit- ment to service. Distinctive curricula in an international, culturally diverse supportive learning environment prepare graduates for life and leadership in an increasingly inter - connected world. The University is indepen- dent and non-sectarian. History The University of Bridgeport was founded in 1927 as the Junior College of Connecticut \u2014 the first junior college chartered by any legislature in the northeastern states. The col-lege had as its purpose, in the words of the founders, to develop in students a point of view and a habit of mind that promotes clear thinking and sound judgment in later pro- fessional and business experience. Although UB has changed in many ways since then, this commitment to student preparation and community service remains central to its mis- sion. The Junior College of Connecticut became the University of Bridgeport in 1947, when the State of Connecticut chartered the in-stitution as a four-year university with au-thority to grant the baccalaureate degree. By that time, the former Barnum estate at Sea-side Park had been purchased and growth in students, faculty, programs and buildings was rapid. The College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Business were added at once, and the colleges of Nursing, Educa-tion, and Engineering soon after. The Junior College expanded its offerings through a merger with the Weylister Secretarial Ju-nior College of Milford, Connecticut, and through the addition of the Fones School of Dental Hygiene (at its inception in 1949 the only such school in Connecticut and the second in New England). By 1950, the University had moved from the original Fairfield Avenue location to the pres- ent Seaside Park campus, which has since grown from 22 to 53 acres. Enrollment was nearly 3,500 students, including a number of international students, taught by a faculty of 183 men and women. In 1951 the University awarded its first Master's degree.In 1953 the University expanded its pro- grams when Arnold College, the oldest co- educational school of physical education in the United States, merged with and was incorporated into the College of Education. In January 1979 UB inaugurated its first doc- toral degree program, Educational Leader - ship; and in 1991 the College of Chiropractic was established, representing the first affilia-tion of a chiropractic school with a university in the United States. In 1992 significant finan- cial support from the Professors World Peace Academy (PWPA), a non-profit organization of academicians dedicated to world peace through education, enabled the University of Bridgeport to continue its programs in the af-termath of a major labor dispute. In 1996 the University established the College of Naturo- pathic Medicine. In 2005 the Ph.D. in Com-puter Science and Engineering was added. University of Bridgeport Today The University today continues its commit-ment to excellence as it maintains its tradi- tion of responding to the changing needs of society through the liberal arts and its pro-fessional programs. Programs are focused so that students receive the kind of personal advising and attention usually found only at small colleges. Furthermore, the Univer - sity takes full advantage of its location in a progressive urban setting, using regional resources as \"living laboratories\" to supple- ment the traditional academic instruction of- fered on the campus. Through co-operative education programs, students can learn from experience by integrating classroom studies on campus with supervised employment in industrial, service, and government sectors. The University through its schools and col- leges offers a variety of undergraduate and graduate degree programs from associate through doctoral levels. In addition, the Uni- versity's College of Chiropractic awards the Doctor of Chiropractic degree; College of Naturopathic Medicine awards the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine and Acupuncture awards the Master of Science in Acupuncture. The IDEAL Program of the School of Continu- ing and Professional Education offers under - graduate courses with flexible scheduling for part-time adult students, at the main campus, at the branch campus in Stamford, CT, and in Waterbury, CT. The University sees its student body as a valuable resource. Approximately 5,000 students were enrolled in 2012-2013, sixty percent of whom are full-time, coming from 45 states and 86 foreign countries and repre- senting a rich diversity of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Faculty The UB instructional staff consists of 121 full-time faculty, and nearly all hold doctoral or terminal degrees in their fields. The regu- lar faculty is augmented by approximately 370 adjunct faculty. Faculty honors include Fulbright Schol- ars, National Science Foundation Fellows, Ford Fellows, National Endowment for the Humanities Fellows, American Council for Learned Societies Scholars, Phi Beta Kappa Scholars, Phi Kappa Phi Scholars and Sigma Xi Scholars.

Campus and Campus History The University of Bridgeport is located fif-ty-five miles from New York City. Bridge- port, Connecticut's largest city, borders the 53-acre campus to the north. Seaside Park and the Long Island Sound, with some of the finest sandy beaches between New York and Cape Cod, mark the southern boundary. The unique location of the campus offers a variety of advantages to the University com- munity. The Sound and the Park are settings for studies in marine biology and for the en-joyment of sun and recreation. The city and county provide opportunities for becom- ing involved in work-study programs with schools, government and some of the coun- try's largest Fortune 500 and multi-national corporations. The architectural diversity of UB's fifty-three buildings, from stately homes as well as new-er structures of modern design, reflects the origins and progress of the university and also embodies its twofold commitment to solidity and change. The entrance to Marina Dining Hall, was once the entrance arch to the es- tate of Phineas Taylor Barnum, who served as Mayor of Bridgeport from 1875 to 1876 and played a crucial role in the city's cultural and economic development. Bryant Hall, with its inlaid mosaic entryway and ornately carved banisters and ceilings, was built in 1895 for inventor Waldo C.Bryant. The Carstensen Hall is a facsimile of a pavilion at the 1893 Columbian Exposition. It was designed in 1899 for the chemist George Edwards, whose research led to improving the durability of sil-ver plate. Between the campus and Seaside Park is the Perry Arch, designed by Henry Ba- con, who also designed the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. The more modern buildings house academic and student life on campus: The Arnold Bernhard Arts and Humanities Center is a focal point for the cultural life of the University and of the Greater Bridge- port community, as well as the center for the study and appreciation of art, music, cinema, design and drama. Facilities in- clude classrooms, studios, the 950-seat An- dre and Clara Mertens Theater, the small in-the-round experimental Austin W . Mather Theatre, the Littlefield Recital Hall, and the Schelfhaudt Gallery. Located on the ninth floor is the Henry B. duPont III Tower Room, used for meetings and receptions. The Carlson Building, prominently located on the main quad of the University, was built by the generosity of William and Phil-lips Carlson in 1955. Until the completion of Wahlstrom Library in 1974, Carlson served as the University's first stand alone library. Today it houses the School of Education on its first floor and the College of Public and International Affairs on it second floor as well as the Office of Overseas Study and the administrative offices of the English Lan-guage Institute. The building also houses the language laboratory and the film and video facility. The John J. Cox Student Center provides so- cial, recreational, and extracurricular cultural programs. It has a social hall with a seating capacity of 400; lounges and meeting rooms; a games room and bowling alley; the office of The Scribe (the campus newspaper); the studio and transmitter of WPKN (an inde- pendent non-commercial FM radio station); and offices of the Student Congress and stu- dent clubs and organizations, as well as of-fices of the Student Development division. The Charles A. Dana Hall of Science is de- signed for study and research in biology, chemistry, physics, health sciences, medical laboratory science and geology. There is a 285-seat lecture auditorium, and the unique Science Wall of Honor commemorating thir - ty-seven of the world's \"Immortals of Sci- ence.\" It is also the home of the School of Arts and Sciences. Eleanor Naylor Dana Hall provides facilities for the Physician Assistant Program and the graduate program in Human Nutrition. The UB Health Sciences Center houses the UB Clinics in Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Dental Hygiene, and Naturopathic care. Also it is the home to the Administration for the Acupunc- ture Institute, College of Naturopathic Medi- cine and the Fones School of Dental Hygiene. The Harvey Hubbell Gymnasium is the center for intercollegiate sports programs. It seats 2,500 spectators. Ernest C. Trefz School of Business houses the School of Business and a major comput-er laboratory. The College of Chiropractic Building has class and conference rooms, offices, a labora- tory, and an auditorium seating two hundred people. It is equipped with the modern facili-ties necessary for the professional programs offered by the Chiropractic faculty. The Technology Building provides the engi- neering disciplines with the special capabili- ties and equipment needed for programs in biomedical, mechanical, electrical and com-puter engineering. The Magnus Wahlstrom Library is the aca- demic and physical heart of the campus.

Articulation Agreements The University has articulation agreements with the following institutions: Capital Community College Gateway Community CollegeHousatonic Community College Middlesex Community College Naugatuck Community College Northwestern Community College Norwalk Community CollegeTunxis Community CollegeWestchester Community College Academic Credit From Non-University Sponsored Instruction The following are four categories of assess- ment from which University of Bridgeport (UB) academic credit is awarded for prior learning earned in non-university sponsored instruction. 1. Standardized Tests\u2014College Level Equivalent Proficiency (CLEP) UB accepts up to thirty (30) credit hours from the credit recommendations of the Col- lege Board's College Level Equivalent Pro- ficiency (CLEP) exam program. Undergrad-uate students may earn up to 30 semester hours of credit (one year's studies) by dem- onstrating subject area competence through standardized testing. CLEP credit may not be used to satisfy the minimum University 30-hour residency requirement. CLEP credit is not included in the student's credit hours earned at the University of Bridgeport and is not computed in the student's quality point ratio at the University. CLEP credit is not considered in the total number of UB hours used to determine eligibility for graduation honors. Information on subject matter and testing procedure is available at the School of Continuing & Professional Studies or at the College Board at: clep.collegeboard.org. 2. Nationally Recognized Evaluations for Credit Recommendations UB accepts evaluations of non-university sponsored instruction as part of a student applicant's transfer evaluation. UB accepts evaluations of non-university sponsored in-struction from the following nationally rec- ognized institutions: American Council on Education College Credit Recommendation Service: ACE CREDIT recommends academic credit for formal courses or examinations offered by various organizations, from businesses and unions to the government and mili-tary. o ACE CREDIT includes evaluations on military credits, DSST exams, ALEKS Exams (McGraw-Hill) and many more non-university organizations. o The ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI), the ACTFL Writing Proficiency (WPT), the ACTFL Reading Proficiency Test (RPT), the ACTFL Listening Profi- ciency Test (LTP) and the ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview Computer Test (OPIc) are recommended for Acollege credit by the American Council on Ed-ucation (ACE). National College Credit Recommendation Service (formerly National PONSI), un-der the auspices of the State University of New York, Board of Regents, evalu- ates training and education programs offered outside of the traditional college classroom setting and recommends them for college credit equivalencies. National CCRS coordinates teams of college faculty evaluators and subject matter experts to conduct extensive reviews of education and training programs offered by corpo-rations, unions, religious organizations and proprietary schools. Students applying for admission to the Uni-versity should include these evaluations with their application and follow the same proce-dures as a transfer student. The equivalent credit will be assessed in conjunction with the academic program and other earned transfer credits. See Transfer Students on page 6. 3. Credit for Life Work Experience Program (CLWEP) Some students acquire mastery over course subject matter through prior work or training experience. UB values the university-level knowledge that student's may have acquired outside the traditional university classroom. In the CLWEP portfolio assessment, students demonstrate that what they already know is equivalent to what they would have learned in an equivalent college course. A student may have acquired this knowledge through past work, independent reading and study, training programs or in-service courses, vol- unteer service, cultural or artistic pursuits, hobbies and recreational pastimes, com- munity or religious activities, organizational memberships, adult education, non-credit courses, study abroad, military training not evaluated for credit by ACE, or other expe- riences. A portfolio enables the student to identify and articulate this knowledge, and potentially earn credit for it. Students learn the process of identifying ar - eas of course-equivalent learning and port- folio development skills through the CLWEP guidelines and assessment plan that can be acquired through the School of Continuing & Professional Studies. CLWEP credit may not be used to satisfy the minimum University 30-hour residency requirement. CLWEP credit is included in the student's semester hours earned at the University and also in the total number of UB hours used to determine eligibility for Admissions7graduation honors. However, such credit is not computed in the student's quality point ratio at the University. Special Instructions for Specific Majors DESIGN PORTFOLIO REQUIREMENTS SASD is looking for a passion for art and design in a portfolio. We recommend that students choose from the following for inclu- sion in their portfolio: drawings, paintings, posters, photography or video, sculpture, ceramics, fashion, or work for a school year - book or class. Submissions should contain 10-12 samples of your work. Portfolios may be emailed, mailed in on DVD, posted to a personal web site, or hand delivered in hard copy form. If a student does not have art or design work or attends a school that does not provide art or design classes, he or she may con- tact SASD for an assignment to complete at home. In these cases, we encourage stu-dents to visit SASD so a faculty member can provide both examples and materials. Please contact sasd@bridgeport.edu for fur - ther information.

We have provided the information below to help you better understand the terms of your payment obligations. Please review this document carefully. If you have any addi- tional questions, please contact the Student Financial Services Office at 203.576.4568. UNIVERSITY OF BRIDGEPORT STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY POLICY PAYMENT OF CHARGES Students are responsible for all charges in- curred upon registration. Charges generally include tuition, fees, housing meal plans and other miscellaneous costs. Students must make acceptable payment arrangements no later than the first day of class. Acceptable payment arrangements are as follows: Payment in full Approved financial aid covering all charg- es Participation in an approved company or organization reimbursement payment agreement Enrollment in an approved payment plan A student who complies with the above shall be considered in good financial stand-ing, as long as all terms and conditions are met throughout each semester. All payment arrangements must be satisfied in full to re-ceive grades, transcripts, diplomas and re- ceive future services. DELINQUENT A CCOUNTS/ COLLECTION Two weeks after the first day of class, past due student accounts are considered delin- quent in nature. In order to continue in the classes for which a student has registered, a student with a delinquent balance must make immediate payment in full or agree to and fulfill the terms of the Past-Due Tuition Repayment Agreement. If a student fails to timely satisfy the terms of his or her financial responsibility agreement, the University may in its absolute discretion cancel registration or refer delinquent past due balances to an outside collection agency, where additional fees and penalties will be charged to the ac- count, as permitted by law. HOLDS Holds will be placed on students' accounts for students who are not meeting their pay- ment plan agreements and/or have any re- maining balance due on their accounts. The hold will prevent the student from; register - ing for additional terms, adding or dropping courses, accessing their grades, requesting transcripts, receiving their diplomas and hav-ing access to other University services. The hold will not be lifted until the balance is paid in full. LATE P AYMENT CHARGES A late fee of $75 will be assessed each month to any past due account. The fee will charged every 30 days until balance is paid in full. COMMUNICATION Method of Communication: UBMail (pow-ered by Google) is the official method of communication with students. Students are responsible for reading the e-mails sent by the University of Bridgeport. Billing statements are emailed to students at least 4 weeks before the beginning of the term if the student has preregistered. Stu- dents who register late shall request a bill at the time of registration. Reminder statements are emailed every 2 weeks. Notices informing students of holds or late fees will be emailed to students. Students shall access their UB Portal on a regular basis to determine if they have a bal- ance, a hold or have had late fees added to their accounts. Students are responsible for all charges and failure to review or receive a billing state-ment does not excuse a student's responsi- bility to pay.

Consult your sponsor to deter - mine if a direct billing agreement has been established with the University of Bridge- port. If one has been established, you need a letter, on company letterhead, from your sponsor that includes your name, eligible program, maximum tuition amount where the bill should be sent. The letter should be forwarded to the Office of Student Financial Services, at 126 Park Avenue, Bridgeport, CT 06604 or faxed a (203) 576-4570. Students are responsible for obtaining a de- ferment payment /direct billing option letter from their sponsor for the initial registration and ensure that it is received at the Office of Student Financial Services by the tuition due date. Students who are unable to obtain a deferment payment/direct billing letter by the payment deadline must pay their tuition prior to the start of the semester. Students must pay any fees not covered by the em- ployer's deferment/ direct payment plan at time of registration. Should employment cease with sponsor or conditions of sponsorship are not met, the student is responsible for all tuitions and fees. A financial obligation continues to exist when using a financial aid deferment. There- fore, a transcript hold will be applied to the student record throughout the deferment pe- riod. Official transcripts will not be released until all University of Bridgeport financial obligations have been satisfied.FINANCIAL AID DEFERMENT WITHOUT FEE (DOMESTIC STUDENTS) Domestic students who receive a Financial Aid award letter may deduct each certified award amount (signified by an \"A\" or a \"P\" rather than an \"E\" in the ACT field on the award letter) from their balance due. Lend- er fees should be deducted from each loan award, excluding Perkins loans. When an \"E\" appears in the ACT field, this usually indicates an action is required before the award will be credited to the student's AR account. In these cases, students must con- tact the Office of Student Financial Services at 203-576-4568 for assistance in determining which action is necessary for the financial aid to be credited to their account. Please note work-study awards are not deducted from the amount due since the student will be eligible to earn up to this amount through student employment. Federal Regulations re-quire the University to issue a paycheck di- rectly to the student for hours worked. PERKINS LOANS Perkins loan recipients must electronically sign for their Perkins loan advance every year within the first two weeks of the start of classes to ensure credit of this award to their account. FEDERAL DIRECT LOANS: Loan origination fees will reduce the amount of loan funds received. These fees (normally between 1% and 3%) should be deducted from the amount shown in the award letter before deducting the amount of these funds from the final bill. ALTERNATIVE LOANS Alternative loans are private loans offered through a lending institution and are not a part of federal student aid programs. Inter - est rate and repayment provisions vary from lender to lender. It is the responsibility of the student to research and understand the im- plications of borrowing an alternative loan. Loans must be approved by lender prior to the tuition payment due date.

Since students are admitted sole-ly on the basis of their academic and person- al qualities, without regard to their financial circumstances, the University offers a variety of financial aid and scholarship programs to provide financial assistance to qualified stu- dents. The University of Bridgeport subscribes to the policy that eligibility for scholarship aid should depend on the student's achievement and promise, but that the amount of aid should depend on the relative financial need of the student and his or her family. The financial need of most students at the University can be met in the form of schol-arships, grants, loans and student employ- ment. Funds are available to the student through the University of Bridgeport from federal and state governments, private foun- dations and University resources. The University of Bridgeport awards merit scholarships recognizing outstanding aca-demic achievement and student leadership. In addition, there are a number of other pay- ment assistance programs that include non-University tuition plans. Students enrolled in tuition discounted pro- grams such as the IDEAL program are not eligible to receive institutional scholarships or grants. The Office of Student Financial Services de- termines the amount and combinations of aid for which the student is eligible. Finan- cial aid decisions are made after a student has been admitted and requests for financial assistance will not influence a candidate's consideration for admission. Financial aid is awarded on an annual basis and continuing students must apply each year for aid. Application Procedures New domestic students are encouraged to begin to apply for financial aid at the same time they are seeking admission. Applicants for financial aid need to: 1. Complete the Free Application for Feder - al Student Aid (FAFSA) by going to www. FAFSA.gov. Be sure to include the Univer - sity's school code, 001416, on the FAFSA. 2.

Satisfactory Academic Progress In order to maintain eligibility for financial aid a student must maintain satisfactory aca- demic progress. Financial aid recipients are expected to make reasonable progress as a condition of receiving and continuing to receive aid. Students' academic progress is assessed according to qualitative and pace measures as they apply. The qualitative measure is (grades) is similar to the academ- ic standards applied to all UB students. The pace measure (number of credit hours com-pleted successfully/maximum timeframe) is used to monitor progress toward degree completion. For a student to be making sat-isfactory academic progress the student must meet the following qualitative GPA standards and have completed, with a passing grade, at least 67% of the cumulative attempted credits. Undergraduate CREDITS ATTEMPTED MINIMUM C.G.P.A. (including transfer credit) 1 - 24 1.5 25 - 48 1.7 49 - 59 1.9 60 or more 2.0 Graduate Graduate students must maintain a C.G.P.A. of 3.0 and complete 68% of the cumulative attempted credits. FINANCIAL AID PROVISIONAL STATUS Students not meeting satisfactory academic standards for a given academic term, as out- lined above, are notified in writing and will be placed on financial aid probation for one semester for which they may receive their aid. At the end of the probationary semes- ter, satisfactory academic progress will be reviewed. If the student meets the minimum standards as outlined, the probationary sta- tus will be lifted. If minimum standards are not met, the student will forfeit his or her future eligibility for financial aid and will be notified in writing. Students who have not maintained eligibil- ity to receive financial aid due to unsatisfac- tory academic progress may appeal for one additional semester of probationary eligibil- ity. The student must also sign an Academic Plan agreement with Student Financial Ser - vices outlining what is needed to meet SAP. Appeals must be submitted to the Office of Student Financial Services within 10 calendar days of receipt of notice of action taken for committee review. The decision on the ap- peal is final. Late or incomplete appeals will not be accepted or reviewed. REINSTATEMENT OF AID If a student is re-admitted, the University will consider the student's application for financial aid. Reinstatement of aid is not automatic and the student must submit a letter to the Of-fice of Student Financial Services requesting a reinstatement. In order to remain eligible for aid, students must meet the minimum aca-demic progress standards as outlined or lose 16eligibility for the following semester. FINANCIAL AID RETURN POLICY Students withdrawing from all courses should see financial aid as it is important to discuss withdrawal and refund as it pertains to the individual student, and its implications for balances owed to the University, federal student loan repayment and future eligibility for financial assistance. Return of Institutional Aid Students withdrawing within the Univer - sity's Tuition Refund Schedule (see Tuition, Fees and Other Expenses) will have the same schedule applied to their University of Bridgeport aid. Return of Federal Aid If you have been awarded federal (Title IV) aid and you withdraw before complet- ing 60 % of the semester your financial aid award will be recalculated, according to the percentage of the semester you have com- pleted. The formula for calculating this per - centage is: (Days enrolled) - (Official breaks of five days or longer) Total number of class days in the semester. Students who plan to withdraw from classes are advised to speak with a Financial Aid Advi- sor prior to doing so to ensure they are aware of the ramifications to their financial aid. Financial Assistance Programs The University of Bridgeport believes that a student's achievements should be recognized and rewarded. Our scholarships and grants enable students who have potential and want to benefit from a high quality academic pro- gram. Students who qualify must enroll as and maintain full time traditional status.

Cox Student Center, Room 116 244 University Ave., Bridgeport, CT 06604 Telephone: (203) 576-4392 or 4393 E-mail: deanofstudents@bridgeport.edu The contribution of the Division of Student Affairs to the University of Bridgeport and its students arises out of the special perspec- tive which members of the student affairs staff have about students and their growth and development, their experiences, and their campus environments. This perspec-tive draws on research about teaching and learning, which emphasize the importance of community, diversity, and individual dif-ferences to the educational experience. The Student Life program is administered through the Division of Student Affairs by the Dean of Students. It includes career de-velopment, counseling and disability ser - vices, health services, interfaith center, inter - national student services, residential life and community standards, campus activities and civic engagement as well as the Title IX Co- ordinator. The Division of Student Affairs enhances and supports the mission, goals, and objec- tives of the University of Bridgeport as an international, culturally diverse supportive learning environment, preparing graduates for life and leadership in an increasingly in-terconnected world. In this role, the staff of the student affairs division has a diverse and complicated set of responsibilities: to advo-cate for the common good while champion- ing the rights of the individual; to encour - age intelligent risk-taking while setting limits on behavior; and to promote independent thought while teaching interdependent be- havior. The extent to which the University is suc- cessful in creating a climate in which these contradictory ends can coexist is reflected in how well students are able to recognize and deal with such contradictions both during and after their college experience. The Divi-sion of Student Affairs is committed to assist-ing students and the University of Bridgeport community as they seek to meet the chal- lenges inherent in balancing these complex and often competing goals. \u2014Adopted from A Perspective on Student Affairs, National Association of Student Per - sonnel Administrators, 1987. Students are encouraged to take an active role in the life of the campus community, where there are many opportunities to con- tribute to group decisions, practice leader - ship, sort out priorities and make personal choices. Students at the University of Bridge-port are responsible for making their own decisions and forming their own judgments concerning personal, social and academic activities. They share the responsibility for maintaining the educational climate needed for learning and for personal growth. The University retains high expectations of ap- propriate behavior, and expects that when students decide to enroll they will abide by all the rules of the University. When the University deems it necessary it reserves the right to notify the parent or guardian to whom a student is financially dependent regarding the health, academic or disciplinary status of the student. (Depen-dency is defined by Section 152 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code).

We endeavor to minimize the difficulties our international students and exchange visitors may experience upon ar - rival by offering a monthly Coffee Hour and publishing a monthly newsletter \"Diversity Crossroads\" as well as by giving necessary information throughout the year. We also provide professional expertise on immigra-tion, employment and taxation issues by holding seminars and workshops. Upon arrival on Campus, all new interna- tional students and scholars report to this office for passport check-in. A mandatory immigration and personal safety information session is also required for all international students. Please visit the International Student Services website at www.bridgeport.edu/iss for more detailed information, applications and gen- eral assistance. Individual appointments with an International Student Advisor are avail- able by calling the office at (203) 576-4395. We may also be reached by fax at (203) 576-4461 and e-mail at internationaloffice@ bridgeport.edu. The office is located in the Wahlstrom Library, Garden Level, Room 133. MEDIA The University supports a student news pub- lication, The Scribe, which is published 4-6 times per semester. The residence halls, as well as the staff of the Division of Student Affairs, publish informational newsletters and the Purple Knight Weekly student activ- ity e-newsletter as well as maintain a pres- ence on various social media platforms. ORIENTATION New student orientation programs are de-signed to introduce students to the Univer - sity of Bridgeport community. The orienta-tion program begins in the summer with our summer orientation and continues a few days prior to the start of classes. This gives incoming students the opportunity to get settled in their new environment and to become familiar with their academic pro- gram. Formal and informal social and in-formational sessions provide students with the opportunity not only to learn about the University's policies, but to meet and social-ize with other students. All new students are expected to attend. The Office of Campus Activities and Civic Engagement employs workers that sup- port the transformation of campus culture through hands-on experiences in project management, workshop development, club training, project implementation, student advisement, event planning, budgeting, stu-dent supervision, and the development of leadership skills. The Office is located in the John J. Cox Student Center, Rm 231. RESIDENTIAL LIFE The University recognizes the important con- tribution that life in the residence halls can makes in a student's total educational expe- rience. Each hall is staffed by a live-in pro-fessional staff member and trained student staff Resident Assistants or Community As- sistants on each floor. Their efforts are coor - dinated through the Office of Housing, Resi- dential Life and/or Community Standards. Residence Hall staff have the responsibility of enforcing University policies, procedures and regulations as they relate to residential living as well as promoting, with the active cooperation of residents, an environment that supports academic achievement. The office is located in the back of Seeley Hall. LIVING ON CAMPUS The University offers a variety of housing options.

The Title IX Coordina- tor may be contacted with questions regard- ing Title IX.Student Affairs26Academic Regulations and Procedures GENERAL INFORMATION The Advising System The University provides academic and per - sonal services to support each student's ef- fort to gain the best possible undergradu- ate education. Selecting a course of study, choosing a major, and deciding upon a ca- reer are crucial decisions for every student. The Advising System functions to assist stu-dents in designing their programs according to their individual interests and needs. Students are assigned a faculty advisor upon acceptance to the University. Faculty advi- sors are available for consultation through-out the student's tenure for purposes of academic advisement and assistance with course selection. Advisors approve registra- tions for traditional undergraduates and pro-gram or major changes for all students. For assistance with non-academic concerns, pro- fessional counselors are available through the University's Student Affairs Division. CONSENT TO PLAGIARISM SCREENING Students are expected to be familiar with and to comply with the University's policies pro- hibiting plagiarism as set forth in the Key to UB-Student Handbook. Some courses utilize electronic screening to detect plagiarism, e.g., Turnitin. These plagiarism screening pro- grams analyze the extent to which students' submitted assignments constitute original content and compare students' submissions to an extensive network of web pages, ar - ticles, and other student work in their data- bases. Using these resources, these programs produce originality reports which categorize submission content, determining what per - centage of each assignment matches text found in their databases. By enrolling in course(s), students consent to the above-described plagiarism screening programs and may also be required to ap-prove specific terms and conditions of use when submitting an assignment. Students also consent to retention of their submission in Turnitin or other plagiarism screening plat-forms, but retain full copyright of their sub- mission. Interruption of Studies WITHDRAWAL FROM A COURSEUndergraduate students may withdraw from any course with advisor approval. Graduate students may withdraw from any course other than a Thesis, Independent Study, Research or equivalent. Course withdrawals may be re- quested up to the last date to withdraw from courses as published in the course schedule book or academic calendar. To withdraw from a course, obtain a Schedule Adjustment Form from the Office of the Registrar and take it to your advisor. Advisor's signature is re- quired to withdraw from any course. Return the signed withdrawal form to the Office of the Registrar for processing. If a student officially withdraws from a course during the first three weeks of a class, no grade will be reported and the course will not appear on the student's transcript. On occasions a withdrawal is granted after the first 20 days for reasons beyond the student's control as determined by the student's advi- sor. In these cases, a \"W\" will be posted on the student's transcript for the course. When a student registers for a course, but ceases to attend class without filing an application for withdrawal a grade of \"F\" shall be posted to the student's transcript. Tuition refunds for course withdrawals will be calculated accord-ing to the University's official refund policy. Federal Financial Aid awards are subject to adjustment when a student withdraws from the University. Cessation of attendance, no- tice to instructors, or telephone calls to the University, do not constitute official with-drawal from the University. WITHDRAWING FROM THE UNIVERSITY Students who withdraw from all courses and thus from the University, must file an Appli- cation to Withdraw at the Office of the Reg- istrar. Students must meet with the Dean of Students prior to submitting the withdrawal form to the Registrar. No student is considered officially with- drawn and no refund of tuition will be made unless the student has contacted the Office of the Registrar. If a student fails to register for a semester without being granted a leave of absence, or the leave of absence has expired, the student will be administratively withdrawn from the University. CANCELLATION Students presently enrolled may cancel their registration or officially withdraw for the sub- sequent semester while completing the cur - rent one. Students must contact the Office of the Registrar to cancel classes. INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ATTENDANCE POLICY International students must pursue a full- time course of study to maintain status and are required by the conditions of their visa to attend scheduled classes. Failure to attend classes may lead to termination of SEVIS re- cords. Before making changes to their sched- ules, International students must speak with an academic advisor and consult with Inter - national Student Services. ISS is located on the Garden Level of Wahlstrom Library. Readmission REGULAR READMISSION A student who officially or unofficially with - draws from the University must apply for read - mission. Readmission is necessary with any break in attendance for full-time students and after a break of more than one semester for part-time students. A student who with-draws officially, or unofficially, and subse- quently applies for readmission is required to meet the degree requirements and condi-tions current at the time of readmission. Stu- dents who have attended another accredited institution in the interim must present com-plete official transcripts with their applica- tion for readmission. Applications for readmission are available from the Registrar's Office. READMISSION IN CASES OF DISCIPLINARY EXPULSION AND SUSPENSION Disciplinary expulsion and suspension may be incurred as a result of unacceptable con- duct. See the Key to UB for rules, regulations and procedures for readmission. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Students who must discontinue enrollment for less than one academic year and who have a commitment to return to the Universi- ty must submit a written request for a Leave of Absence to the Office of the Registrar. A copy of this request must also be sent to the Dean or Director of the student's program. Students who are in good academic stand- ing and who have met all University require-27ments may return to the University at the be- ginning of any semester within the one-year Leave of Absence period. A leave of absence may be extended for an additional year upon approval of the pro- gram Dean or Director. A written request is required for consideration of an extended leave of absence and the leave will be noted on the student's permanent record. FIVE YEAR RULE FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS Students who interrupt their studies for a pe- riod exceeding five years must obtain written permission from the Dean of their College or Director of the School to apply previously earned credits toward their degree. Application for Graduation You must apply for Graduation one term prior to the completeion of your last class. Students must Log into their https:// webadvisor.bridgeport.edu/WA2/WA2?& TYPE=M&PID=CORE-WBMAIN& TOKENIDX=5889426310 WebAdvisor account and look for the https://myub.bridgeport.edu/students/Pages/WebAdvisor.aspx?title=Application+for+graduation&pid=ST-XWBSTS015 Application for Graduation . Students must complete the on-line form and remit the $150 graduation fee via credit card. NOTE: Please be aware that certification of your degree is done by your Department and not by the Office of the Registrar. Such consultation enables the advisor to check the student's records for discrepan- cies and allows some time during the last semester to resolve problems if any appear. The fulfillment of the graduate requirements is the student's responsibility. For deadlines for graduation applications, please see the Academic Calendar Students who are required to take a course/s after the expected graduation date must re- apply for graduation and pay an additional application fee. All blanks on the application form must be completed. Diplomas will be printed exactly as the name appears on the application form. The University of Bridgeport holds one cer - emony in May of each year. A fee must be paid whether or not you participate in the ceremony. Diplomas are normally mailed within 45 days of the end of the term for which a student is graduating. Release of diplomas is dependent on all graduation re-quirements and financial obligations to the University of Bridgeport (including Perkins Loans) being satisfied. Diplomas are mailed to the address listed on the graduation appli- cation form. If you have a change of address during the course of the graduation process, please email the Registrar at registrar@bridge- port.edu so that your records can be updated. Transcripts Students may request official transcripts to be mailed to other institutions, prospective employers, or other authorized agencies, by completing a transcript request from avail-able in the Office of the Registrar. Please allow ten (10) days for requests sent by mail to be processed. Each graduating stu-dent will receive one free, unofficial copy of his/her transcript together with his/her diploma upon graduation. Subsequent tran-script requests must be made to the Office of the Registrar in writing. Transcripts will be mailed to the address listed on the transcript request form.

UNDERGRADUATE REGULATIONS & PROCEDURES Classification of Undergraduate Students SPECIAL STUDENTS An applicant admitted with permission to take courses for which he or she is quali- fied (met the prerequisites), but not as a de- gree candidate, is a special student. Special Students may later apply for matriculation and are subject to any changes in gradua- tion requirements instituted prior to actual matriculation. A student who has formally applied for ad- mission to the University and has been ad-mitted to one of its Colleges as a degree candidate is a matriculated student. An applicant admitted with permission to take courses for which he or she is qualified, but not as a degree candidate, is a special stu- dent. Special students may later apply for matriculation and are subject to the same ac-ademic regulations as matriculated students. Only matriculated students carrying at least twelve semester hours are eligible for elec- tion to class and other offices (with the ex-ception of the Part-time Student Council, and University Senate) FULL-TIME STUDENTS Normal academic progress is maintained by a student who: 1. Has been accepted into a degree pro- gram; 2. Is fulfilling the requirements of that de- gree program as described in this Catalog; 3. Has a cumulative quality point ratio of at least 2.0 (\"C\" average), or that required by the specific degree program if it is higher than 2.0; and 4. Registers for and completes at least 12 se- mester hours of credit each term (exclud- ing co-op terms). PART-TIME STUDENTS Normal academic progress is maintained by a student who: 1. Has been accepted into a degree pro- gram;Academic Regulations and Procedures282. Is fulfilling the requirements of that de- gree program as described in this catalog; 3. Has a cumulative quality point ratio of at least 2.0 (\"C\" average), or that required by the specific degree program if it is higher than 2.0; and 4. Registers for and completes between 1 and 11 semester hours of credit each term. CLASS STANDING Students are classified according to the num- ber of college hours satisfactorily completed: Freshman 0-30 semester hours Sophomore 31-60 semester hours Junior 61-90 semester hours Senior 91 and above THE MAJOR Most students matriculating in programs leading to an Associate's or Bachelor's de- gree declare a major when they are admitted to the university. The student must earn a grade of \"C-\" or better in every major course. However, the student's overall quality point ratio in major courses must be at least 2.0. In some cas- es, departmental requirements may exceed these minimums. If a student earns a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in a course in the major field, he or she must obtain a written statement from the department chair specifying the procedure necessary to remedy the deficien- cy and remain in the major. SECOND B ACHELOR'S DEGREE Students who wish to earn a second Bach-elor's degree must fulfill all College/School and major requirements for the second de- gree and must earn a minimum of 30 ad-ditional credits beyond the number required for the first Bachelor's. THE MINOR The University offers the option of selecting a second area of specialization. Like the ma- jor, the minor was conceived to provide a unified, coherent program in a discipline or area of knowledge. While requiring a sec- ond focus for the student's intellectual inter - ests, it enables him or her to investigate the important concepts of a specific area and to acquire a firm basis for further study. In terms of career preparation, the minor op- tion can complement a regular major pro-gram or it may add an entirely new dimen-sion to the traditional curriculum. A minor is a minimum of 18 credits to be defined by the School and Department. Students who wish to pursue a minor should obtain the application in the Dean's or Di- rector's office of the College or School in which the minor is offered. Minors may be assigned in the following ar - eas: Accounting Business AdministrationChemistry Computer EngineeringComputer Science Criminal JusticeElectrical Engineering Fashion Merchandising FinanceGraphic Design Philosophy Gerontology History Human Services Industrial Design Interior Design International Business International Political Economy & Diplomacy Literature & CivilizationManagement & Industrial Relations Marketing Martial Arts Mass Communications Mathematics Music New Media StudiesPolitical Science Psychology Religion and Politics Sociology Social Science UNSPECIFIED STATUS Unspecified status is designed primarily for those students who have not yet chosen a specific field of concentration within their College. The courses which they take under these circumstances will fulfill the majority of general college requirements during the first and second year of study. Students who have been admitted to un- specified status must follow the procedure for change of major in order to become ad- mitted to a specific major and must declare a major by the end of the sophomore year. CHANGE OF MAJOR If after matriculation a student wishes to change a major, it must be initiated by the student through the office of the senior administrator of the College or School. In some cases, change of program may require a reevaluation of semester hours earned at UB or transferred from another institution. It is the student's responsibility to consult with the chair of the anticipated major depart-ment to formulate a curriculum plan for the completion of that degree. Registration for Courses The student must formally register for cours- es during the regular or early registration pe- riod. All charges for the semester are payable in full before or during registration unless the student has applied for the deferred pay-ment plan. A program of fifteen or sixteen semester hours constitutes a normal load. No student will be permitted to register for more than eighteen semester hours in any one semester without the prior written ap- proval of the appropriate College Dean or School Director. CHANGE OF REGISTRATION All changes of registration require the prior written approval of the student's faculty ad- visor. Students shall refer to the published course schedule and Key to UB to determine additional approval procedures and require- ments for all program changes. The student must submit all approved changes of reg- istration, including course withdrawals, to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadlines. CLASS ATTENDANCE Undergraduate students are expected to at-tend their classes regularly. The instructor shall specify in the course syllabus at the be- ginning of the semester the extent to which the attendance factor will be taken into ac- count when grades are calculated. Due al- lowance, however, will be made for such factors as illness, inclement weather, and se- vere personal or family problems. UNIVERSAL ENGLISH All student papers submitted to any instruc- tor at the University must be of University standard in form, spelling, punctuation and literary organization. Instructors may refuse to read or to correct papers that are not in keep- ing with the standards of good English usage.Academic Regulations and Procedures29Grades and Quality Points A semester hour is the unit by which credits are measured. A quality point is the numeri- cal value assigned to letter grades A-F. Each grade is assigned quality points as shown below. The faculty uses the following crite- ria as bases for determining \"W\" Letter grades may be assigned with \"+\" and \"-\" signs. Other grades include pass-fail (earned under the University Pass/Fail Program): \"S\" - sat-isfactory completion of course requirements; and \"U\" - has not completed course require- ments. QUALITY POINTS QUALITY POINTS GRADE PER SEMESTER HOUR GRADE PER SEMESTER HOUR A 4.00 C 2.00 A- 3.67 0.67 C+ 2.33 The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of se- mester hours attempted into the number of quality points earned. Non-credit courses and grades of pass in pass/fail courses are exempted from the computation of the qual- ity point ratio. Incomplete (\"I\" or \"R\") grades are not included in this computation until converted to a letter grade. REPEATED COURSES Students may repeat any course at any grade level below \"A\". The grade from the first re- peat of a given course will replace the first- time grade for the computation of the QPR, the original grade however, will remain on the transcript. The grade for a course repeat- ed more than twice will be the average of all of the grades earned each time the course was taken. All repeated courses will be so indicated on the transcript. PASS/FAIL OPTION (FREE ELECTIVES ONLY) Undergraduate students may elect to take up to 6 courses in an academic degree program on the pass/fail basis. Only free electives may be chosen for the pass/fail option, and no more than two courses may be on that basis in a given semester. Request to take a course on the pass/fail basis must be made in writing on the appropriate form after reg- istration in the course, but absolutely no later than the tenth day of scheduled classes in a regular semester, the fifth day for a ten- week course, or the third day for a five-week course. Students should review the com-plete regulations with their advisors before requesting the pass/fail option through the Registrar's Office. INCOMPLETE WORK Incomplete grades (\"I\" or \"R\") must be re-corded by the date stipulated by the Registrar at the end of the semester. No incomplete will be so recorded by the Registrar unless it is accompanied by a clear indication from the course instructor of the nature of the work to be made up. The Registrar will provide ap-propriate forms with grade sheets. This infor - mation will be placed in the student files. a. An \"I\" (incomplete) grade designates in- complete work in a course at the time of grading for reasons beyond the student's control and determined to be bona fide by the instructor. These would include absence from a final examination or in- ability to complete terminal assignments due to illness, employment conflicts, etc. In such cases where the \"I\" grade is awarded the incomplete will revert to a failing grade if the unfinished work is not satisfactorily completed by the end of the semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted, ex - clusive of the summer sessions. This time can be extended by the instructor for le-gitimate reasons. b. A grade of \"R\" indicates incomplete work in thesis, research, or undergraduate or graduate student project courses. The \"R\" grade must be removed within a period of time specified by the instructor/men-tor/project advisor or director. It must be within the maximum time allowable for degree completion in the academic pro-gram where the degree is being sought. \"W\" GRADE No student may withdraw from a course without the knowledge of his/her academic advisor, as indicated by that advisor's signa- ture on the change of schedule form. With-drawal \"W\" grades are assigned based on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change of registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. This includes withdrawals initiated by the stu- dent and those initiated by the University (e.g., cancellation of course sections). 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the official change of reg- istration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period in a given semester or summer session, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with the grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR but do count toward \"hours at- tempted.\" 3. The names of students who have official-ly withdrawn from a course and received the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, including \"late\" withdrawals, must be individually approved by the appropriate Dean or Director and the Provost before they be- come official and are recorded. CARNEGIE UNIT OF CREDIT Note: The application of the Carnegie unit of credit has implications for graduation requirements, transfer credit policy, faculty load and for measuring program hours/in-come. The Carnegie Unit of Credit provides a guideline on the amount of time that a student is expected to dedicate to a one se-mester hour course in order to receive one semester hour of academic credit. The Uni- versity of Bridgeport calibration of the Carn-egie Unit of Credit is as follows: Onsite Lecture Classes: To receive one se- mester hour of academic credit, the student is expected to attend a 50 minute lecture class per week and spend approximately two hours on assignments and study outside of the classroom throughout a fifteen week semester. Online or Blended Learning Classes: Through Blackboard, Canvas, Wimba or other online tools and blended learning, students would be expected to complete 2.5 hours of activi- ties per week over fifteen weeks to receive one semester hour of academic credit. This would include activities such as reading and responding to posted course materials, dis- cussion board postings, and Skype or Wim-ba discussions.Academic Regulations and Procedures30Onsite Activity-based Classes: One hour and forty minutes of engagement in discipline- based activity and fifty minutes of study per week throughout fifteen weeks. Clinics, Studios and Laboratory-Based Class: 2.5 hours of laboratory, clinical or studio ac- tivity per week for 15 weeks. Independent Study: 2.5 Semester hours of Study per week over a 15 week Semester. Other Forms of Learning: Academic credit based on a demonstration of competency in defined academic outcomes will be the exception and will be based on accepted instruments approved by the Deans and Program Chairs. These can include CLWEP, CLEP tests, or examination of a portfolio by trained academics in the discipline in which the student seeks credit. In all of these learning formats, contact hours and/or study/assignment hours would be increased each week in a summer or con- centrated session to assure compliance with unit of credit guidelines. Approved by University of Bridgeport Sen- ate, November 30, 2010 Off-Campus Study Matriculated students are expected to take the courses for their degrees at the Universi- ty of Bridgeport. Permission to take courses at other institutions for transfer credit will be given only for good and valid reasons and must be approved in advance and in writing by the student's advisor. Permission will not be granted for courses currently offered by the University or courses within the last thir - ty semester hours before graduation, or for courses previously failed at the University. Matriculated students may not take courses at junior or community colleges for transfer credit at the junior or senior level toward their degrees. CREDIT FOR LIFE WORK EXPERIENCE (CLWEP) Some students acquire mastery over course subject matter through prior work or train- ing experience. Many departments have de- veloped examination and other assessment procedures to provide the possibility of credit for those experiences which correlate to specific course offerings in the University Catalog.CLWEP credit may not be used to satisfy the minimum University 30-hour residency re- quirement. CLWEP credit is included in the student's semester hours earned at the Uni-versity and also in the total number of UB hours used to determine eligibility for gradu- ation honors. However, such credit is not computed in the student's quality point ra- tio at the University. Information on subject matter and evaluation procedures is avail-able in the office of the Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. COLLEGE LEVEL EQUIVALENT PROFICIENCY EXAM (CLEP) The University of Bridgeport participates in the Educational Testing Service's College Level Equivalent Proficiency Exam program. The basic purpose of this program is to give the student and non-traditional learner a means for assessing their levels of achieve- ment and for requesting college credit for such achievement. Undergraduate students may earn up to 30 semester hours of credit (one year's studies) by demonstrating subject area competence through testing. CLEP credit may not be used to satisfy the minimum University 30-hour residency requirement. CLEP credit is not in- cluded in the student's credit hours earned at the University of Bridgeport and is not com- puted in the student's quality point ratio at the University. CLEP credit is not considered in the total number of UB hours used to de- termine eligibility for graduation honors. Information on subject matter and testing procedure is available in the office of the Dean of the School of Continuing and Pro- fessional Studies. ADVANCED PLACEMENT A student may enter the University of Bridgeport as a freshman, but with advanced standing toward a degree. Advanced stand- ing may be achieved by taking the Advanced Placement examinations administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. A score of three or above allows the student to earn up to eight credits in one subject area. Well qualified students may also earn advanced placement by taking courses for college credit while in secondary school. In- formation regarding Advanced Placement is available in the Office of Admissions.Academic Status of Students The following policies and standards define the minimum requirements for maintaining academic status in the undergraduate degree programs of the University. Higher require-ments may be established by the faculty for specific programs, subject to approval by appropriate College committees, the appro-priate senior administrator of the College or School and the Provost. Such requirements are described in the appropriate section of this catalog. NORMAL ACADEMIC PROGRESS Normal academic progress refers to a stu-dent's scholastic status in a degree program. The student who is not maintaining normal academic progress will be permitted to re- main in a degree program while attempting to reestablish normal academic progress, un-less and until the student is subject to aca- demic separation as described below. A student may be awarded a degree only when all degree requirements have been satis- fied. In particular, a student who has failed to maintain normal academic progress at some point, must have reestablished normal aca- demic progress before a degree is awarded. Academic Separation The following policies and procedures apply to all students, both matriculated and special. FULL-TIME STUDENTS In order to maintain satisfactory progress as a full-time student, it is necessary to attempt a minimum of 12 credits per semester. A full- time student whose quality point ratio is be-low 2.0 for a given semester is sent a letter of warning at the end of that semester. A full-time student, who has attempted few- er than 19 semester hours and whose quality point ratio is below .75 is automatically sepa-rated at the conclusion of a semester. A student is automatically separated from the University at the conclusion of a semester when the cumulative quality point ratio and UB semester hours attempted are as follows: UB SEMESTER HOURS ATTEMPTED* QPR 24 Below 1.5 48 Below 1.7 72 Below 1.9 96 or more Below 2.0 * Retaking a course does not count toward this total.Academic Regulations and Procedures31Maintaining satisfactory academic progress is essential in order to remain eligible for fi - nancial aid. Please refer to the financial aid section for further information on maintain - ing eligibility for financial aid. PART-TIME STUDENTS A student is automatically separated from the University when the cumulative quality point ratio and UB semester hours attempted are as follows: UB SEMESTER HOURS ATTEMPTED* QPR 24 Below 1.5 48 Below 1.7 72 Below 1.9 96 or more Below 2.0 READMISSION A student who has been separated from the University under the above provisions may apply for readmission to the University no sooner than one full semester after separa-tion. A readmission form is available from the Office of the Registrar. No course work at the University of Bridgeport is permitted during the period of separation. NOTIFICATION A student will be notified of his/her separa-tion before the beginning of the following semester. It is, however, the student's re- sponsibility to be aware of his or her aca-demic status at all times. APPEALS Actions taken under the regulations pertain-ing to Academic Separation may have an im- mediate impact on a student's eligibility for financial aid. Students may appeal actions taken pursuant to these regulations. Appeals must be made in writing directly to the Aca- demic Separation Appeals Committee within ten calendar days of receipt of notice of the action taken. The decision of the Dean will be made within twenty-one calendar days of the date of the receipt of the appeal. An appeal of separation from the University that is granted places the student in a pro- bationary status. The conditions of this sta- tus, including its maximum duration, will be specified in the Committee decision granting the appeal.Change of Status FROM FULL-TIME TO PART-TIME Students wishing to transfer from full-time to part-time status must secure the necessary forms from the Registrar's Office. FROM PART-TIME TO FULL-TIME Students wishing to transfer from part-time to full-time status must secure the necessary forms from the Registrar's Office. Academic Honors PRESIDENT'S LIST A full-time student who, in a given semes- ter, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ratio of 3.7 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the President's List at the end of that semes- ter. A part-time student who is matriculated and who, during a regular academic year, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ratio of 3.7 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the Presi-dent's List at the end of the academic year. DEAN'S LIST A full-time student who, in a given semester, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ratio of 3.2 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the Dean's List at the end of that semester. A part-time student who is matriculated and who, dur - ing a regular academic year, completes 12 or more semester hours with a quality point ra- tio of 3.2 or higher and with no incomplete grades is named to the Dean's List at the end of that academic year. NATIONAL HONOR SOCIETIES Honor societies include Phi Kappa Phi, all University; Beta Alpha, accounting; Delta Mu Delta, business administration; Sigma Phi Al- pha, dental hygiene; Alpha Sigma Lambda, part-time students; Pi Gamma Mu, interna- tional and national social science; Eta Kappa Nu, electrical engineering; Upsilon Pi Epsilon, computer science; and Sigma Xi, research and scholarship; Lambda Pi Eta (The National Communication Studies Honor Society); The- ta Alpha Kappa (The National Religious Stud- ies Honor Society); Pi Sigma Alpha (The Na-tional Political Science Honor Society); Sigma Iota Rho, The Honor Society for International Studies; Phi Sigma Lota (Honor Society of Languages), Alpha Phi Sigma (Criminal Jus- tice Honor Society). Requirements for Undergraduate Degrees The stipulations in the list immediately be- low are only those which are common to the awarding of the Bachelor's degree. Howev- er, requirements specific to each College or School and to individual curricula and dis- ciplines within each College or School also exist. The student must be especially careful to note all of these, since fulfillment of gradu- ation requirements is the individual student's responsibility. No permission for deviation from published requirements is official un- less it is made in writing and signed by the senior administrator of the College or School from which the degree is sought. It is rec- ognized that the requirements for graduation in individual Schools may change. A student must meet the requirements for graduation which are current at the time of graduation, and consistent to the greatest extent possible with the degree requirements in existence at the time of the student's entry into the major. However, whenever a program is altered it is the University's responsibility to translate the student's previously completed work into the new program requirements so that the con- tinuously enrolled student is not penalized for the adaptation. The only exception would be when the state or other licensing agency imposes a new requirement. The common requirements for awarding the Bachelor's de-gree follow. A student must: 1. Have been admitted as, or have achieved the status of, a matriculated student in the College, and must have attained upper - class or major status. 2. Have completed the last thirty semester hours of work toward his or her degree under the direct auspices of the Univer - sity. Under exceptional circumstances, the senior academic administrator may slightly modify this requirement. 3. Present an overall cumulative quality point ratio of at least 2.0 and, in addition, must have a quality point ratio of 2.0 or better in those courses taken for credit in the major. Each individual course in the major must be passed with a grade of \"C\" or better. The student must have earned the number of semester hours of credit Academic Regulations and Procedures32required by the College or School and must not deviate from the curriculum as displayed in this catalog without the writ- ten approval of the appropriate senior academic administrator or his/her desig- nate. GRADUATION HONORS Candidates for graduation who have com- pleted at least sixty semester hours of ac- ademic course work at the University of Bridgeport in their junior and senior years are eligible for honors upon recommenda- tion of the appropriate College faculty. The following standards are used: 1. The Bachelor's degree cum laude may be awarded to a student whose cumulative quality point ratio is at least 3.40. 2. The Bachelor's degree magna cum laude may be awarded to a student whose cu-mulative quality point ratio is at least 3.60. 3. The Bachelor's degree summa cum laude may be awarded to a student whose cu- mulative quality point ratio is at least 3.80. The Associate's degree may be awarded cum laude to a candidate with a minimum quality point ratio of 3.2 and magna cum laude to those with 3.5. A minimum of 45 semester hours must have been earned at the Univer - sity of Bridgeport. GRADUATE REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES *For the Regulations and Procedures pertain- ing to the Graduate Professional Programs in Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Naturopathic Med- icine and Human Nutrition, please see the ap-propriate program sections of this catalog. General Regulations 1. The mere completion of courses and re-quirements does not guarantee continua- tion in the graduate program or advance- ment to degree candidacy. 2. Every student must consult with his/her assigned advisor to ensure a carefully planned program of studies. 3. A graduate student is expected to com-plete his/her degree program within sev-en years of admission. A student may, for sound and valid reasons, request his/her Dean for an extension of this time limit. Such a request must have the approval of the student's advisor, and Department. 4. The amount of graduate work transfer - able to a graduate degree is limited to two graduate courses. Courses applied to one degree or diploma normally are not trans- ferable to a second degree or diploma. Courses presented for transfer credit must be graduate level study completed with a grade of \"B\" or above at an accredited institution. The transferred courses should have been completed within the past sev- en years. The approval of additional transfer credit and waivers of the course time limit may be granted based on the approval of the Department Chair, School Director, and College Dean. 5. The requirements for a master's degree shall include at least one of the following: a comprehensive examination, a written thesis based on independent research, or completion of an appropriate special project. 6. Graduate programs require that all grades applied toward the degree be \"C\" or bet-ter. The grade of \"C- \" cannot be used to satisfy degree requirements. Probation and Separation Policy 1. The minimum cumulative grade point average necessary to continue graduate studies is 3.0 and the minimum semester grade point average to continue graduate studies is 2.0. 2. A student who does not meet either the semester or cumulative grade point aver - age will automatically be placed on pro- bation for the next semester of study. 3. A student placed on probation must meet the standard for continuation at the end of the probationary semester. Failure to meet the standard will result in automatic sepa- ration. 4. Separation from the Program of Study may be appealed to the Academic Ap-peals Committee of the Graduate Council. The appeal must be in writing and must be submitted within 15 days of notifica-tion of separation. 5. A student separated from a Program of Study may apply for re-admission to the Program 1 year from the date of separa- tion from the Program. 6. A student may not be placed on proba- tion more than twice. Failure to maintain a cumulative 3.0 grade point average or a semester grade point average of 2.0 a third time will result in automatic, non-appealable separation. Application for re- admission cannot be made sooner than 1 year after the date of separation. Classification of Students DEGREE STUDENTS All students who have formally declared their intent to pursue a program leading to a specified graduate degree are classified as Graduate Degree students and may fall into one of the following categories: REGULAR A student who has completed all the admis-sion requirements and who has presented a background of scholarship and performance that indicates his/her capacity to profit from and complete a degree program is admitted as a regular degree student. PROVISIONAL A student who has met the general require- ments for admission, but not those for full standing because the promise of achievement in the area of intended study cannot be ac-curately appraised at the time of admission, is admitted provisionally subject to conditions stated on the Certificate of Admission. DEGREE CANDIDATE A regular degree student who has success-fully completed the first 12 hours of graduate study under the direction of assigned advisors and is, in the opinion of the faculty, worthy of continuing the pursuit of an advanced degree at the University, is a degree candidate. Ap- plication for degree candidacy must be filed with the major department after completion of 12 semester hours. MATRICULATION MAINTENANCE All regular and provisional graduate students must maintain matriculation continuously until all degree requirements have been met. Students may maintain matriculation in the following ways: 1. By registering for degree required course work. 2. By registering for continuous matricula- tion. 3. Ed.D. candidates must register for \"Con- tinuing Dissertation research.\"*Academic Regulations and Procedures33Students who fail to register for each semes- ter through one of the options above will au- tomatically be separated from their program. * See Insert for current year's Tuition, Fees, and Other Expenses. NON-DEGREE GRADUATE STUDENTS SPECIAL STUDENT A college graduate from an accredited insti- tution, who elects to take courses for which he/she is qualified but who has not been admitted to a degree program, is classified as a special student on the graduate level. If subsequently admitted to a degree program, there is no guarantee that courses taken as a special student will be counted towards the degree requirements; in any case, only twelve semester hours may be applied to a degree. Those graduate students classified as special graduate students are, therefore, urged to indicate to the Office of Admis- sions and the Registrar whether they wish to change their status to regular degree student prior to or immediately upon completion of twelve semester hours. In order to register for graduate courses as a special student, a completed Application for Graduate Studies must be on file in the Of-fice of Admissions. Evaluation and Grading of Course Work \"A\" indicates distinction; for work of excep- tional quality. \"B\" indicates above-average achievement; quality expected of a graduate student. \"C\" indicates minimal achievement; not up to standards of graduate work. \"D\" indicates below average achievement; no graduate credit possible. \"I\" and \"R\" indicate incomplete graduate course work. (a) An \"I\" (incomplete) grade designates incomplete work in a course at the time of grading for reasons beyond the con-trol of the student and determined to be legitimate by the instructor. These would include absence from a final examina-tion or inability to complete terminal assignments due to illness, employment conflicts, etc. In such cases where the \"I\" grade is awarded the incomplete will re- vert to a failing grade if the unfinished work is not satisfactorily completed by the end of the semester immediately fol-lowing the one in which the incomplete was granted, exclusive of the summer sessions. This time can be extended by the instructor for legitimate reasons. (b) A grade of \"R\" indicates incomplete work in thesis, research, or undergraduate or graduate student project courses. The \"R\" grade must be removed within a pe-riod of time specified by the instructor/ mentor/project advisor or director. It must be within the maximum time allowable for degree completion in the academic pro- gram where the degree is being sought. \"W\" indicates approved student withdrawal. In addition to the above, the grades of \"A-\", \"B+', \"B-', \"C+', \"C-\" and \"D+\" may be as- signed for graduate courses. Semester Hours Carried per Semester Nine semester hours of credit per term nor - mally is considered a maximum full-time pro- gram for graduate students. A student desiring to take more than 12 semester hours must re-ceive written permission from his/her advisor and the Dean or Director of the appropriate college or school.Academic Regulations and Procedures34The Core Curriculum The University holds that professional and ap- plied studies, and later success in careers, re- quire a sophisticated and learned grasp of the artistic, communicative, cultural, social, histori- cal and scientific achievements of the world; and that all learners and professionals should be able to interpret these domains and to com- municate about them clearly and persuasively. All colleges and universities in the State of Con- necticut are required by the Office of Higher Education to mandate that General Education courses compose \"33 percent of the minimum requirements for the baccalaureate degree.\" The University of Bridgeport fully supports the educational philosophy behind this mandate. The University of Bridgeport also believes that General Education should reflect the Univer - sity's educational mission. The General Educa-tion's Core Curriculum draws upon the best traditions of American education and seeks to stimulate creativity, intellectual growth, and development of analytical thinking; but it also advances UB's distinctive educational outlook, which is international in character and com- mitment. Thus the University requires that a large majority of the forty required credit hours of General Education be distributed within its Core Curriculum and allows the remaining to be taken as Liberal Arts electives. \"Liberal Arts\" encompass any course that is not designed pri- marily for skill or knowledge acquisition in a specific profession or field of work. The total number of General Education credit hours must be forty or higher and must satisfy the Core requirements. The required distribution of Core courses through a range of disciplines reflects the mis- sion of the University of Bridgeport. In par - ticular, courses from disciplines are chosen because they encourage reflection upon the interdependent nature of the world, contribute to global awareness, and encourage interdisci- plinary modes of integrative learning. All class- es in this curriculum contribute to academic development and lay the groundwork for suc- cess in graduate schools or students' chosen professions. The Core Curriculum represents what is best and distinctive about the Univer - sity of Bridgeport. THE UNIVERSITY'S CORE CURRICULUM HAS THREE DIMENSIONS: 1. Skills 2. Heritage 3. Seminars I. THE SKILLS SECTION Skills classes help students learn how to think clearly, write effectively, and communicate ac- curately and persuasively. These courses, nor - mally taken in the first semester, lay the foun-dation for all further study. The University of Bridgeport requires competency for such skills through successful completion or placement out of two such courses: one in composition, the other in mathematics. (Note: Placement out of any course requires an equal number of credits to be completed in other approved lib- eral arts coursework toward the minimum forty required credit hours of General Education.) English: English 101 Math: Math 102 or 103 II. THE HERITAGE SECTION Heritage classes introduce students to the ar - tistic, communicative, cultural, social, historical and scientific achievements of the world. The courses below have been selected for inclusion in the Core Curriculum because they contrib- ute to forming an interdisciplinary perspective about these achievements. These courses aim to help students see the world in a distinctive way: as a plural but increasingly interdepen- dent reality. Upper-level courses are suggested to students who are completing Core General Education requirements as upperclassmen, or who have focused academic interests in a par - ticular area of enquiry. Enrolling in these upper-level courses requires the instructor's permis-sion. Full course descriptions and any course prerequisites can be found in Undergraduate Courses of Instruction section of the Catalog.

SEMINARS: FIRST YEAR SEMINAR AND CAPSTONE 390 The thematically focused First Year Seminar, taught with common student learning out- comes to all freshmen, is taken during the first semester of study. This seminar introduces stu- dents to the academic values of a university education while inculcating habits of learn- ing that will serve them throughout their un- dergraduate education and beyond. Through this seminar experience, students establish a foundation upon which the rest of their uni- versity education stands. This may be satisfied through FYS 101, BIOL 100, BUAD 101, ENGR 111, or INTST C101. The Capstone Seminars, CAPS 390, provide an academic context in which the skills and content of the other courses in the General Education Curriculum can be synthesized and integrated. The Capstone is the \"crowning achievement\" of the General Education Cur - riculum. As such, the seminars are limited to juniors and seniors who have completed at least 75 semester credit hours and all required hours within in the Skills and Heritage sections of the Core Curriculum. No exceptions will be granted to this policy. NOTE ON COURSE TRANSFER POLICY The University allows twenty-seven hours of the General Education Curriculum distribution hours to be transferred from other universities. The Capstone Seminar and at least one addi- tional General Education elective course must be taken at the University of Bridgeport. The University of Bridgeport First Year Seminar is not required of transfer students who enter with 30 or more credits.35Cooperative Education and Internships Cooperative Education The University of Bridgeport offers an ex- tensive voluntary cooperative education pro- gram, allowing students to combine class- room study with work experience in their chosen profession. Cooperative Education provides a practical application of academic studies plus opportunities to learn material that cannot be taught in the classroom. Cooperative Education offers the additional bonus of providing paid work experience that can contribute to paying educational expenses and give the student the sense of being self-supporting. Theory and practice are more closely re- lated. Motivation is increased as studies become meaningful. Work experience helps develop maturity and a sense of responsibility. Work experience helps to develop skills in human relations. Professional contacts may be made that can lead to permanent employment. Job opportunities help to test career ob-jectives. Work experience gives students a distinct advantage in a very competitive job mar - ket. Co-Op graduates often start at a higher level job and with higher pay than stu- dents without experience. CO-OP WORK ASSIGNMENTS Assignments are related as closely as pos-sible to the student course of study and ca- reer goals. The large majority of Co-Op jobs are located within 40 miles of the University. Some students locate their jobs near their homes outside of the normal Co-Op place- ment area, thus enabling them to increase their net earnings from Co-Op salaries. Most undergraduate Co-Op students work part-time during the academic year and full- time during vacations. Graduate students have the option to work full-time or part- time during the academic year. STUDENT SALARIES Students are placed in regular jobs and nor - mally are paid for their services by the coop-erating employer. They perform under actu- al working conditions and are advanced on the basis of merit. Guarantees concerning job placement and pay cannot be offered. However, between the end of the Freshmen year and graduation, the typical Co-Op sal- ary can represent a substantial portion of the total cost of a student's education. ACADEMIC CREDITS Academic credit for Co-Op work experience is authorized by the dean and the faculty of the individual schools having Co-Op pro- grams. Students must register and pay the 1-3 credit Co-Op fee for each work term. ELIGIBILITY The Co-Op program is open to all full-time students demonstrating their academic ability. DOMESTIC UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS must complete two full terms at the Universi- ty with a minimum 2.5 grade point average. INTERNATIONAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS must complete one academic year at the Uni- versity with a minimum 2.5 grade point aver - age, have been in F-1 or J-1 visa status for a minimum of one academic year and have a thorough command of oral and written English. DOMESTIC GRADUATE STUDENTS must complete a minimum of four courses in their graduate program with a minimum 3.0 grade point average. INTERNATIONAL GRADUATE STUDENTS must complete one academic year in their graduate program with a minimum 3.0 grade point average, have been in F-1 visa status for a minimum of one academic year and have a thorough command of oral and writ- ten English. In addition to the general requirements stated before, Ph.D. students in Computer Science and Engineering or Technology Management are allowed to start their CPT only after they write their dissertation proposal and pass its oral defense (excluding CPT summer session). Ph.D. students in Computer Science and En- gineering or Technology Management are allowed to start their OPT only after the suc-cessful completion of the dissertation defense.INTERNSHIPS Internships provide work experience in the student's major field of study. Internships may or may not be paid accord- ing to the practice of the employment field. Internships increase motivation as studies become meaningful. Internship work experience develops ma-turity and a greater understanding of the demands of the student's career field. Internships provide the professional ex-perience that can lead to permanent em- ployment. Internships provide the student with the opportunity to network in their field be-fore graduation. Students with Internship experience be-fore graduation often start at higher level jobs and with higher pay than graduates without experience. STUDENT SALARIES Many students are able to combine a non-paid Internship position with a paid Co-Op work experience in a related field to earn not only a salary but exposure to more than one employment opportunity. ACADEMIC CREDITS Academic credit for Internship is awarded by the dean and faculty of the school offering the Internships. Most Internships earn 3 academic credits per term. ELIGIBILITY Students are eligible to participate in Intern-ships according to the course sequence de- scribed by their academic program of study. International students taking paid Internship positions must also have been in F-1 or J-1 visa status for a minimum of one academic year and have a thorough command of oral and written English. INTERNSHIP ASSIGNMENTS Arrangements for Internships may be made with the University Internship Director, the student's faculty advisor, or the Dean of the school.36University Library University Librarian: Deborah Dulepski Magnus Wahlstrom Library, Second Floor, Library Library, part of the University's Information Services, is centrally located on campus, occupying floor 1-4 of the Magnus Wahlstrom building.

The Office informs the University community of ongoing developments related to the institu- tion's international mission. The Office also oversees the English Language Institute and the Office for Study Abroad. It supports ini- tiatives such as the annual International Edu- cation Week, the International Festival and the work of the University's Internationaliza- tion Committee. Overseas Study The Office of Overseas Study assists student placements and maintains ties with interna- tional partners. Participants must be students in good standing at the University and they need the approval of their advisor who is ex- pected to review course selection with stu- dents to assure that students will still be able to graduate in a timely manner. Students are reminded that they must receive their final 30 credits at the University of Bridgeport in order to graduate with a University of Bridgeport degree. Therefore, they normally plan to study abroad in the Sophomore or Junior year. Students interested in studying overseas are encouraged to contact Brandon LaFavor at 203-576-2450. The Office, which operates from the College of Public and International Affairs in Carlson Hall, has facilitated over - seas study for UB students in a variety of venues including Brazil, Jordan, the United Kingdom, Australia, Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan and the United Arab Emirates. The Of- fice also overseas summer study opportuni-ties in Asia and in Latin America. The Office of Internationalization has also placed stu- dents in contact with other approved Ameri-can and overseas programs for international study. The Office provides students with written and web-based information on overseas studies.

In addi- tion, the School is responsible for those cours-es in composition, humanities, fine arts and natural sciences, mandated by the University's core curriculum. The School is committed to an interdisciplin- ary approach that it believes best prepares students for the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century, and for graduate school. The Biology Program is designed to prepare students for further study in graduate or pro- fessional schools, or for employment in edu-cation, industry, or governmental service. Students may follow a general biology cur - riculum or elect an option in pre-chiropractic, pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, pre-naturopathy, pre-veterinary, marine biology, or zoology. The General Studies Program gives adult learners, as well as traditional undergraduates, greater flexibility in completing their studies by offering broad areas of disciplinary con-centration in place of more traditional majors. Students use this option to pursue careers in business and social science and as a pre-pro-fessional degree. The First Year Studies Program develops, pro- motes, and administers programs and services for under prepared freshmen, who are given the opportunity to demonstrate their true abil- ity. Students remain in the program for one to four semesters depending on their level of achievement. They use the record they have compiled to transfer into their major of choice at the University. The Health Sciences Program prepares stu- dents for entry level positions in exercise and fitness, and in nutrition, as well as for advanced study in pharmacy, physician assis- tant, nursing, and other professional programs in the health sciences. The curriculum in this program includes basic foundation courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics as well as in required courses in philosophy and psychology. The Human Services Program combines theoretical coursework with fireld work ex-perience to prepare students for careers in human service agencies and community or - ganizations. The program requires students to 43supplement their course work in the human services and gerontology with courses in psy- chology, sociology, and related fields. The Literature and Civilization Program gives students a general foundation in the liberal arts while, at the same time, examining the connections within and between them. With- in this major, students may opt for a concen-tration in Creative Writing, English, History, Philosophy. The Mathematics Program is designed to pre- pare the student for graduate work in math-ematics and allied areas, industrial employ- ment, secondary school teaching, and careers in quantitative areas of biological and social sciences. The Medical Laboratory Science program pre- pares students for careers in a hospital labora- tory with opportunities for growth in research or molecular diagnostics. The MLS Program may also serve as a pre-med or pre-physician assistant training program. In addition to the specific medical laboratory science, biology, and chemistry courses required for the pro- gram, students will demonstrate competency in foundation courses in biology, chemistry, and mathematics as well as in required cours- es in philosophy and psychology. The Music Program offers three distinct four-year programs leading to the Bachelor of Music degree: Music Education, Perfor - mance, and Music Business. Music students are required to complete music foundation courses and one of the three concentrations. The Music Business concentration reflects the growing complexity of the commercial music scene. The Psychology Program gives students a knowledge of the general areas of develop- mental, personality, social, cognitive, and ab-normal psychology, preparing them for em- ployment in psychology and related fields or for further study in graduate programs. The program permits ancillary study in related subject areas in the human services, the hu- manities, the social sciences, and biology. The School provides courses in Physics and Chemistry in support of the University's Sci- ence and Engineering programs. Facilities The music programs are housed in the Arnold Bernhard Center which provides classroom, performance, and lecture hall space. Individ- ual students have access to spacious practice and recording areasThe Biology and Mathematics program are lo-cated in Dana Hall. Three floors are occupied by Biology, Physics, Chemistry, and Geology laboratories. Internships, Co-operative Programs and Professional Opportunities The School offers students a variety of options dependent on their major interests. In the Hu- manities programs there are opportunities for internships with state and local government organizations, newsprint and broadcast me- dia, advertising agencies, and related com- mercial interests. The University's proximity to New York City, the media, art, and design center of the United States and the site of many museums, foundations and research in-stitutes, offers students an exceptional variety of intellectual, cultural, and professional ex- periential learning possibilities. Our students are actively participating in summer programs in Biology, and working part-time in many corporate and consulting companies locally and nationally. Accreditation All degree programs in the School of Arts and Sciences are licensed and accredited by the State of Connecticut Office of Higher Educa- tion. Admission Criteria and Procedures A student is admitted to the majors in Arts and Sciences after an evaluation of the high school transcript, counselor recommendations, and SAT/ACT scores and has demonstrated poten-tial in analytical reasoning, comprehension, verbal expression and intellectual growth.

First Year Studies Program The First Year Studies Program (FYSP) is an academic unit which, utilizing a variety of support services, facilitates the transition of first-year students from high school to univer - sity life. Program advisors assist the students in the selection of appropriate courses while preparing them for admission into the major of their choice. The FYSP team attempts to foster within their students a spirit of intellectual curiosity, per - sonal responsibility, and commitment to aca- demic excellence. The FYSP is housed in the School of Arts and Sciences but is designed to prepare the under prepared student for majors in any of the Schools at the University of Bridgeport. The Program emphasizes strengthening study skills and awareness of college culture and protocol. Because these factors are essential for successful completion of a college degree, students in the FYSP must adhere to stringent academic and attendance guidelines. Support is provided in the form of intense advising, communication with the professors, and use, in some cases mandatory, of the Academic Resource Center. It is the goal of the First Year Studies Program to prepare its students for ac- ceptance into the desired majors by the time they successfully complete their first thirty credits.

The School prepares students for leadership and technology positions in industry, government, and academia and significantly contributes to the profession and community locally, nation-ally, and globally. The School offers a distinctive education in fundamental and emerging disciplines through its faculty and institutional partners. The edu- cation features an application-oriented ap-proach to interdisciplinary issues and oppor - tunities that balances theory with real world state-of-the-art practices. A stimulating environment, modern research laboratories, and distinguished programs at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels ensure that our graduates possess creative, innovative, and analytical skills with a strong commitment to research and technical excel-lence, ethical conduct, and cultural, societal, and global well-being. Undergraduate The Computer Engineering program prepares graduates for the practice of engineering at the entry level and helps graduates develop the ability to pursue a course of lifelong learning. A secondary aim is to provide a foundation for those interested in and qualified to pursue graduate studies. The program emphasizes a sound broad-based interdisciplinary technical education, with the integration of the practice of engineering design throughout the curricu- lum. The program in Computer Science pre- pares students to solve theoretical and applied problems relating to programming and pro- gramming applications. Acquiring both skills and fundamental knowledge is stressed in the curriculum. An additional goal is to provide students an excellent foundation for advanced study in graduate programs. The Electrical Engineering program prepares graduates to understand technology, particu-larly engineering principles and be able to com-municate these principles. They will understand the basics of classical Electrical Engineering. They will have the ability to design and ana-lyze electronic circuit diagrams. UB's Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) degree program combines in-depth studies with lab and project experience to help students ap- ply the principles of motion, force, energy, and materials for the design, development, analysis, manufacturing, testing and maintenance of me- chanical systems.

TIME LIMITATION AND PROGRAM CONTINUITY All requirements for the degree of Master of Science must be completed within six years (twelve consecutive semesters) of the effec-tive start of an approved graduate program of study. Once a program is initiated, the student must maintain continuous enrollment until completion. Under certain circumstances, a student may be granted permission to interrupt his/ her program by petitioning the Dean in writing, stating the underlying circumstances. Pro- gram interruption without formal permission will constitute grounds for dismissal from the Graduate School.School of Engineering52DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS All graduate students must have on file an ap- proved program of study on the form provid- ed. Programs of study are worked out between the student and his/her advisor to meet both the student's desires and the graduate faculty's philosophy of an integrated program. The pro- gram of study must carry the approval of the chair of the department awarding the degree. Changes in the approved program of study must be approved by the student's program advisor and the department Chair. ENGINEERING COLLOQUIUM REQUIREMENT All Engineering students are required to regis- ter for the Engineering Colloquia Series (ENGR 400) once during their course of study. Stu- dents are expected to register in their first se-mester. Students who do not pass the course are required to repeat the course in a subse- quent semester. GENERAL THESIS REGULATIONS MS Students are encouraged to include a the- sis investigation in their approved program of study. Accumulation of thesis semester hours and work done during a thesis investigation must be continuous up to the time of its com-pletion. Only those students designated as regular graduate students who have satisfied the following requirements will be permit-ted to accumulate thesis credits. During the semester prior to that in which the student desires to initiate his/her thesis investigation, he/she must have: 1. Included a thesis investigation in his/her approved program of study; 2. Sought and obtained a member of the graduate faculty who agrees to act as his/ her thesis advisor; 3. Submitted a completed thesis investigation form to the department in which the de-gree is to be awarded; 4. Obtained a Thesis Committee, appointed by the department chair, consisting of three members of the graduate faculty (in-cluding the advisor as committee chair). Students should obtain a copy of \"Specifica-tions for Master's Thesis\" from the office of the department chair which describes require- ments in detail. All theses in Engineering must be presented at a faculty-graduate seminar. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that this requirement is fulfilled, and that written notice of the presen-tation is distributed to all interested persons at least one week before the event. Students who are in the process of complet-ing a thesis are required to register for at least two semester hours of thesis in each semester, including summer, that they actively engage in that activity under faculty guidance. Semester hours thus accumulated that total more than the approved program of-study requirement are not counted toward the degree. This procedure does not apply to Electrical En- gineering, where students have up to 3 semes- ters (not counting the summer semester) to start and finish their project/thesis. For every semes-ter they are not registered for any credits, they must take ELEG 596 (seminar) for 1 credit. They do not take ELEG 596 in the summer semester, unless it is their last semester. Upon successful completion of the thesis, and acceptance by the Thesis Committee, provided all other requirements in the program of study are completed, the student becomes eligible for the degree. COMPLETION OF MASTER'S DEGREE The Master of Science degree will be awarded only to those students successfully complet-ing the following requirements: 1. A minimum of 31 semester hours (34 hours for Technology Management) with a QPR of \"B\" or better in an approved program of study. The number of semester hours which may be transferred from another in-stitution is an individual matter that will be reviewed by the major department, but is normally no more than 6 semester hours. 2. Satisfactory completion of the state licen-sure requirements as prescribed by the faculty of the major department, and a fa-vorable recommendation from the faculty upon review of the student's program and performance, after the student has made formal application for a Master's diploma. When the degree is completed with a thesis, a minimum of eight courses of three semester hours each are required for the Master of Sci-ence degree in Electrical Engineering or Me- chanical Engineering. For the Master of Science in Computer Science or Computer Engineer - ing, nine courses of three semester hours each plus six semester hours (minimum) of thesis are required. For the Master of Science degree in Technology Management, nine courses of three semester hours each plus six semester hours (minimum) of thesis are required; for students holding the Bachelor of Science in Manufacturing Engineering or Industrial En-gineering from an approved program, this re-quirement may be reduced to eight courses of three semester hours each, plus six semester hours (minimum) of thesis.COOPERATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM The School of Engineering offers an optional cooperative education program.

It serves a quarter of the world's population and has increased in public acceptance in the United States and Europe as the fastest grow- ing complementary health care field. TCM has gained this respect by being the most ancient written form of medical therapy known. For more information, call Dr. Jennifer Brett: (203) 576-4122 or 1-800-EXCEL-UB (1-800-392- 3582), ext. 4122 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which encompasses acupuncture, manual therapy, diet counseling, herbal therapies, exercise and breathing techniques, has been in use for thousands of years. Over the millennia, the Asian community has continuously refined this ancient healing art. During the last cen-tury, this refinement has included integration of Western medical sciences within the para- digm of TCM.MS-AC The development of the Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program integrates the medical concepts of both the East and West. The student will learn classical acupuncture and Traditional Chinese medical theory as well as up-to-date western bio-medical sci- ences. The Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program's goal is to provide acupuncture and Traditional Chinese medical training consis- tent with the developing traditions in Asia and the growing modern health care system in the United States. Having an opportunity to work alone and in conjunction with other health care practitio-ners in the Health Sciences Center, the stu- dents will be able to integrate the care of pa- tients with other health care providers. Thus, the student gains a \"real world\" advantage before entering private practice. MS-TCM The MS-TCM is a 4-year program during which the students are instructed in Chinese Herbol- ogy during three (3) of the four (4) years of training, after a first year of basic sciences, theory and diagnosis classes lay the founda- tion for understanding the art and science of a full range of TCM modalities. All foundational courses and clinical rotations from the MS-AC program are included in the MS-TCM. The nearly 3400-hours of training in Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine modalities, including excellent training in acupuncture, moxibus- tion, tui na as well as Chinese herbal studies is designed to produce graduates with exem-plary clinical skills. The clinical focus of this program is evident from the very first classes and permeates all the training in the MS-TCM program. The MS-TCM program is a residential pro- gram with students completing over 80% of their course work and 100% of their clinical rotations in residence. The ASIAN/CHINESE HERBOLOGY (ACH) courses will be offered in a blended format with 50% of the didac- tic program offered online and 50% during 4 weekends each semester, and an additional 3 weekends each summer for a total of 11 weekends a year. Students will participate in an online environment to complete their ASIAN/CHINESE HERBOLOGY studies. MS-CH The MS-CH program is a stand-alone program that will allow licensed health care profes-sionals to better understand Chinese Herbol- ogy and be able to safely utilize these herbal products. Currently, many healthcare professionals are able to prescribe herbal therapies (MDs, DOs, NDs, DCs, L.Acs) or work with herbal thera- pies (PharmDs). The MS-CH program is the only clinically-oriented systematic mas- ters-level program for health professionals in these therapies. The focus of this program is on not only clinical usage of Chinese herbal therapies but also on safety in the clinical set- ting while framing the clinical use of these herbs in the TCM tradition. The potential for issues associated with integrated care and drug-herb and nutrient-herb interactions are covered in detail within the MS-CH courses. The nearly 900-hours of training in Chinese herbal studies will produce graduates with exemplary clinical skills. The clinical focus of this program is evident from the very first classes and permeates all the training in the MS-CH program. D.TCM. The D.TCM is a 170-credit, 4-year program during which the students are instructed in both biomedicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The first year of studies fo-cuses on biomedicine and TCM theory and diagnosis classes which form the foundation for understanding the art and science of TCM modalities. The second and third years in- troduce students to the full panoply of TCM treatment modalities including acupuncture, Chinese herbology, dietetics, tui na, taijichuan and qigong. The last two years of training fo- cus on clinical rotations both on campus and off campus including training in integrated medical settings. The D-TCM program is designed to provide significant training in biomedicine and inte- grative medicine for those interested in pro- viding traditional Chinese medicine in primary care. Chinese medicine practitioners (L.Ac.s) play an important part in U.S. healthcare. The Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination against complementary and alternative medi- cine (CAM) practitioners, including acupunc- turists. UBAI is dedicated to ensuring that its graduate practitioners are included in all as- pects of healthcare, from the private office to hospitals and public health forums. UBAI's D-TCM program will help gradu- ates participate in a healthcare system that is multidisciplinary and enhances competence, 59mutual respect, and collaboration across all healthcare disciplines. The clinical program stresses a team-based approach to care. Degree Master of Science in Acupuncture (M.S.Ac.)

3956 COURSE IDENTIFICATION Course identification is as follows: APT: Acupuncture Practice and Techniques ATD: Asian Medicine Theory, Diagnosis and Ap- plication AHM: Herbal Medicine Theory AWB: Western Biomedicine AMR: Movement, Respiration and Bodywork Studies ACS: Clinical Services ACH: Chinese Herbal Therapies ACC: Chinese Herbal Clinic AIC: Integrated Clinical Practice The course numbering for the system is as fol- lows: 500 level - courses offered in year one 600 level - courses offered in year two700 level - courses offered in year three or four800 level - courses offered in the fourth year of the doctoral program The second digit identifies the semester the course is given in that academic year. The third digit indicates the area. E.g.: APT 524 APT: Acupuncture Practice and Techniques 5 - year one2 - second semester 4 - fourth course in the area sequence Grades Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa- tions. Grades earned are on a four (4) point scale with a grade of \"A\" or 4 quality points being the highest grade attained. Grades with quality points are: GRADE QUALITY POINTS A 4.0 B+ 3.5 B 3.0 C+ 2.5C 2.0 D 1.0 F 0.0The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semes-ter hours into the number of points earned. Transfer credits are not included in this com- putation. Administrative Grades In addition to the academic grades submit-ted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized. I: The grade of Incomplete \"I\" is used by the faculty to indicate that a student has not completed all course require- ments. A student will have one week from the first day of the next term to meet with the faculty and complete all course requirements unless other arrangements are made with either the faculty member or the program Director prior to the end of the term in which the course was taken. Upon completion of the course requirements the faculty will submit the earned grade. Failure by the student to meet with the faculty and complete the re- quirements in one week from the first day of the next term will result in a grade of \"I\" being converted to a grade of \"F\". Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will be required to register for and re- take that course in its entirety when the course is regularly scheduled. Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be able to register for courses for which that course is a prerequisite. R: Students may repeat a course at any grade level below an \"A\". The first re-peat will replace the first-time grade for the computation of the QPR. TCR: This indicates transfer credit granted for equivalent work completed at an-other accredited institution. W: Withdrawal grades are assigned on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of-registration period, that course does not appear on the stu- dent's transcript. 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change-of-registration period, but before the end of the official with- drawal period, a grade of \"W\" is as-Acupuncture Institute68signed and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR and do not count towards \"hours attempted.\" 3. The names of students who have officially withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the bal-ance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, in- cluding late withdrawals, must be approved by the Director and the Provost before they become official and are recorded. Poor academic performance does not constitute a valid reason for late withdrawal. Academic Policies ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS Each student is expected to attend all lectures, laboratories and other activities associated with the total completion of a given course. A student who is absent from class in excess of ten percent of the total class hours may have his or her grade reduced for lack of partici- pation as outlined in the course syllabus. A student absent in excess of twenty percent of the total class hours will receive a grade of \"F.\" Requirements for Graduation - MS- AC In order to be eligible for graduation from the Acupuncture Institute program, candidates must meet the following criteria: 1.

No student will graduate from the pro- gram who has not resolved all financial obligations with the University of Bridge- port GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING Good academic standing is achieved when a student is maintaining good grades, has met all financial responsibilities to the Acupuncture Institute degree program, and is not guilty of any breach of standards governing ethical and clinical conduct. ACADEMIC PROBATION Academic probation occurs when the student's cumulative grade point average falls below the required grade point average of 2.9 or if a stu- dent receives one grade of \"F\" or two or more grades of \"D\" during a single semester. A stu- dent who is on academic probation is not in good academic standing and is not eligible to Acupuncture Institute69carry a full academic course load. ACADEMIC REMEDIATION A student who is on Academic Probation will be placed in a program of Academic Reme- diation and will be required to meet with the Director of the Institute. Academic Reme-diation requires a student to carry a reduced academic load. Students will be permitted to convert grades of \"D\" or \"F\" only by retaking the course the next time it is offered by the Acupuncture Institute. Successful completion of a program of aca- demic remediation requires a student to pass each repeated course with a \"C\" or better and have earned a cumulative GPA (CGPA) of 2.9 or better. A student who has not earned a CGPA of 2.9 or better upon one semester of remediation but has shown substantial improvement in his or her course work will be allowed one more semester of remediation in order to achieve the CGPA of 2.9. A student in a program of academic remediation may ask the Director for a written definition of a minimum CGPA, or range of CGPA, which would be deemed to be substantial improvement, and for a written calculation of the semester of remediation GPA which would be necessary to achieve in order to bring the student's CGPA into the range of substantial improvement. In such event the student shall countersign the written statement and deliver a copy of the signed document to the Director. A student may not graduate with a grade of \"D\" on their transcript. Grades of \"D\" may not remain on the student's transcript for more than one year and must be remediated by re- peating the course and receiving a grade of \"C\" or better. This is not a limitation for the instructor, but rather a requirement to pass each course so that students have the appro-priate level of proficiency to pass the NCCTCM Board Exams and become licensed acupunc- turists. A student may remediate a grade only by retaking the course before graduation. If the student does not pass the course with a \"C\" or better, the student will be on Academic Probation and will be required to speak with the Director of the Acupuncture Institute be- fore registering for any new classes. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student who after one semester of remedia-tion does not show substantial improvement in his or her academic performance or after two semesters of academic remediation does not achieve a CGPA of 2.9 will be academically dismissed from the acupuncture program. Academic dismissal may also occur if a stu- dent's CGPA falls below 2.9, or if the student receives one \"F' or two grades of \"D\" in one semester on a second occasion. Upon com- pletion of the first semester, any student not achieving at least a 2.9 GPA will be academi- cally dismissed from the program. DISMISSAL FROM THE ACUPUNCTURE INSTITUTE Academic inadequacies are not the only rea- son for dismissal from the Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program. The following is a list of additional causes for dismissal: 1. Failure to meet generally accepted stan-dards of ethical and professional con- duct and clinical practice. Such dismissal is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration as es- tablished by the Director of the UBAI. 2. Pleading \"Guilty\" or \"No Contest\", or be- ing found guilty of any crime involving moral turpitude; in the event of a pre- existing or new felony the Institute shall have the right to impose sanctions, in- cluding but not limited to dismissal, on a case by case basis. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or demonstration of behavior that creates safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. Dismissal of this nature is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration as es-tablished by the Director of the Institute. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the University of Bridge-port Acupuncture Institute. The Institute shall have the right to suspend any student from any or all privileges of a stu- dent in good standing during the pendency of any proceeding pursuant to the foregoing until such time as all University procedures are terminated. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM: If a student withdraws or wishes to take a leave of absence from the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute and is in good standing he or she is eligible for readmission. A student who withdraws when not in good academic standing or, who leaves without officially withdrawing seriously jeopardizes his or her chances of future readmission or admission to other acupuncture Institutes. If a student withdraws or takes a leave of ab- sence with plans to reenter at a later date, he or she should make this clear at the time of withdrawal. Please note: All requirements for the mas- ter's degree in Acupuncture (MS-AC) must be completed within five (5) years from the first matriculation to graduation. All requirements for the master's degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine (MS-TCM) must be completed within seven (7) calendar years from the first matricu- lation to graduation. All requirements for the doctoral degree in Traditional Chinese Medi-cine (D.TCM) must be completed within eight (8) calendar years from the first matriculation to graduation. If a student withdraws one or more times from the program, the cumulative absences must not exceed two years. Former University of Bridgeport Naturopathic and Chiropractic students who started acu- puncture training as a combined-degree stu- dent during their professional training who then took a leave of absence or withdrew from the acupuncture institute must demon- strate competency through examination for all work completed prior to withdrawal from the program, with the exception of the basic sci- ence (\"AWB\"-designated) courses, upon read-mission to the program. All such previously completed coursework will then be treated as transfer credit and the time frame for comple-tion of the MS-Acup degree will be 4 years (48 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program; and the time frame for com-pletion of the MS-TCM degree will be 5 years (60 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program. If a student wishes to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, he or she must submit a letter to the Director stating the reason for withdrawal. The student must also complete all required paperwork from the Registrar's of-fice. In addition, the student should also note if he/she plans to re-enter the program and the term (Fall/Spring year) of such re-matric- ulation. READMISSION TO THE PROGRAM To be considered for readmission to the pro-gram after withdrawal or leave of absence, write to the Assistant Director of the Institute requesting readmission and indicate the date of re-entry desired. It is important to do this Acupuncture Institute70well in advance of the proposed date of read- mission.

Applications will be accepted each year until the class has been filled.Acupuncture Institute71Notification of Acceptance Applicants will be notified in writing of the de- cision of the Admissions Committee as soon as a decision is made. Transfer Credit Policy Students may apply to have some of the train- ing required by the Acupuncture Institute for graduation transferred from another acupunc- ture degree-granting program, or an accred-ited school of post-graduate medical training. Transfer credit will be assessed by the Insti- tute Director and is only awarded for courses similar in content and length, and with instruc-tors similarly qualified as those given by the Acupuncture Institute. Students requesting transfer credit must provide an official course transcript, a school catalog and, if requested, a course syllabus for any course for which trans- fer credit is requested. Documentation of the transfer of credit awarded, and the institution from which transfer credit was awarded are kept in the student files. No less than 20 clini-cal credits and 14 didactic class credits must be completed at the Acupuncture Institute for the student to be eligible for graduation and the granting of the MS-Acupuncture and MS-Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine degrees. All students, including transfer students, must complete the Clinical Entrance Exam with a score of no less than 75%, the Clinical Exit Exam and all practi- cal clinical examinations with a grade of 70% or better to be eligible for graduation. An applicant's credits from another Institute may be considered for transfer only under the following conditions: 1. The applicant must meet current pre-requisites in force at the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute at the time the student originally enrolled at the health profession institution from which the transfer is being made, regardless of having been accepted to the institu-tion from which they are transferring. In many cases, University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute's requirements are higher than those for other acupuncture related professional schools. 2. Be courses for a student majoring in the medical sciences, acupuncture or TCM medicine 3. The institution from which the student is transferring must be acceptable to the Admissions Committee of the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, such as another acupuncture degree-granting program, or an accredited school of post-graduate medical training. 4. The credits being transferred must be equivalent in credit hours content and quality to that of the University of Bridge- port Acupuncture Institute. If the Univer - sity of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute course contains a laboratory so must the course being considered for transfer. In order to verify equivalence, students may be required to provide a course descrip- tion or course syllabus for comparison. 5. Only credits with a grade of \"C\" (2.00 on a 4.00 scale) or better are considered for transfer. Transfer credit is credit only; the transferred grade will not affect the QPR. 6. In order to obtain transfer credit the stu-dent must have graduated or have been granted an honorable withdrawal from the professional or graduate school at- tended. 7. To receive transfer credit for any courses taken 3 or more years prior to entering the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, and for any course completed during an apprenticeship or other non- traditional or non-accredited learning en- vironment, the student must demonstrate competency through examination. The passing grade for such exams is 75%. 8. Credits used to satisfy the minimum pre- requisites for admission must not be used for advanced placement credit. 9. All international transcripts and course descriptions must be evaluated by an ap-proved foreign credential evaluation ser - vice. Transfer Credit - D.TCM The D-TCM degree program will not be ac-cepting direct transfer credit. Because a first doctoral level degree is new to the field of acupuncture in the US, all students seeking advanced standing will have to have knowl- edge of specific subjects assessed through a combination of challenge exams and portfolio review. Each challenge exam carries an exam fee of $85. Portfolio reviews require an accepted student to take a course in portfolio construc-tion and then pay $85 for each course that is being challenged through the portfolio review. No more than 90 credits may be transferred into the D-TCM program from outside institu- tions.Advanced Standing Students who are accepted as transfer students may receive advanced standing if a substantial number of semester hours have been accepted by University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Insti-tute. This may enable the student to complete either the MS-ACUP program in less than six semesters, or the MS-TCM degree in less than eight semesters. Transfer credit may be grant- ed either with or without advanced standing. If advanced standing is granted: No more than 84 credits may transfer from an- other institution of acupuncture or TCM medi- cine for the MS-ACUP degree. No more than 110 credits may transfer from another institu- tion of acupuncture or TCM medicine for the MS-TCM degree. No more than 90 credits may be transferred into the D-TCM program from outside institutions. No less than 20 clinical credits and 14 didactic class credits must be completed at the Acu- puncture Institute for a student to be eligible for graduation and the granting of the MS-Acu- puncture or MS-Traditional Chinese Medicine degree. No less than 25 clinical credits and 50 didactic class credits must be completed at the Acupuncture Institute for a student to be eligible for graduation and the granting of the Doctorate in Traditional Chinese Medicine degree. All students, including transfer students, must complete the Clinical Entrance Exam with a score of no less than 75%, the Clinical Exit Exam and all practical clinical examinations with a grade of 70% or better to be eligible for graduation. Advanced standing in the Acupuncture Insti- tute requires evaluation of official transcripts and course descriptions from the institution of higher learning where the student received his or her training as described in Transfer Credit above. Foreign students must have their transcripts evaluated by a foreign transcript evaluating services, such as World Educational Services (WES). A special curriculum sched- ule will be made up for the student based on semester hours transferred and course avail- ability. Tuition will be calculated based on the num- ber of credits being taken per semester multi- plied by the single credit fee at the time of the student's attendance. If advanced standing is not granted, but some semester hours are transferable, the student will be admitted to the first semester and will be exempt from courses for which transfer Acupuncture Institute72credit was granted. Former University of Bridgeport students in the other graduate-level health sciences pro- grams who started acupuncture training as a combined-degree student during their profes- sional training who then took a leave-of ab- sence or withdrew from the Acupuncture In-stitute must demonstrate competency through examination for all work completed prior to withdrawal from the program, with the excep-tion of the basic science (\"AWB\"-designated) courses, upon readmission to the program. All such previously completed coursework will then be treated as transfer credit and the time frame for completion of the MS- Acupuncture degree program will be four (4) years (48 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program; and the time frame for completion of the MS-Traditional Chinese Medicine degree program will be five (5) years (60 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program. Evaluation of advanced standing is completed by the Director of the Acupuncture Institute. Upon request, a letter is sent to the student, with a copy available in the student file, of all coursework which is acceptable for trans- fer credit. The transfer credit grades will not appear on official transcripts from the Univer - sity of Bridgeport and the grades from those classes will not affect a student's GPA. Course prerequisites must be completed by all students, including those taking courses as auditors, before admission to a course will be granted. Exceptions may be made by permis- sion of the Director under the following spe- cial circumstances: 1. A student has skills equivalent to comple-tion of the pre-requisites from non-tradi- tional training or experience (i.e.: in an apprenticeship). Students may request a waiver from completing the prerequisites before taking more advanced courses. Students will have to complete all such courses or demonstrate competency through examination before graduation from the Acupuncture Institute. 2. A University of Bridgeport Health Scienc- es graduate student requires special skills for an outreach clinic setting (e.g.: clean needle technique and auricular acupunc- ture for NADA-style detox treatments).Transfer of Credit for Foreign Health Profession Institutions To be eligible for transfer of credits, applicants from foreign acupuncture, medical, chiroprac- tic, osteopathic or dental institutions located in countries that do not have an accredita-tion system equivalent to those of the United States, must submit evidence of proficiency in all work submitted for advance standing cred-it. Credits from foreign Institutes and universi- ties must have transcript evaluation performed by a reputable transcript evaluation service. To receive advanced-standing for courses taken 3 or more years prior to entering the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, and for any course completed during an ap- prenticeship or other non-traditional or non- accredited learning environment, the student must demonstrate competency through exami- nation. The passing grade for such exams is 75%.Acupuncture Institute73College of Chiropractic Dean: Michael Ciolfi Elenore Dana (203) 576-4483 E-mail: mciolfi@bridgeport.edu Associate Dean: Telephone: (203) 576-4336 Fax: (203) 576-4351 E-mail: psherman@bridgeport.edu Associate Dean, Anthony Sciences Street Telephone: Chiropractic is the philosophy, art, and sci- ence which concerns itself with the relation- ship between structure and function of the human body, as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health. The College of Chiropractic prepares stu-dents to be primary health care providers. Each student is educated to diagnose, to care for the human body, to understand and re-late fundamental scientific information, and to consult with, or refer to other health care providers. The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic is a non-profit, coeducational pro- fessional institution which grants the Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree to graduates who successfully complete four academic years of study including a clinical internship. The program is offered on a full-time basis with no students admitted to a part-time course of study. There are no correspon-dence courses offered. All requirements for the D.C. degree must be completed with-in seven years from the dated of matriculation. Degree Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.)Accreditation & Membership The doctor of chiropractic degree program of the University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the Council on Chiropractic Education, 8049 N. 85th Way, Scottsdale, AZ 85258, 480-443-8877. The College of Chiro- practic is also a member of the Association of Chiropractic Colleges. Mission Statement Provide a comprehensive, full-time educa-tion that prepares qualified candidates to become doctors of chiropractic. Present a clinically relevant and integrated curriculum that is evidenced-influenced in regard to basic sciences, chiropractic prin-ciples and related health sciences. To adhere to a curriculum that emphasizes: The body is an integrated unit; The body has intrinsic self-regulating and healing mechanisms; Structure and function are interrelated; The neuromusculoskeletal system can effect the functioning of other body sys- tems and, in turn, can be affected by these systems. Produce graduates who will be competent to practice as portal of entry chiropractic physi-cians, providing diagnostic services, health services, humanistic care and conservative methods of therapeutics to assist patients in achieving health and wellness. Advance chiropractic and its knowledge base through scholarship and research. Provide opportunities for faculty, students and staff to engage in activities which ser - vice the needs of the chiropractic profession and the public. Provide for continuous improvement and quality of our programs through assessment, and by fostering an atmosphere of knowl-edge, growth and open discussions. Curriculum A Doctor of Chiropractic is a physician whose purpose is to meet the health needs of the public as a member of the healing arts. He/she gives particular attention to the relationship of structural and neurological aspects of the body and is educated in the basic and clinical sciences as well as in re-lated health subjects. Chiropractic science concerns itself with the relationship between structure (primarily the spine), and function (primarily coordinated by the nervous sys- tem) of the human body as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health.. \"The DCP of the University of Bridgeport incorporates the understanding of chiro-practic as a profession practicing primary health care, provides curricular and clinical evidence of that through outcome measures, and consists of education and training to prepare graduates to: A. Practice direct contact health care as a portal-of-entry provider for patients of all ages and genders; B. Assess the patient's general health sta-tus, complaints and problems leading to a diagnosis. Specific elements of patient assessment minimally include complete health history; review of systems; physi- cal, biomechanical and neurological ex- amination; the analysis of vertebral and extra-vertebral subluxation; and, when clinically indicated, diagnostic imaging, clinical laboratory, and/or specialized di-agnostic procedures; C. Develop a goal-oriented case manage-ment plan that addresses any sublux-ations or other neurobiomechanical prob- lems, and that may include rehabilitation and/or other therapeutic modalities; D. Develop appropriate doctor/patient re- lationships with continuity in the chiro- practic management of health problems, and coordination of care with other health-care providers; and E. Promote wellness by assessing health risk and providing problem-related, general and public health information, and life- style counseling. The purpose of chiropractic professional ed- ucation is to provide the student with a core of knowledge in the basic and clinical sci- ences and related health subjects sufficient to perform the professional obligations of a doctor of chiropractic. A doctor of chiropractic is a primary care physician whose purpose as a practitioner of the healing arts, is to help meet the health needs of individual patients and of the pub- lic, giving particular attention to the struc- tural and neurological aspects of the body. The application of science in chiropractic concerns itself with the relationship between 74structure, primarily the spine, and function, primarily coordinated by the nervous sys- tem of the human body, as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health. Further, this application of science in chi- ropractic focuses on the inherent ability of the body to heal without the use of drugs or surgery. As a gatekeeper for direct access to the health delivery system, the doctor of chiropractic's responsibilities as a primary care physician include wellness promotion, health promo-tion, health assessment, diagnosis and the chiropractic management of the patient's health care needs. When indicated, the doc-tor of chiropractic consults with, co-manag- es, or refers to other health care providers.\" ( From the Council on Chiropractic Education Standards for Doctor of Chiropractic Pro- grams, January 2007) It is the purpose of the University of Bridge- port College of Chiropractic program to offer as a minimum those courses and objectives as suggested in the CCE standards. It is also the purpose of the UBCC program to offer a broad-based educational experience. In many cases, the educational program pre-sented will go beyond the course offerings suggested by CCE and will also go beyond individual state laws and scope of practice. The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic curriculum is divided into three phases: Basic Sciences, Clinical Sciences, and Clinical Services. Basic Sciences The basic Science curriculum instructs stu-dents in Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Public Health, and Pathology. These courses are offered primarily during the first two years of a student's education. It is the purpose of this aspect of the pro- gram for students to develop an understand-ing of both normal and abnormal structure and function, homeostatic mechanisms, and to gain a foundation upon which the clinical sciences will be built. Clinical Sciences Students from their first semester onward are instructed in the Clinical Sciences. Course offerings include: Chiropractic History, Chi- ropractic Principles and Practice, Diagnosis, Radiology, Technique Procedures, Nutrition, and Physiological Therapeutics and Reha-bilitation Procedures. Students are given in- depth training in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Practical hands-on training is in- cluded beginning in Semester I and continu-ing to graduation. Information from the basic science curriculum is integrated into the clin- ical science course offerings and is a founda-tion upon which the clinical science courses build. Many of the clinical science courses have as a prerequisite successful completion of the basic science courses. Clinical Services The Clinical Services phase of the curricu-lum is the last and most important aspect of the UBCC program. Interns at the Col- lege's Chiropractic Health Center care for patients under the supervision and direction of licensed doctors of chiropractic. To be eligible for this part of the curriculum, stu-dents must be in good academic standing, successfully completed all courses in Semes- ters I thru V, and successfully completed the clinic services entrance examination. During the Clinical Services portion of the program students will continue to receive training in the clinical sciences. They will also continue to be evaluated during their internship in or - der to remain eligible for clinical services. To continue in Clinical Services, students must remain in good academic standing. Towards the completion of the Clinical Services pro-gram students will be administered a clini- cal competency examination which must be successfully completed prior to graduation. Because each course is integrated with other course offerings, students should be aware of the prerequisite and corequisite require-ments. Throughout the curriculum every effort is made to insure the relevance of information to chiropractic principles and practice. The following is a breakdown, by subject, of the time devoted to each area of study within the curriculum. Licensure Requirements and Career Opportunities LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS The Doctor of Chiropractic degree program offered by the University of Bridgeport Col- lege of Chiropractic is accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education. As in-dicated in a previous section, the college meets or exceeds the minimum educational requirements suggested by the CCE. Students who receive the Doctor of Chiropractic de- gree from UBCC are eligible for licensure in all states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Canadian Provinces and other foreign coun- tries as regulated by local laws and regula- tions without restrictions. Licensure in many states require students to complete Parts I, II, III, and Physiotherapy examination as of- fered by the National Board of Chiroprac-tic Examiners (NBCE). Additionally, states also require that students pass the Part IV Practical Examination offered by the NBCE. Students should contact the NBCE or the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards (FCLB) for additional information pertaining to licensure where they wish to practice. The College maintains a directory published by FCLB in the library as well as within various offices located in the College of Chiroprac- tic. The directory contains information per - taining to licensure and to scope of practice within each state. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Approximately ninety (90%) percent of the students who have entered the UBCC have completed the requirements for graduation as outlined in this catalog. Most graduates of UBCC go directly into a private practice of their own. Other graduates work as an associate with an experienced doctor or they may rent space within an existing practice.

The third digit indicates the sequence within that discipline. e.g. AN 511 AN - Anatomy 5- year one 1- semester one 1 - first course in discipline sequence Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa-tions. Grades earned are on a four (4) point scale with an \"A\" or 4 quality points being the highest grade attained. Grades with qual-ity points are: GRADE QUALITY POINTS A 4.0 C 2.0 B+ 3.5 D 0.0 B 3.0 F 0.0 C+ 2.5 The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semester hours into the number of points earned. A grade of \"D\" is not an acceptable passing grade. Transfer credits are not in- cluded in this computation. In addition to the Academic Grades submit- ted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized. Administrative Grades I The grade of Incomplete \"I\", is used by the faculty to indicate that a stu- dent has not completed all course re- quirements. A student will have one week from the last day of the term to meet with the faculty and complete all College of Chiropractic77course requirements. Upon comple- tion of the course requirements the faculty will submit the earned grade. Failure by the student to meet with the faculty and complete the requirements in one week from the last day of the term will result in the grade of \"I\" be-ing converted to a grade of \"F.\" Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will be required to register and retake that course in it's entirety when the course is regularly scheduled. Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be eligible to register for courses for which that course is a prerequisite. R Students may repeat a course at any grade level below \"A\". The first repeat will replace the first-time grade for the computation of the QPR. TCR This indicates transfer credit granted for equivalent work completed at an- other accredited institution. W Withdrawal grades are assigned based on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of- registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change-of-reg- istration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR and do not count toward \"hours attempted.\" 3. The names of students who have official-ly withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, including late withdrawals, must be approved by the Dean and the Provost before they be- come official and are recorded. Poor aca- demic performance does not constitute a valid reason for late withdrawal. Academic policies used to manage and di- rect the academic program are: 1. Attendance Requirements 2. Requirements for Graduation 3. Good Academic Standing 4. Academic Warning, Probation and Dismissal 5. Dismissal from the College (Non-Academic) 6. Withdrawal from the Program 7. Readmission to the Program Attendance Requirements Each student is expected to attend all lec- tures and laboratories and other activities as- sociated with the total completion of a given course. A student who is absent from class in excess of ten percent of the total class hours may have his or her grade reduced for lack of participation as outlined in the course syl- labus. A student absent in excess of twenty present of the total class hours will receive a grade of \"F.\" Requirements for Graduation In order to be eligible for graduation from the College, candidates must meet the fol- lowing criteria: 1. Have successfully completed a minimum of four academic years of resident study in an accredited institution granting a first professional degree. The last 3 semesters must have been in residence at the Uni- versity of Bridgeport College of Chiro- practic. A student must complete at least 25% of the program to qualify for a UBCC degree and have completed all require- ments within 7 years of matriculations. 2. Have successfully completed all require-ments of the educational program and have achieved a 2.50 cumulative grade point average. 3. Have successfully passed parts I and II of the National Board of Chiropractic Exam- iners. 4. Have been recommended for graduation by the College Faculty and Administration. 5. Have satisfactorily met all financial obli-gations to the College, Office of Financial Aid, publication of the class yearbook and commencement exercises. Satisfactory Academic Progress Students enrolled in the UBCC Doctor of Chiropractic degree program are in good academic standing and are making satisfac- tory academic progress, if they have success-fully achieved the following criteria upon completion of their most recent semester of course work: 1. Did not receive a grade of \"F or D\" in any course, and2. Maintain a cumulative grade point aver - age of 2.50 or better. A student who has not achieved the above criteria is not making satisfactory academic progress and will be required to follow the criteria as outlined in the catalog regarding Academic Probation and Dismissal. Good Academic Standing Good academic standing is achieved when a student is maintaining good grades, has met all financial responsibilities to the College and is not guilty of any breach of the standards governing ethical and clinical conduct. ACADEMIC WARNING, PROBATION AND DISMISSAL Safeguards have been built into the system to protect students who are not performing well academically from suffering academic failure. During the semester, the faculty re-ports to the Dean on a regular basis, con- cerning the grades of all students in their courses. If it is noted that particular students are doing poorly, these students will be con-tacted to set up an interview. The interview will consist of a discussion of the causes for the student's poor performance and ways in which he or she might improve a grade. ACADEMIC WARNING Academic warning will result when the fol-lowing is taking place: 1. The most recent semester quality point ra- tio falls below a 2.00. ACADEMIC PROBATION Academic Probation occurs when the stu- dent's QPR falls below 2.50 or if a student receives a grade of \"F or D\" in one or more courses. A student on academic probation is not eligible to carry a full academic course load. ACADEMIC REMEDIATION A student on academic probation will be placed in a program of Academic Remedia- tion. The student is required to meet with the Associate Dean of the College to deter - mine what courses will be retaken to satisfy the requirements of Remediation. In general, academic Remediation requires a student to repeat all grades of \"F or D\", carry a reduced academic load.College of Chiropractic78ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student who does not show substantial academic improvement after one semester of Remediation, or who is unable to achieve a QPR of 2.50 after two semester of Reme-diation will be dismissed from the College of Chiropractic. Academic dismissal may also occur if a stu- dent's QPR falls below a 2.50 on a second occasion. Any student not achieving a QPR of at least 1.75 upon completion of the first semester of study will be academically dismissed from the College of Chiropractic. DISMISSAL FROM THE COLLEGE Academic inadequacies are not the only rea-sons for dismissal from the College or Uni- versity. The following is a list of additional causes for dismissal: 1. Failure to meet the generally accepted standards of ethical conduct and clinical practice. Dismissal of this nature is sub- ject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 2. Pleading guilty or \"nolo contende,\" or be- ing found guilty of any crime involving moral turpitude or being felonious in na- ture. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or the demonstration of behavior that creates safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. Dismissal of this nature is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the College or University. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM If a student withdraws from University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic in good standing he or she is eligible for readmission. A student who withdraws when not in good academic standing or, who leaves without officially withdrawing, seriously jeopardizes his or her chances of future readmission. If a student withdraws with plans to re-enter at a later date, he or she should make this clear at the time of withdrawal. All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within seven years from the first matriculation to graduation. If a stu-dent withdraws one or more times from the program, the cumulative absences must not exceed three and one half years.READMISSION TO THE PROGRAM To be readmitted to the program after with-drawal, a student must write to the Associ- ate Dean for Academic Affairs requesting readmission and indicate the date of re-entry desired. It is important to do this well in ad- vance of such a date. Minimum Requirements for Admission The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic does not discriminate on the ba- sis of sex, age, color, creed, ethnic origin or handicap in the administration of its educa-tion programs or on admissions. All candidates for admission must furnish proof of having acquired three years (90 ac-ceptable semester hours or more) of study, creditable towards a baccalaureate degree, taken in accredited, degree-granting institu-tions. Pre-professional education acquired must have been completed with a minimum cumulative Quality Point Ratio of 2.50 on a 4.00 scale. A baccalaureate degree is recom- mended. All candidates must have completed the fol- lowing specific courses as part of their pre- professional preparation: Communication/Language Skills 6 Semester Hours Psychology 3 Semester Hours Chemistry: General and Organic (w/ Lab) 12 Semester Hours General: 3 semester hours minimum Organic: 9 semester hours minimum Electives (Social Sciences/Humanities) 15 Semester Hours General Bio/Anat & Phys (w/ Lab) 8 Semester Hours (2 consecutive courses) General Physics (w/ Lab) and related Studies 8 Semester Hours All bio/anat & phys, chemistry and physics courses must: Be courses suitable for students majoring in sciences.

For Admission beginning with the fall 2003, all matriculants must furnish proof of having earned a minimum of 30 semester hours in upper division credits. A personal interview is required. Under ex- tenuating circumstances a telephone inter - view will be granted. Applicants must understand that possession of minimum entrance requirements does not constitute a guarantee of acceptance. Each entering class is selected from a large pool of eligible candidates, a majority of whom have completed four-year degrees. Those students selected for acceptance usually have ob- tained grades which are substantially higher than the minimum requirement. Physical Qualifications for Admissions The following physical qualifications are re- quired for participation in the doctoral degree program at the UB College of Chiropractic. These qualifications are essential for the preparation of the Doctor of Chiropractic. Stu- dents at the College must be able to perform at a high level of competency in all phases of classroom, clinic, and laboratory activities as they will ultimately use the knowledge at-tained as Doctors of Chiropractic. The qualifications are as follows: 1. The student must possess the coordina- tion and use of both upper limbs as their use is required for, among other skills, the performance of the chiropractic ad-justment, the primary skill of a practicing Doctor of Chiropractic. 2. The student must possess manual dexter - ity so that he/she may perform in the var - ious clinical, chiropractic, and basic sci-ence laboratories without posing a threat to him/herself, patients, or his/her fellow students' safety and well-being. 3. The student must have the ability to stand not only in the performance of manipula- tive procedures but others as well. 4. The student must have hearing and visual senses, appropriately assisted if needed, acute enough to individually record pa- tient histories, to provide routine safety in- structions, and perform stethoscopic and other ausucultatory examinations, to read all forms of diagnostic imaging, and to perform microscopy examinations so that College of Chiropractic79he/she can adequately interpret normal, abnormal, and pathological changes. Handicapped persons will not be summarily denied admission, nor will higher scholastic requirements be demanded of them. They, like all other students, must carry out class-room, laboratory, and clinical assignments, including microscopic work, x-ray interpreta- tion and techniques, or the equivalent; pass written, oral, and practical examinations and meet all the requirements of the College. Cancellation of Admission or RegistrationThe college reserves the right to cancel the admission or registration of individuals whose attendance at the college, in the opin- ion of the appropriate administrative officers and dean, is not mutually beneficial to that person and to the institution. Individuals who have registered at other ed- ucational institutions may not disregard such records and make application on the basis of high school and selected college transcripts. Applicants who gain admission to the college on the basis of incomplete or fraudulent cre- dentials or misrepresentations in their written application for admission may have their: admission and registration canceled with- out refund of any fees; and total credits rescinded that have been earned following such admissions;and future registration at the college prohib- ited. Pre-Professional Requirements for Licensure It is most important that all candidates for admission thoroughly investigate the specif- ic requirements of each state in which they plan to practice. In some cases, pre-profes-sional requirements must be completed prior to entrance into a chiropractic program in order to be qualified to apply for a state li-censing examination. International Applicants International Applicants must complete an Application for International Students as well as an Application to the College of Chiro- practic. Applicants who have done pre-professional study in foreign countries must submit of-ficial copies of the records of such study as well as translations if the original records are not in English. Usually, these records must be evaluated by an appropriate professional agency. Any fees charged by such an agency are the responsibility of the student. Follow- ing submission of these documents to UBCC, the Director of Admissions will make contact with the prospective student. If the applicant is a native of a foreign coun- try, he or she must demonstrate proficiency in English at a level appropriate for ad-vanced study. At a minimum proficiency can be demonstrated in one of the ways listed below: 1. A score of 550 or better on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) AND a score of 50 or better on the Test of Spoken English(TSE). Information on the TOEFL/TSE can be obtained from TOEFL, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, NJ 08541-6151, USA or; 2. Receipt of a grade \"C\" or better in one semester of English at an accredited U.S. college or university or; 3. A letter showing successful completion of the University of Bridgeport's English Language Institute. Application Procedures Application for admission must include: 1. A properly completed Application for Ad- mission form. 2. Application Fee. The applicant must provide the following to the Director of Admissions: 1. Official transcripts of all college records. 2. Three letters of recommendation, one must be from a health care professional. Selection of Candidates The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic is coeducational and does not dis- criminate against any applicant on the basis of sex, race, creed, color or national origin. (Title VI, Civil Rights Act 1964) All eligible finalists are invited for a personal interview before any action is taken upon their application. Among the qualities typical of most success- ful candidates for admission, the following are especially important: 1. Superior communication skills, both oral and written. 2. Evidence of strong motivation to becom-ing a helping professional and, more spe-cifically, a chiropractor. 3. Initiative and honesty as evidenced in the candidates' transactions within the ap- plication process and in all information submitted in support of the application. 4. Academic achievement which compares favorably with that of successful students at the University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic. Application Deadlines Applications for admission may be submit-ted at any time. NOTIFICATION OF ACCEPTANCE Applicants will be notified in writing of the decision of the Admissions Committee as soon as a decision is made. Transfer Students Transfer Credit The University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic may grant transfer credit for courses taken in accredited professional and graduate schools. In doing so, the following requirements must be met: 1. The courses taken must have content equivalent to courses given at UBCC. lf the UBCC course contains a laboratory, so must the course being considered for transfer. 2. A course being considered for transfer must have credits and hours equivalent to or greater than the same course at UBCC. 3. Any course to be transferred must have been passed with a grade of C or better. (2.0 on a 4.00 scale.) 4. A transferred course carries credit equal to the UBCC course for which credit is granted. The original grade earned is not transferred and does not affect the stu- dent's QPR at UBCC. 5. In order to obtain transfer credit the stu- dent must have been granted an honor - able withdrawal from the professional or graduate school attended. An overall Grade Point Average (GPA) of a 2.50 (on a 4.0 scale) or higher must be achieved in order to be considered for transfer status or advanced standing. It is important to note that all transfer stu-dents must meet the entry level prerequisite requirements for first semester students re-College of Chiropractic80gardless of having been accepted to the in- stitution from which they are transferring. In many cases, UBCC's requirements are higher than those for other chiropractic and profes-sional schools. Prospective transfer students should note that an admissions application to UBCC is needed in order to begin a review for trans- fer credit. Students wishing to transfer must provide the Admissions Committee with an official transcript and a catalog from the chi- ropractic, professional or graduate school/s from which they are transferring, as well as a syllabus from each course for which the student is requesting transfer credit. Advanced Standing Students who are accepted as transfer stu-dents may receive advanced standing if a substantial number of semester hours have been accepted by UBCC. This could possi-bly enable the student to complete the D.C. program in less than 8 semesters. Transfer credit may be granted either with or without advanced standing, Effective Fall 2005, The University of Bridgeport College of Chiro- practic will grant no more than a maximum of 20% of advanced standing credit/hours towards our curriculum. A transfer student is eligible to receive no more than 42 transfer credits. Potential transfer students should be aware that in most cases they would have to complete approximately, 3 to 3 1/2 years at UBCC if accepted. If advanced standing is granted: 1. A special curriculum schedule will be made up for the student based on semes- ter hours transferred and course availabil- ity. 2. Tuition will be calculated based on the number of credits being taken per semes- ter multiplied by the single credit fee (if less than 14 credits per semester) at the time of the student's attendance. If advanced standing is not granted, but some semester hours are transferable, the student will be admitted to the first semester and will be exempt from courses for which transfer credit was granted.College of Chiropractic81College of Naturopathic Medicine Dean: Marcia Prenguber, N.D., FABNO Health Sciences Center 60 Telephone: (203) 576-4110 Fax: (203) 576-4107 E-mail: mprengub@bridgeport.edu Associate Dean Academic Health Sciences Center Telephone: (203) sdraus@bridgeport.edu Associate Dean for Clinical Education: Sciences E-mail: jmahfoud@bridgeport.edu Clinic Coordinator: 576-3450 E-mail: jholdorf@bridgeport.edu Dispensary Manager: 576-4298 E-mail: lnapoli@bridgeport.edu Assistant to the (203) Napoli, A. Ross, K. Sanders, D. Terfera, E. Zampieron Naturopathic medicine is a distinct profes- sion of primary health care that emphasizes prevention and treatment of disease, and promotion of optimal health and wellness through the use of natural therapies that en-hance the inherent healing wisdom of nature, the vis medicatrix naturae. Rooted in tradi- tion, naturopathic physicians utilize clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, physical medicine, and other natural modali-ties to help patients thrive. Most naturopathic physicians are in private practice, though op- portunities in group and integrative practice settings, research, and education are rapidly growing. The University of Bridgeport, Col-lege of Naturopathic Medicine (UBCNM) trains students to a broad scope of practice, to prepare students to practice across North America. Students are responsible for be- ing informed of licensure requirements and scope of practice in the legal jurisdiction in which they plan to practice. Degree Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (N.D.) Recognition and Memberships UBCNM is approved to offer the degree of Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine by the Con- necticut State Department of Higher Educa- tion.

College of Naturopathic Medicine Mission Statement Rooted in naturopathic philosophy, our goal is to train students to become physicians who are experts in individualized patient-centered care that focuses on disease prevention and optimization of health throughout the lifespan. Program Competencies Prior to graduation from the College of Na- turopathic Medicine students are required to meet the standards of knowledge, behaviors and practices associated with competency de-velopment in naturopathic medicine. These competencies have been established to con- firm that graduates from UBCNM possess the knowledge, values, technical ability, clinical reasoning and communication skills needed to practice medicine safely and effectively. Additionally, it is expected that as medical professionals our graduates will integrate re- flection, research and professional develop-ment into their medical practices. Competen- cies include: 1. Patient Care Gather complete, relevant patient in- formation Document encounters including re- porting of information and develop- ment of an assessment and plan effi- ciently and accurately.

Values Display a commitment to naturopathic principles and philosophy Demonstrate reflective practice that in- corporates self-care Respond to needs of patients and soci- ety while 82Naturopathic Principles and Practice The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians has adopted the following official definition of Naturopathic Medicine, its prin- ciples and practice: Naturopathic medicine is a distinct system of primary healthcare \u2014 an art, science, philoso- phy, and practice of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness. Naturopathic medicine is distinguished by the principles upon which its practice is based. The principles are con- tinually reexamined in the light of scientific advances. The techniques of naturopathic medicine include modern and traditional, sci-entific and empirical methods. The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medical practice: The Healing Power of Nature (vis medicatrix naturae): Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in the per - son which is ordered and intelligent. Naturo- pathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to fa-cilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes (tolle causam): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm (primum non nocere): Na- turopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming a patient: Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; Avoid when possible the harmful sup- pression of symptoms; Acknowledge, respect, and work with the individual's self-healing process. Doctor as Teacher (docere): Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and em-power them to take responsibility for their health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient re-lationship. Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic phy- sicians treat each patient by taking into ac-count individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other fac-tors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Prevention: Naturopathic physicians empha- size the prevention of disease \u2014 assessing risk factors, heredity, and susceptibility to disease and making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine is committed to the creation of a healthy world in which humanity may thrive. PRACTICE Naturopathic Methods: Naturopathic medi- cine is defined by its principles. Diagnostic methods, treatments, and modalities are se- lected and applied based upon these prin- ciples in relationship to the unique individual needs of each patient. Naturopathic Practice: Naturopathic practice includes the following diagnostic and thera-peutic modalities: clinical nutrition; botani-cal medicine; naturopathic physical medicine including naturopathic manipulative therapy; public health measures and hygiene; health counseling; minor surgery; homeopathy; acupuncture; naturopathic obstetrics (natural childbirth); and laboratory assessment, diag-nostic imaging, and clinical diagnosis. Curriculum The academic and clinical curriculum at UBC-NM is an intensive four-year, full-time pro-gram that provides students with a foundation in the knowledge and skills essential to the practice of naturopathic medicine. This doc-toral degree prepares students for the Natu-ropathic Physicians Licensing Exam (NPLEX), required for state and provincial licensing ex-ams, and for the general practice of naturo-pathic medicine. The curriculum, instruction, and clinical ex- periences are designed to prepare graduates to be competent physicians offering com-prehensive healthcare using traditional and up-to-date methods and modalities in ac-cordance with the principles of Naturopathic Medicine. The first year of the program is de-voted to biomedical sciences and naturopath-ic philosophy. The second year of training is focused on clinical sciences and the begin-ning of coursework in therapeutic modalities. The last two years focus on naturopathic case management related to organ systems, special populations (e.g., pediatrics and geriatrics), and advanced study of therapeutic modalities. Clinical training begins during the second year of study, through observation of patient care. During the 3rd year of training, students provide a supportive role in patient care at the on-campus UB Clinics and off-site com-munity clinics in the surrounding area, under the supervision and direction of naturopathic physicians and other licensed physicians. To be eligible for clinical education training and credit, students must be in good academic standing, successfully complete required courses in Semesters I through IV, pass the Clinic Entrance Exam, and have current CPR certification. The course of study consists of four academic years each consisting of two 18-week semes-ters, as well as some summer and holiday clinic shifts.

Some, but not all, licensing jurisdictions require a specific minimum number of didactic hours for the practice of` these specialties. Currently, the following courses are offered as electives by the college: NNP 712 Generative Medicine I Generative xxx TCM IIINTCM xxx TCM IV GRADES Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa- tions. Grades earned are on a four (4)-point scale with an \"A\" or 4 quality points being the highest grade attained. GRADE QUALITY POINTS A 4.0 B+ 3.5 B 3.0 C+ 2.5C 2.0 F 0.0 The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semes-College of Naturopathic Medicine84ter hours into the number of points earned. Transfer credits are not included in this com- putation. Clinic Grades are: Satisfactory (S) or Failure (F). Refer to the UBCNM Student Handbook for policies regarding a grade of \"F\". Administrative Grades In addition to the Academic Grades submit- ted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized: I (Incomplete), TCR (Transfer Credit), and W (Withdrawal). I: The grade of Incomplete (I) may be requested by a student and is used by the faculty, with the prior approval of the Associate Dean, to indicate that a student has not completed all course requirements for approved reasons. These include documented medical emergencies of the student or immedi- ate family member. To be eligible for an Incomplete, a stu-dent must have attended a minimum of 75% of the course hours. The faculty member and the Associate Dean may approve the student's request for an Incomplete. Upon approval, the fac-ulty member and Associate Dean will determine the time granted to com- plete the course requirements. Once the student has completed course re- quirements within the approved time frame, the faculty member will submit the earned grade. If the requirements are not completed within the ap- proved time frame, the course grade will be converted from an \"I\" to an \"F\". Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be eligible to register for courses for which that course is a pre- requisite without approval by the As- sociate Dean of Academic Affairs. TCR: Transfer credit granted for equivalent graduate work completed at another accredited institution. W: Withdrawal grades are assigned on the following policy statements: If a student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of-registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change- of-registration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's tran-script. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR. The names of students who have of- ficially withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. Any exceptions must be approved by the Associate Dean of Academic Af- fairs. Academic Policies See the UBCNM Student Handbook for the most current and complete description of Col- lege policies and procedures. ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS Each student is expected to attend all lectures and laboratories and other activities asso- ciated with the total completion of a given course. Certain courses are offered on eve-nings and weekends. A detailed description of the attendance poli- cy can be found in each course syllabus. REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION In order to be eligible for graduation from UBCNM, candidates must: 1. Complete all requirements of the educa- tional program with a minimum 2.50 cu-mulative grade point average. 2. Receive a recommendation for gradua-tion by the UBCNM Faculty and Admin-istration. 3. Fulfill financial obligations to the College and University Office of Financial Aid. 4. Complete, at a minimum, the last three semesters in residence at UBCNM, by transfer and/or advanced-standing stu-dents. All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within seven years from the first matriculation to graduation. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS A student is considered to be meeting sat- isfactory academic progress by maintaining a QPR of 2.5 or greater with no outstand- ing grade of \"F\". Good academic standing is achieved when a student maintains a GPA of 2.5, has met all financial responsibilities to the College, and is free of any breach of the stan-dards governing ethical and clinical conduct. Academic Probation, Remediation, and Dismissal ACADEMIC PROBATION Academic probation occurs when the stu- dent's GPA or QPR falls below 2.50, or the student has a grade of \"F\" in one or more courses. A student who is on Academic Pro-bation is not in good academic standing, and may not be allowed to carry a full academic course load. In addition, a student on Aca-demic Probation may not be allowed to par - ticipate in the UBCNM clinic, outreach clinic sites, preceptorships, or any activities associ-ated with clinical education. A student on Ac- ademic Probation must meet with the Associ- ate Dean of Academic Affairs to create a plan for successful completion of the program. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student who, after one semester of Aca-demic Probation, does not show substantial improvement in his or her academic perfor - mance may be subject to dismissal from the program. Additionally, Academic Dismissal may occur if a student is placed on Academic Probation for a second time, for any reason. A student whose GPA falls below 2.0 at any time may be subject to dismissal from the program. Any student who is subject to dis-missal may appeal to the Dean (see Appeals and Disciplinary Action). NON-ACADEMIC DISMISSAL FROM THE COLLEGE Naturopathic medical students are expected to demonstrate ethical and professional be- havior at all times. The following incidents may be cause for dismissal from the program: 1. Failure to meet the generally accepted standards of professional conduct and clinical practice. Dismissal of this nature is subject to a review of a committee of peers, faculty, and administration. 2. Pleading guilty or \"no contest,\" or being found guilty of any crime involving mor - al turpitude or being felonious in nature. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or the demonstration of behavior that creates safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the College. See the College Student Handbook for a com-plete description of policies and procedures for Non-Academic Dismissal.College of Naturopathic Medicine85LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM If a student requests a Leave of Absence (LOA) from UBCNM, and is in good academic and financial standing with the College, s/he is eligible for readmission for up to one year from the date the leave begins. After one year, the LOA expires and the student must reap- ply for admission to the College through the Admissions Office. A Medical Leave requires medical documen- tation from a physician that states that the stu-dent must take leave to recover from illness or injury. Before returning to the program the student must provide medical clearance that allows full participation in academic and clini- cal activities. After one year, the student must reapply for admission to the College through the University Admissions Office. A student who withdraws from the University must reapply for admission to the College in order to be readmitted to the program. If a student fails to register for a semester without applying for an official LOA at any time be- fore completion of the naturopathic program, s/he is considered to have withdrawn from the program. If a student takes leave one or more times from the program, the cumulative absences must not exceed three years. LOA or Withdrawal requires the student to complete all required paperwork from the University's Registrar and Financial Aid Office. READMISSION TO THE PROGRAM A student on Leave of Absence from UBCNM who intends to return to the program must notify the Dean in writing and reapply for ad- mission through the University's Admissions Office at least one month before the begin- ning of the semester of anticipated return.

By submitting an application to the University of Bridgeport, Fones School of Dental Hy-giene, the applicant is confirming their abil- ity to meet qualifications for entrance into the Fones School of Dental Hygiene program. General Criteria for the A.S. and the B.S. Degree in Dental Hygiene The two year basic core curriculum of the Fones School combines courses from the College of Arts and Sciences and the Fones School of Dental Hygiene to provide a broad educational preparation. In addition to ba- sic and dental science theory, the program provides education in preventive service and dental health education. During the second year, the students receive clinical education at the Fones Dental Health Center on campus, and through assignments to the clinical and educational facilities of school dental health programs, hospitals and community agencies. These assignments are directly supervised by Fones faculty. Stu- dents are responsible for providing their own transportation to community agencies. A student who earns a grade of C- or below in a course in the major field, must obtain a written statement from the School Director specifying the procedure necessary to rem- edy the deficiency and remain in the major. Enrollment in the second year is contingent on completing all first year requirements and achieving a QPR of 2.0. Education at the baccalaureate level en- hances the dental hygienists' opportunities, abilities, background and values. The pro- fessional dental hygiene curriculum is com-bined with a liberal arts education. Upon satisfactory completion of 122-125 credits in the areas of study specified, the student will be recommended for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene. Students in the Bachelor of Science degree (B.S.) may integrate the Bachelor's courses with the clinical aspect of the Dental Hy-giene curriculum or pursue a Baccalaureate degree (B.S.) after completing clinical prepa- ration at the Associate in Science Certificate 89Level. This Baccalaureate degree comple- tion approach is available to Fones' students and graduates of a Dental Hygiene program that is accredited by a specialized accredit-ing agency recognized by the Council on Post Secondary Accreditation and the United States Department of Education. All courses listed in the major program sec- tion of the catalog for the Associate in Sci-ence and/or Bachelor of Science degree are required for graduation. The majority of Dental Hygiene courses may be taken dur - ing the regular academic year. Dental Hygiene Bachelor of Science Degree Online Program The online B.S. in Dental Hygiene from The Fones School of Dental Hygiene at the University of Bridgeport offers an oppor - tunity for dental hygienists to further their education beyond the A.S. degree.

ATTENDANCE CAMPUS WEEkEND FORMAT Each class period represents 20% of a four credit course or 25% or a three-credit course. Class attendance and participation are in- dispensable parts of the educational pro-cess that are required throughout the pro- gram. Since classes only meet 4 or 5 times, depending on whether the course is 3 or 4 credits, it is imperative that students attend class. In the event of absence due to illness or family emergency, please notify the Assis-tant Director and the instructor immediately. If more than one class is missed during the semester for either a 3 or 4 credit course you will receive a failing grade for the class and will have to repeat it. This includes absences for illness. Make-up examinations due to absence WILL NOT will not be permitted without an approved legitimate excuse with full documentation (see makeup policies) and will result in a grade of zero for that exam. Students ARE NOT PERMITTED to leave class prior to 5pm unless prior authori-zation is received from the Assistant Director and this would require the same guidelines for approval as an absence. Prior approval must be sought during normal administra- tion business hours Monday - Friday. Those who leave class early without prior approval or subsequent documentation of illness or emergency that meet the guidelines speci- fied under makeup policies below will be penalized with a 20% grade deduction on their course grade. MAkE-UP POLICIES WEEkEND CAMPUS AND ONLINE FORMAT Make-up examinations and assignments will not be permitted without a legitimate excuse or prior approval from the instructor and as- sistant director and will result in a grade of zero. An acceptable excuse for prolonged illness, or family emergency, entitling a stu- dent to a make-up examination, requires a legitimate detailed doctor's note (with diag- nosis) by a U.S. licensed physician or official documentation of family emergency, which must be submitted to the Program Assistant Director and approved. Please note that only one make-up examination is allowed per course regardless of instructor approval. Missed exams must be taken before the next scheduled examination and may be modi-fied and made more difficult by the instruc- tor. Make-ups will not be granted for reasons of personal convenience, such as traveling, weddings and vacations. GRADING POLICY Online exams are timed. Your syllabus should define for you the time limit on the exam as well as when you log onto Canvas to complete it. Your are permitted to log onto the exam only ONCE and complete it in the required time frame. Students cannot log in and out of exams. Once submitted, the exam cannot be accessed again. Time limits set by the professors must be adhered to. Students who exceed the time limit on the exam, (this is reported to the instructor automatically) will receive a grading penalty equal to the percentage of excess time they took. For example, if an exam was sched- uled for 60 minutes and the student took 66 minutes to complete it, they would have exceeded the exam time by 10%. Therefore their exam grade would be penalized 10% of the total possible points for the exam. If exam was 100 points, then 10% would equal a 10 point deduction. Repeated violations of exam time may result in further grading pen-alties and will be reported to the program assistant director for review.

EVALUATION AND GRADING The GPA is determined based on the follow-ing scale. A = 4.00, A- = 3.67, B+ = 3.33, B = 3.00, B- = 2.67, C+ = 2.33, C = 2.00, C- = 1.67, D+ = 1.33, D = 1.00, I = Incomplete, W = Withdrawal, R = Research in progress. Any course with a grade of C- or a numerical grade of 73 or less must be repeated to earn graduate credit. Other courses may be re- peated if the student needs to raise the GPA. When a course is repeated, only the second grade will used to calculate the GPA. Tuition must be paid again for all classes that are re-quired to be re-taken (no exceptions). Evalu-ation and grading are the responsibility and province of the professor. All students in a course will be graded consistently or equiva- lently. Students may be penalized for late or missed work. Questions regarding grades should be addressed to the course professor. GRADE DISPUTES A disputed grade may be appealed in writing as follows: First Appeal: Directly to the instructor within 30 days of receipt of grade Second Appeal: To Assistant Director of Nu- trition Institute Third Appeal: To Director of Nutrition Insti- tute/Vice Provost of Health Sciences Final Appeal: To the Provost TRANSFER CREDITS The Program Director, with the Dean's ap- proval, may allow up to six semester hours (eight hours in the case of laboratory cours- es) of graduate transfer credits from a region- ally accredited college or university. The courses being considered for transfer must have been completed within the past seven years, with a grade of \"B\" or better, and be comparable to the University of Bridgeport's graduate courses. Physicians (i.e.: medical, osteopathic, chiropractic, naturopathic, etc.) may request advanced standing for 560A and 560B. However, many choose to take 560B (Biochemistry) if they have not had the course in many years, as a review and prep- aration for course 560D (Clinical Biochemis-try). Advanced transfer credit for physicians will only be granted for courses where a grade of \"B\" or better was achieved. INCOMPLETE COURSEWORk An \"I\" (Incomplete) designates incomplete work at the time of grading for reasons be- yond the control of the student, fully docu- mented, and corresponding to UB makeup policies as stated above, and determined to be bona-fide by the instructor and the As- sistant Program Director. If approved by the assistant director and the instructor, incom-plete coursework must be completed by the end of the semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was grant-ed. If the work has not been completed and no grade has been submitted as indicated, the grade automatically becomes F. STU-DENTS WHO ARE FAILING A COURSE ARE Nutrition Institute95NOT PERMITTED TO TAKE AN INCOMPLETE AND REPEAT THE COURSE TO ATTAIN A NEW GRADE. A GRADE OF \"F\" WILL BE IS-SUED AND THE COURSE WILL HAVE TO BE REPEATED BY RE-REGISTERING FOR THE COURSE. GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING PROBATION AND SEPARATION Good academic standing is achieved when a student maintains a 3.0 GPA. If the GPA drops below 3.0, the student will be placed on academic probation. A student, who re-ceives a second grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in any course, or is placed on probation in two dif- ferent semesters, will be separated from the program. In cases of academic probation, the student should consult with the Program Assistant Director for advice and planning to raise the GPA. In cases of separation from the program, a student may make a writ- ten appeal to the Director within ten days of the notification of separation. If an ap- peal is granted, the student will remain on academic probation and his progress will be monitored periodically during the semester. RESEARCH IN NUTRITION - COURSE 560J The research project can be taken as an elec- tive, and is not required, as part of the Hu- man Nutrition Program. The project can be a literature-based study or an original research project. Students have one semester to com- plete the project before incurring a fee. If thesis completion exceeds the one semester limit, the student must maintain continuous matriculation by registering for ADMIN 600, each semester, until the thesis has been com-pleted. Graduation Requirements The minimum number of credits required for graduation is 41; the minimum GPA required is 3.0. Students are expected to complete class work for the degree within five years of initial enrollment in the program. Successful completion of ALL sections of the comprehensive competency examination is required for graduation.

General Criteria for the RN to BSN Degree in Nursing The RN to BSN applicant must complete an application for admission and provide all of- ficial transcripts from all college/university/ diploma programs attended. Sixty-four cred-its of basic nursing and general education credits from an accredited college or ac- credited diploma program with a 2.75GPA is required to be accepted into the program. Ninety credits may be transferred from ac- credited four-year institution. The length of time to complete the BSN program is contin- gent on the number of transferred credits ac- cepted and the number of general education courses that need to be taken. The 27 credits of upper level RN to BSN program courses and the 3 credit Capstone 390 seminar were designed so they can be completed in one calendar year plus one summer course by taking 2 online courses per 8 week session once all pre-requisite courses are completed. The pace is determined by the student but the BSN degree should be completed within 7 years of matriculation. The RN to BSN student must maintain a GPA of 2.5 or higher to be eligible for graduation. A student who fails a nursing course may repeat that course and the second grade re- places the first grade for the computation of the QPA. Both course grades will remain on the official transcript. The student who falls below the minimum required GPA will col-laborate with a faculty advisor to formulate a professional improvement plan that will outline steps to achieving the required GPA. The grade for a course repeated more than twice will be the average of all the grades earned each time the course was taken. All repeated courses will be so indicated on the transcript. The University of Bridgeport poli- cies and standards for the Academic Status of Students and Academic Separation (Catalog 2014-2016, page 30) for undergraduate de- gree programs will apply for students who are not maintaining the required academic progress. 101School of Professional Studies Dean: Dr. Timothy Laynor Wahlstrom Library, Garden Level 126 (203) 576-4537 E-mail: scpsinfo@bridgeport.edu School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) serves the public by facili-tating access to the University's knowledge and resources through credit and noncredit courses and alternative methods of teaching and learning, and by aiding adult lifelong learners and organizations to become more competitive, improve their earning power, and enrich their lives.

Why Students Enroll at ELI Many students wish to enrich their knowl- edge of the English language while on leave from a school or a job in their home country. Most of these students return to their home country after a stay at ELI of from 7 weeks to a full year or more. Many ELI students plan to apply for admis- sion to a degree program at the University of Bridgeport. They improve their knowledge of English to meet the English language re-quirement for university admission. These students usually obtain \"conditional accep- tance\" to a degree program and will receive full acceptance when they satisfy the Uni- versity's English language requirement for admission. It should be noted that successful completion of ELI's advanced level satisfies the English language requirement for ad- mission to the University of Bridgeport. ELI graduates are not required to take the TOEFL or IELTS. The Curriculum The curriculum of ELI focuses on improving skills in speaking, listening comprehension, writing, and reading. At all levels of the cur - riculum, ELI instructors seek to help students improve their language skills through active use of the language both in and out of the classroom. New students complete a placement test upon arrival and are placed in the appropriate level of English. Successful completion of the ses- sion allows the student to move up to the next level. Students who are placed in the lower levels concentrate on basic grammar, speaking, lis-tening, and reading skills, and practice para- graph writing. As students progress through the levels, they continue to improve their speaking and listening skills while taking on more challenging tasks in reading and writing. In the advanced levels, students strive to achieve competence in language-dependent tasks similar to those that are required of na- tive speakers of English in both academic and career-related activities. These include read- ing for content; note-taking from spoken and written materials; speaking skills needed to relate information, to persuade, to negotiate, and to inquire; and skills needed in essay and report writing, as well as in effective corre-spondence. Graduates of ELI receive a \"Certificate of Com- pletion\" which certifies that they have met the English language requirement for admission to the University of Bridgeport. Grades reports are issued upon request. Schedule of Charges Please see insert for current academic year for tuition, fees, and other expense. ELI students should plan on spending about $200 per 8-week session to cover required books and miscellaneous personal expenses such as recreational travel, local transporta- tion, books, laundry, clothing, etc. Application Forms and Additional Information Prospective students may obtain application forms, credit card charge forms, insurance information, etc. at ELI's Internet site, by email, or by calling or faxing ELI.103Ernest C.

To this end the University has established a Pre-Law and a Pre-Health advisory program. Pre-Law Studies Advisor: Timothy Mandeville Fax: (203) 576-4388 E-mail: traynor@bridgeport.edu While no single curricular path is the ideal preparation for law school, a broadly based undergraduate program that includes train - ing in analytical reasoning and writing will serve you well. Law schools want students who can think, read, and write and who have some understanding of the forces that have shaped human experience. You can ac - quire these attributes in any number of col - lege courses, whether in the humanities, the social sciences, or the natural sciences. English language and literature courses are virtually indispensable. At the same time, ev - ery law student should be aware of the in - stitutional processes of government through which much of the law is made and applied. You can gain this awareness through study in political science. Because the law is insepara - ble from our historic experience, you should have some acquaintance with American his - tory. The fact that many legal subjects are in - timately concerned with economic relations among individuals, and with the structure and development of business enterprises, makes a knowledge of macro and microeco - nomics valuable. Statistics, accounting, and computer science are other courses that will help you to understand special legal subjects and the practice of law. Accredited law schools require that appli - cants take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). In the admissions process, law schools are primarily interested in the stu - dent's LSAT score, the student's GPA, and the intensity and depth of the student's un - dergraduate program, showing the student's capacity to perform well at an academically rigorous level.For more information on pre-law studies, check out the Law School Admission Coun - cil at www.lsac.org. Pre-Health Professional Studies Advisor to Pre-Health: Spiros Katsifis Charles Dana Hall 169 Fax: (203) 576-4262 E-mail: for General Studies Majors: Edward Geist Bryant Hall 271 Avenue Telephone: (203) 576-4956 Fax: 576-4051 Virtually all of the professional schools in these fields have the same minimum en - trance requirements: 1. Completion of 90 credit hours of college work or completion of a bachelor's de- gree, 2. Completion of laboratory science courses in the following subjects: Biology - 8 credit hours General Chemistry - 8 credit hours Organic Chemistry - 8 credit hours General Physics - 8 credit hours 3. Completion of a liberal arts core that in-cludes English composition, psychology, communications, humanities, social sci-ences, and the fine arts. Depending on the health profession and school some variation in these requirements does occur. The highest percentage of students admit - ted to health professional graduate schools major in biology with chemistry the second most common major. However, students ma - joring in any discipline, e.g. history, music, or psychology, are also viable candidates provided they satisfy the pre-requisites of the professional school to which they seek admission. The University of Bridgeport's Biology Major offers a B.A. or B.S. degree that provides a rigorous scientific and technical program for the pre-health professional student. See the Biology major for additional details. The University of Bridgeport's Bachelor of Science in General Studies (B.S.) degree program provides the student with the op - portunity to create a program, in consulta - tion with their advisor, that may fit the indi - vidual student's particular needs. The University offers a pre-Chiropractic pro - gram in the Biology major and the General Studies major. These programs are offered with the cooperation of the University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic. In both programs the student may elect a 90-Credit Basic Option, Combined Baccalaureate/ Doctor of Chiropractic Option, or Complete Baccalaureate followed by Doctor of Chiro - practic Option. See the description of the pre-chiropractic program elsewhere in the catalog. A pre-Naturopathic program is also of - fered in cooperation with the University of Bridgeport's College of Naturopathic Medi - cine. In this program a student must com - plete the bachelor's degree before entering the College of Naturopathic Medicine. See the description of this program elsewhere in the catalog. It should be noted that pre-health pro - fessional study in any of the above areas provides an excellent foundation for other careers in the health sciences, including os - teopathy, podiatry, physical therapy, optom - etry, and pharmacy. 105Pre-Professional Programs for Chiropractic The University of Bridgeport offers a pre- professional program for students preparing for Chiropractic College, the Pre-Chiroprac - tic Program for undergraduate students. This program fulfills the prerequisites for all Chi - ropractic colleges in the United States and Canada, including the University of Bridge - port College of Chiropractic.

Upper Division coursework provides stu- dents with a common body of managerial knowledge, multinational business studies, study in a major field, and an internship or business development project. The concen-tration of professional courses in the last two years builds upon the broad-based analytical tools and liberal arts foundation of the first two years. Management 350, Business Policy and Strat- egy, is the Capstone Course of this degree program. The final examination of this course shall constitute, therefore, an out- come assessment of what the student has learned in the program. This examination, normally an extensive and comprehensive case study, will be graded by several faculty members representing different and relevant disciplines.Learning Outcomes LEARNING OBJECTIVES Students 1) acquire the knowledge neces-sary for an understanding of business data; 2) develop the technical skills necessary to measure, analyze, and interpret economic data; 3) learn how to effectively communi- cate economic data; and 4) acquire the ac- counting foundation that enables them to pursue advanced study required for the suc- cessful completion of the CPA exam. ASSESSMENT Students are evaluated with exams, home- work assignments and oral presentations. Students will be evaluated and benchmarked with a standardized accounting test. This will ensure their preparation for graduate study towards the CPA exam. Students' accounting knowledge and skills also will be tested with a program specific exam when they begin and finish their accounting program. Students must earn a grade of \"C\" or higher in each Accounting major course.

These items are distributed throughout the clinical phase of the curriculum, the costs of which are included within the Dental Hy- giene special fees. During the second clinical year, the students receive skills-based education, not only at the Fones Dental Hygiene Health Center on campus, but also through assignments at clinical and educational facilities of school dental health programs, hospitals and com- munity agencies. These assignments are di- rectly supervised by Fones faculty. Students are responsible for providing their own transportation to community agencies. All courses listed in the dental hygiene cur - riculum program for the Associate and/or Bachelor of Science degree are required for graduation. The Dental Hygiene student must earn a grade of \"C\" in all major courses. A student that earns a grade of C- or below in a course in the major field, must obtain a written statement from the School Dean specifying the procedure necessary to rem- edy the deficiency and remain in the major. Enrollment in the second year is contingent on completing all first year requirements and achieving a cumulative QPR of 2.0 Qualifications and procedures required of applicants to the Fones School are the same as those described in the chapter on Admis- sions. Dental Hygiene clinical courses begin in the fall term and the Associate's degree curriculum is open only to full-time Dental Hygiene students. Clinical students are re- quired to submit a physical, dental, visual acuity report and current cardiopulmonary resuscitation/recognition certification on an annual basis. Student must also submit evidence of Hepatitis B vaccine series sero- conversion and PPD tuberculin test. All ad- mitted students are subject to a background check. This procedure will be conducted by the outside agency Verified Credentials, Inc. All information is maintained confidentially. Learning Outcomes Through completion of the entry-level dental hygiene curriculum students will achieve the following outcomes: Characterize professionalism and respon- sibility in all health promotion and dis- ease prevention activities. Apply a professional code of ethics while adhering to appropriate legal and regula- tory measures when providing oral health services. Utilize critical thinking, problem solving, and evidence-based decision making in the dental hygiene process of care. Provide the dental hygiene process of care (assessment, dental hygiene diag-nosis, planning, implementation, evalua- tion, documentation) for patients/clients in all settings. Communicate effectively with and deliver culturally competent, inter-professional health care to individuals and groups from diverse populations. Demonstrate the knowledge necessary to assess, plan, implement and evaluate community-based oral health programs. Continually perform self-assessment to maintain professional standards and en- courage life-long learning. Value the need for personal and profes-sional growth through participation in professional activities and associations. Understand and master the competencies of Dental Hygiene Professional Practice. Students will demonstrate professionalism, ethical behavior, evidenced-based decision making, competent client care, health promo- tion, and disease prevention. A set of compe- tencies has been developed to verify ability to perform total client care and develop pro- fessionally. Students must demonstrate suc- cessful completion of these competencies in order to graduate. Completion of competen- cies confirm that the student has the ability to safely provide dental hygiene care at an entry level, or what is minimally expected in per - formance as a new graduate. As a licensed professional who continues in his/her career, experience and continued learning leads one in becoming proficient, or eventually, even an expert in the delivery of care. The Fones School of Dental Hygiene Competencies are posted on the University Website. Students learn the skills and knowledge necessary to function effectively as an inte-gral member of the dental health team. The program utilizes the facilities of the Uni- versity of Bridgeport Health Clinics Fones School of Dental Hygiene Health Center, area hospitals, and community health clin- ics. Specialized course work must be taken in the outlined sequence. DHYG designated courses are open to admitted dental hygiene students only. A minimum grade of C or bet-ter (74 or above) is required in ALL dental hygiene courses.

Design majors begin their studies with foun- dation courses in two- and three-dimension- al design, drawing, digital photography, and computer applications, as well as back-ground courses in arts and design history. Beginning in the foundation year, students learn to analyze each other's ideas, and are trained to present their own to maximum ef-fect. Students are introduced to the theory and practice of mass communication and ad- vertising, and are encouraged to undertake further study in the cultural and social back-ground of modern times. The program's emphasis is placed on the four-course De- sign Studio sequence, which acquaints stu-dents with ever more sophisticated technol- ogies while applying the design processes to real-world community projects, creating a meaningful portfolio. Internships, coopera- tive work arrangements, and special projects are available to qualified students. Learning Outcomes 1. Demonstrate ability to identify, analyze, and solve design problems. Assessment: Portfolio projects and project research. 2. Demonstrate mastery of design tools, techniques, and concepts in design. As-sessment: Projects and portfolios that evidence craftsmanship and adherence to project parameters. 3. Demonstrate an understanding of the aesthetics of form development, and of the history and current state of design. Assess-ment: Projects, papers, and presentations for art and design history courses; in studio courses, projects that appropriately refer - ence historical precedents. 4. Demonstrate proficiency in selection and use of relevant technologies in design. Abilities to use available technical and industrial processes to produce a design product, and to design and implement such a process. Assessment: Project and portfolio materials planned to be feasibly reproducible by industrial means rather than by one-off or by hand. 5. Demonstrate an understanding of the cultural and societal connections linking design trends and processes as well as a knowledge of business practices and of the market place.

Such programs range from medical school and physician as-sistant programs, to programs in chiropractic and naturopathic medicine, as well as nutri- tion, acupuncture, and pharmacy. Many of these career options can be pursued in the University's professional programs. The program offers tracks (concentrations) in community health education, exercise and fit-ness, and nutrition for students who desire to enter these fields at the entry level. The program affords this range of options primarily through a liberal arts orientation toward these professions. Thus, all students take a foundation of common courses in bi-ology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics, as well as special general education courses such as biological psychology and healthcare ethics. A primary conviction of the program is that one of the most pressing challenges of the twenty-first century is to provide adequate healthcare to the growing and aging popu- lation. Whether students prepare for profes-sional school application and admission, or entry level opportunities, all are encouraged to develop a philosophy of care consistent with the University's mission. Admissions Requirements A student is admitted to the majors in Arts and Sciences after an evaluation of the high school transcript, counselor recommenda- tions, and SAT/ACT scores and has demon-strated potential in analytical reasoning, com- prehension, verbal expression and intellectual growth.... Students who perform well in the Biology and Mathematics programs [thus also Health Sciences] are generally found to have met the following criteria: 1. SAT scores of 530 verbal and 560 math, or composite ACT score of 22. 2. Grade point average of B (2.5) or better. 3. Rank in the top half of the high school graduating class. 4. Four years of mathematics; two lab sciences and an additional science unit in high school. At the discretion of the Admissions Commit-tee, students who meet two of these stan- dards can be admitted into the major. Learning Outcomes As a result of completing the B.S. in Health Sciences, graduates will be able to apply principles of health and wellness as a life-long process of learning grounded in the study of basic sciences and the behavioral arts. The students will : understand fundamental biological, chemical, and physical properties un- derlying life systems be able to gather and analyze research data and make inferences based on the data be aware of professional, ethical, and privacy issues that are pertinent to ca-reers in the health sciences Exercise and Fitness students will un- derstand the relationship between exer - cise and wellness maintenance and be skilled at developing appropriate fitness programs for diverse populations. Nutrition students will understand prin- ciples of human nutrition and the rela- tionship to health and wellness using evidence based strategies. Community health education stu- dents will understand principles to help people assume more responsibility for their health and well being through edu-cational development, implementation and evaluation of community health programs. Pre-professional students will be broadly prepared to enter professional schools and to successfully meet school admissions criteria.GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS ______ The following General Education courses are required of all Health Science concen- trations: ENGL 101 English Composition 3 FYS 101 First Year Seminar 3 PHIL 110 Healthcare Ethics 3 PSYC 103 Introduction to Psychology 3 MATH 105 Intermediate Algebra 3 BIOL 113 Anatomy and Physiology I 4 HUM Humanities Core 3 SOSC Social Science Core 3 FA Fine Arts Core 3 MATH 203/203B Statistics/Biostatistics 4 CAPS 390 Capstone Seminar 3 Total Semester Hours Required 35 Concentration Requirements & Suggested Programs Each concentration requires specific addi- tional courses.

The designer's concern is with the sensory aspects of prod- ucts, bringing together all facets of product development including aesthetics, ergonom-ics, materials, manufacturability, and environ- mental considerations. Professional design- ers often work in interdisciplinary teams on consumer products; business products; and scientific and medical instruments. The Industrial Design program begins with the basics of two- and three-dimensional de- sign, art and design history, computer aided design, drawing, model making, as well as courses in the sciences and general education. Students will research, design and develop assigned product concepts in the studio and computer laboratories. Build product mod- els in a well equipped Model Lab and pres-ent and document their creative and unique solutions. They will study support subjects like ergonomics, materials and manufactur - ing, sustainability and marketing. All stu- dents will develop a strong portfolio that will prepare them to enter the design profes-sion. The Industrial Design program offers the student a broad based design education with opportunities to specialize within many traditional areas of product, package, exhib- it, and transportation design. Students will have opportunities to work on competitions and collaborative projects often with indus- trial sponsorship, and will be encouraged to work in summer internships. Learning Outcomes 1. Demonstrate ability to identify, analyze, and solve design problems. Assessment: Portfolio projects and project research. 2. Demonstrate mastery of design tools, techniques, and concepts in design. As- sessment: Projects and portfolios that evidence craftsmanship and adherence to project parameters.3. Demonstrate an understanding of the aes- thetics of form development, and of the history and current state of design. As- sessment: Projects, papers, and presenta-tions for art and design history courses; in studio courses, projects that appropri- ately reference historical precedents. 4. Demonstrate proficiency in selection and use of relevant technologies in design. Abilities to use available technical and industrial processes to produce a design product, and to design and implement such a process. Assessment: Project and portfolio materials planned to be feasibly reproducible by industrial means rather than by one-off or by hand. 5. Demonstrate an understanding of the cultural and societal connections linking design trends and processes as well as a knowledge of business practices and of the market place. Assessment: Projects and portfolio solutions that are culturally- and audience-appropriate for the prob- lem as posed by the business and market briefs for the project.

The Professional Interior Designer is quali- fied to identify, research and solve prob- lems pertaining to the function and aesthetic quality of the interior environment. The de- signer must have knowledge of construction materials, their applications and methods of installation. Interior designers must design the space in accordance with federal, state and local building codes to meet safety, health, and accessibility requirements. In- terior designers both plan the space and fur - nish the interiors of private homes, public buildings and commercial establishments such as offices, retail, restaurants, hospitals, hotels and theaters. They may plan addi-tions, renovations and be involved in his- toric preservations. With a client's needs and budget in mind, they develop space-plan-ning solutions; prepare working drawings, millwork, architectural details and specifi- cations for interior construction, furnishing and finishes. Designers use computers to generate plans and construction documents, in addition to 3D modeling views. At UB several interior projects assignments are done in collaboration with noted inte- rior/architectural firms, to give students a grasp of real projects and receive addi-tional inputs from professionals in the field. In addition, this relationship helps estab- lish connections for internships. *ITDSN 398 (Internship) can be taken as an elective in addition to the required course-work. As an Interior Design major, you can special- ize in several areas: Residential Design (new and existing) Contract Design such as: Retail, Hospital- ity, Corporate Offices, Health care, Institu- tional Historic Preservation Exhibit Design Furniture and Furnishings DesignLearning Outcomes 1.

Po- litical economy describes the nexus between politics and economics, and international political economy studies the arena where international politics and international eco- nomics meet. The subject matter of Inter - national Political Economy is the study of the international economic system and how it produces, distributes, and uses wealth. The study of the international political sys- tem focuses a set of institutions and rules by which social and economic interactions are governed. It represents an investigation of the political basis of economic action and the economic basis of political action. An important additional consideration is the role of international law in developing uni- versal principles and norms in the conduct of international relations, and governing of relations between states and their citizens. Because diplomatic negotiations form the basis of new international law, and because diplomacy operates within the framework of extant international law, the study of di-plomacy is an important component in the study of international political economy. Learning Outcomes The B.A. in International Political Economy & Diplomacy has the following learning out- comes: 1) students will demonstrate an abil- ity to explain and compare different political and economic systems; 2) students will be able to reflect on the role of culture, his- tory and religion in international political economy; 3) students will be able to explain the role of diplomacy and conflict resolution in international relations; 4) Students will demonstrate a basic working knowledge of a world language other than one's mother tongue; 5) students will demonstrate the ability to use critical thinking in their evalu- ation of issues and problems in international political economy; and 6) students will dem-onstrate practical skills in helping resolve global disputes through diplomacy and con- flict resolution. * Note that for all College of Public and In- ternational Affairs majors, a portfolio is col- lected to track progress in programmatic outcomes.

The major provides students with the skills, knowledge, and insights which ac-crue from the study of history, literature, and philosophy. The degree requires 42 hours in the Humanities, 40 hours of General Edu-cation, 12 hours of Language study, and 32 hours of Electives. In Group I students are introduced to the disciplines that make up the humanities by taking a combination of required and elec- tive courses in fine arts, history, literature, and philosophy. In the senior year, Humani- ties majors take a two-semester sequence (Group II) applying the interrelationships of the humanistic disciplines, first in the Senior Seminar and then in the supervised research and writing of the Senior Thesis in the stu-dent's area of Concentration. The Literature and Civilization major allows for four areas of Concentration (Group III): (A) Creative Writing, (B) English, (C) History, and (D) Philosophy. Each Concentration re-quires 15 hours, a combination of specific courses and electives in the area of study. The Literature and Civilization major must take 12 hours of Language study. The re-maining hours may be used to earn a Minor, to take additional courses in the Humanities or the Concentration, or to satisfy a curiosity about some of the many other areas of study offered by the University. Learning Outcomes By completing the Literature and Civilization program, students will: 1) be able to read crit- ically and analyze traditional literary genres, historical texts, and philosophical texts; 2) be able to develop and communicate their ideas clearly in writing; 3) be able to identify and evaluate appropriate research sources, incorporating the sources into documented academic writing, and formulate their own arguments based in part on those sources; 4) gain a competency in the content, theo-ries and methods of a particular discipline in the humanities that will manifest itself in their written work; 5) be able to demonstrate an understanding of the interconnectedness of literary, historical, and philosophical de- velopments that influence the current global culture; 6) develop an appreciation for the humanities as a source of practical wisdom, aesthetic pleasure, and knowledge of the di-versity of human experience; and 7) develop a grounded sense of ethical responsibility in an increasingly interconnected world.

In par - ticular, we study the role of religious values in fomenting conflict and promoting peace; in preparing for a life of service; and in giv-ing depth and direction to culture. The study of contemporary religions as a liv- ing phenomenon requires the concomitant study of social sciences and politics in order to deepen one's appreciation of the ways in which the religious roots of any society can impact upon both politics and culture. This becomes increasingly important in a world in which a successful career in business or diplomacy requires an understanding of the way that religion shapes culture, political thought and current conflicts. This program, one of the few of its kind in the world, pro- vides students with a broad understanding of the major themes within religion while also allowing them to develop expertise in one of three cultural spheres: Western Religion and Culture; Islamic Religion and Culture or East Asian Religion and Culture. With this expertise, graduates of this program will be equipped to provide a deeper analysis of existing social structures and contribute to solutions in the worlds of international rela- tions, media and more broadly political sci-ence. Required courses from a common founda- tion prepare students to apply their knowl- edge in one of three concentrations. In the foundations sequence, students are acquainted with the belief systems of the world's major religions as well as political science and economics. This aspect of study involves learning religious studies methods, political science methodologies, principles of economics, cultivating the capacity for criti-cal analysis, developing cultural sensitivity, and securing ability to communicate within an array of cultural and political idioms. In the concentrations sequence, students focus their learning on current problems and prac- tically-oriented solutions. Three defined con-centrations are possible: (1) East Asian Reli-gion and Society; (2) Islamic Religion and Society; and (3) Judeo-Christian Thought and Society. With the consultation of an ad-visor, a self-planned option is also possible. Integrative in nature, this study draws upon other disciplines. Students in Religion and Politics are encouraged to take courses in political science, history, literature, econom- ics, sociology, and mass communication. Our students prepare to serve in non-gov- ernmental organizations, to seek profession- al degrees to further lives of service, and to enroll successfully in graduate schools of the highest caliber. Since the program is person- ally and intellectually demanding, its admis-sions policy is selective. Learning Outcomes Students in the B.A. in Religion and Politics will: 1) demonstrate a broad mastery of the lib-eral arts, including cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary skills of interpretation, critical thinking skills, and oral and written communication skills; 2) demonstrate a mastery of religious stud- ies methods; 3) demonstrate competency in the keys di- mensions of political theory and political science; 4) demonstrate a high-level of competency in one's understanding of the history, be-liefs, evolution, and practice of religion and governance in the Islamic cultural sphere, or in East Asian/Confucian sphere or in the West and demonstrate the competen-cies needed to compare developments and institutions in one's area of specialization with those in place in other major cultural spheres; 5) demonstrate a critical, non-prejudicial understanding of how the world's religions differentially impact social, political, and economic development; 6) demonstrate an understanding of key so- cial institutions (and their impact upon de-velopments in religion and politics); 7) demonstrate at least a 104 level of com- petency in a foreign language germane to the region, which the student has chosen as his or her area studies concentration; 8) demonstrate the ability to undertake in-dependent work and produce research at a high quality for undergraduates Summary of Requirements MAJOR PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS _________ I.

It is innovative both in its interdisciplinary approach to subject matter and the options it offers students to pursue their goals, wheth- er in graduate school or government or the foreign service, in international agencies or business, in the law, teaching or community service. In addition to completing the major (i.e. meeting the requirements indicated in Groups I & II), students may choose to add (i) concentrations or minors in Criminal Jus-tice, History, International Studies, Pre-Law, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, or (ii) minors in career-related areas such as International Business, Finance, Human Ser - vices, and Education. Career opportunities traditionally available to liberal arts students are much enhanced by the flexibility the So- cial Science major permits. In its interdisci- plinary approach, its emphasis on breadth as well as depth of learning, and its focus on practical skills, the Social Science major pre- pares students, for leadership roles in their communities and the world, and for self- fulfillment, and for success in their careers. Learning Outcomes Students in the B.A. in Social Sciences pro- gram will 1) possess a broad, liberal arts foundation and an understanding of how developments in social and intellectual his-tory shape and affect human values and in-stitutions; 2) demonstrate an understanding of basic social science methods; 3) demon-strate that they are conversant (i.e., possess a basic grasp) in the disciplines subsumed under the \"social science\" rubric at the Uni-versity of Bridgeport, i.e., political science, economics, international studies, and so-ciology; 4) demonstrate a more advanced \"working knowledge\" of at least one social science discipline; 5) demonstrate they pos-sess the cognitive competencies and study skills to succeed in advanced/graduate stud-ies in any of the social sciences or in law or business; 6) demonstrate that they have the competencies needed to function compe-tently in an entry-level social science-relat-ed career; and 7) demonstrate competency in written and oral communication.

The program accomplishes its mission by developing student expertise in technical skill, solution architecture and delivery, analysis and management. Gradu- ates of the MS A&S will be well-positioned to enter contemporary data-driven organiza-tions. Students will learn both a breadth of knowl- edge of information systems and a depth of skills in modern analytical methods. Class- work involves both rigorous instruction and required projects to prepare graduates for the unique stresses of this fast-paced indus- try. A similar MBA program with a concen- tration in Analytics Intelligence is offered by our Ernest C. Trefz School of Business; this MS A&S is for students looking to focus more on analytics and systems specifically, rather than business management generally. Positive program outcomes will be achieved through the knowledge and skills the stu-dents will acquire from a comprehensive curriculum design, instruction in an effec- tive learning environment, opportunities for inquiry, and professional development. This program largely leverages our existing offer - ings. While more specific and analytical in nature, these learning outcomes are in line with our institutional mission, and our MBA program. Program Characteristics Although students with work experience will find maximum benefit from the MS A&S; no previous work experience is required. The curriculum is designed to recognize and ac- commodate substantial diversity in prepara- tion and experience as well as the different goals and career expectations of students. For this reason, some students may be re- quired to complete preparatory coursework to successfully graduate from the 30-credit Analytics and Systems Master of Science MS A&S program. Flexible course delivery enables students to proceed at their desired pace. Most students complete the MS A&S program in 18 to 24 months. Learning Outcomes Students will integrate the knowledge and skills they have gained throughout their graduate program to develop and evaluate information systems and analytics by: Technical Demonstrating an understanding of con- cepts learned throughout this graduate program Describing the business drivers and criti- cal success factors for effective analytics and systems project and program deliv- ery Using research, tools and techniques for complex analytical solutions that cap- ture, consolidate and present informa-tion for meaningful insights Human Communicating complicated informa- tion at a professional level clearly and concisely Understanding how to manage all as- pects of the data capture, delivery and analysis process Demonstrating initiative, discipline, and follow-through on assignments and projects Facilitating meaningful dialogue related to class topics Conceptual Evaluating the advantages and disadvan- tages of analytics and systems solution designs, tools and visualization options Analyzing trends within data, facilitating their application, and sharing throughout the organization Applying the theories and techniques learned throughout this program with focus on analytics, information systems, sourcing, and vendor management. Learning Outcomes will be assessed using the following measures: Research papers integrating market trends with class topics Exams measuring the effective acquisi- tion of technical, systems design and delivery acumen \"Hands on\" tools and calculation assign- ments and projects covering key mana- gerial aspects of analytics and systems design and delivery Student attendance and class participa- tion A thesis or internship that demonstrates the ability to conduct investigations in the analytics and systems discipline. Language Requirement Conditionally accepted international stu- dents with an undergraduate degree that was taught in a language other than Eng- lish are required to successfully complete additional language-related coursework and third-party assessment testing before joining the program. Academic Preparation Students with undergraduate preparation in a non-business field may be required to com- plete up to 12 credits of preparatory course- work. Students with a strong academic record (B or better in each case) from an accredited university may be able to waive prepara- tory foundation courses. Accounting & Busi-ness Law (ACCT500) requires both manage- rial and financial accounting, as well as any course labelled business law that included contracts and tort law. Economics & Finance (ECON500) requires both micro- and macro- economics, as well as finance that included time value of money. Information Systems & Quantitative Methods (ITKM500) requires information systems, intermediate Excel, and either MS Excel- or SAS-based statistics or re- search methods. Management & Marketing (MGMT500) requires organizational behav-ior, operations management, and marketing or any similarly named course that includes consumer behavior. Preparatory Courses: Acquiring the Foundation for Success (up to 12 Credits) This course provides the basic fundamentals that serve as a necessary foundation for the MS A&S program.

For students who have earned graduate credit from the Trefz School that is not included in a conferred degree: all applicable (graduate) three-credit courses may be transferred into the MS A&S program.MS/MBA Dual-Degree Program The Trefz School offers students the opportu- nity to acquire concurrent (students must not be eligible to graduate from either program until the final semester) graduate degrees within the Trefz School in which students may apply up to 15 credit hours to both pro- grams. A minimum of 51 credit hours must be completed to satisfy the requirements of this dual-degree program. The BUCP599 Capstone course is available for dual-degree students with the follow- ing modification; students may complete a three-credit internship and one one-credit in each program.\" STEM Designation The MS A&S is classified by ICE (U.S. Im- migration and Customs Enforcement) as a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) degree. Progression/Sequence of Coursework Preparatory coursework must be taken in the first semester. Students begin the formal MS A&S program by completing the eight Core courses (in any order). The Capstone courses should be taken in the final semes- ter, or final two semesters. Fulltime Status Fulltime status requires at least three classes per semester (spring and fall) for interna- tional students and at least two classes per semester for domestic students. International students on an F1 or J1 visa may take fewer than 9 credits only once during their gradu- ate tenure (spring and fall semesters), which is only permitted in their final semester. Grading Policy A grade of C or better is required for credit toward graduation in all preparatory and program coursework. Students are expected to maintain a semester GPA of 3.0 or bet-ter throughout their studies. Those students who earn a semester GPA below 3.0 will be placed on probation and must comply with the associated formal process to successfully maintain proper status. Requirements for Graduation To qualify for the award of the degree of Master of Science in Analytics and Systems, a student must fulfill the following minimum requirements: 1. Admitted to candidacy for the degree in the School of Business. 2. Satisfactorily complete all academic re-quirements with a cumulative grade point average grade of \"B\" (CGPA = 3.0) or bet- ter. 3. File an application for the award of the degree at the Registrar's Office on or be- fore the date published in the University Calendar. 4. Complete all academic requirements within five (5) years from the date of first registration, unless a petition for exten- sion is granted. Extensions are granted only for compelling reasons.Analytics & Systems Master of Science184Director: Spiros Katsifis Charles Telephone 576-4262 Email: skatsif@bridgeport.edu The Biology Master's degree programs of- fer a contemporary biology curriculum that emphasizes the principles and experimental approaches of modern biology. The M.S. program emphasizes design and execution of experimental research, while the M.A. program emphasizes career building. The program offers a variety of customized options so students may select an academic plan that best suits their goals. We offer de-gree course paths in Molecular Biology, Bio-medical Science, or Ecology and Evolution. We also offer two degree options, the Master of Science (MS) or Master of Arts (MA) in Biology. Degree Options MAsTer Of sCIenCe (M.s.) In BIOLOgy This option emphasizes design and execu- tion of experimental work. In this program, the student will be required to complete a thesis featuring an original research. Students in this program will most likely be pursuing terminal degrees following the completion of their degree. MAsTer Of Ar Ts (M.A.) In BIOLOgy This option emphasizes career building. As a student in the M.A. degree program, students will have the option of pursuing an internship or completing their degree with coursework only. Students in the M.A. degree program will most likely be working professionals in- terested in advancing their careers by gaining expertise in the field of biology. CAreers And pr OfessIOns AvAILABLe TO grAdu ATes Of THe pr OgrAM. The program advances the skills and training of students with degrees in Biology or related fields, making them competitive for jobs in private, academic, and government research institutions, clinical laboratories, government agencies, teaching opportunities and those seeking to strengthen their applications to doctoral programs and other professional programs. Graduates with master's degrees in biology are expected to have additional opportunities in nonscientist positions relat- ed to biology, in fields like sales, marketing, publishing, and research management. Some examples of nonscientist job titles that require or prefer a Master's degree include Proposal Development Specialist, Global Product Man- ager, Technical Sales Representative, and Land Management Specialist. OBjeCTIves Of THe pr OgrAM The M.S. program requires a minimum of 33 credit hours of coursework designed to meet stated objectives of student learning for the program. All credit hours must therefore be graduate level (400-level or higher) courses in Biology, or cognate courses tailored to individual student interests, in Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineer - ing, Health Science, or Medical Technology. All cognate courses are subject to depart-mental approval of their contributions to ei- ther the research or career skill acquisitions listed in the programs objectives (see item III.1 below). Every student in the program must take the core courses Biology 445, 470, 490, 498 or 499 and Math 423B. Those elect-ing the thesis option (M.S.) must complete twenty four credits of course work and six credits of Master's Research, culminating in a written thesis and oral defense, demon- strating the program's objective of successful acquisition by the student of independent re-search skills. Students choosing the non-the- sis option (M.A.) must either complete thirty three credits of course work in Biology or cognate courses aimed at further acquisition and refinement of program student learning objectives or thirty credits of course work and, with the approval of the graduate Chair of biology, three credits of intern experience in a professional setting aimed at student ac-quisition of career skills targeted by the pro- gram. Both MS and MA students should take examinations, oral or written as appropriate. Upon completion of the internship, the stu- dent should have a written report by the in-tern advisor and should present a seminar at UB, demonstrating successful completion of the area of her/his internship. Program Admissions and Special Requirements Applicants to the M.S. and M.A. programs must submit the following documents: Official transcripts of all undergraduate (and any graduate) work Evidence of successful completion of the baccalaureate degree, with an overall cu- mulative index of B as well as a B or bet-ter average in program prerequisites: Bi- ology and cognate science courses, such as Biochemistry, Chemistry, or applied clinical lab-based science courses. Two letters of recommendation For M.A. students: If students decide to complete the internship, they will be re- quired to submit a letter of sponsorship from a suitable internship site after enroll- ing in the graduate Biology program. In addition, the candidate must have the fol-lowing pre-requisites. At least one course (minimum of 3 credits) with a grade of C or better in each of the following areas: math, organic chemistry, physics, genetics, and cell & molecular bi-ology. All prerequisites with the exception of genetics must include a lab. The courses must be designated as appropriate for biol-ogy majors. Students will not be admitted to the program with more than 9 credits of deficiency. Credits from courses addressing deficiency do not count toward the M.S./M.A degree. Deficiencies must be remediated in the first 12 credits of the program either at UB or, with prior permission from the pro- gram chair, from elsewhere. Learning Outcomes The program will prepare graduates to: Search, read and interpret current biolog- ical literature Develop an in-depth understanding of the scientific issues of a particular area of biology Develop expertise in research methods associated with an area of biology Develop professional skills related to work in a specific area of biology or bio- medical science Integrate techniques, skills, and under - standing of scientific principles across various area sub-disciplines of biology.

McAdams II Mandeville 576-4647 Email: amcadams@bridgeport.edu The UB MBA Value Proposition The Master of Business Administration (MBA) is a valuable education for aspiring and practicing managers in any industry or field of endeavor. The graduate program provides early to mid-career professionals with the breadth and depth of theoretical and practical knowledge and skills that are necessary for effective leadership in an in- creasingly international and dynamic envi- ronment. Our innovative, interdisciplinary, and interactive MBA experience emphasizes leadership, teamwork, analytical thinking, business and management competencies, and communication to give you a competi- tive edge for success. Program Characteristics Although students with work experience will find maximum benefit from the MBA; no previous work experience is required. The curriculum is designed to recognize and ac-commodate substantial diversity in prepara- tion and experience as well as the different goals and career expectations of students. For this reason, some students may be re- quired to complete preparatory coursework to successfully graduate from the 36-credit MBA program. Flexible course delivery en- ables students to proceed at their desired pace. Most students complete the MBA pro-gram in 18 to 24 months. Learning Outcomes: Students will demonstrate knowledge in all - and proficiency in at least one of - the basic business disciplines (accounting, economics, entrepreneurship, finance, human re- sources, information systems, leadership, management, and marketing). the ability to communicate ideas clearly and concisely in oral and written struc-tures, and in formal and informal set-tings. interpersonal and professional skills that enable them to contribute within diverse sets of teams and build internal and ex- ternal relationships that facilitate success in contemporary organizations. information literacy, proficiency with technology, and analytical techniques for decision-making. critical and logical thinking that inte- grates concepts across disciplines with creativity and integrity enabling them to successfully lead in a dynamic global environment. Assessment Papers, presentations, responses to cases, and projects are evaluated using formal rubrics as measures. Students, and the program as a whole, are evaluated and benchmarked across the basic business disciplines (formative - with the use of standardized academic tests) and (summative - with the use of independent third-party tests). Students, working in teams, are evalu- ated based on team performance and individual contribution. Language Requirement Conditionally accepted international stu- dents with an undergraduate degree that was taught in a language other than Eng- lish are required to successfully complete additional language-related coursework and third-party assessment testing before joining the program. Academic Preparation Students with undergraduate preparation in a non-business field may be required to complete up to 12 credits of preparatory coursework. Students with a strong academ-ic record (B or better in each case) from an accredited university may be able to waive preparatory foundation courses. Account-ing & Business Law (ACCT500) requires both managerial and financial accounting, as well as any course labelled business law that included contracts and tort law. Eco- nomics & Finance (ECON500) requires both micro- and macro- economics, as well as fi-nance that included time value of money. Information Systems & Quantitative Methods (ITKM500) requires information systems, intermediate Excel, and either MS Excel- or SAS-based statistics or research methods. Management & Marketing (MGMT500) re-quires organizational behavior, operations management, and marketing or any similarly named course that includes branding and consumer behavior. Preparatory Courses: Acquiring the Foundation for Success (12 Credits) This coursework provides the basic funda- mentals across the business disciplines that serve as a necessary foundation for the MBA program. ACCT500 Accounting & Business Law ECON500 Economics & Finance ITKM500 Information Technology & Quantitative Methods MGMT500 Management & Marketing MBA Program Curriculum: (total of 36 credits) Three Components: Core, Concentration, and Capstone Core Courses (18 credits) In the six Core courses you will apply the theory from the Foundation coursework through cases and real-world exercises. ACCT505 Managerial & Cost Accounting FIN505 Advanced Financial Management ITKM505 Information Systems & Knowl- edge Management MGMT505 Organizational Behavior MGMT555 Global Project Management MKTG505 Marketing & Branding Concentration Courses (9 credits) Because many careers require specialized and in-depth knowledge and skills in spe- cific business areas, the program provides students with the opportunity to complete three courses of in-depth study in an area of their choice. Students may choose from eight concentrations. Accounting Analytics Intelligence Entrepreneurship Finance General Human Resources International Marketing188Capstone Courses (9 credits) The Capstone experience provides the final integration of student learning across the disciplines and the application of concepts learned to practical and competitive situa-tions. Capstone (9 credits) Integration (required) o BUCP597 Strategy & Policy Practicum (select one) o MGMT582 Business Planning o BUCP589 Cases in Ethics, Innovation, & Leadership o BUCP588 Research Methods Experiential (select one) o MGMT582 Business Planning o BUCP589 Cases in Ethics, Innovation, & Leadership o BUCP598 Thesis (requires GLDP501: advisor assigned by discipline) o BUCP599 Internship eligibility for Transfer Credits in the 36-credit upper-level program Courses For students who have earned graduate credit from a regionally accredited university that is not included in a conferred degree: No more than two (graduate) three-credit courses may be transferred into the MBA program. For students who have earned graduate credit from the Trefz School that is not included in a conferred degree: all appli- cable (graduate) three-credit courses may be transferred into the MBA program. MBA/MS Dual-Degree Program The Trefz School offers students the opportu-nity to acquire concurrent (students must not be eligible to graduate from either program until the final semester) graduate degrees within the Trefz School in which students may apply up to 15 credit hours to both pro- grams. A minimum of 51 credit hours must be completed to satisfy the requirements of this dual-degree program. Multiple MBA Concentrations Students may gain additional concentrations by successfully completing three courses in any of the eight concentrations (courses may not be counted twice toward concentra-tions). Students may receive a double con- centration in their original concentration by taking three additional advanced courses in the discipline. MBA/Engineering Partnership In an arrangement, with the School of En-gineering, approved Engineering courses offered by the College of Engineering are available for students in the MBA degree. Specific courses for this study are selected with - and approved by - the student's advi- sor. Progression/Sequence of Coursework Preparatory coursework is the first step: Stu- dents start their studies by completing all necessary Preparatory courses. Once all the Preparatory courses have been completed, students may enter the formal MBA program. In some cases, students may take a combi- nation of Preparatory and Core courses dur - ing their transition into the Program, but students should not take a Preparatory and advanced class in the same discipline at the same time (e.g. ITKM500 and ITKM505). Students begin the formal MBA program by completing the six Core courses (in any order). The three Capstone courses should be taken in the final semester, or final two semesters, and must only be taken once all Core courses have been successfully com- pleted (not concurrently). Fulltime Status Fulltime status requires at least three classes per semester (spring and fall) for interna- tional students and at least two classes per semester for domestic students. International students on an F1 or J1 visa may take fewer than 9 credits only once during their gradu- ate tenure (spring and fall semesters), which is only permitted in their final semester. Grading Policy A grade of C or better is required for credit toward graduation in all preparatory and program coursework. Students are expected to maintain a semester GPA of 3.0 or bet-ter throughout their studies. Those students who earn a semester GPA below 3.0 will be placed on probation and must comply with the associated formal process to successfully maintain proper status. Requirements for Graduation To qualify for the award of the degree of Master of Business Administration, a student must fulfill the following minimum require- ments: 1. Admitted to candidacy for the degree in the School of Business. 2. Satisfactorily complete all academic re-quirements with a cumulative grade point average grade of \"B\" (CGPA = 3.0) or bet- ter. 3. File an application for the award of the degree at the Registrar's Office on or be- fore the date published in the University Calendar. 4. Complete all academic requirements within five (5) years from the date of first registration, unless a petition for exten- sion is granted.

If admitted, priority candidates receive pre-ferred course registration. In addition to the general admissions require- ments listed above, admission decisions for the Clinical Mental Health Counseling con-centration will give careful consideration to indicators of candidate life experience and maturity (e.g., successful work experience in a human service field). A personal interview is also required. Applicants who hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university but do not meet one or more of the above criteria may be admitted provisionally. Those without the recommended background in Psychology will be required to take additional psychol- ogy-related coursework as part of their de-gree program. Those admitted on provisional status may be fully admitted once they have completed 12 credits of coursework with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher. Although students may enter the program in any term, it is advised to begin in the fall. Students who begin in the spring or summer may have limited course options.Programs The Division of Counseling offers a Master of Science degree in Counseling with concen-trations in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and College Student Personnel. In addition to the master's degree, a Certificate of Advanced Study (CAS) is offered for those who wish to take specialized courses beyond the masters and/or complete licensure requirements. Stu- dents who apply to one program and wish to transfer to another must apply to change programs. Upon entry into a program, students plan an individualized plan of studies with their advi- sor in which graduate transfer credit of no more than six credits may be included. While students can take courses at their own pace, all of the counseling degree programs require a minimum of two years to complete. There is a set sequence of courses for each concen- tration and some courses have prerequisites. Courses are offered once a year, typically in the evening or on weekends. In addition, there is a seven year time limit for completion of all degree requirements. Typically students take two or three courses each term. Many students have full or part-time employment. Although it is possible to take all course work in the late afternoon, evening, or on weekends, some additional time during the day may be required to meet course expectations. This is especially true for internship placement. Professional Licensure Students interested in licensure should con-sult the state in which they wish to practice for specific requirements. The State of Con- necticut requires 60 credit masters degree.. Specific areas of coursework are also re- quired. In addition, candidates for licensure must complete supervised clinical experienc-es and obtain a qualifying score on a stan- dardized examination. Students who wish to pursue licensure should select the Clinical Mental Health Counseling concentration. Certificate of Advanced Study For individuals who hold a master's degree in Counseling or a closely related field but lack one or more of the requirements for licen- sure as a professional counselor, the Division of Counseling and Human Resources offers a specialized program of study leading to a Certificate of Advanced Study (CAS) in Clini-cal Mental Health Counseling. The require-192ments of this program are individualized to the needs and goals of each student and con- sist of 30 credits. Practicum The practicum is designed to allow students to develop their counseling skills in a closely supervised setting. The course instructor, stu- dent's advisor, and site supervisor determine appropriate practicum activities. Activities could include observing/shadowing, attend- ing staff meetings, tutoring, advising, inter - viewing professional staff members, studying materials and procedure manuals, and other support functions. Internship Following the practicum and prerequisite courses, students will pursue an internship. The goal of the internship is to further de- velop and refine the skills established during practicum. You are eligible for the internship component of your program after completing the required coursework and approval from faculty. The internship is the heart of the mas- ter's degree training program in Counseling at the University of Bridgeport (UB). It provides a venue within which students receive the guidance necessary for development as an entry-level counselor. Program faculties pro-vide didactic and experiential training, which serves as the foundation for the development of skills necessary for independent work in clinical settings. The internship operationaliz- es this training and, in the person of the clini- cal supervisor, personifies the profession with which the intern ideally identifies. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the type of internship site that you choose and you should discuss this closely with your ad- visor. Successful internship training can only occur when program faculty and site super - visors form a close collaborative relationship with the mission of providing quality training and the development of the intern as a whole person. Internships are not guaranteed and approval to attend internship is dependent upon students' performance both interper - sonally and academically. Internships must be completed over two semesters, typically over the course of a full academic year, starting in the fall and ending in the spring.Learning Outcomes Graduates in Clinical Mental Health Counsel-ing will: Evidence understanding of the role of a counselor; including ethical practice, coun- selor behaviors and professional associa- tions As measured by: Internship, Participation in professional associations, C570, C568 Demonstrate knowledge, awareness and skills requisite for counseling persons from different cultural contexts and of different levels of ability As measured by: C512,C545, Internship, CPCE Apply counseling theories, techniques and intervention to practice; in individual and group settings As measured by: C505, C570, Internship, C512, C540 Demonstrate knowledge of the ethical use of appraisal instruments As measured by: C582, CPCE Demonstrate an ability to diagnose mental health status As measured by: C515, Internship Demonstrate an ability to review counsel- ing research and integrate its contribution to specific areas of knowledge As measured by: C535, CPCE Demonstrate knowledge of, and skills in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy As measured by: C505, C570, Internship Graduates in College Student Personnel will: Demonstrate knowledge, awareness and skills requisite for working with students from different cultural contexts and of dif- ferent levels of ability As measured by: C545, Internship Demonstrate an ability to review field re- lated research and integrate its contribution to specific areas of knowledge As measured by: C536 Apply knowledge of counseling theories and developmental theory as well as best practices in Student Affairs and student As measured by: Internship, C512, C555, Cumulative Exam Evidence understanding of role of the Stu- dent Affairs professional; including ethical behavior and professional affiliation As measured by: Internship, Professional As- sociations Demonstrated an ability to assess needs of different groups within a particular college environment, develop appropriate program, implement and assess program As measured by: Internship Demonstrate understanding of the historical influences that have shaped student affairs practice As measured by: C527, Cumulative Exam Demonstrate knowledge of current issues in higher education and the purpose and function of student affairs practice in higher education As measured by: C503, C520, Cumulative Exam Demonstrate an ability to integrate the knowledge and awareness gained to indi-vidual courses As measured by: Cumulative Exam Graduates in Human Services will: Evidence understanding of the role of a counseling professional; including ethical practice, behaviors and professional asso- ciations As measured by: Internship, C568, profes-sional associations Demonstrate knowledge, awareness and skills requisite for working with persons from different cultural contexts and of dif- ferent levels of ability in a counseling setting As measured by: C510, C545, Internship Apply counseling theories, techniques and intervention to practice; in individual and group settings As measured by: C505, C540, Internship Demonstrate knowledge of the historical influences within human services and the management within the human service en- vironment As measured by: C532, C625, C620 Demonstrate an ability to review counsel- ing research and integrate its contribution to specific areas of knowledge As measured by: C535, Masters Project Demonstrate an ability to integrate the knowledge and awareness gained to indi-vidual courses As measured by: Internship, Masters Project Summary of Requirements Masters students in the Division of Counsel- ing are required to complete the following courses:Counseling Master of Science Degree193COnCenTrATIOn In CLInICAL MenTAL HeALTH COunseLIng (CMHC) The concentration in Clinical Mental Health Counseling is designed to prepare students for work as mental health counselors and re- quires advanced coursework in clinical skills, psychopathology, appraisal procedures, ad- diction, and psychotherapeutic techniques.

White Arnold Bernhard Center Telephone: (203) 576-4036 Fax: (203) 576-4042 alwhite@bridgeport.edu Design is quickly moving to the center many organizations' core strategy. Such companies achieve a significant competitive advan- tage through the implementation of effec-tive design thinking. New demands are be- ing placed on designers, and new skills are needed to fully integrate into the business landscape of the 21st century. Design Management is more than the study of business and design, it is a fundamen- tal belief within an organization that design can improve productivity, create more in-novative products, lower operational costs and create a more sustainable work envi- ronment. The field of Design Management encompasses every discipline of design, in- cluding graphic and communication; indus- trial design and engineering; architecture and interior; and fashion and textile design. The MPS Design Management program at Shintaro Akatsu School of Design (SASD) emphasizes the following five core aspects of design and business: LeAdersHIp Design Managers lead teams of design- ers, which requires a specific set of skills to develop the leadership style that's right for the individual and the team. Addition-ally, Design Managers are often asked to champion ideas throughout an organiza-tion. Both of these types of leadership skills are emphasized in this program, resulting in graduates with strong leadership skills. sTrATegy Design and strategy are deeply connected. Design Managers who graduate from this program will be able to develop concepts that support and promote the core strategy of their organization, and articulate that strategy in a clear and persuasive way. MArkeTIng Understanding the principles of marketing is critical to effective Design Management. Promotion, product design, package de- sign, and the design of the physical plant often all fall under the responsibility of the Design Manager. Upon completing the courses in this program, students will have working knowledge of these issues. OperATIOns Through interactive simulations and case study research, Design Management stu- dents gain a deep understanding of the operational procedures within an organiza-tion. The courses in this program help stu- dents identify, understand, and influence efficient operational practices. fInAnCe Students will be able to read and compre-hend financial statements such as annual reports, cash flow statements, and balance sheets to more effectively integrate design proposals with business functions within their organization.

The Educational Leadership with Ad- ministration and Supervision program at the University of Bridgeport seeks to develop leaders who can accomplish all of the fol-lowing: 1. Develop a shared vision for student learning that creates meaning for the people in the organization and infuses purpose into the strategies and standards for actions linked to that vision. 2. Promote an instructional program, built on high expectations for all learners and conducive to student learning and pro-fessional growth, thereby developing a school culture of success for all learners. 3. Establish positive learning environ- ments by developing trust and credibility through meaningful relationships. 4. Establish a culture that is open and in- clusive, through modeling and expecting ethical and moral behaviors from all. A student who holds a Master's degree from an accredited college or university may ap- ply to in the Sixth Year program. The Pro- fessional Diploma program consists of thirty semester hours. The Sixth Year Program, leading to the pro- fessional Diploma in Educational Leadership with Administration and Supervision, is de- signed to meet requirements leading to ad- ministrator and supervisor certification (092). This Connecticut State Certification enables a candidate to apply for leadership positions other than Superintendent of Schools (093 certification). With the exception of Reading and Language arts, this certification would also include subject area consultant and cur - riculum coordinator.Intermediate Administrator (092 Certification) Certification Track Summary of Requirements (30 SEMESTER HOURS) CERTIFICATION REQUIRES COURSES IN EACH OF THE FIVE AREAS, AND A TOTAL OF 24 CREDITS BEYOND THE MASTER'S ________ REQUIRED CORE __________________________________ I.

It is designed to enhance and improve the effectiveness of public and private organization leaders, school adminis- trators, and researchers. Graduates and cur - rent students have held and hold significant positions in state-wide school systems, for- profit, non-profit institutions, colleges, and universities. The advanced graduate curricu-lum integrates the sound principles of admin- istration, management, organizational psy- chology, information technology, program evaluation, quantitative, qualitative, action, and mixed research methodologies. The program is specifically tailored to the working professional and is offered on a part- time basis (two evenings per week) at the U.B. Campus. Consequently, all courses and seminar are conveniently scheduled around the job of the working professional. The suc- cessful completion of the program leads to the Doctor of Education degree (Ed.D.). The Doctoral Program takes into consider - ation the needs of such personnel in terms of both the content of the curriculum, orienta- tion, and program organization. It is offered at the University of Bridgeport campus easily accessible from New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts by car, train, or ferry. The program requires a minimum of four years for completion, including three years of formal study, and a minimum of one year to complete the dissertation. During the first two years, students' typically take one six credit doctoral seminar and one three credit research-evaluation course per semester. Stu-dents should take online-hybrid classes dur - ing year one and two summers as part of the residency requirement in the program. 1.

Residency A substantial period of residence must be included in a doctoral program to provide significant faculty-student interaction, oppor - tunities for exposure to and engagement with cognate disciplines and research scholars working in those disciplines, and significant face-to-face peer interaction among graduate students. Residency is established through continuous enrollment, fall, spring, and sum- mer with a minimum of 3 credits per semes-ter. Residency provides the opportunity for a mentor-apprentice relationship between fac- ulty and students and time for in- depth and direct faculty support of students. Thus, the intent of the residency requirement is to en- sure that doctoral students contribute to and benefit from the complete spectrum of edu- cational, professional, and enrichment oppor - tunities provided on and off the University of Bridgeport campus. 3. Dissertation Preparation The dissertation proposal draft is a 12-15 page overview of the student's ideas for their dis- sertation. The proposal draft which is cre- ated in the first year of the program as part of EDLD 811-Introduction to Research, EDLD 812-Quantative Research, and EDLD-813-Lit- erature Review should provide guidance for the selection of dissertation committee mem- bers as well as a basis for further expansion of the dissertation methodology and proce-dures which occurs in EDLD 814-Qualitaa-tive Research and EDLD 815-Mixed Methods Research. The purpose for the dissertation proposal draft is to state the problem, pur - pose, research questions, methodology, and procedures to conduct the research project. The proposal draft will include a graphic depiction of the methodology and methods, and a time line for completion of the disser - tation proposal including literature review and Human Subject approval. Discussing the research proposal in draft format with a po- tential committee chair, other potential com- mittee members, and peers will enable the student to obtain advice early in the disserta- tion process as to the suitability of the topic and as to whether or not the research ques-tions and methodologies are logical, appro- priate, and sound. 4. Comprehensive Examination and Dissertation Proposal All matriculated doctoral students wishing to become doctoral candidates must pass a written comprehensive examination. Pas- sage of the comprehensive exam coincides with the final dissertation proposal. The comprehensive exam will consist of: (a) one research methodological question; (b) one program focus question; and (c) one area of specialization question related to the stu- dents' dissertation topic. The questions will be designed by the doctoral faculty and the student to rigorously assess the mastery and synthesis of knowledge garnered during coursework. Further, it is intended to gauge the student's potential for independent dis- sertation research. Students should take the exam at the conclusion of their third year, after all coursework has been completed. Students will have 30 days to complete the take home comprehensive exam. Each ques- tion should be 15 pages with no less than 15 appropriate citations per question represent-ing coursework in the program, and the stu- dents' research in their specialization strand. Following APA 6th edition is mandatory! The dissertation proposal is a required com- ponent of the doctoral program, and must be approved for a student to become a doctoral candidate. The student, the student's Chair, and the School of Education expect to see evidence of careful attention to APA 6th style and format in the proposal document. The UB Doctoral Guidelines are derived from standard practices among universities, librar - ies, and publishers. The student is expected to read and follow the Guidelines through-208out the proposal preparation. The proposal includes the student's statement of a re- search problem and the chosen method of investigating it. The proposal is the first step toward completion of the dissertation, which is an original contribution to one's field of study. The study may be applied research; it may be experimental, quasi-experimental, or non-experimental in its design; it may in- clude quantitative, qualitative, action, mixed or critical methodology. Writing the disserta- tion proposal begins immediately upon en- tering the Ed.D. program guided by a unique sequence of six 3-credit courses (EDLD: 811, 812, 813, 814, 815, 816). It is essential that the student be capable of discussing the the-oretical basis of a proposed study and the specific methodologies and is approved by IRB and the dissertation committee before the student begins formal data collection. A proposal draft should contain the following headings: 5. Dissertation-Doctoral Candidacy Once the student has successfully passed the Comprehensive Examination and completed the Dissertation Proposal, he or she is eligi- ble to apply to be a Doctoral Candidate. The student should submit the form \"Admission to Doctoral Candidacy\" to the Director. This designation will be conveyed to the student by an official letter from the School of Edu- cation and/or the Department of Educational Leadership. Doctoral Candidacy allows the student to register for dissertation advising EDLD 850 which is a 0 credit course but is deemed to be full time. A student must be a candidate for at least two semesters prior to the granting of the degree. Student may not, unless granted a waiver, defend the dis-sertation during the semester immediately following the semester during which he or she completed the proposal. The purpose of this requirement is to assure a minimal lapse of time for effective work on the dissertation after acquisition of the basic competence and after delineation and approval of the re- search problem and methodology. Once stu- dents are advanced to candidacy they must be enrolled in EDLD 850 continuously for dissertation advising and supervision (fall, spring and summer semesters) until gradu-ation. If the student is not advanced to can- didacy within six years from the time of ad- mission to the doctoral program, the student should be dismissed from the program. Each student has a three-member dissertation committee, the director of the Ed.D. Pro- gram, and the Dean of School of Education. Note: Completion of Doctoral Degree The degree must be completed within seven years of the date from which the student started coursework in the doctoral program. In exceptional cases, the department may recommend that the Dean grant an exten- sion of this limit.Educational Leadership Doctor of Education Degree209Electrical Engineering Master of Science Degree Chair: Navarun Gupta Engineering Building Telephone: (203) 576-4117 Fax: (203) 576-4750 Email: navarung@bridgeport.edu This Program is designed to increase the stu- dent's knowledge and competence in basic areas necessary for Modern Electrical Engi- neering, while affording sufficient freedom to allow an in-depth study of such areas as Communications, Control Systems, Electron- ics and Digital Processing.

Furthermore, customized study plans to al- low receiving the Electrical Engineering M.S. degree while pursuing either the Ph.D. de- gree in Computer Science and Engineering or the Ed.D. degree in Education are avail- able. Doctoral students in these two pro-grams should consult their respective doc-toral advisors to work on their individualized plans. Further details on the dual M.S. in Electrical Engineering degree programs are available in the catalog section on Graduate Studies Division. Admission Requirements Students must have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering or a related field. In both cases, the department may require make-up of background deficiencies. COURSE REQUIREMENTS _________________ A. A total of 30 semester hours is required in an approved program of study. Some students in this program enter with an undergraduate record lower than desired. These students are told in their admit let- ter that they must take 33 or 36 or 39 credits for their MS in E.E program. B. The Master's thesis is optional. If under - taken, it counts as 6 semester hours and must be conducted under the supervision of an EE Department faculty member. If the Master's thesis is not taken, then EE-597 must be taken for 3 credits. C. 400 or 500 level courses in Electrical En- gineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science are acceptable, with advisor approval, to count for the course requirements of the MS in E.E program. D. It is recognized that not all students will have the necessary depth of study in their preparatory program for the MSEE. Con- sequently, the Department may permit a maximum of two undergraduate electives to be taken for graduate credit. E. A total of one course in Mechanical En-gineering or Technology Management is allowed to be taken toward the Master of Science in electrical Engineering. The elective courses may be chosen from the list of Electrical Engineering concentra- tion areas or chosen in consultation with the graduate advisor. The course requirements of the concentra- tion areas are described in the Graduate Studies Division section of the catalog. The concentration areas can be applied to satisfy the requirements of dual Masters de-gree programs of study.Learning Outcomes Students in the M.S. Electrical Engineering Program will be able to 1) demonstrate the ability to use techniques, skills and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice; 2) demonstrate the ability to plan and conduct laboratory experiments and in- terpret and report results; 3) demonstrate the ability to identify and apply concepts of en- gineering economics and project planning; 4) demonstrate knowledge of contemporary global and societal issues and their relation- ship; and 5) exercise strong oral and written communication skills including those need-ed for technical writing.210Associate Professor: pmaymin@bridgeport.edu The UB MS in Finance Value Proposition The Master of Science in (MSF) is a 30-credit graduate program designed to meet the needs of a distinct type of professional in the finance industry. The MSF develops the abil-ity of students whose career goals include specialist, technical, and management roles in financial enterprises. The program accom-plishes its mission by developing student expertise in financial instruments, financial technology, financial analysis and financial management. Positive program outcomes will be achieved through the knowledge and skills the students will acquire from a com-prehensive curriculum design, instruction in an effective learning environment, opportu- nities for inquiry, and professional develop-ment. This program largely leverages our existing offerings. Students learn concepts in risk, finance, in- vestments, and analytics that provide the basis for careers in finance. Students also develop the technical and quantitative skills needed to pursue a variety of careers in the finance industry. While more specific and analytical in nature, these learning outcomes are in line with our institutional mission, and our MBA program. Students will learn how to evaluate and price a financial opportunity. They will learn how to gauge the appropriate level of risk to discount future projections. They will learn how to compare across investment oppor - tunities at a given time and how to allocate among them in an optimal way. They will learn how to create useful tools for answer - ing financial questions so that reports could be generated automatically and progress can be tracked. They will learn how to both as- sess and manage risk. Most importantly and most generally, they will learn how to solve financial problems with finely honed prob- lem-solving skills via analytical capabilities and data-driven decision-making. Program Characteristics Although students with work experience will find maximum benefit from the MSF, no pre-vious work experience is required. The cur - riculum is designed to recognize and accom- modate substantial diversity in preparation and experience as well as the different goals and career expectations of students. For this reason, some students may be required to complete preparatory coursework to suc-cessfully graduate from the 30-credit MSF program. Flexible course delivery enables students to proceed at their desired pace. Most students complete the MSF program in 18 to 24 months. Learning Outcomes: Students will integrate the knowledge and skills they have gained throughout their graduate program to develop and evaluate financial and risk management strategies by: Technical Demonstrating an understanding of con- cepts learned throughout their graduate program Testing a hypothesis or market strategy through robust historical evaluation Using research, methods, and instru- ments to price assets, evaluate risk, and manage portfolios Explain and differentiate standard finan- cial models and their assumptions Human Communicating complicated information at a professional level using appropriate acumen Demonstrating initiative, discipline, and follow-through on assignments Facilitating meaningful dialogue and reasoned disagreements related to class topics and current financial events Conceptual Evaluating the advantages and disadvan- tages associated with evolving regulatory environments Analyzing organizational decisions relat- ing to risk management and financial practice Applying the theories and techniques learned throughout the graduate finance program Learning Outcomes will be assessed using the following measures: participation in classroom activities ad- dressing current financial events, preparing case studies, creating one-off back tests of financial hypotheses, performing simulations, developing reusable financial and risk management tools, performing due diligence research proj- ects, writing 5-to-10-page papers on critical financial topics, presenting findings in a five-minute pro- fessional presentation, and one capstone exercise reflecting their accumulated knowledge and skills. Language Requirement Conditionally accepted international stu- dents with an undergraduate degree that was taught in a language other than Eng- lish are required to successfully complete additional language-related coursework and third-party assessment testing before joining the program. Academic Preparation Students with undergraduate preparation in a non-business field may be required to com- plete up to 12 credits of preparatory course- work. Students with a strong academic record (B or better in each case) from an accredited university may be able to waive prepara- tory foundation courses. Accounting & Busi-ness Law (ACCT500) requires both manage- rial and financial accounting, as well as any course labelled business law that included contracts and tort law. Economics & Finance (ECON500) requires both micro- and macro- economics, as well as finance that included time value of money. Information Systems & Quantitative Methods (ITKM500) requires information systems, intermediate Excel, and either MS Excel- or SAS-based statistics or re- search methods. Management & Marketing (MGMT500) requires organizational behav-ior, operations management, and marketing or any similarly named course that includes consumer behavior.

For students who have earned graduate credit from the Trefz School that is not included in a con-ferred degree: all applicable (graduate) three-credit courses may be transferred into the MSF program. MS/MBA Dual-Degree Program The Trefz School offers students the opportu-nity to acquire concurrent (students must not be eligible to graduate from either program until the final semester) graduate degrees within the Trefz School in which students may apply up to 15 credit hours to both pro- grams. A minimum of 51 credit hours must be completed to satisfy the requirements of this dual-degree program. STEM Designation The MSF is classified by ICE (U.S. Immigra- tion and Customs Enforcement) as a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) degree. Progression/Sequence of Coursework Preparatory coursework is the first step. In some cases, students may take a combina- tion of Preparatory and Core courses during their transition into the Program. Students begin the formal MSF program by complet- ing the eight Core courses (in any order). The Capstone courses should be taken in the final semester, or final two semesters. Fulltime Status Fulltime status requires at least three classes per semester (spring and fall) for interna- tional students and at least two classes per semester for domestic students. International students on an F1 or J1 visa may take fewer than 9 credits only once during their gradu- ate tenure (spring and fall semesters), which is only permitted in their final semester. Grading Policy A grade of C or better is required for credit toward graduation in all preparatory and program coursework. Students are expected to maintain a semester GPA of 3.0 or bet-ter throughout their studies. Those students who earn a semester GPA below 3.0 will be placed on probation and must comply with the associated formal process to successfully maintain proper status. Requirements for Graduation To qualify for the award of the degree of Master of Science in Finance, a student must fulfill the following minimum requirements: 1. Admitted to candidacy for the degree in the School of Business. 2. Satisfactorily complete all academic re- quirements with a cumulative grade point average grade of \"B\" (CGPA = 3.0) or bet- ter. 3.

Dana Hall Room 142 Email: agrazia@bridgeport.edu Program Overview The Doctor of Health Sciences (D.H.Sc.) is a terminal academic degree program that can be described as a combination of the Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) and the Doctor of Public Health (DPH) degrees. The goal is to provide a solid foundation in the health sciences while developing skills in research design and analysis, best-practices in clinical care and education. It is envisioned to con- tribute significantly to the personal and pro-fessional growth of healthcare professionals and educators. This program offers students with master's degrees the opportunity for continuing academic training and advance-ment in their fields. There are currently two areas of concentration: health care clinician and education. The Doctor of Health Scienc- es is an academic degree and not a clinical healthcare degree, but one which prepares healthcare professionals with tools of admin-istration and scholarship. The goals are to enable health professionals to become better clinicians, teach in colleges and universities, or become health care administrators. For those interested in research, this program provides the foundation for both qualitative and quantitative research as core values in the educational process. Concentration Areas This D.H.Sc. program is currently designed with two tracks: 1) Health care clinician track 2) Education track. Students will have the option of taking courses from both tracks, as electives. This program has the potential to grow and add new tracks as demands and needs arise in the future. Admission Requirements Master's degree from a regionally accredited institution with a graduate cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher, or a First Pro- fessional Doctorate from a regionally accred- ited institution and professionally accredited program of study (Where appropriate). Health care experience, professional cre-dentials, licensure in a health related field or experience teaching in higher education is preferred. Applicants without health care or teaching experience will be evaluated on their potential for success such as significant leadership in education and the clinical en- vironment. Outcomes of the Program Become leaders with the skills and knowledge to initiate changes in healthcare environments Have the ability to analyze and influence public policy related to healthcare services Possess the skills necessary to effectively utilize evidence to support best practice clinical decisions Have the knowledge to integrate evidence-informed complementary medicine modalities into care delivery Have the ability to use research to solve problems and make ethical decisions in healthcare settings. Effectively serve as consultants to patients, clients, community organizations, and professional colleagues Generate more professors with improved higher education pedagogy InsTruCTIOnAL fOrMAT This 61 credit degree program will be on a three term per year schedule and a cohort will be accepted for the beginning of each of the three terms: fall, spring and summer. All of the course work can be completed online, except for a one week on campus residency. Along with the online course work, students are also required to complete a disserta- tion. Taking two courses per term, students should be able to complete the program in about 40 months. dIsser TATIOn Each student will be assigned a faculty advi-sor prior to beginning their dissertation proj- ect. Students will complete a three-course dissertation sequence that is designed to as-sist the student with the doctoral dissertation project. The aim of this sequence of cours- es is to ensure that each student is making progress toward the desired endpoint. To complete the degree, students must com-plete the required dissertation sequence including submitting the dissertation which must be accepted by a dissertation commit-tee. The dissertation topic can be an area of in- terest selected by you, with the approved of your adviser. Students will be working with their adviser and receive guidance through-out the dissertation process. The dissertation for the D.H.Sc. degree does not necessarily have to involve original research, but for example, can be a research paper, literature review, meta-analysis or a systematic review. There is no formal oral defense, however, the dissertation must be approved by the committee members. The dissertation committee shall consist of a minimum of three qualified faculty members. At least two members of the committee shall be from the University of Bridgeport. All committee members must possess a terminal degree and should have some expertise in the area. The student will work closely with their committee chair, who will primarily be responsible for supervising the student's work and guiding the student's progress. The committee members will be responsi-ble for periodically reviewing the student's progress and providing timely feedback. The responsibility of the entire committee is to examine the dissertation and meet to make a final determination concerning its accept- ability. The decision of the dissertation com-mittee will be pass or fail. Students will have the opportunity to present their dissertation during the one week on campus seminar.

In addition, two (3-credit hours) courses at the five- hundred or six-hundred level from the Technology Management Department are required to satisfy the Information Technology Globalization Track require- ment. Only courses with at least B grade can be counted towards satisfying the course requirements. 2. A two-semester teaching practice re- quirement (3 credit hours each), for which students are to register with no fees. The students will be expected to teach lower undergraduate level classes, and/or assist professors as teaching as- sistants (i.e., perform a significant teach-ing role), thus giving Ph.D. graduates experience for an academic teaching career. 3. At least 15 semester hours of disserta- tion research, culminating in a disserta- tion proposal defense and dissertation defense. 4. Comprehensive examination: written and oral (proposal defense). 5. Publication of at least two journal pa- pers, or one journal paper and two refereed conference papers, within the course of the Ph.D. topic research. These publications are not required to be single-authored by the student and they might be co-authored with mem- bers of the dissertation committee. The journals and conferences are expected to meet quality metrics established by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. B. Time and Load Guidelines: Both full and part-time students are en-couraged to apply for the Ph.D. degree, which should be completed within a maxi- mum of seven calendar years. A Ph.D. stu-dent (part-time or full-time) is expected to devote the necessary time to courses and research to make satisfactory progress to- ward the degree. Satisfactory progress in- cludes active participation in the research and teaching environment of the School of Engineering. The student advisor and dis- sertation committee should advise the stu-dent as to her/his progress in the program. Full-time students are required to register for at least 9 credit hours each semester while part-time students are required to register for at least 6 credit hours per aca- demic year (spring and fall semesters). C. Course Work: A Ph.D. candidate must complete at least 30 credit hours of course work, not includ-ing the dissertation, beyond the MSc. de- gree. Upper level undergraduate remedial courses cannot be used to fulfill the course work requirement. D. Course Grade Point Average: A Ph.D. student is expected to maintain a G.P.A. of 3.0 or more. If the G.P.A. falls below 3.0, the student is automatically placed on probation. Continued proba-tionary status for two semesters may lead to dismissal of the candidate from the pro- gram. No grade less than B is acceptable towards the course work requirement. E. Seminar Requirement: A Ph.D. student is expected to present her/his research findings in public semi- nars. S/he is also expected to interact and participate in professional discussions and meetings such as conferences and work- shops. To fulfill these requirements, a Ph.D. student is expected to present one seminar before the dissertation defense. The seminar of his/her research topic for the dissertation serves as the oral (pro-posal defense) part of the comprehensive exam. The Ph.D. Director awards a Pass/ Fail grade after consultation with the Ph.D. director student's dissertation advisor. The student is required to register for one sem- inar course. F. Core Courses: Ph.D. candidates are required to finish a set of 4 courses out of a list of 7 core courses. The Department of Computer Sci- ence and Engineering publishes a list of core courses every two years. The list is available through the Ph.D. Program Di- rector.

G. Comprehensive Examination: One of the major checkpoints in the Ph.D. program that assesses the breadth and depth of the student is the written and oral (proposal defense) comprehensive examination. Passing the Written Compre-hensive Examination is granted when the student achieves at least a 3.5 GPA in the 4 core courses with at least B grade in each course. The seminar requirement represents the oral (proposal defense) section of the exam. The outcome of this examination will be of fail or pass. A student can re- take this examination no more than once. A student who does not pass the compre- hensive examination in two attempts will be dismissed from the program. H. Dissertation Committee: After selecting a dissertation advisor, the student is required to define a problem of merit, carry out a literature search and prepare a course of action to solve the se- lected problem. The candidate is expected to produce a dissertation proposal. The dissertation advisor in consultation with the Ph.D. program Director, recommends a dissertation committee for the student. The dissertation committee includes at least three members in addition to the dis-sertation advisor. At least four members of the dissertation committee must be from a professorial rank within the school. Addi-tionally, an external examiner is appointed as well. It is expected that the dissertation Supervisor and at least 50% of the com-mittee membership has to be from profes- sorial ranks of the Computer Science and Engineering Department. The external examiner is one whom has been distin-guished in the field of computer science and engineering. S/he might not hold a professorial rank. Ph.D. Program Director and the Dean of the School of Engineering must then approve the dissertation com-mittee. I. Admission to Candidacy: When a student passes the written com-prehensive examination, s/he will be ad-mitted to Ph.D. candidacy. This serves as another significant milestone in progress towards the Ph.D. degree. I. Residency Requirement: The Ph.D. program is an on-campus pro- gram that has a two years residency re- quirement. Residency can be demonstrat-ed by taking on-campus classes, satisfying the teaching requirement, and attending seminars and meetings in the School of Engineering. J. Dissertation: The student is expected to work on the accepted topic and come up with origi- nal results. S/he has to report the results in the form of a Ph.D. dissertation. The student is encouraged to document the in- termediate results in the form of technical reports. S/he is also encouraged to pub-lish these results as they are discovered, in the international professional literature, i.e., refereed conference proceedings and journals. Proof of good work is the accep- tance of the results by reputed journals. Intermediate results can also be discussed in departmental seminars. The completed dissertation must be distributed to the dis- sertation committee members at least two weeks before the dissertation defense. The committee will read it and certify that the dissertation is a work of substantial merit and that it can be defended. It is the responsibility of the student that the final draft of the dissertation addresses all legiti-mate concerns of the committee members. K. Dissertation Defense Examination: After having secured approval from the dissertation committee members regard- ing the worthiness of the dissertation, a student will proceed with a request for the dissertation defense examination. The chairman of the dissertation committee will chair the examination. The student will schedule a convenient time for a pub- lic defense. It is the responsibility of the student to find a time that is suitable to all the members of the dissertation commit- tee, at least two weeks before the defense. At the end of the defense, the decision of the dissertation committee will be pass or fail. It is the responsibility of the disserta- tion advisor to see that the comments and the criticism of the audience are addressed adequately in the final version of the dis- sertation. Based on the recommendation of the dissertation committee, the Ph.D. Director, and the Departmental Chairman, the Dean of the School of Engineering will recommend the Ph.D. degree subject to the satisfaction of all other formal require-ments.

Admission Requirements The Ph.D. in Technology Management pro- gram is an advanced level program. Students are expected to demonstrate an understand- ing of fundamental concepts in management and technology gained through appropriate undergraduate and graduate (master) edu- cation. Students who are accepted into the Ph.D. program but lack some of those funda- mental concepts will be required to remedy their deficiencies through completing satisfac-tory undergraduate or graduate courses (with- out graduate credit). Students admitted to the Ph.D. program should have a business or management de- gree as well as an engineering, computer science or technology degree. To be more specific, a student should have either an (1) undergraduate Engineering or Technology (STEM* category) and an MBA or MS in Tech- nology Management or Engineering Man-agement or Management of Technology or equivalent degree; or (2) an undergraduate Business or Management or TM or MOT or equivalent and a Master's degree in Engineer - ing, Technology or STEM category, with at least a 3.3 GPA. Three+ years of industry ex-perience or equivalent is desired. Students ad- mitted from non-English speaking countries, having a Masters degree in engineering and an undergraduate in business or vice-versa will also be required to have a TOEFL score of at least 550 or equivalent (IBT = 80, IELTS = 6.5). The GRE exam is required for admission. Students with an undergraduate and graduate degree in engineering or a STEM category, with three or more years of business expe- rience, may also be accepted into the Ph.D. program. The applicant must submit two let- ters of reference and a personal statement (containing such information as background; experience, motivation for pursuing the Ph.D. in TM areas and suggested topics for potential dissertation research, etc.) Interested students in the Ph.D. program with- out a master's degree must apply and may be admitted into a master's program first, and then upon satisfactorily completing the mas-ter's degree, they would be eligible to apply for the Ph.D. program. This route assumes an appropriate Bachelor's degree (see above). *STEM = Science, Technology, Engineering or Math; MOT= Management of Technology. Please refer to both the General Admissions Information and the Ph.D. TM for detailed requirements. (http://www.bridgeport.edu/ admissions and http://www.bridgeport.edu/ Phd-TM) Academic Requirements The requirements for Ph.D. in TM students include the following: The Ph.D. in TM is an interdisciplinary de- gree for which all Ph.D. students must take a common core of five (5) required courses and choose from elective courses from Area 1 (New Technology Venture Creation) and Area 2 (Current and Emerging Technologies - Technology Specializations). Each student can choose elective courses from three study options (see below and Appendix 1). A list and short description of core and elective courses by specialization is provided in Ap- pendix 2. - Focus on Area 1 - New Technology Ven- ture Creation (e.g. Entrepreneurship and Corporate Venturing): Number of courses to be taken in Area 1 is three courses each from Area 1 and two courses each from Area 2 (in one of the Technology Specializations). - Focus on Area 2 - Current and Emerging Technologies - (Technology Specializa- tions) Number of courses to be taken in Area 2 is four from Area 2 from one of the following Technology Specialization areas and one from Area 1. The Technol- ogy Specialization areas focus on one of the following: Bio-Tech and Bio-Medical Technol- ogy, Systems and Processes Information Analytics, Technology and Decision Support Systems Manufacturing, Supply Chain and Lo- gistics Technology, Systems and Pro- cesses - Combination of Areas 1 and 2 - Number of courses to be taken is two each from Area 1 and three each from Area 2. In Area 2, the students must pick courses from one Technology Specialization area for depth coverage. TIMe And LOAd guIdeLInes The program will admit both full and part- time students. For all students, the program must be completed within a maximum of seven calendar years. If a student requires more than seven years, he/she must file a letter of appeal requesting a time extension to the Dean of the SOE and the Ph.D. pro- gram coordinator. A Ph.D. student (part-time or full-time) is expected to devote the neces-sary time to courses and research in order to make satisfactory progress toward the degree. Satisfactory progress includes active personal participation in the research and teaching en- vironment of the School of Engineering. The student advisor and dissertation committee should advise the student as to his/her prog- ress in the program. Full time students are re-quired to register for at least nine credit hours each semester while part-time students are re- quired to register for at least six credit hours per academic year (spring and fall semesters). TIMe LIMITs All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within the seven-year period (accumulating to 21 Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters) following admission to the doc-toral program. TIMe LIMIT exTensIOn requesT Under compelling circumstances beyond the student's control, a student may petition for a one-semester extension of the seven-year time limit. If the one-semester extension is recommended by the Ph.D. in Technology Management Program Director and approved by the Dean, the student has one additional semester to complete work on the disserta- tion. If the student fails to complete all degree requirements within the time for the student's doctoral program or within a one-semester ex- tension approved as noted above, the student will be dismissed from the doctoral program. To complete the doctoral degree, the student must reapply for admission. Policies do not provide the option to revalidate courses com-pleted more than six years prior to the date of admission. A readmitted student therefore would be able to apply to the new admis-sion only those courses approved by the de- partment and Graduate School and complete within the prior six years (accumulating to 18 Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters). COurse W Ork A Ph.D. candidate must complete at least 30 credit hours of course work, not including the dissertation, beyond the Masters degree. Upper level undergraduate remedial courses cannot be used to fulfill the coursework re- quirement. The Ph.D. dissertation will require a minimum of 15 credit hours to complete. Courses must be selected as follows:Technology Management Ph.D. Program2251. Five Core Courses of three credit hours each. 2. Additional five (three credit hours each) courses in specific areas** 3. A one-semester teaching practicum re- quirement (no credit hours). COurse grAde pOInT AverA ge A Ph.D. student is expected to maintain a G.P.A. of 3.0. If the cumulative G.P.A. falls be- low 3.0, the student is automatically placed on probation. (Note:grades for transferred courses are not included in the calculation of the University of Bridgeport GPA). Continued probationary status for two semesters will lead to dismissal of the student from the program. *Students admitted to the Ph.D. program should have a business or management de- gree as well as an engineering, computer science or technology degree. To be more specific, a student should have either: (1) An undergraduate Engineering or Technol-ogy (STEM = Science, Technology, Engineer - ing and Mathematics category) degree and an MBA or MS in Technology Management or Engineering Management or Management of Technology (MOT) or equivalent gradu- ate degree; or (2) an undergraduate Business or Management or TM or MOT or equivalent degree and a Master's degree in Engineering, Technology or STEM. ** Area 1 - New Technology Venture Creation and Area 2 - Select Current & Emerging Tech-nologies (see Ph.D. Program Structure for additional requirements and areas) No grade less than C is acceptable towards course work requirements. pH.d . prOgrAM dIreCTOr The Dean of the School of Engineering will ap- point a director for the doctoral program. The director supervises the implementation of the Ph.D. program. S/he is responsible for coordi- nating administrative functions related to the Ph.D. program including admission, market- ing, appointment of advisors, and formation of dissertation committees, for each doctoral stu- dent. In addition, the director is charged with preparing and administering the preliminary and the comprehensive examinations. The di- rector is also responsible for recommending courses for students who may not have the proper prerequisites for certain courses. AdvIsOr Each Ph.D. candidate, in her/his first semes- ter, will be assigned a program advisor by the Ph.D. program director. The advisor will de- velop a program of study for the student and monitor his/her progress until a dissertation committee is formed for the student. A dis- sertation advisor will be appointed for each student after he/she passes the comprehen- sive exams and perform all subsequent ad- vising. The program advisor and dissertation advisor may be the same person or two dif- ferent people. A student is required to form a dissertation committee in conjunction with the Ph.D. program director after finishing the core Ph.D. courses (and passing the candi- dacy examinations), so that a better under - standing of the various topics and research interests in the department will, by then, have been achieved. COMpreHensIve exAMInATIOn One of the major checkpoints in the Ph.D. program that assesses the breadth and depth of the student's academic accomplishment and progress is the candidacy examinations and oral dissertation proposal defense exami- nation. The candidacy examinations will test the breadth and depth of knowledge in all aspects of Technology Management related to the body of knowledge required for the Ph.D. in Technology Management, including but not limited to, the core curriculum courses, and the courses in Areas 1 and 2. The can- didacy examinations should be taken at the completion of all course work. The Ph.D. Program Director will organize these candidacy examinations, which will be developed and graded by faculty. The out- come of this examination will be a fail or pass. A student can sit for this examination twice. A student who does not pass the can- didacy examinations in two attempts will be dismissed from the program. A student may submit an appeal regarding the potential dis- missal from the program. dIsser TATIOn COMMITTee And OrAL defense Of pr OpOsed dIsser TATIOn T OpIC In A puBLIC seMInAr After passing the required examinations and selecting a dissertation advisor (or having an advisor appointed), a student is required to define a problem of merit, carry out a litera-ture search and prepare a course of action to solve the selected problem. The candidate is expected to produce a dissertation proposal, which must be orally defended in a public seminar. The Ph.D. director awards a Pass/Fail grade after consultation with the student's dis- sertation advisor and committee. The Ph.D. Program Director, in consultation with the dissertation advisor, recommends a dissertation committee for the student. The dissertation committee contains at least three members in addition to the dissertation advi- sor. At least four members of the dissertation committee must be from a professorial rank within the School of Engineering and/or other schools. Additionally, an external examiner is appointed as well. The external examiner is one who is distinguished in the field of Tech- nology Management. The Ph.D. Program Di- rector and the Dean of the School of Engineer - ing must approve the dissertation committee. AdMIssIOn TO CAndId ACy Every student enrolled in the Ph.D. in Tech- nology Management degree program must take a candidacy examination administered by the program director and the graduate faculty. The candidacy exam aims at assessing the ca- pability of the student conducting doctoral re- search based on evidence of critical thinking, problem solving, conducting original research and other measures viewed as essential func- tions of a successful doctoral student. When a student passes the candidacy examination and fulfills all other requirements, s/he will be admitted to Ph.D. candidacy. pH.d . dIsser TATIOn The student is expected to work on the ac-cepted topic and original results. S/he must report the results in the form of a Ph.D. dis- sertation. The student is encouraged to docu- ment the intermediate results in the form of technical reports. S/he is also encouraged to publish these results as they are discovered, in international professional literature, i.e. ref- ereed conference proceedings and journals. Intermediate results can also be discussed in departmental seminars. The completed dis- sertation must be distributed to the disserta- tion committee members at least two weeks before the dissertation defense. The commit- tee will read it and certify that the dissertation is a work of substantial merit and that it can be defended. It is the responsibility of the student that the final draft of the dissertation addresses all le- gitimate concerns of the committee members. dIsser TATIOn defense exAMInATIOn After securing approval from the dissertation Technology Management Ph.D. Program226committee members regarding the worthiness of the dissertation, a student will proceed with a request for the dissertation defense examination. The chair of the dissertation committee will chair the examination. The student will schedule a convenient time for a public defense. It is the responsibility of the student to find a time that is suitable to all the members of the dissertation committee, at least two weeks prior to the defense. At the end of the defense, the decision of the dissertation committee will be pass or fail. It is the responsibility of the dissertation advisor to see that the comments and the criticism of the audience are addressed adequately in the final version of the dissertation. Based on the recommendation of the dissertation com- mittee, the Ph.D. in Technology Management Director and the Dean of the School of En- gineering will recommend the Ph.D. degree, subject to the satisfaction of all other formal requirements.

Founded in 1931 with fewer than a dozen members, the Alumni Association has grown to include more than 35,000 mem bers. Alumni are always encouraged to visit the campus to attend events or just to indulge in nostalgia. An active and committed vol- unteer Board of Directors continues to man- age the Association's affairs, with a num- ber of activities planned each year. From athletic events to regional receptions and celebrations of alumni achievements, the calendar is always full. A university can only measure its success through the achievements of its alumni. The University of Bridgeport boasts a plethora of prominent graduates. They serve as cor - porate CEO's and university presidents, au-tomobile designers, commissioners of edu-cation, political leaders, television stars and prominent athletes. Their accomplishments reflect well on their alma mater, which in turn extends its gratitude. We would like to hear from you. Please email us at alumni@bridgeport.edu or call us at 203-576-4133.Alumni Association391The Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Acts And Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Acts The University is in compliance with the Student Right-to-Know Act of 1990 and Campus Awareness and Campus Security Acts of 1990. Reports, disclosures and other data are available in the University's Student Handbook, the Key to U.B., the Campus Public Safety Office and/or other official University publications. The University of Bridgeport Campus Public Safety Office keeps statistics concerning the occurrence on campus of certain criminal offenses, which were reported to them or to the local police. These statistics are pub-lished and distributed annually to the entire University of Bridgeport campus commu-nity, and to other interested parties. For further information, contact the Director of Campus Security, Dean of Students, or the University Attorney. FERPA The University of Bridgeport has designated the following types of information as direc-tory information which may be disclosed without consent: Student's full name and alias, if applicable; address; email address; telephone listings; major field study; degrees and awards received; dates of attendance; classification; participation in officially recognized sports or activities; weight and height of members of athletic teams; photographs; and enroll-ment status (undergraduate or graduate, full-time or part-time). Parents or eligible students have the right to refuse to permit the University of Bridge-port to designate any or all of those types of information as directory information with respect to a particular student, thereby preventing its disclosure as directory infor - mation. Forms indicating the intent of the parents or eligible students to request infor - mation be withheld can be obtained in the Office of the Registrar, and must be submit-ted within the first five class days to be ef-fective to avoid disclosure.Notification of Rights under FERPA The FamilyEducational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. Among these rights are: 1. Among these rights are to inspect and review the educational records within 45 days of the day the University receives the request for access. Students should submit to the Registrar a written request that identifies the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University Registrar will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where records may be inspected. If the Registrar does not maintain the records requested the Registrar will advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of their educational record that he/she be-lieves is in accurate or misleading. Stu-dents should ask the University to amend the record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the Registrar, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his/her right to a hearing regarding the re-quest for amendment. Additional infor - mation regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when no-tified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information con-tained in the student's education re-cords, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational in-terests. A school official is: A person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academ-ic or research, or support staff position, including health or medical staff. A person elected to the Board of Trustees. A person or entity employed by or under contract to the University to perform a special task, such as securi-ty, building and grounds, information technology, food service, an attorney, auditor, collection agency or other outside vendor. A student serving on an official com- mittee, such as a disciplinary or griev-ance committee, or who is assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate education-al interest if the official is: Performing a task that is specified in his or her position description or contract agreement, or is customarily performed by such person at the uni-versity. Performing a task related to a stu- dent's education. Performing a task related to the disci- pline of a student. Providing a service or benefit relat- ing to the student or student's family, such as health care, counseling, job placement or financial aid. Maintaining the safety and security of the campus. Upon request, the University discloses edu-cation records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. The Dean of Students or designee has the au- thority to notify parents or guardians when dependent students under the age of 21 are found to be in violation of the University alco- hol and/or drug policies for: 1) possession of a keg or large volume, 2) dispensing alcohol to a minor, 3) possession or distribution of controlled substances, 4) under age posses- sion or open container in a public space for a second time; or in cases where a student is subject to residence hall separation, suspen- sion, expulsion or required emergency medi- cal care because the student became ill from the consumption of alcohol and/or drugs. The notification is permissive and at the discretion of the university. The notification of parents or guardians is indicated when: 1) the viola-392The Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Acts And Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) tion involved harm or threat of harm to per - sons or property, or 2) the violation involved an arrest in which the student was taken into custody. Nothing in these guidelines shall prevent university officials from notifying parents or guardians of a health or safety emergency, or when a student, under the age of 21 is found to have violated university policy with respect to the use and/or consumption of alcohol or drugs. Whenever possible, students will be informed that parental notification is planned in advance of their parents receiving the no- tice. The notification of parents is simply an act of notice and is not subject to appeal. The Dean of Students or designee may dis- close the name and a summary of the infor - mation regarding the final outcome of a hear - ing if the student is found to have committed an act of violence. Students may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and ad- dress of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office US Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. Washington, DC 20202-4605 FERPA: Notice for Directory Information The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a Federal law, requires that the University of Bridgeport with certain excep-tions, obtain your written request prior to the disclosure closure of personally identi-fiable information from a student's educa-tional records. However, the University may disclose appropriately designated \"directory information\" without written consent. Ex-amples include: The annual yearbook; News releases Honor roll or other recognition lists; Graduation programs; and Sports activities sheets, such as weight and height of team members Directory information which is information that is generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if released, can also be disclosed to outside organizations. Outside organizations include, but are not limited to companies that manufacture class rings or publish yearbooks. If you do not wish the University to disclose directory information without prior written consent you must notify the University by the 10th day of class in a semester. The student must contact the Registrar's Office, located on the Garden Level of Wahlstrom Library and fill out the appropriate paperwork. If a student makes such a request, the University has the option or either (1) withholding all information of the types specified and omit- ting the student's name from any published list involving such information or (2) seeking the student's written permission to release the information. The University of Bridgeport has designated the following information as directory infor - mation: Student's name Address University electronic mail address Telephone listing Date and place of birth Hometown Citizenship Family relations Marital status Previous schools or training Academic year Dates of attendance and/or graduation Major field of study or academic spe- cialty Instructors and courses Participation in sports and other offi- cially recognized activities (including position, role, or function) Membership in officially recognized honorary, professional, academic, or social organizations Academic honors or achievements Special awards or recognitions re- ceived, scholarships, fellowships, assis- tantships Offices or honorary positions to which elected or appointed Eligibility for and performance records in athletics or other recognized forms of competition Height and weight of members of ath- letic teams Place and nature of employment Post-graduation plans Positions or achievements Hobbies, interests, and community ac- tivities Publications or papers presented Title of honors or graduate thesis For students seeking employment on job interviews, such additional informa- tion as has been furnished or cleared by the student with the understanding that it will be used in connection with applications or employment inquiries Religious affiliation, if volunteered by the students, will be revealed to the campus ministry, local churches, syna- gogues, and mosques.
