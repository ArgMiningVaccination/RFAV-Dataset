About one-third of the general population report using CAM either on their own (e.g., yoga) or through the services of a CAM provider (e.g., massage). While CAM is offered within the military health system, no systemwide data are available on its use. RAND conducted an environmental scan (CAM survey) of military treatment facilities (MTFs) to understand the availability of CAM, the conditions for which CAM is being used, and the types and process of credentialing and privileging of CAM providers. Most MTFs (83 percent) offer CAM services, usually up to eight different types, with relaxation therapy, acupuncture, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and chiropractic being the most common. Lack of provider availability was the primary reason reported for not offering CAM. These services are most often used for chronic pain, stress, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. There is variability across MTFs and types of CAM in the process and criteria used for credentialing and privileging providers. While most MTFs reported that CAM use is usually documented in a patient's electronic medical record, there was variation in the availability and use of procedure codes. Standardization of CAM coding would allow consistent tracking of CAM providers and use for better manpower management, and easier data collection for future comparison studies. Standardization of CAM provider credentialing and privileging would ensure that providers are properly trained and have clear practice requirements.
