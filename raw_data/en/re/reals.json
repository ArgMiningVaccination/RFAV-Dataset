While oral supplementation is beneficial, it cannot compare with the efficiency and power of IV treatments in terms of their ability to achieve therapeutic levels of nutrients in the blood. IV therapy is useful for muscle spasms, migraines/headaches, fibromyalgia, anxiety, heart failure/angina and atherosclerosis, allergic symptoms such as rhinitis (runny/stuffy nose) and urticaria (itchy skin), upper respiratory infections (cold/flu), and various infections in general for that matter (sinusitis, EBV, pneumonias, etc.). There are specific IV formulation for fluoroquinolone toxicity, macular degeneration, neurodegenerative diseases, liver inflammation (NASH, viral hepatitis etc.) Cancer treatment: high dose Vitamin C is used for immune stimulation, enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, and for its direct cytotoxic (cancer cell killing) effects. Certain other IV formulations help to decrease the side-effects of chemotherapy (fatigue, anorexia and wasting, pain, nausea/vomiting, dehydration). Another use of IV therapy is enhancing athletic performance. An IV before an event, workout, or competition, can improve performance, and after an event it can hasten recovery, by providing rehydration as well as providing nutrients directly to depleted cells. We also use specific nutrients to reduce inflammation after exercise. Gastrointestinal issues: IV therapy is also particularly suited for diseases of malabsorption, i.e. when the digestive system is impaired and thus nutrients cannot be absorbed in sufficient quantities. Chelation is used for removing heavy metals such as mercury, lead and gadolinium from the body, as well as for treatment of cardiovascular disease. EDTA, and DMPS are commonly employed. Myers' Wellness IV (Aka Vitamin Infusion or Vitamin Drip) This combination of vitamins and minerals improves energy, decreases fatigue, treats acute muscle spasms, improves athletic performance, improves immune function, detoxification, anxiety, migraine, depression, benefits heart function and treats cardiovascular disease. Glutathione push Can be combined with Myers' Wellness Cocktail. Glutathione is the body's 'master antioxidant'. It is essential for detoxification and neutralizing free radical stress. Exhaustive exercise depletes glutathione and increases the production of free radicals. Research has shown that raised glutathione levels decrease muscle damage, reduce recovery time, increase strength and endurance, and shift metabolism from fat production to muscle development. Immune IV Support immune function and fight infections. For when you're sick, or for prevention. Includes high dose vitamin C, vitamins, minerals, and glycyrrhizic acid. Useful for viral, fungal, or bacterial infections, such as colds, flus, sinus infections, etc. Tranquility IV Includes minerals and amino acids that naturally calm the nervous system, plus glutathione for detoxification. Acute muscle spasm/pain IV Consider this IV treatment in case of motor vehicle accidents, after work-out injuries, back injuries, or anything that has caused your muscles to tighten and cause pain. This will help decrease inflammation and relax your muscles. Phosphatidylcholine Used with chelation for helping to reverse athersclerotic cardiovascular disease. Also useful in neurological and liver diseases. Hydration alone 500ml hydration solution supplied directly into your veins for optimal hydration. Can be used before an event for better performance, or during recovery from exercise or illness (especially indicated after loss of fluids such as from vomiting or diarrhea). NAD Vital for energy production in every cell of your body, NAD declines as we age and thus is an important part of our anti-aging and rejuvenation program, as well as benefitting chronic fatigue, neurological conditions, and overall wellness. UBI aka Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation By passing the blood through an ultraviolet light chamber, the immune system is activated and pathogens are killed. Useful for treatment of viral and bacterial infections and autoimmune conditions. Ozone Therapy Blood is ozonated outside of the body then returned to the veins. This has multiple benefits - see ozone therapy page for more details. "}
