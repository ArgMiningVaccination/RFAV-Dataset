Puurs, Belgium GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Arzneimittel, Brehna, Germany General characteristics The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is an RNA vaccine composed of nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA). It is a single-stranded, 5'-capped messenger RNA that has been generated through cell-free in vitro transcription from a DNA template encoding the viral spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 [ [WHO, 2020](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/338096/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_evaluation-BNT162b2-2020.1-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) ]. The mRNA sequence encoding the protein was synthesized using an optimized T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription reaction with complete replacement of uridine by N1-methyl-pseudouridine [ [Deva Priya SA, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40261-021-01022-9) ]. The reaction included a DNA template containing the immunogen open reading frame flanked by 5untranslated region (UTR) and 3UTR sequences and was terminated by an encoded polyA tail [ [Deva Priya SA, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40261-021-01022-9) ]. The mRNA encapsulated in process [ [Hassett KJ, 2019](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2162253119300174) ].After injection, body cells take up the lipid nanoparticle, delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into viral protein and then initiating the immune response against COVID-19 [ [Hassett KJ, 2019](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2162253119300174) ]. The expressed membrane-bound spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is then recognized by immune cells as a foreign antigen. This elicits both T-cell and B-cell responses to generate neutralizing antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. It is important for the immune system to respond to the virus at the prefusion stage because it would probably be too late for the immune system to intervene at the postfusion stage when the virus is entering into the cell [ [Xia X, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13010109) ]. Proline substitution is one of the main techniques reported to stabilize the SARS-CoV-2 spike at prefusion conformation. Spike protein variants can exhibit different levels of expression in comparison to the parental construct, and improved ability to withstand heat stress, storage temperature and resistance to freeze-thaw cycles [ [Hsieh CL, 2020](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6510/1501) ]. The modification of the lipid nanoparticles improves the immune response and improves tolerability [ [Hassett KJ, 2019](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2162253119300174) ]. Ingredients The vaccine contains the following ingredients: 1. Concentrate for dispersion Active ingredient One dose (0.3 mL) contains 30 mg nucleoside-modified messenger RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) stabilized in its prefusion phosphate dihydrate Sucrose Water for injections Sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) Hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) 2. Ready-to-use dispersion Active ingredient One dose (0.3 mL) contains 30 mg of tozinameran, a COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine injections 3. Pediatric formulation: concentrate for dispersion Active ingredient One dose (0.2 mL) contains 10 micrograms of tozinameran, a COVID-19 mRNA Comirnaty bivalent (original + omicron BA.1) Active ingredient One dose (0.3 mL) contains 15 micrograms of tozinameran and 15 micrograms of riltozinameran, a Comirnaty bivalent (original + omicron BA.4/BA.5) Active ingredient One dose (0.3 mL) contains 15 micrograms of tozinameran and 15 micrograms of famtozinameran, a Risk considerations The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine is a non-replicating and non-integrating platform. This means the delivered mRNA does not interact with the genome and does not carry a risk for infection [ [GAVI,2020](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/will-mrna-vaccine-alter-my-dna) ]. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated mRNA vaccine technology allows the delivery of precise genetic information together with an adjuvant effect to antigen-presenting cells. It is molecularly well defined, in principle, free of materials of animal origin [ [WHO, 2020](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/338096/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_evaluation-BNT162b2-2020.1-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) ]. Dosing and schedule Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (original strain) The recommended schedule for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is: [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)] For children aged 6 months to 4 years: a series of three doses (3g, 0.2 ml each). The first two doses are administered 3 weeks apart followed by a third dose at least 8 weeks after, according to the manufacturer label. For children aged 5 to 11 years: a series of two doses (10 g, 0.2 ml each) 4 to 8 weeks apart. For persons 12 years of age and older: a series of two doses (30 g, 0.3 ml) 4 to 8 weeks apart. WHO recommends extending the interval between the first and second dose up to 8 weeks. The preferred site of injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. This vaccine is presented as: [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/tozinameran-covid-19-mrna-vaccine-nucleoside-modified-comirnaty-biontech)] 1. Concentrate for dispersion for intramuscular injection provided in a multidose vial (6 doses of 0.3 mL per vial, after diluting with 0.9% Sodium Chloride) indicated for persons aged 12 and older (purple cap vial, dilution required). 2. Ready to use dispersion for injection provided in a multidose vial. One dose (0.3 mL) contains 30 micrograms of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine indicated for persons aged 12 and older (grey cap vial). 3. Pediatric formulation: concentrate for dispersion for intramuscular injection provided in a multidose vial (10 doses of 0.2 mL per vial, after diluting with 0.9% Sodium Chloride) indicated for persons aged 5 to 11 years (orange cap vial, dilution required). 4. Pediatric formulation (6 months to 4 years): concentrate for dispersion for intramuscular injection provided in a multidose vial (10 doses of 0.2 mL per vial, after diluting with 0.9% Sodium Chloride) indicated for persons aged 6 months to 4 years (maroon cap vial, dilution required) [ [FDA, 2022](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/comirnaty-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine)]. Booster dose [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)] A booster dose is recommended for the highest priority-use groups (e.g. older adults and health workers) 4-6 months after the completion of the primary series. If more than 6 months have elapsed since the completion of the primary series, the booster dose should be given at the earliest opportunity. Once high booster dose coverage has been achieved in the highest priority-use group, countries may also consider a booster for other lower priority-use groups. WHO has not yet determined the need for and timing of booster doses for persons below 12 years of age, except for immunocompromised children. EMA recommends a booster dose of Comirnaty 10 micrograms for children 5 to 11 years of age at least after 6 months after the primary schedule [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty)]. Second booster dose: WHO recommends considering a second booster dose 4-6 months after the first booster dose for all older persons (age-specific cutoff defined by countries), all persons with moderate and severe immunocompromising conditions -regardless of age-, adults with comorbidities that put them at higher risk of severe disease, pregnant women, and health workers [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. FDA recommends a second booster dose for persons 50 years of age and older and immunocompromised individuals from 12 years of age, provided at least after 4 months of the first booster dose [ [FDA, 2022](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/comirnaty-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine)]. EMA recommends second booster dose for persons 60 years of age and older and medically vulnerable individuals provided at least after 4 months of the first booster dose [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ecdc-ema-update-recommendations-additional-booster-doses-mrna-covid-19-vaccines)]. Heterologous schedule [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)] WHO supports a flexible approach to use different COVID-19 vaccine platforms for different doses (heterologous schedule) and considers two doses of any EUL COVID-19 vaccine to constitute a complete primary series. For persons aged 12 and older, a 30 g dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine may be used as a booster dose following a completed primary series using any other EUL COVID-19 vaccine platform. A heterologous booster (i.e. using COVID-19 vaccines from other platforms than mRNA) and variant-adapted vaccines (once they have received regulatory approval) can be used for first and second boosters. With heterologous schedules, the order of the vaccines administered can affect the levels of the immune response. A boost with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after a primary series with another platform often led to higher neutralizing antibody titers. More information about clinical trials on vaccine efficacy for heterologous schedules is available in the \"efficacy and effectiveness\" section of this dashboard. Heterologous vaccination should only be implemented with careful consideration of current vaccine supply, vaccine supply projections, and other access considerations, along with the potential benefits and risks of the specific products being used. Vaccination schedule for immunocompromised persons [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)] WHO recommends an extended primary series including an additional (third) dose of 30 g for immunocompromised persons aged 12 years and older, and 10 g for immunocompromised persons aged 5 to 11 years. An additional (third) dose should be given 1-3 months after the second dose in the standard primary series. If more than 3 months have elapsed since the second dose in the primary series, the additional (third) dose should be given at the earliest opportunity. A first and second booster dose (fourth and fifth doses) given 4-6 months after the previous dose is recommended for all immunocompromised persons. Adapted Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines Comirnaty (original + omicron BA.1) is administered as a single booster dose (0.3 mL) for persons aged 12 years and older after three months of the primary series or monovalent booster [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty)]. The pharmaceutical form is a dispersion for intramuscular injection provided in a multidose vial (each 0.3 mL dose containing 15 g of tozinameran and 15 g of riltozinameran) [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/comirnaty-originalomicron-ba1)]. The preferred site of injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Comirnaty bivalent BA.4/BA.5) Comirnaty bivalent (original + omicron BA.4/BA.5) is administered as a single booster dose (0.3 mL) for persons aged 12 years and older after three months of the primary series or monovalent booster [ [WHO, 2022](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/comirnaty-originalomicron-ba4-5)]. FDA recommends to administer (original + omicron BA.4/BA.5) as [ [FDA, 2022](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/comirnaty-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine)]: - The third primary series dose (0.2 mL) at least 8 weeks after two doses of the monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 6 months to 4 years of age. - A single booster dose (0.2 mL for children aged 6 months to 4 years) at least two months after the primary series [ [FDA, 2023](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-bivalent-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-booster-dose?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)] - A single booster dose (0.2 mL for persons aged 5-11 years, and 0.3 mL for persons aged 12 years) at least two months after the primary series or a monovalent booster.

FDA recommends administering Comirnaty bivalent (original + omicron BA.4/BA.5) as a booster dose for individuals 6 months of age and older, and as a third dose in a third-dose primary schedule for children 6 months to 4 years of age [ [FDA, 2022](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/comirnaty-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine)]. Contraindications Comirnaty bivalent (original + omicron BA.4/BA.5) is contraindicated in individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty)], [ [FDA, 2022](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/comirnaty-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine)]. (See the list of ingredients under 'General characteristics' in the extended version). Precautions Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (original strain) Allergic reactions [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. A history of anaphylaxis to any other vaccine or injectable therapy (i.e. intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous vaccines or therapies), is not a contraindication to vaccination. For such persons, a risk assessment should be conducted by a health professional. Such persons should be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination. Individuals with an immediate non-anaphylactic allergic reaction to the first dose (such as urticaria, angioedema, or respiratory symptoms) that occur within 4 hours of administration should not receive additional doses unless recommended after review by a health professional. However, subject to individual risk-benefit assessment, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine could be provided under close medical supervision if it is the only available vaccine for persons at high risk of severe disease. As a small number of anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in vaccines without a history of anaphylaxis, it is recommended that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should be administered only in settings where anaphylaxis can be treated. Until more data are available with regard to anaphylaxis after vaccination, all vaccinees should be observed for at least 15 minutes after vaccination. Food, insect venom and contact allergies and allergic rhinitis, eczema and asthma are not considered a contraindication to vaccination. The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex, and there is no contraindication or precaution to vaccination for persons with a latex allergy. In addition, as BNT162b2 does not contain eggs or gelatine, there is no contraindication or precaution to vaccination for persons with allergies to any food substances. Myocarditis [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. Myocarditis is a very rare adverse event that has been reported after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The observed risk is highest in males aged 12-29 years, and higher after the second dose. Available data suggest that the immediate course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is generally mild and responds to treatment. Vaccinated individuals should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis (e.g. persisting chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination). Other potential causes of myocarditis and pericarditis should also be ruled out. Pregnancy [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)] WHO recommends the use of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant persons. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing before vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination. Breastfeeding [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults. As the Pfizer-BioNTech COVIV-19 vaccine is not a live virus vaccine and the mRNA does not enter the cell nucleus and is rapidly degraded, it is biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the nursing infant. Based on these considerations, WHO recommends its use in breastfeeding women. WHO does not recommend stopping breastfeeding due to vaccination. Children and adolescents [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. The priority remains to prevent deaths by achieving high vaccine coverage (primary series and boosters) in the highest and high priority-use groups. It is of utmost importance for children to continue to receive the recommended childhood vaccines for other infectious diseases. Older persons [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. Vaccination is recommended for older persons without an upper age limit Immunocompromised persons [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. Information and, where possible, advice on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in immunocompromised persons should be provided to inform individual risk-benefit assessment. Persons living with HIV [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. Persons living with HIV who are stable on antiretroviral therapy should be vaccinated. It is not necessary to test for HIV infection before administration of the vaccine. Persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. Vaccination may be offered regardless of a person's history of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The optimal minimum interval between a natural infection and vaccination is not yet known, but an interval of 3-6 months could be considered. Persons with current acute COVID-19 [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19, including between doses, should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for discontinuation of isolation have been met. Persons who previously received passive antibody therapy for COVID-19[ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)] Although some reduction in vaccine-induced antibody titers has been observed in this group, the balance of benefits versus risks favors vaccination. Other precautions Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with an acute febrile illness (body temperature over 38.5 \u00b0C) or acute infection [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals with bleeding disorders or other conditions that increase the risk of bleeding, such as anticoagulant therapy, thrombocytopenia and hemophilia [ [WHO, 2020](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/sites/default/files/documents/TAG-EUL_PublicReport_BioNTech_DEC20.pdf)]. Co-administration with other vaccines For adults, based on several co-administration studies, COVID-19 vaccines may be administered concomitantly or at any time before or after other adult vaccines, including: live attenuated vaccines, inactivated, adjuvanted, or non-adjuvanted vaccines. When administered concomitantly, the vaccines should be injected at separate sites, preferably different extremities [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. Inactivated influenza vaccine WHO recommends that countries consider co-administration of COVID-19 vaccines with seasonal influenza vaccines, whenever feasible, dependent on seasonality [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1)]. Adapted Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines Allergic reactions [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty)]. Events of anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should be available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of Comirnaty bivalent (original + omicron BA.1). Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination Myocarditis and pericarditis [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty)]. The risk of myocarditis after a booster dose of Comirnaty bivalent (original + omicron BA.1) has not yet been characterized. There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty, observed more often after the second dose, and in younger males. Pregnancy [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty)] There are no available data regarding the use of Comirnaty bivalent (original + omicron BA.1) during pregnancy. However, a large amount of observational data from vaccination with Comirnaty during the second and third trimesters have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

However, observational data from vaccination with Comirnaty from breastfeeding women have not shown an increase in adverse effects in breastfed infants. Immunocompromised persons [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty)]. The efficacy and safety of this vaccine have not been assessed in immunocompromised persons. The efficacy of Comirnaty bivalent (original + omicron BA.1) may be lower in these individuals. Other precautions Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with an acute febrile illness or acute infection [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty)]. As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals with bleeding disorders or other conditions that increase the risk of bleeding, such as anticoagulant therapy, thrombocytopenia and hemophilia (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with the vaccination process itself [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty)].

After taking the first dose from the multidose vial, the vial should be used within a maximum of 12 hours (stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C [36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F]). In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. Disposal Due to the high risk that discarded vials of COVID-19 vaccines can be recovered, it is essential that they are guaranteed to be safely disposed at the site of use; or study the possibility of applying reverse logistics, if the safe treatment and disposal of vaccine residues cannot be guaranteed. Otherwise, consider the possibility that the discarded vaccine vials are shredded, if there is a safe way to do so [ [WHO, 2021](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/339561)].

Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness Efficacy of preclinical studies on the vaccine The immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was tested in mice and non-human primates that were injected with two vaccine candidates: BNT162b1 and BNT162b2. In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate vaccine elicits a dose-dependent antibody response and strong T-helper-1 CD4+ and IFN+CD8+ T cell responses. Rhesus macaques that received 100 g of BNT162b2 showed robust antibody and cellular responses, and no signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection 3 days after immunization [ [Vogel AB, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03275-y) ].

This means Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 in 95%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: contracting COVID-19. Comparison: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trials identified in this review, 850 people not receiving Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine out of 21096 presented this outcome (403 per 10000) versus 77 out of 20998 in the group that did receive it (37 per 10000). In other words, 366 less people per 10000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 91%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 by 91 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 27. Which means that 27 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contracting COVID-19. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. No reasons for concern were detected in relation to risk of bias, inconsistency, indirect evidence, imprecision or publication bias. Contracting severe COVID-19 (measured at least 7 days after the second injection) The relative risk of contracting severe COVID-19 in the group that received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.25 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.23). This means Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 in 75%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis.

In other words, 10 less people per 10000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 96%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 by 96 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 10000. Which means that 10000 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contracting severe COVID-19. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as moderate. The reason for downgrading the certainty of the evidence is imprecision because of the low number of events and wide confidence interval. No reasons for concern were detected in relation to risk of bias, inconsistency, indirect evidence or publication bias. Mortality The existing evidence does not allow to assess the impact of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine on the risk of mortality. The information provided by randomized trials was not adequately powered to estimate a difference in this outcome. Deaths can occur in the intervention and control group for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or the vaccine. Establishing that there is a reduction (or increase) in the risk of death attributable to COVID-19 would require trials with a higher statistical power. Efficacy of the vaccine in subgroups Contracting COVID-19 (>65y) (measured at least 7 days after the second injection) The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 (>65y) in the group that received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.06 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.12). This means Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 (>65y) by 94%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis.

In this case, the NNTB is 23. Which means that 23 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contracting COVID-19 (6 months - 4y). Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Summary of findings table (iSoF) Efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccine in subgroups Age Randomized trials The proportion of patients >55 years of age in the C4591001 trial was 42.2% (15921 out of 37706 participants) [ [Polack, Fernando P., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577) ]. Vaccine efficacy in the different age groups was consistent with that observed in the overall population. Efficacy was 95.6% (89.4 to 98.6) in the group 16 to 55 years, 93.7% (80.6 to 98.8) in >55 years, 94.7% (66.7 to 99.9) in 65 years and 100.0% (13.1 to 100.0) in 75 years [ [Polack, Fernando P., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577) ]. The proportion of participants 12-15 years in the C4591001 trial was 67.3% (2260 out of 3358 participants) [ [Frenck RW, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2107456) ]. The proportion of participants 16-25 years in the C4591001 trial was 32.7% (1098 out of 3358 participants) [ [Frenck RW, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2107456) ]. In the group that included 1983 participants in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort, vaccine efficacy from 7 days after the second dose was 100% (95% CI, 75.3 to 100). In the group that included all 2229 participants in the 12-to-15-year-old cohort, vaccine efficacy from 7 days after the second dose was 100% (IC del 95%, 78,1 a 100) [ [Frenck ]. The phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial B7471026 is currently evaluating the efficacy/safety of the vaccine in vaccinated adults 65 years of age and older [ [Pfizer, 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04887948) ]. The proportion of participants 65-85 years in the BNT162-03 was 50% (72 out of 144 participants) [ [Li J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01330-9) ]. The older participants generally had a lower peak neutralizing antibody response than the younger participants. The vaccine-induced highest neutralizing titers were observed on day 43 (21 days after the BNT162b1 boost dose) for the older adults in the BNT162b1 group. Moreover, geometric mean neutralizing titers reached 1.3-fold in the older adults group versus a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera obtained at least 14 d after positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test [ [Li J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01330-9) ]. Puthanakit T et al was a phase 2 randomized clinicla trial conducted in Thailand. The study included 80 participants aged 12 to < 18 years without previous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Participants were randomized to be vaccinated with CoronaVac (SV) 3 ug as the first dose followed by BNT162b2 30 \u00b5g or 20 \u00b5g as the second dose, at 3-week (3w) or 6-week interval (6w). During the Omicron-predominant period, participants were offered a BNT162b2 booster dose 30, 15, or 10 \u00b5g. Immunogenicity was determined using IgG antibody against spike-receptorbinding domain of wild type(anti-S-RBD IgG) and surrogate virus neutralization test(sVNT) against Delta variant at 14 days and 5 months after the 2nd dose. Neutralization tests(sVNT and pseudovirus neutralization test; pVNT) against Omicron strain were tested pre- and 14 days post-booster dose. At day 14, the geometric mean(GM) of in SV6w/PZ30lg. The GMs of sVNT against Delta variants at day 14 among participants in SV3w/PZ30lg and SV6wk/PZ30lg arm were 95.3 % and 99.7 %inhibition, respectively.

Data were collected 21 days after the second dose. The study showed that two-dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine elicits robust and stable antibody responses in older Long-Term Care Facility residents, consistent with overall levels of vaccine-induced immunity [ [Oliver Stirrup, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.26.22269885) ]. The cohort study using Senior Shield data, included 43,596 residents of long term facilities, 39,482 received one dose, 37,656 received two doses, with a follow-up period of 5 months. This study shows that the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectively prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related death, and all-cause mortality in LTCF residents [ [Goldin S, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000521899) ].

This study evaluated the T cell responses from individuals recovered from COVID-19 and T cell responses from recent Moderna mRNA-1273 or Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccines for their capacity to recognize peptides derived from the ancestral reference sequence and the beta variant. Comparison of the variant to the ancestral sequence showed significant differences for CD4+ and CD8+ T cell reactivity in the activation-induced marker assay for B.1351. Decreases of 14% and 22%, respectively, were observed with the B.1.351 pools for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (B.1.351: p < 0.01 for both comparisons) [ [Tarke A, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100355) ]. Angkasekwinai N et al. was a cohort study conducted in Thailand. Data was collected from a single-tertiary care hospital between July to September 2021. Results showed that for both Sinovac and AstraZeneca prime-vaccination groups, the PRNT50 GMT against the Delta and Beta variant was significantly higher among those participants who received a booster dose of Pfizer (30\u00b5g or 15\u00b5g) compared to those who received AstraZeneca or Sinopharm/ BIBP. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in the PRNT50 between boosting with 30\u00b5g or 15\u00b5g of Pfizer vaccine, regardless of the primary vaccination series and the type of variant evaluated. The study showed that the PRNT50 against the Beta variant was 1.5-fold lower compared to Delta variant for CoronaVac and AstraZeneca prime-vaccination groups. The GMTs of the PRNT50 observed between post-boost, and post-primary vaccination series were highest among participants who received Pfizer boosting in both Sinovac and AstraZeneca groups [ [ ].](javascript:;) Lu et al. was a prospective cohort study that recruited 135 COVID-19 recovered individuals scheduled to receive either a Sinovac or Pfizer vaccine. The study compared the neutralizing response against the vaccinated individuals' Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants to the unvaccinated ones. The study found that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine greatly increased the neutralizing titers against all three variants and seropositivity rate. Neutralizing titers against the Delta and Beta variants were not significantly different than against the ancestral lineage [ [Lu Lu, 2022](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4029746) ]. Niyomnaitham et al. was a comparative study conducted in Thailand. The study recruited 210 participants equally divided (n=30) to receive Sinovac, AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines either as a first or second dose. Participants who received only Sinovac or AstraZeneca first and second doses also received a booster dose with Pfizer-BioNTech. The study found antibody levels were highest among the groups that received Pfizer-BioNTech as a second dose. Levels were similar between homologous and heterologous regimens. These levels were significantly higher compared with the groups who received AstraZeneca or Sinovac as a second dose. The groups who were given Pfizer-BioNTech as the second dose had significantly higher neutralizing titers against Delta and Beta than those that received AstraZeneca or Sinovac as the second dose. Neutralizing titers against the Beta variant were reduced by 2 to 5-fold compared to the Delta variant. Overall, neutralization against Omicron was low across the groups and was 28- to 229-fold lower than Delta. Neutralization against the Delta and Omicron variants was significantly lower among groups who received Sinovac as a second dose than the other groups. Seropositivity rate for the Omicron variant was of 80% (45/56), 50% (30/60) and 21% for the groups that received Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac as a second dose respectively [ [Suvimol Niyomnaitham, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.03.22271601) ]. PRIBIVAC was a randomized controlled trial conducted in Singapore. 100 participants who had received a primary vaccine schedule with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were randomized to either homologous (BNT162b2 mRNA-1273; 'BBM'; 49). The primary was level of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and Variants of Concern (VOCs) on day 28 after the booster dose. The results of the study showed that both vaccine schedules induced increases in the level of neutralizing antibodies against the Beta variant (BBB to 97.1).

Behrens et al. conducted a longitudinal monitoring of ChAd/ChAd (n = 41) and ChAd/BNT (n = 88) vaccinated individuals and the impact of a third vaccination with BNT. Whilst the majority of participants had neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan strain in plasma before the third vaccination, neutralizing antibodies against Beta variant were particularly in the ChAd/ChAd group less frequent or virtually absent. In the ChAd/ChAd group, the third immunization profoundly increased neutralization of the Beta variant, which was virtually absent after prime/boost. All BNT-boosted ChAd/BNT vaccines had efficient neutralizing activity against Beta variant and titers were mostly above those identified after the second vaccination [ [Behrens GMN, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32527-2) ].

A decrease in NT50 was also observed for the Beta variant in both interventional and control groups (GMT 293.21 ]. Renia L et al was a cohort study that included 312 participants vaccinated with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. This study compared the kinetics of specific antibodies, B and T cell memory responses in a cohort of BNT162b2-vaccinated healthcare workers and elderly individuals in Singapore up to 6 months postimmunization and for a subset of elderly low responders after a third dose. After the second dose, all but one of the participants developed anti-Spike protein antibodies by day 90. Immunoglobulin isotyping showed that the proportion of vaccinees with detectable IgM (above both cohort and individual baseline) was >85% at day 21 but dropped to 12% by day 90 (12%) and was negligible by day 180. After the second dose, all individuals seroconverted by day 90. However, 36.5% of individuals mounted a poor anti-RBD IgG response. More than 79.1% of the plasma had neutralizing antibodies above the individual baseline after the first dose, 99% after the second dose, and 93% at day 180. The antibody response against the Delta variant was lower than the Wildtype ancestral strain and extremely low or non-existent against the Omicron variant. The third dose strongly boosted the antibody responses against the total Spike protein or its RBD. The boosting injection also induced a strong antibody response against the spike protein of the Delta and Omicron variants. [ [Renia L, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32312-1) ].

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG (anti-S IgG) levels were significantly higher in the ChAd/BNT group short after prime-boost vaccination when compared to the ChAd/ChAd group but declined significantly over time in both groups, with lower anti-S IgG after homologous vaccination prior to the third immunization. Following a third immunization, they found greatly increased anti-S IgG responses in both groups. Additional immunization of the homologous ChAd/ChAd immunized group led to a significant 46.9 -fold increase in anti-S IgG (p<0.0001) and 8.0-fold increase in vaccination (p<0.0001). In both groups, anti-S IgG levels were considerably higher when compared to the situation observed 14 days after the second vaccination (the third vaccination diminished previous differences between the heterologous ChAd/BNT and homologous ChAd/ChAd prime-boost vaccination groups, since anti-S IgG were comparable in both groups after the third vaccination). The numbers of spike-specific memory B cells generated after prime-boost vaccination gradually increased during the following months with no significant difference between the ChAd/ChAd and the ChAd/BNT group, in line with increased amounts of spike-specific antibodies, highlighting the impact of the third vaccination for better protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. 2 weeks after a third immunization with BNT, spike-specific memory B cells were significantly higher in the ChAd/ChAd as compared to the ChAd/BNT prime-boost group. The frequencies of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in blood samples collected after the second vaccination were significantly higher in the ChAd/BNT than in the ChAd/ChAd group. Both cell populations declined over time after heterologous immunization, while they remained at low levels after homologous vaccination. Whilst spike-specific CD4+ T cells declined to frequencies similar to individuals after homologous ChAd/ChAd vaccination, spike-specific CD8+ T cells remained above the frequencies of the heterologous vaccinated group. A third immunization with BNT in the ChAd/ChAd group significantly raised numbers of spike-specific CD4+ T cells above levels observed after the second vaccination. A third vaccination of the ChAd/BNT group only regained spike-specific CD4+ T cell to levels present after the second vaccination. A third vaccination with with BNT did not result in an expansion of spike-specific CD8+ T cells above levels observed after second vaccination in ChAd/BNT vaccinees, but did so in ChAd/ChAd vaccinated individuals. Like for spike-specific CD4+ T cells, raised numbers in spike-specific IFN--producing T cells in the ChAd/ChAd as well as the ChAd/BNT group after the additional BNT vaccination was confirmed by cytokine measurement in supernatants after SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide stimulation. The third vaccination did not further increase spike-specific IFN--producing T cells in ChAd/BNT vaccinated subjects above levels obtained already after the second vaccination [ [Behrens GMN, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32527-2) ].

After the second dose, all but one of the participants developed anti-Spike protein antibodies by day 90. Immunoglobulin isotyping showed that the proportion of vaccinees with detectable IgM (above both cohort and individual baseline) was >85% at day 21 but dropped to 12% by day 90 (12%) and was negligible by day 180. After the second dose, all individuals seroconverted by day 90. However, 36.5% of individuals mounted a poor anti-RBD IgG response. More than 79.1% of the plasma had neutralizing antibodies above individual baseline after the first dose, 99% after the second dose and 93% at day 180. The antibody response against the Delta variant was lower than the Wildtype ancestral strain and extremely low or non-existent against the Omicron variant. The third dose strongly boosted the antibody responses against the total Spike protein or its RBD. The boosting injection also induced a strong antibody response against the spike protein of the Delta and Omicron variants.

Safety of the vaccine in clinical trials Key messages Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine increase the risk of any adverse events. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine increase the risk of serious adverse events. Main safety outcomes of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Any adverse events (measured at 2 months ) The relative risk of any adverse events in the group that received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 2.19 (95% CI 2.1 to 2.28). This means that, in relative terms, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of any adverse events in 119%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: any adverse events. Comparison: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the available trial, 2638 people not receiving Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine out of 21631 presented this outcome (1220 per 10000) versus 5770 out of 21621 in the group that did receive it (2670 per 10000). In other words, 1450 more people per 10000 did develop the outcome because of the vaccine. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTH is 7. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Non-serious adverse events The total number of non-serious adverse events was not reported as a group, so it was not possible to estimate the effect for this outcome. The most common adverse reactions associated with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were fatigue (59% versus 23% among younger vaccine recipients and 51% vs 17% in older recipients%); headache (52% versus 24% among younger vaccine recipients and 39% versus 14% in older recipients) and fever after the second dose (16% among younger vaccine recipients and 11% in older recipients) [ [Walsh EE, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2027906) ]. Serious adverse events (measured at 2 months ) The relative risk of serious adverse events in the group that received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 1.14 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.46). This means that, in relative terms, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of serious adverse events in 14%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: serious adverse events. Comparison: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the available trial, 111 people not receiving Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine out of 21631 presented this outcome (51 per 10000), versus 126 out of 21621 in the group that did receive it (58 per 10000). In other words, 1 more person per 1000 experienced serious adverse events due to receiving the vaccine. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTH is 1429. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as moderate. The reason for downgrading the certainty of the evidence is imprecision because of the low number of events and wide confidence interval. No reasons for concern were detected in relation to risk of bias, inconsistency, indirect evidence or publication bias. Safety of the vaccine in subgroups Any adverse events (5-15y) (measured at 2 months ) The relative risk of any adverse events (5-15y) in the group that received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 1.12 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.37). This means Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of any adverse events (5-15y) by 12%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: any adverse events (5-15y). Comparison: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trials identified in this review, 136 people not receiving Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine out of 1879 presented this outcome (724 per 10000) versus 234 out of 2649 in the group that did receive it (807 per 10000). In other words, 83 more people per 10000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 12%, or that the intervention increased the risk of any adverse events (5-15y) by 12 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTH is 120. Which means that 120 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not any adverse events (5-15y). Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high.

The phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial B7471026 is currently evaluating the efficacy/safety of the vaccine in vaccinated adults 65 years of age and older [ [Pfizer, 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04887948) ]. The proportion of participants 65-85 years in the BNT162-03 was 50% (72 out of 144 participants) [ [Li J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01330-9) ]. In the 65-85 years old group, 83% of participants in the 10 \u00b5g BNT162b1 dose group, 92% of participants in the 30 \u00b5g BNT162b1 dose group, and 8% of participants in the placebo group reported at least one solicited adverse reaction. Reactogenicity was dose-level dependent and was most evident in the group receiving 30 \u00b5g, BNT162b1. Older participants did not have increased reactogenicity after the BNT162b1 boost dose [ [Li J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01330-9) ]. Grade 3 fever was reported in 8% of older participants who received 30 \u00b5g BNT162b1. One male participant in the older age group experienced an episodic grade 3 fever accompanied by pain and pruritus at the injection site after the prime BNT162b1 dose at 30 \u00b5g and electively withdrew before receiving the boost vaccination [ [Li J, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01330-9) ]. Other comparative studies The interventional, non-randomized study COGEVAX-BIO is currently evaluating the effectiveness/safety of the vaccine in people over age 75 institutionalized in the long-term care units [ [G\u00e9rond'if, 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04961502) ]. The non-randomized study Covid-19-Abs is currently evaluating the effectiveness/safety of the vaccine in residents and staff associated with nursing homes, extended care facilities, and over 55 communities [ [Dr. Sidney J. Stohs, 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04944095) ]. Dagan et al. report an increased risk of myocarditis mostly among young male adolescents and adults (16 to 39 years of age), with 8.62 excess events per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 2.82 to 14.35) among vaccinated individuals [ [Dagan N, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2115045) ]. Li LL et al. included 3,118,802 participants who had received one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and 2,979,326 who had received two doses (1,389,401 Pfizer and 1,589,925 Moderna). Data were collected during the period from December 12, 2020, to August 21, 2021. The study results showed that, Overall, two-dose mRNA vaccine regimens are safe in a population with many comorbidities. Weakness, muscle aches, fever, mental status changes, falls, dehydration and acute kidney injury were transiently increased after vaccination, especially after the second dose. Among patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was an increased risk of hospitalization (absolute risk 1:1000). Chen PY et al. was a comparative cohort study that included 30,832 people who received booster doses in the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. The study analyzed the reported incidence rate, and factors associated with adverse events, including short-term serious adverse events and short-term non-serious adverse events, among different vaccine products through the hospital-based Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. A total of 7,432 records were collected during the three-month study period. Respondents under 39 years of age had a higher incidence rate of adverse events (61.9%) than those between 40 and 64 years of age (48.7%), and those over 65 years of age (26.3%). The incidence of adverse events in Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is higher than in Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and MVC-COV1901 (IRR Moderna vs. Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.34; Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine vs. MVC-COV1901: 95% CI: 2.27 to 3.3 [ [Chen PY, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10071115) ] Yamin D et al was a retrospective cohort study conducted in Israel that included 863,886 people aged 60 years and above who received the first, second monovalent and/or bivalent BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine boosters between July 2021 and November 2022. The risk difference after the bivalent booster was -3.03 (95% CI, -5.45 to -0.61) for arrhythmia, 0.2 (95% -0.4 to 1.01) for Deep Vein Thrombosis, 0.4 (95% CI, -1.41 to 2.22) for heart failure, myocardial infarction and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.0 to 1.41) for other thrombosis [ [Yamin D, 2023](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4336133) ]. Children and adolescents Randomized trials In the phase 2/3 components of the C4591001 trial, reactogenicity was measured in a subset that included 8183 participants (12 years of age). Reactogenicity data were collected by participants' e-diary reporting local reactions and systemic events for 7 days after each dose. This preliminary data provides support of safety on adolescents 12 to 15 years of age [ [FDA, 2020](https://www.fda.gov/media/144246/download) ]. Younger adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (49/100 in the vaccine group and 51/100 in the placebo group) contributed to a preliminary reactogenicity data analysis. In this age group, pain at the injection site was the most frequent local reaction, reported in 71.4% of participants in the vaccine group, compared to 17.6% in the placebo group after Dose 1 [ [FDA, 2020](https://www.fda.gov/media/144246/download) ]. Most systemic events in younger adolescents were mild to moderate in severity. Severe events were relatively infrequent in both groups, occurring in no more than 1 or 2 participants after either dose [ [FDA, 2020](https://www.fda.gov/media/144246/download) ] The proportion of participants 12-15 years in the C4591001 trial was 67.3% (2260 out of 3358 participants) [ [Frenck RW, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2107456) ]. The proportion of participants 16-25 years in the C4591001 trial was 32.7% (1098 out of 3358 participants) [ [Frenck RW, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2107456) ]. In both age cohorts (12-5 years and 16-25 years), BNT162b2 recipients reported more local events than placebo recipients. Local events were generally mild to moderate in severity, reported at similar frequencies in both age cohorts ), and typically resolved within 1 or 2 days. Injection-site pain was the most common local reaction in all groups. Severe injection-site pain after any BNT162b2 dose was reported in 1.5% of 12-to-15-year-old participants and in 3.4% of 16-to-25-year-old participants; no severe pain was reported after placebo administration [ [Frenck RW, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2107456) ]. In both age cohorts (12-5 years and 16-25 years), headache and fatigue were the most frequently reported systemic events. After BNT162b2 injection, severe headache and severe fatigue were reported in a lower percentage of 12-to-15-year-old participants than of 16-to-25-year-old participants. Fever with a temperature 38\u00b0C occurred after the second dose of BNT162b2 in 20% of 12 to 15-year-old recipients and in 17% of 16 to 25 years old recipients. Fever with a temperature higher than 40\u00b0C occurred 1 day after the first dose of BNT162b2 in 0.1% of the 12-to-15-year-old participants [ [Frenck RW, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2107456) ]. Other comparative studies C4591007 is an ongoing non-randomized study evaluating the safety in healthy children ages 12 years and less [ [BioNTech SE, 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04816643) ] The non-randomized study COVA is currently evaluating the effectiveness/safety of the vaccine in healthy or clinically stable participants aged 11 years and older [ [The University of Hong Kong, 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04800133) ]. Cheng DR et al was a comparative study conducted in Australia. The study included 454,974 12 to 17 years old participants who had received 871,689 mRNA doses (782,964 Pfizer and 88,725 Moderna). The aim was to describe myocarditis adverse events following any COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in the adolescent population. Confirmed myocarditis reporting rates were 8.3 per 100 000 doses in this age group (aggregated data for both mRNA vaccines) [ [Cheng DR, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001472) ]. CoVacU5 was a retrospective cohort study conducted in Germany that included 7,806 children younger than 5 years old who received 3 to 10 g of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The study aimed to report short-term safety data in children from birth to younger than 60 months. In the active-comparator analysis of symptoms occurring after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination versus non-Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination showed ORs of 1.62 (95% CI, 1.43-1.84) for any symptoms, 1.68 (95% local injection-site symptoms, 2.55 [Toepfner ]. Cristina Morciano et al was a self-controlled case series study that included 15,986,009 participants who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine: 10,833,284 with Pfizer vaccine, 1,706,979 with Moderna vaccine, 2,863,950 with AstraZeneca vaccine and 581,796 with Janssen vaccine. This study investigated the risk of Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome after vaccination with anti-COVID-19 vaccines. Relative incidence of Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome for the second dose of Pfizer vaccine was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.49-1.48). [ [Cristina Morciano, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.17.23284585) ] Mangat et al was an observational study conducted in the United States that analyzed data from 177,679 reports of adverse events following immunization attributed to the Pfizer vaccine. The overall crude cumulative reported rate of solicited adverse events per 100,000 fully vaccinated was 3.06 (95% CI, 2.70-3.47) for the 5-11 years age group, 18.25 (95% CI, 17.57-18.95) for the 12-17 years age group and 33.74 (95% CI, 33.36-34.13) for the 18-65 years group. [ [Mangat HS, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281993) ] Buchan SA et al was a cohort study conducted in Canada that analyzed data from 1.65 million doses of Pfizer administered to indiviuals aged 12 to 17 years. The aim was to estimate the incidence of reported myocarditis or pericarditis after vaccination.The reported incidence after the first dose was 3.1 (95% CI, 2.0-4.5) per 100,000 doses administered. The reported incidence after the seconde dose was 6.3 (95% CI, 4.7-8.3) per 100,000 doses administered. [ [Buchan SA, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2022.6166) ] Ahsan M et al was a cross sectional study conducted in India that included data from 385 children between 5-17 years. The aim was to assess the frequency and severity of adverse events following immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. The frequency of adverse events following immunization was reported to be higher after the first dose than after the second with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 2.12 (95% CI, 1.57-2.86). [ [Ahsan M, 2023](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11020207) ] Pregnancy Randomized trials A total of 23 participants reported pregnancy during the trial. Nine of them withdrew from the study but the follow-up on these participants continues in order to assess pregnancy outcomes [ [Polack, Fernando P., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577) ]. C4591015 is an ongoing phase 2/3, randomized trial evaluating the safety in this subgroup [ [BioNTech SE, 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04754594) ]. Other comparative studies Shimabukuro et al. (CDC report) was a safety monitoring non-comparative study that enrolled 16,439 pregnant women that received Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Results showed that the most frequent local and systemic reactions wer: 95.6% injection-site pain, 80.6% fatigue, 65.0% headache, 46.0% fever or felt feverish. Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported (Data based on 827 participants in the v-safe pregnancy registry who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the VAERS, the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases) [ [Shimabukuro TT, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983) ]. An analysis of the CDC v-safe COVID-19 Pregnancy Registry in 19,252 pregnant people who received the vaccine did not show obvious safety signals [ [Shimabukuro TT, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983) ]. Nakahara A et al. included 83 vaccinated pregnant women that received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna or Pfizer). These pregnant women were age-matched with 166 female controls. Safety was assessed as any vaccine-related complaint as defined in the original safety data. Results showed a frequency of complaint following vaccine administration of 18.1% in the pregnant group and 16.9% in the non-pregnant group. The most frequent local and systemic reactions in Pregnant females were: fever 4.8%, Cough/Shortness of Breath 4.8 %, Vomiting/Diarrhea 4.8%. Complaint frequency was higher after the second dose (12.3 %) than after the first dose (6%) [ [Nakahara A, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1745-1168) ]. Aharon D et al. included 222 vaccinated (Pfizer =119 or Moderna =103) patients and 983 unvaccinated patients who underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles between February and September 2021. Data collected included oocyte, fertilization, and embryo development parameters, as well as results of preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy among cycles in which testing was performed. The study showed that the administration of Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was not associated with an adverse effect on stimulation or early pregnancy outcomes after in vitro fertilization. The fertilization rate for the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cohort was 80.7% (95% CI 78.4 to 83.0) in the vaccinated group and 78.7% in unvaccinated groups (95% CI 77.5 to 80.0). No differences were observed between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients on univariate analysis in the secondary outcomes of eggs retrieved, mature oocytes retrieved, mature oocytes ratio, or blastulation rate. In cycles in which preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy was performed, vaccinated patients had a proportion of euploid embryos of 48.8% (95% CI 44.1 to 53.6) compared with 42.5% (95% CI 40.2 to 44.9) in unvaccinated patients [ [Aharon D, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000004713) ]. Montalti M et al. was a cross-sectional study that enrolled 600 female physicians aged from 24 to 60 years old; 131 pregnant and 469 breastfeedings that received Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Results showed that 16 of the 31 immunized pregnant women, reported at least one symptom after the first, and 14 after the second vaccine dose. After the first dose, 64.5% had nausea/vomiting, 25.8% fatigue, and 12.9% headache and arthralgia/myalgia; flushing and low back pain were rare. After the second dose, 76.5% of respondents had nausea/vomiting, 70.6% fatigue, and 41.2% arthralgia/myalgia [ [Montalti M, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2022.2106747) ]. Botton J et al. was a self-controlled case series conducted in France. The study included participants (8,358 first dose of ChAdOx1; 4,887 Second dose of ChAdOx1; and5 third ChAdOx1 dose) aged 18 to 74 years hospitalized for pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic stroke, or ischemic stroke between December 27, 2020, and December 20, 2021. This study assessed the short-term risk for severe cardiovascular events after COVID-19 vaccination in France's 46.5 million adults. The primary outcome was hospitalizations for cardiovascular events (Myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or stroke). There was an increase in the incidence of myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism after adenoviral-based vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine). The RI during the second week after the dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine for Myocardial Infarction was 0.84 for Hemorrhagic Stroke [ [Botton J, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.7326/M22-0988) ]. Rottenstreich et al conducted a multicenter retrospective study. Parturients who delivered in Israel between August and December 2021 with complete records of COVID-19 disease and vaccination status were included. A total of 2583 women were included in the analysis: 626 received the third booster dose of the BNT162b2, 1094 received two doses of the vaccine, and 863 were unvaccinated. Receiving the third booster was not associated with an increase in either composite adverse maternal or neonatal respectively) when compared to those who received two doses of the vaccine. Administration of the third booster dose during pregnancy was associated with a reduced composite adverse neonatal outcome compared to unvaccinated women (aOR 0.6; p=0.01) [ [Rottenstreich M, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00404-022-06786-9) ]. Kachikis et al analyzed a convenience sample of adults enrolled in the online prospective study. Participants who were pregnant, lactating, or neither pregnant nor lactating at the time of their booster or third dose were eligible for this follow-up survey; 17,014 (97.2%) completed the follow-up survey. 16,989 individuals reported their vaccine type for booster or third dose, most of them received the BNT162b2 (10,319 [60.7%]) or mRNA-1273 (6651 [39.2%]) vaccines. After a COVID-19 booster or third dose, 82.8% reported a local reaction, and 67.9% reported at least 1 systemic symptom. Compared with individuals who were neither pregnant nor lactating, pregnant participants were more likely to report any local reaction to a COVID-19 booster or third dose (aOR 1.2, 95% CI, 1.0-1.4; p = 0.01) but less likely to report any systemic reaction (aOR 0.7, 95% CI, 0.6-0.8; p<0.001). Most pregnant [97.6%]) lactating of 10,277 [96.0%]) individuals reported no obstetric or lactation concerns after vaccination. aOR = adjusted odds ratio [ [Kachikis A, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.30495) ] Sadarangani M et al was a cohort study conducted in Canada. This study aimed to determine the frequency and nature of significant health events among pregnant females after COVID-19 vaccination, compared with unvaccinated pregnant controls and vaccinated non-pregnant individuals. Data were collected primarily by self-reported survey after both vaccine doses. Most pregnant participants had received BNT162b2 (3414 received dose one and 1892 received dose two) or mRNA-1273 (2183 received dose one and 1216 received dose two) COVID-19 vaccines. Pregnant vaccinated females had decreased odds of a significant health event compared with non-pregnant vaccinated females after both dose one (aOR 0.63 95% CI 0.55 to 0.72]) and 0.62 [0.54 to 0.71]) of any mRNA vaccination. Pregnant vaccinated females had an increased odds of a significant health event within 7 days of the vaccine after dose two of mRNA-1273 (adjusted odds ratio 4.4 95% CI 2.4 to 8.3]) compared with pregnant unvaccinated controls and 1.3 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.42) after the second dose of Pfizer vaccine.

Covas D et al was a cross-sectional study conducted in Brazil that included 2,486 pregnant and postpartum women vaccinated with: 187 Sinovac, 572 Pfizer, 1,712 AstraZeneca and 15 Janssen. The aim was to describe the adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant and postpartum women in the early stage of the vaccination campaign in Brazil. Incidence of adverse events notified for pregnant women was 92.5 (95% Sinovac, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccine, respectively. Incidence of adverse events notified for postpartum women was 15.28 (95% 0-0) Sinovac, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccine, respectively [ [Covas DT, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0280284) ]. Mansour O et al was a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States including 2,129 pregnant women from the C-VIPER cohort who received at least one dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. The estimated overall cumulative risk of spontaneous abortion (SAB) by gestational week 20 was 13.4% (95% CI, 8.3% to 16.9%), which is within the range estimated by both population-based cohorts and v-safe. The cumulative risk of SAB by week 20 for Pfizer was 10.9% (95% CI, 5.9% to 14.7%), The cumulative risk of SAB by week 20 for Moderna was 20.6% (95% CI, 8.8% to 29.4%).

The study compared the frequency of adverse outcomes in between pregnant patients who received mRNA vaccines and unvaccinated patients. Vaccination was associated with a lower incidence of perinatal death (aOR 0.20 [95% CI, 0.05-0.88]), (aOR 0.63 [95% CI, 0.48-0.82]), neonates with very birth weight (aOR 0.35 [95% CI, 0.15-0.84]), and neonatal (aOR 0.66 [95% CI, 0.52-0.85]). aOR = adjusted Odds Ratio [ [Morgan JA, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000005072) ]. Woestenberg PJ et al was a cohort study conducted in the Netherlands, including 4,348 pregnant women who received at least one dose of Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca. After the first dose, 59% of the women reported 1 or more adverse reactions: 68% for Moderna, 87% for AstraZeneca and 56% for Pfizer. After the first dose, injection site reaction was most commonly reported (32% of women), followed by myalgia (26%) and fatigue (20%). After the second dose, fatigue was most commonly reported (28% of women), followed by myalgia (24%) and injection site reaction (23%).

Shulman et al. was a comparative study conducted in the United States [ [Shulman RM, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.6004/jnccn.2021.7113) ], which recorded short-term adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with cancer; it also compared the magnitude and duration of these reactions with those of patients without cancer and determined whether these adverse reactions are related to active cancer therapy. The study included patients with and without a history of cancer at an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center between February 16, 2021 and May 15, 2021. Post-vaccination symptoms were common and reported with similar frequencies by patients with and without cancer (73.3% vs 72.5%). There were no significant differences between patients with and without cancer in the frequency of adverse events when responses to the first and second vaccine dose were tabulated separately (dose 1: 61.3% vs 60.2%; dose 2: 64.2% vs 62.8%). The adverse event profile for patients with cancer receiving active treatment did not differ by treatment type for either dose 1 or dose 2. The authors suggest that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is well tolerated by patients with a history of cancer, including those receiving active treatment. Adverse events occurring shortly after vaccination closely resemble those seen in patients without cancer [ [Shulman RM, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.6004/jnccn.2021.7113) ]. Vinante L et al. was a comparative cohort that included 361 patients with 756 administered COVID-19 vaccinations (Pfizer:529 doses; Moderna: 194 doses; AstraZeneca: 28 doses; Janssen 5 doses).

Results showed that vaccinated women had a higher risk of increased cycle length than unvaccinated women in OR 1.48 (95% CI 1.00 to 2.19), after adjusting for sociodemographic and behavioral factors. COVID-19 vaccination was only associated with the change to longer cycles in the first 6 months after vaccination and among women whose cycles were short, long, or irregular before vaccination. This change was associated with messenger RNA and adenovirus-vectored vaccines. Menstrual cycle characteristics were not affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [Wang S, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2022.07.003) ]. Vinante L et al. was a comparative cohort that included 361 patients with 756 administered COVID-19 vaccinations (Pfizer:529 doses; Moderna: 194 doses; AstraZeneca: 28 doses; Janssen 5 doses). The study assessed the incidence of radiation recall dermatitis after COVID-19 vaccination in breast cancer patients previously treated with postoperative radiation therapy. Results showed that breast symptoms were reported by 7.5% of patients, while radiation recall dermatitis was considered for 5.5%. Radiation recall dermatitis was more common in the first dose compared to the second (4.4%) or third (1%), especially when administered within the first month after irradiation (12.5% vs 2.2%). Symptoms were generally self-limited, and anti-inflammatory medications were required in a few cases [ [Vinante L, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.breast.2022.06.008) ].

CVIM 4 was a randomized controlled trial conducted in Thailand. The study included 77 kidney transplant recipients (per protocol analysis) who had already been vaccinated with a full primary regimen with ChAdOx1 or that had been vaccinated with a primary regimen with CoronaVac and boosted with the ChAdOx1 vaccine. The participants were randomized two receive an additional dose of either a mRNA vaccine (Moderna of Pfizer BioNTech, n= 40, group M) or a viral vector vaccine (ChAdOx1, n= 37, group V). The immunogenicity outcome was the measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibody levels and the surrogate viral neutralization test (%SVNT); the cell-mediated immunity was evaluated through SARS-CoV-2 specific- interferon- (IFN-)-producing T and B cell. Both responses were measured 2 weeks after the intervention. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were assessed via phone call on days 3 and 7 post-vaccination, and unsolicited AEs were self-recorded by participants. At day 7, AEs were reported by 10 (25%) of the M group's participants and 9 (24%) of the V group's participants. No grade 3 AEs were reported by any group at day 7 [ [Bruminhent J, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajt.17151) ]. Nantanee R et al was randomized clinical trial conducted in Thailand.

The full-dose recipients tended to have more moderate-severe systemic reactogenicities, e.g., myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, and headache. Myalgia occurred more frequently in the standard-dose group (42% vs. 32% in the half-dose group, p 0.04) [ [Nantanee R, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10060914) ]. Terentes-Printzios D et al was a randomized cross over trial conducted in Greece. The study included 32 participants that received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (2 doses, 30 g per dose with a 3-week period between the 1st and the 2nd doses) in a sequence-randomized, sham-controlled, assessor-blinded, three-period (1st vaccine dose, 2nd vaccine dose, placebo), crossover design. There was a washout period of at least 7 days. The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effect of mRNA vaccine administration on endothelial function and arterial stiffness. The primary outcome was endothelial function (assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)), and the secondary outcomes were aortic stiffness (evaluated with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV)) and inflammation (measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in blood samples). There was an increase in hsCRP after the 1st dose (0.60 (95% CI 1.60 to 0.20) (p = 0.013) and the 2nd dose (maximum median difference at 48 h 6.60 (95% CI 9.80 to 3.409) (p < 0.001) compared to placebo. FMD remained unchanged during the 1st dose but decreased significantly by 1.5% (95% CI: 0.1% to 2.9%, p = 0.037) at 24 h after the 2nd dose. The vaccine did not change PWV.

The risk difference after the first booster compared with the primary series was -0.68 (95% CI, -1.82-0.46) for myocarditis and -0.23 (95% CI, -2.05-1.59) for pericarditis, the only adverse event that was positively significant was lymphadenopathy after the first booster, with a risk difference of 8.98 (95% CI, 1.68-16.28). [ [Yechezkel M, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(22)00407-6) ] Burn E et al was a study conducted in the United Kingdom, including 3,768,517 people vaccinated with AstraZeneca, 1,832,841 people vaccinated with Pfizer, 401,691 people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 9,414,403 people from the general population. The study assessed the risk of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after vaccination. An increased risk of venous thromboembolism was seen after the first dose of AstraZeneca with SIR (standardized incidence ratio) of 1.12 (95% CI, 1.05-1.20) and Pfizer 1.12 (95% CI, 1.03-1.21). Rates of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis were higher after the first dose of AstraZeneca 4.14 (95% CI, 2.54-6.76.

Reports of possible GBS were identified from the spontaneous surveillance system database for COVID-19 vaccine doses administered between February and September 2021. [ [Joshua Osowicki, 2022](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4127034) ] Gallo AT et al was a non comparative study conducted in Australia that included 977,559 participants with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and 258,606 with Pfizer vaccine and 11,967 with Novavax vaccine. 9 cases of anaphylactic reaction were reported after the first Moderna dose (0,01%), 1 case after the second dose (0,00%) and 5 cases after the third dose (0,00%). After the first dose of AstraZeneca 6 cases were reported for anaphylactic reactions (0,01%) and 1 case after the second dose (0,00%). After the first dose of Pfizer there were 0 cases of anaphylactic reactions, 1 case after the second dose and 0 cases after the third dose. No cases of anaphylaxis associated with the Novavax vaccine have been reported. [ [Gallo AT, 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10122041) ] Jacobs JW et al was a surveillance study conducted in the United States that reported autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia following SARS-CoV-2 and non-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including 863 reports between 1990 and 2022. There were 23 cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and 141 cases of immune thrombocytopenia associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. [ [Jacobs JW, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.18627) ] Abukhalil AD et al was a cross-sectional study conducted in Palestine that included 1,137 participants with at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The aim was to investigate the post-vaccine adverse events following the Pfizer Vaccine administration. Approximately one-third of participants reported no adverse efects after receiving the first, second, or third doses (34%, 33.6%, and 32.5%, respectively). The most commonly reported adverse events were fever, chills, headache, fatigue, pain and swelling at the injection site, muscle pain, and joint pain. [ [Abukhalil AD, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-022-07974-3) ] Monitoring WHO indicates that after a vaccine is approved for use, regulators conduct robust monitoring of efficacy, as well as monitoring of safety and risk minimization (pharmacovigilance) activities. They need to continually monitor the safety of the vaccine to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks. [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-05-2022-statement-for-healthcare-professionals-how-covid-19-vaccines-are-regulated-for-safety-and-effectiveness) ] Regarding safety surveillance and monitoring, serious adverse events, anaphylaxis and other severe allergic reactions, Bell's palsy, cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, cases of COVID-19 after vaccination resulting in hospitalization or death should be identified and recorded. Regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine, the following should be monitored: Efficacy of the vaccine over time and whether protection can be prolonged with booster doses. Studies to investigate whether this vaccine reduces the transmission and viral spread of SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation and notification of vaccine failures and information on viral sequences. Regarding the subgroups of interest Prospective studies on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant and lactating females. Occasional controlled trials on the safety and security of vaccination in children under 18 years of age. Safety data from vaccination in immunosuppressed people, including patients living with HIV and autoimmune diseases.
