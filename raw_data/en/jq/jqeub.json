At Cornell, Hannah worked as a research assistant in the Eleanor J. Gibson Laboratory of Developmental Psychology, studying the development of language in a social context. She pursued an independent project on the reward value of unimodal versus multimodal social cues in typically developing infants. During a clinical research internship in the Division of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center, she was drawn to research on developmental disorders and decided to pursue further training at the intersection of developmental and clinical psychology. As a Cohen fellow, Hannah used eye tracking to study the development of social visual engagement in typically developing children and children with autism. She was also interested in exploring the neural underpinnings of autism in order to help guide early detection and intervention.
