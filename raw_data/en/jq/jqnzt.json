Relevance to primary care and nursing Health professionals including paediatricians, health visiting and school nursing teams, GPs andpractice nurses are involved in children and young people 's immunisation services. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)has issued a guidance report for the National Health Service, commissioners, managers and health professionals on reducing differences in theuptake of immunisations (NICE 2009) in children and young people. It highlights the importance of parental responsibility and the need to providethem with information on childhood vaccinations. Characteristics of the evidence This Cochrane review contained six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one cluster RCT, which included 2978 participants who wereparents, guardians or others in a parental role,and who had at least one child due for childhood vaccinations (Kaufman et al., 2013). Three studieswere conducted in low- or middle-income coun- tries (Nepal, Pakistan) and four were conducted in high-income countries (Australia, Canada and theUnited States). Interventions needed to be face-to-face communication that needed to mention some aspects of routine childhood vaccinations that aimed to change parental knowledge, beliefs,attitudes, behaviour or self-ef cacy. They were directed to parents to inform or educate them about routine childhood vaccinations (based onrecommendations by the Wor ld Health Organisation (WHO 2012). They were compared with usual care or no intervention (eg, passive intervention, information cards). Most interventions were directed to mothers, one was delivered to expectant parents,and three targeted mothers who had barriers toaccessing vaccination, which included illicit drug users, adolescent mothers or mothers of low socio- economic status. Six studies delivered face-to-faceinterventions to individuals and one targeted groups of parents, via oral or information sessions, lectures, group classes, home visits or outreachsessions. They could be delivered by anyone including physicians, nurses or other healthcare professionals, lay volunteers from the communityor peers in clinics, antenatal classes or the mother 's home. The type, intensity and duration of inter- ventions varied. Summary of key evidence The trials were of low quality and were at moderate risk of bias overall. Primary outcomesincluded immunisation status of child and parental Correspondence to: Dr Daksha Trivedi, Senior Research Fellow, Evidence Based Practice, Centre for Research in Primary andCommunity Care, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane,Hateld, AL10 9AB, 15:339-341 REVIEW ARTICLEdoi:10.1017/S1463423614000322 \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2014 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1463423614000322 Published online by Cambridge University Pressknowledge or understanding of vaccination. Secondary outcomes included parental intention to vaccinate the child, experience of intervention, adverse effects and cost of implementing inter-vention. The latter was reported by one study and no other measures were reported. Assessment varied from immediate pre/post intervention to12 months. The cluster RCT did not report usable data for the review. Meta-analysis was not conducted. Face-to-face interventions for individual parents versus control Immunisation status, single session intervention Four comparisons from three studies ( n=2101) showed inconsistent results at three months. Two studies that showed signi cant improvement (18%; n=750 and 54%; n=754, respectively) in immunisation rates had a high risk of bias. Immunisation status, multi-session, post intervention Two low quality studies ( n=328) showed inconsistent results from reduced to no effect. Knowledge/understanding of vaccination Two studies ( n=489) with multi-session inter- ventions showed no signi cant effect compared with controls. Costs Only one low quality study ( n=365) reported costs, so the effects of the case managementintervention remain uncertain. The additional costof immunisation per child for the intervention delivered to all children was approximately eight times higher than usual care and four times higherfor high risk children (de ned as those children who received few well-child visits ( 3/5 visits). The study did not consider effects of the interventionon subsequent care and changes to costs over time, for which longer-term data are required. Face-to-face interventions for groups of parents versus control Knowledge/understanding of vaccination One cluster RCT reported comparable baseline scores and no signi cant differences betweengroups at post-test. Data were not usable for the review. No included studies were reported in other comparisons (Face-to-face i nterventions for indivi- duals versus groups, and comparison of two different types of face-to-face interventions) Implications for Practice There is insuf cient evidence to recommend face-to-face interventions to educate parentsabout early childhood vaccination, although incorporating communication about vaccination in routine care may be appropriate. Implications for research High quality RCTs are required to evaluate face- to-face interventions to educate parents across more diverse settings and populations, including low literacy populations. Comparisons of commoncombinations of multi-component interventions are required which include intermediate outcomes to identify pathways of effect. Trials with steppedinterventions need to be developed to examine theeffects of each component. Clarity is required on the content of components of interventions and comparisons as well as the format, method andfrequency of delivery.
