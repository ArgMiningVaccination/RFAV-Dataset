The toll this takes on our bodies can be quite severe. The normal waste by-products of cellular metabolism, such as carbon dioxide, are easily disposed of in a healthy person. However, when burdened with food preservatives, chemicals, pesticides, drugs, irradiated food and overeating, the eliminating channels become overloaded. According to the book, Edgar Cayce's Guide to Colon Care, by Sandra Duggan, R.N., the following problems are caused by toxic build-up: Skin rash Sluggish Liver Kidney problems Mucus in the colon Dark circles under the eyes Hypertension Heart palpitations Burning eyes Stiff knees Feeling tired and listless Dizziness Joint pain Muscle pain in arms and legs Poor digestion and assimilation Anemia Moodiness and irritability Cayce, \"the father of holistic medicine\", adamantly expressed \"...a clean colon is vital to our health and well-being...if the body can be kept free of toxic build-up, then it is capable of normally assimilating nutrients, and can replenish itself.\" Also, there seems to be a growing body of evidence that our society eats too much, is dangerously overweight and eats too many of the wrong foods. The emphasis is usually placed on calories and weight loss and how we look but ignore the health problems created by excess weight and eating our Standard American Diet. Specific detoxification organs in the body are stimulated ~ the liver, kidneys & intestines which will help you achieve optimal health. Emphasis is placed on the liver and the colon because these two organs play a major role in supporting the digestive systems and detoxification. It gives the body the resources it needs so that it can purify and rebuild itself naturally. Upon completion of the program, you will have a different mindset about food, your body and your health. Combine with colon hydrotherapy for maximum benefits. The 21-day Standard Process Purification Program This program isn't just a cleanse diet. It's a structured program that brings healthy lifestyle habits into focus. It's designed to purify, nourish and help patients maintain a healthy body weight by eating whole foods, exercising, drinking nutritious shakes and taking supplements made with whole food and other ingredients.* The menu includes a varied abundance of fresh vegetables and fruits for the first 10 days, with select proteins added on day 11. The supplements support the body's ability to remove naturally occurring toxins. This promotes a state that allows for toxin release.* Feel free to contact me for more information on this program. I have found it to be the most effective and gentle detox and an excellent reset in the years of being a Colon Hydrotherapist. The program also includes coaching support with me during the three weeks.
