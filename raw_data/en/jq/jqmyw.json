Welcome to Acupuncture and Herbcare Clinic Thank you for visiting Acupuncture and Herbcare clinic, established in 2000 in Essex, by Dr Amy Huang and Dr John Zheng.

What Our Practitioners Say: \"As an acupuncturist, dedicated to this field for nearly 30 years, it has become a part of my life.\" \"I really enjoy helping my clients. I love to work for myself as I prefer spending more time on each patient rather than filling in endless paperwork which I had done in the past in hospitals.\" What you can expect Each practitioner in our clinic has a unique style, often blending aspects of Eastern and Western approaches to medicine. To determine the type of acupuncture / herbal treatment and make an individually tailored plan that will help you the most, your practitioner may ask you about your symptoms, behaviour and lifestyle. They may also closely examine: - The parts of your body that are related to your symptoms - The shape, coating and colour of your tongue - The colour of your face - The strength, rhythm and quality of the pulse in your wrist. The initial consultation and treatment may take up to 60-90 minutes with subsequent appointments usually taking about 45 minutes. They may include, as appropriate, within their treatments ear acupuncture, cupping, scalp acupuncture, subcutaneous acupuncture or electro-acupuncture, to maximise their sessions therapeutic outcome. Sometimes they may suggest taking herbal medicine combined with acupuncture treatment; A common treatment plan for a single complaint would involve one or two treatments a week, the number of treatments depending on the condition being treated and its severity. The benefits of acupuncture / herbs are cumulative, so more than one treatment is necessary. When the body heals the treatments can be reduced in frequency, but it is common to receive six to ten treatments.

I specially have interests in treating Infertility and IVF support.\" Urinary System Disease - \"Acupuncture treatment for OAB, Urinary Incontinence, BPE is a research project funded by government and 2000 patients were in the group. I got involved in this project over 20 years ago in China. I was fortunate to have had opportunity to learn how to treat Urinary system disease with acupuncture from some top specialists. Since then I have never stopped practising, I have always been amazed by what it can achieve from Acupuncture treatment. I do hope that I could help more people be free from suffering.\" What Our Clients Say \"Dear Doctor Amy, Thank you so much for all your help. Thank you for the advice, for the treatments, and always listening to my worries. Baby is coming at last! It would not be possible if you have not been there to help us through it. I haven't had period for 7 years when I came to see you. All the Doctors I had been visited told me that IVF is only option for me. But you made this miracle happen naturally! Thank you! You have always been patient supportive. Every treatment I had with you has been a wonderful journey towards motherhood. All the best! And may you continue to be a blessing to other hopeful moms, like you have been to me. Thank you so so much!

What Our Practitioners Say about themselves: Pain Management - \"After the university education, I started my first job as an Orthopaedic surgeon in Orthopaedic Hospital. In clinic I found quite a lot of chronic and acute pain actually couldn't get solved by operations. Painkiller abuse is a wildly spreading problem, but pain killers can only provide short-term pain relief, alongside the addictive nature of these drugs can also quickly lead to a painkiller addiction. So I decided to look for some different ways to help the patients and applied the 3 years Master course in Acupuncture dealing with chronic spinal diseases.\" What Our Clients Say When I came I thought I would never walk again, but only had one treatment and 95% walking better. Next time I came to have another appointment again, now I am walking OK. Also cleaned up my chest infection 4 treatments in all. Thank you "}
