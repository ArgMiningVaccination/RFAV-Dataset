It is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.\" Audre Lorde Care to join me? We'll begin on the Snow Moon, Jan 21st, the first New Moon of the Year about the program: It is an invitation to rest and re-set, to gather and grow together Each day for 30 days you will receive an email with an attached PDF, featuring a prompt, a practice, a sample ritual, a quote/affirmation, and a seasonal recipe or two*. Some practices will be cumulative (and others a one time experience). Some days you will find the suggested action easy and some days perhaps a little more challenging, some days the rituals will speak right to you and other days you may want pass and to create your own. * I try to keep them simple with items which most people have in their homes or can be found at the local grocery store, if I suggest a more specialized herb or ingredient I will offer more common alternatives also. I want to introduce nourishing herbal practices to you but also make it immediately and transformative You will be guided to create your own personal self care toolkit and manual. We will have a private (optional) Facebook page to document your progress and share challenges with other, I will be popping in daily to cheer you all along and offer inspiration and support. This email/PDF based course gives you tools you can return to time and time again. Often all we need that one little action to shift our mindset/ the energy and to be able to take those small steps needed to start to feel more like ourselves. Something I have learnt during my 25 years in the Holistic Health Care field is that by creating reliable self-care habits we can be more present, make clearer decision, and begin to unlock the fullness of life. Be prepared to start feeling very full :-)! The best road to self care is to establish simple daily practices which remind you of the gifts, benefits, blessings, you enjoy and the goodness that prevails in your life. Step by step we can reset our past programming and begin to treat ourselves with love.
