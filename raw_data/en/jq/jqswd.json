Immune-boosting formulas like LifeSpa's [Immuno-Blast](https://store.lifespa.com/product/immuno-blast/) use mostly herbs that traditional cultures simply foraged as food. This formula includes immune-boosting mushrooms, such as maitake and shiitake,8 along with beta-glucans, often considered the active agent in mushroom immune support.9 Other ingredients include: a (15ppm), which has been used in Ayurveda for thousands of years. All of these ingredients have been well-studied and confirmed to support immune function. Finally, the addition of menthol crystals and eucalyptus oil support healthy lung function and respiration. LifeSpa's Immuno-Blast is now the go-to first defense herbal formula for my family and patients because it has consistently outperformed other immune formulas.

Here's what the science says about shiitake, colloidal Maitake (Grifola frondosa) and Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) the of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4202470/) evaluated shiitake and maitake mushroom glycans for immune-supportive potential. Researchers found significant stimulation of immune-defense reaction with a maitake-shiitake combination, maitake having the strongest response, followed by shiitake. The study concluded that short-term oral doses of natural immunomodulating glucans from maitake and shiitake mushrooms strongly support heathy immune response in both branches of the immune system: the cellular and the humoral.1 Beta Glucans Beta glucans are naturally occurring polysaccharides, or long chains of glucose molecules, that make up the cell walls of mushrooms. The healing and immune-stimulating properties of mushrooms have been known for thousands of years in Eastern countries.2 Mushroom beta glucans support a health immune response by increasing host immune defense, and enhancing macrophages, which help to support the repair of damaged cells, and natural killer cell function.2 Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) Astragalus is one of Chinese medicine's classic immunoregulatory herbs. It's a warm, heavy, and sweet root quickly absorbed by the body, much like its sister, the Ayurvedic herb [ashwagandha](https://store.lifespa.com/product/ashwagandha-capsules/). Studies suggest astragalus also activates Echinacea angustifolia is one of the West's most reliable immune tonics and has been used as a first defense immune response agent for centuries. Echinacea angustifolia is a wide-spectrum immunomodulator that regulates both innate and adaptive immune responses.4,11 Garlic (Allium sativum) Garlic appears to support immune system function by stimulating certain cell types, such as macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and eosinophils. Garlic has been found to support healthy modulation of years as an immune-stimulating agent. Studies back-up the traditional use of licorice to support healthy immune response. Licorice is a demulcent herb, meaning it is gentle on the digestive system. Ayurveda uses licorice as an anupam, or carrier herb, to assist in the absorption of other herbs in a formula. Studies suggest one of the mechanisms for licorice's effect on the immune system is through its impact on the lymphatic system (which carries the immune system) and the healthy proliferation of lymphocytes.6,12,13 We recommend \"How Much Licorice mostly in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine as an immune system tonic.7 Forsythia Fruit (Forsythia) Forsythia fruit is a heat-clearing, detoxifying herb classically used in Chinese medicine to support healthy immune response.8 Honeysuckle Flowers (Lonicera japonica) Honeysuckle flowers have as a heat-clearing, lymphatic-moving, immune-supportive herb.9,14,15 Colloidal Silver Silver products have been used for thousands of years for hygiene and immune support. Studies suggest silver is non-toxic and may support healthy immune response by a process in which silver cations form pores in the cell walls of undesirable bacteria, enter the cells, and support an immune response once inside the cells.10 Immuno-Blast for Immune Support Support your immune system with my blend of these powerful herbs and tonics!
