The wellness programs at the [NYU Langone Fertility Center](/locations/fertility-center) can help reduce your overall stress, bring your body to optimum health, and prepare it for pregnancy. There is some evidence that complementary treatments are most likely to benefit fertility when started before ovulation, but the effects can continue throughout your cycle. We offer acupuncture, yoga, psychological services, nutrition, and mind-body classes. Acupuncture Acupuncturists Lara Rosenthal and Sara Frohlich believe that peak fertility occurs with peak vitality. Acupuncture aims to calm the nervous system and improve blood flow to the pelvic region. It may improve pregnancy rates when used in conjunction with fertility treatment. Acupuncture can be paired with Chinese herbs, lifestyle, and nutritional guidance to boost your overall health and maximize your fertility. Acupuncture may be safely used before and in conjunction with fertility medications and procedures such as [in vitro fertilization (IVF)](/locations/fertility-center/in-vitro-fertilization-egg-freezing-embryo-banking/in-vitro-fertilization) and intrauterine insemination. To schedule an individual appointment with one of our acupuncturists, please call [212-807-6769](tel:212-807-6769) or email [info@lararosenthal.com](mailto:info@lararosenthal.com). Yoga Yoga can help you relax, stretch, and strengthen your body. It is safe to practice anytime during your fertility treatment. Group classes are on hiatus, but private sessions, either in-person or online, are available. For more information, please email [barrieraffel@earthlink.net](mailto:barrieraffel@earthlink.net). Psychological Services Dealing with your emotions is an important part of your IVF treatment, and our specialists at the Fertility Center want you to feel supported as you embark upon your treatment journey. Psychotherapy for individuals and couples dealing with anxiety, depression, and the emotional impact of grief and loss is available through the Fertility Center. We help you develop coping skills and strategies to handle the ups and downs of infertility treatment. We also teach work-life balance skills and stress management tools. Couples can benefit from talking through the conflicts and anxiety that can occur while receiving treatment. Please call [212-263-0054](tel:212-263-0054) to receive a referral for these services. Patients enrolled in our donor egg, donor sperm, and gestational carrier programs receive this information as a part of your orientation. Nutrition for Fertility Because the food you eat can have an impact on your reproductive health, we partner with [Rooted Wellness](https://www.rootedwellness.com/) to offer one-on-one nutritional counseling. During your initial consultation, a registered dietitian assesses your medical history, current diet, and infertility treatment plan. They review your food log and create an individualized food plan geared toward helping you achieve your health and wellness goals. Mind-Body Stress Reduction Classes For more than 35 years, Helen Adrienne, LCSW, has taught individuals, couples, and groups how to reverse the physiology of stress. She runs a series of four psychoeducational classes for the wellness program, in which you will learn a large array of coping skills, including mindfulness, guided imagery, breathing techniques, and self-hypnosis, along with ways to transform negative thinking and build self-awareness.
