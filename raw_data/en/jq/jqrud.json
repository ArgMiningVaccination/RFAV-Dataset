Webinars for the Australian Naturopathic Practitioners Association Inc (ANPA) DEMENTIA: ESSENTIAL OILS OFFER SOLUTIONS FOR QUALITY OF LIFE People are asking what I know about Aromatherapy and Dementia. Apart from my PhD thesis and a couple of journal articles, I created a webinar for naturopaths on this topic in 2018. You will learn about symptoms of dementia relieved by essential oils, the most useful essential oils, current research evidence and the best ways to apply the oils for people with dementia. AROMATHERAPY FOR NATUROPATHS Here are the recordings I did in 2017 for the Australian Naturopathic Practitioners Association - two webinars covering details of what essential oils are, what aromatherapy is, what the evidence-base is, and five effective essential oil treatments naturopathic practitioners can use with their clients.
