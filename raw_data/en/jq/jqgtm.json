In this tapping massage your body's energy lines are tapped with a mallet from a tamarind tree, creating a resonating, healing vibration, penetrating deep into your muscles, clearing blocked energy. Tok Sen is a unique massage originating in Chiang Mai in the north of Thailand, and is therefore not found in the tourist areas of Thailand or in other parts of the world. The technique removes the blockages in energy channels, activates acupressure points, promotes the normal flow of energy in the body, and relaxes contracted muscular patterns, which other massage techniques are unable to reach. Tok Sen has a proven therapeutic effect in the resistance of diseases associated with the musculoskeletal system and some internal organs. Benefits include cleansing the body of toxins and removing negative energy, eliminating tension in the muscles and fascia, reducing the effects of stress and restoring mental calm, and treating hseadaches, neurasthenia, and pain in the spine and joints.

Chi Nei Tsang - Taoist Abdominal Massage In Ancient Chinese Taoism it is understood that when we have an emotional blockage a blockage is also created in the belly. The abdomen is the centre of feeling and emotion, as well as for assimilation, digestion and letting go of food and of emotions. This abdominal massage holds space for unreleased emotions to be felt, expressed and released. It also works on the physical level, clearing blockages, easing tensions, moving the blood and lymph fluid and promoting bowel clearance.

Acupuncture Acupuncture is one of the most well-known traditional Chinese medicine treatments that has been practicing over 2,000 years. Acupuncture is a natural way to empower self-healing and balance the body's ecosystems by focusing on qi, Yin & Yang theory and 5 elements principle. From the perspective of traditional acupuncture, pain and illness occur when our flow of vital energy (qi) through the energy's pathways (meridians) becomes stagnant. By inserting thin needles into specific points along these pathways could encourage and regulate your energy's flow. Restoring balance and stimulating the body's innate ability to heal. Chinese Cupping Cupping is one of the methods from traditional Chinese medicine. Cups are applied to the skin and suction is created, drawing blood through the layer of muscle and fascia to the surface. Pressure provided by cupping can loosen muscles, relieve tension, encourage blood flow, and sedate the nervous system. Encourage muscles to recover faster. It also stimulates and aids the immune system, removes built up toxins, and relieves back pain, joint pain, stiffness and spasms.
