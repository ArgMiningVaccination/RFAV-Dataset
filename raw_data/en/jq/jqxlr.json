These parameters can include models for viewing personality development; explaining past behavior; predicting future behavior; understanding the current behavior of the client; diagnosing and plan - ning treatment; assessing client motivations, needs, and unresolved issues; and identifying strategies and interventions for use during the counseling and psycho - therapy process. Theories help organize data and provide guidelines for the prevention and intervention efforts of counselors and therapists. They direct a professional helper's attention and observations and offer constructs, terminology, and viewpoints that can be understood by colleagues and used during supervision and consultation sessions. Theory directly influences the interventions used by counselors and therapists to promote a client's new insight, new behavior, and new approaches to relationships and problem solving. The greater a counselor or therapist's awareness of the strengths and possibilities inherent in numer - ous theoretical frames of reference, the greater the potential for understand - ing the uniqueness of a particular client and for developing the most effective treatment plan. This book is unique in both format and content. All of the contributing authors are experts who provide state-of-the-art information about theories of counsel - ing and psychotherapy (see the \"Meet the Contributors\" section for their back - grounds). In addition, each chapter discusses applications of theory as they relate to one particular case study: a hypothetical client named Maria to whom we are introduced in the introduction to Part 2. This book also includes information that is sometimes not addressed in other counseling and psychotherapy textbooks, such as the core dimensions of and brief and integrative approaches to the help - ing relationship, diversity and social justice issues in counseling, feminist theory, dialectical behavior theory, transpersonal theory, constructivist theories, and cre - ative approaches in counseling and psychotherapy. The book's unique approach enhances its readability and should increase reader interest in the material.vi Preface FEATURES OF THE TEXT This book is designed for students who are beginning their study of individual coun - seling and psychotherapy. It presents a comprehensive overview of each of the fol - lowing: psychoanalytic, Jungian, Adlerian, existential, person-centered, rational theories; reality therapy/choice theory; and family, feminist, transpersonal, constructivist, and cre - ative approaches. Each theory is addressed from the perspective of background, hu - man nature, major constructs, applications (which includes a discussion of the goals of counseling and psychotherapy, the process of change, traditional intervention strate - gies, and brief intervention strategies), clients with serious mental health issues, cross- cultural considerations, and evaluation (which evaluates both the supporting research and the limitations of the theory). Each discussion also includes a summary chart and a case study consistent with the theoretical model. We know that one text cannot adequately address all of the factors connected with a given theory; entire texts have been written discussing each of the theories in this book. We have, however, attempted to provide readers with a consistent approach to analyzing and studying each theory and have included examples of how to apply the theory to a case study. The format for this text is based on the contributions of the coeditors, who con - ceptualized the content and wrote the first chapter, as well as the contributions of 30 authors selected for their expertise in various theories. Each chapter contains theoretical and applied content. The text is divided into the following three parts: \"Foundations for Individual Counseling and Psychotherapy,\" \"Theories of Counsel - ing and Psychotherapy,\" and \"Constructivist Theories and Creative Approaches.\" Part 1, \"Foundations for Individual Counseling and Psychotherapy\" (Chapters 1 and 2), begins by offering general information about the helping relationship and individual counseling as well as information on brief approaches to counsel - ing and psychotherapy. This introductory information is followed by a chapter ti - tled \"Diversity and Social Justice Issues in Counseling and Psychotherapy,\" which sets the stage for developing awareness of the limitations of traditional Western theories and subsequent cross-cultural/diversity discussions. Part 2, \"Theories of Counseling and Psychotherapy\" (Chapters 3-15), presents in - formation on the 13 theories selected for inclusion in this portion of the text. Each of these theory and then applies the theory to the case study of Maria. Part 3, \"Constructivist Theories and Creative Approaches,\" is focused on the fourth force of counseling and psychotherapy and the use of creativity in counseling. NEW TO THIS EDITION This edition of our text includes some additional features that we think will be of great interest to readers. Chapter 1 has been updated and also includes a brief dis - cussion on integrative counseling. An updated chapter on diversity and social jus - tice issues in counseling and psychotherapy presents state-of-the-art information vii Preface and perspectives to counselors who will be practicing with increasingly diverse client populations. Readers should really enjoy the new rendition of the psycho - analytic theory chapter, which now goes beyond a discussion of classical psycho - analysis and includes brief psychodynamic theory, psychodynamic interpersonal theory, and interpersonal psychotherapy. The cognitive-behavioral chapter pro - vides the reader with general background about both behavioral and cognitive behavior theoretical views and discusses how the cognitive behavior approach developed from the behavioral point of view. The updated chapter on family theory is included to sensitize the reader to the fact that counselors and therapists engaging clients in individual work must keep in mind the systemic variables influencing clients and the fact that some clients may need family counseling and psychotherapy as part of a comprehen - sive treatment plan. Completely new to this sixth edition are chapters on constructivist theories and creative approaches to counseling and psychotherapy. Few counseling textbooks of this nature address these conceptual frameworks. We think readers will be stimulated by these features. Finally, professors adopting this text can request the PowerPoint slides and quiz items that have been developed for use with this text. We, the coeditors, and the 30 other contributors have made every effort to give the reader current information and content focused on both theory and application. It is our hope that this sixth edition of Counseling and Psychotherapy: Theories and Interven - tions will provide the foundation that students need to make decisions about follow- up study of specific theories as well as the development of their own personal theory of counseling and psychotherapy.ix Acknowledgments We would like to thank the authors who contributed their time and expertise to the development of this book for professionals interested in individual counseling and psychotherapy.
