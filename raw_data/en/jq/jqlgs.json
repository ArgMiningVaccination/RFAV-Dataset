Sharon Frey, M.D ., clinical director of SLU's Center for Vaccine Development and principal investigator of the Moderna trial at SLU Denise Hooks -Anderson, M.D., assistant dean for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and associate professor, Family and Community Medicine at Saint Louis University Niva Lubin -Johnson, M.D ., FACP ,an internal medicine physician based in Chicago, served as the 119th President of the National Medical Association (NMA) and serves as chair of the Women Physicians Section Governing Council for the American Medical Association (AMA) MYTH 1: You can delay routine vaccinations until the pandemic is over. You shouldn't postpone your vaccinations. Submit question in the Q & A featureMYTH 2: The COVID -19 vaccines were developed too fast to be safe. There were not enough participants in the clinical trials todeclare the vaccines safe. The technology used to develop the new COVID -19 vaccines is not new. Submit question in the Q & A featureMYTH 3: I already had COVID -19, so I do not need the vaccine. It's not clear how long a natural infection with COVID -19 provides immunity from the disease. There are reports of individuals becoming reinfected with the virus. Submit question in the Q & A featureMYTH 4: COVID -19 vaccines were developed to deliver a microchip into my body. The vaccine will alter my DNA. The vaccine does not contain a microchip. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines work in the cell's cytoplasm and never enter the cell nucleus, where the DNA, your genetic material, lives. Submit question in the Q & A featureMYTH 5: I will not need to wear a mask after I am vaccinated. The COVID -19 vaccines protect you from getting seriously ill from COVID -19.But it's not known if the vaccine will keep you from being infected then transmitting the virus to others. Submit question in the Q & A featureWhat are the ingredients in the COVID -19 vaccine? Do the COVID -19 vaccines contain aborted fetal tissue? The active ingredient in both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is mRNA. The mRNA tells your cells how to make a protein from the c oronavirus. Once your body knows how to make the protein, it can recognize COVID -19 and fight it off. The vaccines also contain lipids (fats ), various salts, sucrose, and other stabilizing ingredients to help your body use the mRNA. No, the COVID -19 vaccines do not contain any aborted fetal cells. However, Pfizer and Moderna did perform confirmation tests (to ensure the vaccines work) using fetal cell lines. Fetal cell line s are not the same as fetal tissue. Fetal cell lines are cells that grow in a laboratory. They descend from cells taken from elective abortion s in the 1970s and 1980s. No fetal cell lines were used to manufacture the vaccine, and they are not inside the injection you receive. Submit question in the Q & A featureWhat are the side effects of the COVID -19 vaccine? Is there a risk of severe allergic reaction if I receive the vaccine? CDC.gov NCBIYou may have pain and swelling at the injection site and experience fever, chills, tiredness, and headache. Side effects may feel like flu and even affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Serious problems from vaccination can happen, but they are rare. There have been approximately 21 cases of anaphylaxis out of nearly 2 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, compared to 1-5 cases per 10,000 people given Penicillin.Does the COVID -19 vaccine cause infertility? I am pregnant or plan to become pregnant, can I still get the vaccine? Are there additional risks for me? It is especially important that certain eligible patient populations, including pregnant women, consult with their trusted physicians when considering whether to take the vaccine. ACOG recommends that COVID -19 vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant individuals who meet criteria for vaccination based on ACIP -recommended priority groups. Submit question in the Q & A featureWhere can I find the best source of information regarding pregnancy and COVID -19 vaccine? ACOG.ORG and discuss with your provider. Submit question in the Q & A featureWhat is the difference between Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson COVID -19 vaccines? Pfizer and Moderna uses mRNA technology. Johnson & Johnson utilizes a viral vector technology. Submit question in the Q & A featureCan you get Covid -19 once you get the vaccine? Can you transmit Covid -19 tosomeone else after getting the vaccine? It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity (protection against the virus that causes COVID -19) after vaccinat ion. That means it's possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID -19 just before or just after vaccination and still get sick .We don't yet know whether getting a COVID -19 vaccine will prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID -19 to other people, even if you d on't get sick yourself. CDC will continue to update as we learn more. Submit question in the Q & A featureHow can people trust the vaccine in underprivileged communities with the history of being mistreated and tested on in the past? The choice to be vaccinated for COVID -19 is a personal one. I t's vital to have a relationship with your primary care physician and to ask questions and raise concerns until you have answers that allow you to make a good decision for yourself. Submit question in the Q & A featureWhy is diversity so important in clinical trials? When people have different genetic and biologic makeup, their bodies can produce antibodies differently. This means to ensure a vaccine will protect people of all ethnic groups, we need to make sure everyone is fully represented in clinical trials Submit question in the Q & A featureHow has COVID -19 impacted women? Unemployment data in the U.S. indicate that women make up 54 percent of the overall job losses to date. Mothers continue to shoulder the majority of family caregiving responsibilities and are faced with lack of childcare infrastructure and online schooling. Source: McKinsey & CompanyWhat barriers have you encountered as a woman in medicine and research? Sexism, racism, and microaggression. Submit question in the Q & A featureWhat advice would you give a young female doctor just starting out in her career? Role of advocacy and negotiation. Submit question in the Q & A featureWhat communication skills do you use to increase rapport with patients and inform them about the COVID -19 vaccine? Building trust and longitudinal relationships. Submit question in the Q & A featureWhich lasts longer, immunity after getting COVID -19 or protection from COVID -19 vaccines? We don't know how long natural immunity might last. Current evidence suggests that getting the virus again (reinfection) is uncommon in the 90 days after the first infection with the virus that causes COVID -19. We won't know how long immunity lasts after vaccination until we have more data on how well COVID -19 vaccines work in real -world conditions. Submit question in the Q & A featureWhere can I get a vaccine and when? Visit covidvaccine.mo.gov to find out when you are eligible to receive the vaccine and locations offering vaccinations. In the St. Louis area, selected health care systems include BJC Healthcare, SSM Health, Mercy St. Louis, St. Luke's Hospital and the St. Louis County Health Department.

Ifyou've been fully vaccinated: CDC.gov Submit question in the Q & A featureYou can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask. Ifyou've been around someone who has COVID -19, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms. However, if you live in a group setting (like a correctional or detention facility or group home) and are around someone who has COVID -19, you should still stay away from others for 14 days and get tested, even ifyoudon't have symptoms.Soul of a Storm Poem by \u00a9Ms Moem She has the soul of a storm and the freedom of the wind. She has eyes like the stars with moonshine within. With the strength of the sea and lightning in her toes She dances on the breeze of change wherever she goes. Hotter than a volcano and deeper than the oceans A whirling, swirling myriad of feelings & emotions. She is daughter of the earth, primordially inspired. She is water, she is wood. She is earth. She is fire!Resources American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) - familydoctor.org BJC Healthcare -BJC.org Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -cdc.gov Illinois Department of Public Health -dph.illinois.gov Mercy -Mercy.net or 1-833-364-6777 Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services - health.mo.gov National Institutes for Health (NIH) -nih.govNational Medical Association (NMA) -nmanet.org Regional Response Team -FAQs SLUCare Physician Group -SLUCare.edu SSM Health -SSMHealth.com St. Louis City Department of Health -stlouis -mo.gov or 314-615-2660 The Center for Black Health & Equity and American Lung Association -Understanding Immunizations and the COVID - 19 Vaccines Vatican -Vatican.vaA recording of this webinar will be available on the News and Events page of our "}
