These protocols include instructions on investigations, collection, ha ndling, and shipping of specimens meningitides Acute Flaccid Myelitis. In addition links to requi red forms, case definitions, and CDC's Vaccine Surveillance Manual 1.When Area Immunization Manager (AIM) or designee receives a positive lab results for VPDs in Alabama NEDSS Based System (ALNBS) queue, presumptive VPD reports from an online REPORT Card, call from notifiable disease reporters (physicians, nurses, dentists, medical examiners, hospital administrators, nursing home administrators, laboratory directors, school principals, childcare/Head Start directors) or central office, open the investigation in ALNBS. The only exceptions to not opening an investigation are for varicella, rubella, and mumps IgG lab results, see 5 below. For calls received directly from reporter, notify central office staff, Data Quality and Surveillance Branch Director, VPD Surveillance Coordinator, or Immunization Director. If no central office staff is available, notify Dr. Karen Landers via e- mail, Karen.landers@adph.state.al.us, or phone (256) 246-1714 2.At a minimum, vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) investigation must be opened in ALNBS on the same day for 4-hour diseases, within 24 hours for 24-hour diseases and outbreaks, and within 5 days for Standard Notification Diseases. 3.If the report is not from a physician, contact the provider about the presumptive case of VPD and obtain lab results performed to date and what specimens are available for further testing. 4.For VPD cases in child care center/homes and schools, please see the AAP Redbook regarding exclusions. Regardless of exclusions, contact the child care center/home director or school nurse to notify the parents of children who are not fully immunized for the specific VPD investigated. 5.For varicella, rubella, or mumps IgG positive lab results received, contact the provider and college/university who ordered the lab to educate, and document the education on the VPD Provider Education Spreadsheet. The education must include: A.The Notifiable Disease Rule specifically required providers to report separately from the labs. Future positive IgGs will not be investigated unless the provider who ordered the labs reports the potential case. The preferred test methods for varicella are culture, IMM VPD Surveillance Protocols, 5/3/16 2 or mumps PCR, or serology, please see TEST Webpage http://www.adph.org/epi/Default.asp?id=5192 . B. How the provider can report a notifiable disease online, https://www.adph.org/Extranet/Forms/Form.asp?ss=s&formID=4799 , or 1-800-469- 4599. C. Reasons to report timely include providing ci vil and criminal liability protection for the provider. D. Ask if the provider looked for the patient's v accine history or previ ous titer results in ImmPRINT. If they don't have access to ImmPRINT, educate the provider and college/university on ImmPRINT an d encourage them to enroll. After calling and educating the provider, docum ent the education on the I:/drive, VPD folder, VPD Provider Education Spreadsheet, \"Mark Lab as Reviewed\" in ALNBS, and enter in the ALNBS General Comment section \"Provider educat ed on date.\" After calling and educating the college/university, document on the second tab of the provider spread sheet and include the source for their recommendations. 6. Request lab at a private provide r's office for all VPDs reporte d. Please note ADPH registered nurses (RNs) should be trained to collect most VPD specimens, including NP swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates. For specimens obtai ned by Immunization fiel d staff, please see Lotus Notes, Document Library, Clinic Protocol Manual, St anding Orders 2016, 2016 Standing Order IMM TB Med Adm ER, 2. Collecti ng specimens needed to test for vaccine preventable diseases. A. For measles and rubella , request a serology and throat swab, nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirate, or NP swab. AIM or designee is not allowed to collect a throat swab or nasopharyngeal aspirate. Physicians, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, and registered nurses (RNs) can collect NP swab s aspirates. Specimen collection must be within 3 days of rash onset for measles and 4 days of rash onset for rubella. B. For mumps , request a buccal swab. AIM or designee is allowed to collect a buccal swab. Specimen collection must be as soon as mumps is suspected. C. For diphtheria , request a nose, throat or wound swa b. Physicians, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, and RN s can collect a swab. D. For pertussis , whenever possible, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or aspirate should be obtained from all persons with suspected case s. The specimen should ideally be collected during the first three weeks of illness, but may provide accurate results for up to 4 weeks. E. For varicella , to make a laboratory diagnosis of VZV infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, the pres ence of the virus DNA should be demonstrated in tissues, vesicular fluid, maculopapular lesi ons, or crusts from lesions. F. For Haemophilus influenzae (HI) and meningococcal (mening), to make a laboratory diagnosis of HI or mening in fections using isolation of th e organism by culture or PCR method, the presence of the bacteria shoul d come from a normally sterile body site. IMM VPD Surveillance Protocols, 5/3/16 3 G. For pneumococcal (strep pneumo), to make a laboratory diagnosis of strep pneumo, the bacterial organism should be isolated from a normally sterile body site. Susceptibility testing should be performed in children <5 years of age. H. For Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM), to make a laboratory di agnosis of AFM, the onset of focal limb weakness should be present and a MRI should be performed and/or CSF should be collected. All specimens should be co llected as early in onset as possible. 7. Review all investigations to ensure the case clas sification is selected, all fields are complete, and submit the investigation within 30 days of opening. 8. Completed all fields on BCL Requisition Form, http://www.adph.org/bcl/assets/BCL_Requisiton_Form.pdf , Wisconsin (WI) State Laboratories Hygiene Form, http://www.adph.org//bcl/assets/WSLH_Lab_Form.pdf or CDC Specimen Collection Form, http://www.adph.org/bcl/assets/CDC_Dash.pdf , see table below.

If the physician does not have the kit for collectio n of the PCR, please provide a kit for collection. Instruct the provider to properly pa ckage the specimens, w ith the completed lab forms, and drop off at the county health depart ment. Alternatively, the provider can pay to have the specimen shipped to the BCL. If th ere is a problem with the physician sending the IMM VPD Surveillance Protocols, 5/3/16 4 specimen, please pick up the specimen and ship it to the BCL. For assistance with specimen collection, please request the BCL to contact the provider's lab. 10. For specimens obtained by ADPH staff for VPDs, complete the BCL Lab Requisition as Specimen Collection Swab - or nasal swab should be transfe rred to 1-3ml of viral transport medium (do not allow to dry out). The entire samp le can be frozen at -70\u00b0C or if low temperature freezers are not available, keep the sample at 4\u00b0C and ship on cold packs. Serology - Blood for serologic testing is collec ted by venipuncture or by finger/heel stick. Use tubes without additives\u2014either a plain, red-top tube or a serum separator tube. The preferred volume for IgM and IgG testing at CDC is 0.5-1 ml of serum to allow for re-testing; however, testing can be done with as little as 0.1 ml (100 ul) if necessary. Generall y, 5 ml of blood (yield about 1.5 ml of serum) can easily be collected fr om adults. Do not freeze the tube before serum has been removed. Centrifuge the tube to separate serum from clot. Gel separation tubes should be centrifuged no later than 2 hours after collection. Aseptically transfer serum to a sterile tube that has an externally threaded cap with an o-ring seal. Fres h, sterile serum can be shipped overnight on a wet ice pack. Hemolyzed and lip emic serum and plasma are noted and tested, usually without apparent interferen ces. Capillary tubes can be util ized for infants. Capillary tubes require the submitter to have access to the appr opriate centrifuge for these capillary tubes. Clinical laboratories should have 50 or 100 ul capi llary tubes that are typi cally used for a variety of tests such as hematocrits or total lipids on new borns. At least 3 of the 50 ul hematocrit capillary tubes should be collected and s pun in a hematocrit centrifuge. Rubella IMM VPD Surveillance Protocols, 5/3/16 5 Respiratory Swab - A throat swab or nasopharyngeal wash should be collected. Materials: sterile swabs, 3 ml aliquots of viral transport medium (VTM: ster ile PBS or suitable isotonic solution such as Hanks BSS, containing anti biotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin) and either 2 % fetal bovine serum or 0.5% gelatin in 15 ml polycarbonate or polystyrene centrifuge tubes, 5 ml plastic syringes, plastic aspirators or 30 ml syringe, Styrof oam shipping containers. Swab throat in the same manner as obtaining a bacterial culture. An alternative method for specimen collection is a nasal wash (nasopharyngeal aspirate) using a syringe attached to a small, plastic tube and 3-5 ml of VTM. After placing VTM in the nose, aspirate as much of the material as possible and rinse the tube with a small volum e (2ml) of VTM. Alternatively, sterile swabs can be used to wipe the nose and throat. Place bo th swabs in a tube containing 2-3 ml of transport medium. The virus is extremely cell-associated, so attempt to swab the throat and nasal passages to collect epithelial cells. Procedures for shipping of specimens Preferred me thod: Keep all specimens on wet ice or at 4\u00b0 C and ship as soon as possible on wet ice (see address below). Other acceptable methods: If immediate, cold shipment (within 48 hrs) canno t be arranged or is not convenient please contact Bureau of Clinical Laboratories (BCL) at 334- 260-3400 to ask if other acceptable methods are available. . Nose and throat swabs can be removed from the transport medium after allowing some time for elution of virus (at least 1 hr). Nasal wash specimens can be centrifuged at 2500 x g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C and the pell et resuspended in 1 ml of tissue culture medium. If possible, the supernatant can be saved in a separate tube. The samples should be frozen and shipped at -70\u00b0 C (dry ice) if centrifugation is not available. Rubella Serology - See Measles Serology Mumps Collect oral or buccal swab - Collect samples as soon as mumps disease is suspected. Samples collected when the patient first presents with sy mptoms have the best chance of having a positive result by RT-PCR. The buccal or oral swab specimens are obtained by massaging the parotid gland area for 30 seconds prior to swabbing the area around Stensen's duct. A commercial product designed for the collection of throat specim ens or a flocked polyester fiber swab can be used. Synthetic swabs are preferred over cotton swabs, which may contain substances that are inhibitory to enzymes used in RT-PCR. Flocked s ynthetic swabs appear to be more absorbent and elute samples more efficiently. Processing the swabs within 24 hours of collection will enhance the sensitivity of both the RT-PCR and virus isol ation techniques. Swabs should be placed in 2 ml of standard viral transport me dium (VTM)[1]. Allow the swab to remain in VTM for at least 1 hour (4\u00b0C). Ream the swab around the rim of the t ube to retain cells and fluid in the tube. The swab can be broken off and left in the tube or discarded. Storage and shipment: Following collection, samples should be maintained at 4\u00b0C and shipped on cold pack s (4\u00b0C) within 24 hours. IMM VPD Surveillance Protocols, 5/3/16 6 If there is a delay in shipment, the sa mple is best preser ved by freezing at 70\u00b0C. Frozen samples should be shipped on dry ice. Diphtheria Culture Swabs - Take a specimen swab from the nose, throat or wounds. Use polyester, rayon or nylon swabs (Copan flocked is what we have. Do not use cotton tipped applicators for this specimen.) The swabs should be placed in transpor t media such as Amies or Stuart and shipped overnight with ice packs. Dry swabs submitted in silica gel sachets are also acceptable. You can use the Reagan Lowe media for cultures to se nd to our state lab. Pieces of pseudo-membrane may also be submitted for culture (physicians onl y can collect this). Pseudo-membrane should be placed in sterile saline (not formalin) and shipped overnight with ice packs. PCR Swabs - CDC does not perform PCR to rule out diphtheria unless diphtheria anti-toxin (DAT) has been requested to treat the patient. Swabs taken from the nose, throat or wounds can be tested by PCR for the presence of the A and B subunits of the diphtheria toxin gene ( tox). The presence of tox does not necessarily indicate that toxin is being produced, and this PCR assay does not distinguish between C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans . Swabs for PCR can be shipped in the same manner as swabs for culture, or they may be placed in a sterile t ube or silica gel sachet. Swabs for PCR should be shipped overnight with ice packs. Pieces of pseudo-membrane may also be submitted for PCR testing. Pseudo-membra ne should be placed in sterile saline (not formalin) and shipped over night with ice packs. IMM VPD Surveillance Protocols, 5/3/16 7 Pertussis IMM VPD Surveillance Protocols, 5/3/16 8 Varicella PCR Swab - Polyester Swab Method is be st suited to sampling vesicular lesions 1. A sterile needle should be used to unroof the top of the vesicle. 2. A sterile swab is then used to vigorously swab the base of the lesion\u2014 applying enough pressure to collect epithelial cells without cau sing bleeding\u2014and collect vesicular fluid. It is important to collect infected epithelial ce lls from the base of the lesion because they usually contain a significant amount of virus. We recommend swabs made from synthetic fi bers, such as polyester, because it is difficult to elute virus from cotton swabs, and wooden swab supports usually absorb extraction buffer and inhibit PCR. 3. Swabs must be placed individually into sepa rate, empty tubes to avoid contamination. Place swabs directly into tubes. Do not place transport medium into the tube; the specimen MUST be kept dry. Tubes must be individually labeled and must be resistant to breakage. IMM VPD Surveillance Protocols, 5/3/16 9 Collecting Crusts (Scabs) 1. Crusts are also excellent samples for PCR det ection of VZV DNA. Crusts can be lifted off the skin (a glass slide is also useful for this purpose) and transferred directly into break- resistant, snap-cap or screw-top tubes. See Handling and Shipping PCR Specimens for shipping instructions. Handling and Shipping PCR Specimens 1. Dried specimens for PCR can be stored at ambient temperature indefinitely, although we prefer to receive specimens as soon after collection as possible. 2. Do not refrigerate or freeze dry specimens in tended for testing by PCR. Specimens can be mailed by regular post unless a result is urge ntly required. Do not suspend specimens in transport medium: they should be shipped dry. 3. In rare cases involving severe complications or death, other types of specimens (e.g., biopsied tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, peri pheral blood, etc.) may be sent to the National VZV Laboratory for PCR testing. When possible, liquid specimens should be shipped frozen. http://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/lab-te sting/collecting-specimens.html Haemophilus influenza, Pneumococcal, and Meningococcal disease CSF Collection - The collection of CSF is an invasive pr ocedure and should only be performed by experienced personnel under aseptic conditions. Th is specimen collection will only be performed by physicians in hospital or emergency based se ttings. NOTE: Information on CSF collection procedures is included in this document for informational purposes only . Physicians should follow their training and hospital procedures for collecting CSF specimens. . If bacterial meningitis is suspected, CSF is the best clinical specimen to use for isolation, identification, and characterization of the etiological agents. A. CSF Collection Kit should contain: 1. Skin disinfectant: 70% alc ohol swab and povidone-iodine 2. Sterile gloves (Be sure to check the expiration date) 3. Sterile gauze 4. Surgical mask 5. Adhesive bandage 6. Lumbar puncture needle (22 gauge/89 mm for adults and 23 gauge/64 mm for children) 7. Sterile screw-cap tubes 8. Syringe and needle 9. Transport container 10. T-I medium (if CSF cannot be analyzed in a microbiological la boratory immediately) (should be refrigerated at 4 C and added to the kit immediately before use in the field.) 11. Venting needle (only if T-I is being used) IMM VPD Surveillance Protocols, 5/3/16 10 12. Instructions for lumbar punc ture and use of T-I medium B. Lumbar Puncture Procedure 1. Gather all materials from the CSF collection kit. 2. Label collection tubes. 3. Ensure patient is kept motionless during the lumbar puncture procedure 4. Disinfect the skin between the two posterior superior iliac crests with 70% alcohol or povidone-iodine to clean the surface from debr is and oils. Allow to dry completely. 5. Position the spinal needle between the 2 vertebral spines at the L4-L5 level and introduce into the skin with the bevel of the needle facing up. 6. Remove CSF (1 ml minimum, 3-4 ml if po ssible) and collect in to sterile screw-cap tubes. If 3-4 ml CSF is available, sue 3 separate tubes and place approximately 1ml into each tube. 7. Withdraw the needle and cover the insertion site with an adhesive bandage. Discard the needle in a puncture resistant, autoclavable discard container. C. Shipping - Transport the CSF to a microbiol ogy laboratory within 1 hour for culture and analysis. If a delay of several hours in pro cessing or getting specimen to the lab inoculate CSF into T-I medium or incubate CSF at 35-37 C with approximately 5% CO and store in an approved location if the laboratory is closed, and warm to room temperature (25C) before use. Specimens for culture should not be refrigerated or exposed to extreme cold, excessive heat, or sunlight. Transport specimens at temperatures between 20 C and 35 C. Collecting Blood Specimens - Blood should be collected when a spinal tap is contraindicated, cannot be performed for technical reasons , or when bacteremia is suspected. A. Venipuncture - 1-3 ml of blood should be collec ted from a child and 5-10 ml of blood should be collected from an adult. Collected blood s hould be diluted in blood culture broth in order to obtain blood cultures. Blood cannot be tran sported before being in a blood culture bottle IMM VPD Surveillance Protocols, 5/3/16 11 because the syringes do not contain any anticoag ulant and the blood will coagulate within a few minutes. When using an alternative blood collection method, immediately inoculate specimens into the blood-culture bottle using a needle and syringe after disinfec ting the top of the bottle with 70% alcohol. Handling and Shipping Blood Specimens - Inoculated blood culture bot tles should be transported to a microbiology laboratory immediat ely for overnight incubation at 35-37 C with ~5% CO 2 (or in a candle-jar) and subsequent culture onto a BA P and CAP. All inoculated blood culture media should be protected from temperat ure extremes (not less than 18 C or more than 37 C) with a transport carrier and thermal insulator (such as extruded polystyrene foam). http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/la b-manual/chpt06-culture-id.html Acute Flaccid Myelitis (see table below) The CDC would like to receive CSF specimen, Uppe r respiratory tract specimen, serum samples, and two stool specimens CSF - See Haemophilus influenza, Pneumococcal , and Meningococcal disease CSF collection.
