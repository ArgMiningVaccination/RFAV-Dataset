As you probably know, our healthcare system is faltering. The United States is typically ranked between 35-40th in overall health among developed nations. Our infant mortality rate is often ranked worse than Cuba. We are sicker, more medicated and operated on more frequently than ever before. America has the best medical schools, the best doctors, the best hospitals, the best research facilities, the most money spent on developing new systems, etc. Despite all of this, we are not #1 in health. Why is this? It's because the idea of what constitutes healthy is faulty. In the U.S. if you are not sick, you are healthy. What is the definition of \"insanity\"? Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, right? Our medical system continues to do the same thing over and over again and we continue to become fatter, slower, more medicated and at higher risk of lifestyle related disease than ever before. Alternative medicine, while great for some types of damage control and more acute care of problems that pop up, is primarily concerned with finding the cause not the cure. Preventing the need for a cure in the first place is a much healthier, happier and educated approach to managing your health. Alternative medicine is abundant in Portland, Maine.
