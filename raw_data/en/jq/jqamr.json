The move will delay export of Covaxin to Brazil, which has placed an order of 20 million doses. A GMP certification from Anvisa is a must for companies wanting to sell drugs or vaccines in Brazil. As per a translated version of the decision on Anvisa's website, the regulator said its inspectors found 12 major and 14 minor non-conformities that indicate a significant risk to vaccine's manufacturing and product quality assurance, implying a health risk for users. Bharat Biotech said: \"The requirements pointed out during inspection will be fulfilled, the timelines for fulfilment is under discussion with the Brazil NRA (national regulatory agency) and will be resolved soon.\" The company also said that the 20 million dose order from the Brazilian government is still active and that the agreement with Precisa Medicamentos will continue. Key areas of concern highlighted by Anvisa inspectors, who inspected the facility at Genome Valley, between March 1 and 5, were [vaccine potency](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/vaccine-potency) , viral inactivation, sterilisation and purity. The regulator said Bharat Biotech has not validated the method of analysis that proves that the virus was completely inactivated during manufacture, due to which live viruses may be present in the vaccine and may cause contamination of patients. It raised concerns over lack of usage of a specific control method to quantify antigen content and potency, which could result in variations in antigen content, compromising effectiveness. Anvisa also said the firm does not take all precautions to guarantee sterility of product, which being an injectable could cause bacterial infection. It added that in the action plan, deadlines proposed for completion of necessary studies and modifications, to guarantee industrial process will not have an impact on efficacy and safety, would end in July 2021. However, lots manufactured prior to this would not have guarantee of reproducibility with clinical lots and of safety of the product. "}
