Science is far more than the dispassionate search for truth about the natural world. We all know it isthe best method ever invented for sifting the real from the unreal, the likely true from the probably not true, and superstition from reality. But it is also a powerful engine for social and technological change, and it impacts human culture and society massively along virtually every dimen- sion. Most scientists appreciate that science is not just for the inhabitants of ivory tow- ers\u2014if such even exist anymore\u2014but an instrument for the improvement of human welfare. At least that's the goal, and certainly it is the reason for most public support of science. But the changes science and technology bring to the world are vast, and they can be uncomfortable, unsettling, and sometimes even unwelcome. Often the changes come before we are ready for them\u2014before our caveman-era brains, smartand adaptable as we may be, can adjust. So it is inevitable that in all the places that science and society interact, we en- counter controversy and conflict. Sometimes vested interests and parts of the media revel in this and set off conflagrations of controversy and misunderstandings fortheir own ends and for the short-time amusement and superficial diversion of themasses. Other times\u2014perhaps too few\u2014high-minded, good-hearted, well-in- formed people can actually have serious and civilized and meaningful conversations and discussions about the substantive issues. This is an essential part of the demo- cratic process, and it's one we've seen a little too little of in recent years. CSICOP , our Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and the S kePTICAl InquIrer have always experienced plenty of controversy. Given our mission (most simply, to \"promote scientific inquiry, critical investigation, and the use of reason in ex- amining controversial and extraordinary claims\"), how could that not be so? For better or worse, we usually end up reporting that there is little or no scientific evidence for various cherished beliefs that anywhere from 30 to 90 percent of the people (not necessarily our readers) hold quite dearly! We don't shy from the inevitable controversy. We always seek to be responsible and reasonable. We always try to focus on the evidence and issues, not personalities. We try to understand others' points of view. We repeatedly emphasize that scientific findings are open to revision with any good, new reliable evidence that passes scientific muster. This is one of the great, salientfeatures of science! uncertainties abound in all active research. Scientists are trainedto deal with uncertainties, and that too is one of the crucial aspects of the scientific process. We appreciate this rather charming tentativeness of all new scientific re- search, but we also recognize that scientific uncertainty is sometimes over-empha-sized, exaggerated, or exploited by partisans outside of science. We recognize all these things. But there are lines we won't cross. usually, the line is drawn where the best scientific evidence and understanding has become overwhelming\u2014the outcome of countless years, decades, or sometimes even cen- turies of scientific inquiry and investigation\u2014and where misrepresentations and distortions about the science are actively and purposely promoted. We must fight these kinds of intentional efforts to undermine our painstakingly obtained sci- entific understanding of the natural world and the creative scientific processes that led us to it. We've found ourselves caught up in many of these public policy controversies in recent years: evolution/creationism and climate change are two of the main ones.

He was one of the most influential figures in the humanist and skeptical move- ments from the late 1960s through thefirst decade of the twenty-first century.Among his magazine S kePTICAl In- quIrer , the secular humanist magazine Free Inquiry, and the independent pub- lisher Prometheus Books. Jonathan kurtz, Paul's son, told SI that his father had a \"'joyous' last day, joking, laughing, etc. He then died suddenly to-ward bedtime. There was no suffering.\" A joint CFI/CSI/CSH statement marked \"with great sadness\" the passing of theirfounder, offered condolences to the fam- ily, and called kurtz \"among the most sig- nificant and impactful figures in the hu- manist and skeptical movements .... We recommit ourselves to carrying on withdetermination the causes kurtz helped bring to global prominence.\" A Memorial Celebration of the life and Vision of Paul kurtz was scheduled for December1 at the university at Buffalo, jointly sponsored by the Philosophy Depart-ment and the Institute for Science and Human Values. Early Life Paul kurtz was born on December 21, 1925, to Martin and Sarah kurtz of newark, new Jersey. He enrolled briefly at Washington Square College of new York university before enlisting in theu.S. Army at the height of World War II. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge and served in a unit that liberated the Dachau concentration camp. He wasdemobilized eighteen months after the war's end and resumed his studies atnew York university (nYu).At nYu kurtz studied philosophy under Sidney Hook, who had himself been a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the pragmatist philoso- pher John Dewey. The philosophy of Dewey and Hook, arguably the greatestAmerican thinkers in the humanist tra-dition, would deeply in fluence kurtz's thought and activism. kurtz graduated from nYu in 1948 and earned his PhDin philosophy at Columbia university in 1952. Academic Career kurtz taught philosophy at Trinity Col- lege from 1952 to 1959. He joined the faculty at union College from 1961 to1965; during this period he was also avisiting lecturer at the new School for Social research. In 1965 he was re-cruited by the new State uni versity ofnew York at Buffalo. The former uni-versity of Buffalo had re cently been ab- sorbed into the state university system; under Governor nelson rockefeller, theinstitution launched an aggressive pro- gram to recruit top young academics toits faculty. kurtz became professor ofphilosophy at SunY Buffalo, a post he held until his retirement from teaching in 1991. At this stage of his career, kurtz focused principally on methods of objective inquiry and the history of American philosophy. He contributedthe significant entry \"American Phi -losophy\" to the influential first edition of the Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1967), edited by Paul edwards. He edited twolarge anthologies of Amer ican philoso- phy and published his best-knownscholarly work, Decision and the Condi- tion of Man (1968). The Humanist Movement It was in the late 1960s that kurtz em- barked on the pursuit whose promi- nence would exceed even that of his ca- reer as a philosopher, when he began hisinvolvement with the humanist move- ment. In 1967 he was named editor of The Humanist, published by the Amer-ican Humanist Association (AHA), then the nation's only significant hu-manist organization. He took the mag-azine in new directions, both by making its content more sharply critical of reli-gion and by using aggressive techniques to expand its circulation. Arguably, The Humanist never en joyed greater cultural prominence or higher circulation than during kurtz's editorship, but his force-ful style led to friction with others within AHA, including some members of its board of directors. kurtz gave up editorship of The Humanist and parted ways with AHA in 1978. Ironically, that was the very year in which, owing tokurtz's influence, AHA moved itsheadquarters from San Francisco to Amherst, new York, the location of SunY Buffalo's suburban campus. (AHA would remain headquartered offHarlem road in Amherst until it moved to Washington, DC, in 2000.) kurtz was for more than a quarter- century an influential figure in the In-[ PAUL KURTZ INMEMORIAM Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 5ternational Humanist and ethical union (IHeu), a worldwide network ofnational humanist organizations found -ed in Amsterdam in 1952. He joined IHeu's board of directors in 1969 andserved as the organization's cochairmanfrom 1986 to 1994. Dur ing this period,kurtz hosted IHeu's Tenth WorldCongress, held at SunY Buffalo duringthe summer of 1988. The Kurtz-Founded Organizations kurtz would be better known for his work through organizations he founded and shaped from their inception. In 1969, he founded Prometheus Books, a for-profit publishing companythat quickly emerged as the dominantimprint in skepticism, humanism, andatheism. It would become the most pro-lific publisher of atheist and humanist titles in history. Since its founding it haspublished more than 2,500 titles in what has become a broad range of genres. Sig- nificant milestones included the 1998 ac-quisition of most of the assets of the scholarly publisher Humanities Press In-ternational, giving rise to Prome theus'simprint Humanity Books, and the for- mation in 2005 of its Pyr division,which has emerged as a prestige imprintfor science fiction and fantasy fiction.now led by Paul kurtz's son Jonathan, the most impressive achievement of Prometheus Books may be that it has retained its independence during five decades in which an enormous number of independent publishers closed down or were absorbed. Paul kurtz was perhaps best known for the three mutually supportive non- profit organizations he founded in Buf-falo and later Amherst, new York, now known as the Committee for Skep tical Inquiry, the Council for Secular Hu- manism, and the Center for Inquiry.kurtz and others founded the world's first organization devoted solely to scientific criticism of paranormal claims at an April 1976 conference at SunY Buffalo whose participants in- cluded author Isaac Asimov, author-mathematician Martin Gardner, and magician James randi. The organiza- tion was originally known as the Com- mittee for the Scientific Investi gation of Claims of the Paranormal and became widely known by its acronym, CSICOP . Several months after its formation, CSICOP launched a journal, The Ze - tetic, which later achieved great promi- nence as the S kePTICAl InquIrer , which continues to be published bi- monthly. During its early years, CSI- COP encouraged the formation of localskeptics groups across the united States, and of independent national skeptics organizations across the world. These groups would form the kernel of today'sinternational skeptical movement. In 2006, the organization shortened its name to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, partly to show that its concernsnow extended beyond its original focus on paranormal claims to include the public understanding of science and is- sues in medicine and mental health. In 1980, two years after his departure from the American Humanist Associ- ation, kurtz launched a new, more ex-plicitly nonreligious humanist organiza- tion, the Council for Demo cratic and Secular Humanism (CODeSH). The word \"Democratic\" was to demon- strate totalitarianism, an important consid- eration since nontheism was then strongly associated with Communism in the public mind. The new organization's first act was to release A Secular Human- ist Declaration , a position document originally signed by fifty-seven distin- guished activists and academics. Its re-lease was covered in a front-page story in the New York Times. The Council si- multaneously launched a journal, Free Inquiry, with kurtz as its publisher andfounding editor. Free Inquiry quickly became the best-respected and highest-circulation humanist magazine in the 6Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirer Kurtz would be better known for his work through organizations he founded and shaped from their inception. Kurtz demonstrates to media how to fake a flying telephone \"poltergeist.\" This was in conjunction with the famous Columbus Poltergeist Case debunked in SI by James Randi (Spring 1985).Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 6u.S. It continues to be published bi- monthly. In 1996, in response to the collapse of european Communism, the organ- ization shortened its name to theCouncil for Secular Humanism. Itmaintains a network of independentlocal groups, operates north America'sonly free thought museum, and en- gages in a variety of educational andadvocacy activities. Since 2007, the Council has been lead plaintiff in alawsuit that challenges contracts be- tween the state of Florida and explic-itly religious social service providers. In 1991, kurtz's skeptical and secular humanist organizations relocated from Buffalo to Amherst, new Y ork. In thesame year kurtz founded a third major nonprofit organization, the Center forInquiry. Originally conceived as a plat- form for consolidating activities thatCSICOP and CODeSH conducted inparallel, from magazine production topayroll, the Center grew into an advo-cacy organization in its own right. Itsagenda encompassed both CSICOP'sskepticism and CODeSH's secular humanism, placing both in a broadercultural and intellectual context. In ad-dition to the Center for Inquiry head -quarters campus in Amherst, which kurtz expanded to some 35,000 squarefeet, there were at various times more than fifty branch Centers for Inquiryoperated in other American cities andacross the world, employing a variety of operating models. From its transna-tional headquarters at Amherst, theCenter conducts a wide range of edu-cational programs, including an online master's degree program in conjunction with the university at Buffalo. Its re- search libraries hold the world's largestcollections of humanist, skeptical, and related literature. Awards and Recognitions Paul kurtz received numerous awards and other encomia. In 1992, he was named a fellow of the American Asso - ciation for the Advancement of Sci- ence. In 1996, the main-belt asteroid kurtz 6629 was named in his honor. In2000, he received the Inter national ra- tionalist Award at the Second Interna-tional rationalist Con ference at Trivandrum, India. In 2001, he received the Charles P . norton Medal, the high- est award bestowed by the State uni-versity of new Y ork at Buffalo. In 2009, he received the eupraxsopher Award, a special lifetime achievement award,from the Center for Inquiry, as well asthe Philip J. klass Award from the na-tional Capi tal Area Skeptics. In 2010,he received a lifetime achievement award at The Amazing Meeting (TAM) sponsored by the James randieducational Foundation. Publications Paul kurtz wrote or edited more than fifty books for scholarly or general au- diences. Among the better-known are Exuberance: A Philosophy of Hap piness(1977), Forbidden Fruit: The Ethics of Humanism (1988), Euprax ophy: Living without Religion (1989), The Transcen- dental Tempta tion: A Critique of Reli- gion and the Paranormal (1991), The New Skep ticism: Inquiry and Reliable Knowl edge (1992), and What Is Secular Humanism? (2006). His works have been translated into multiple lan- guages. He composed a great number of essays, including editorials that ap- peared in every issue of Free Inquiry magazine from its founding in 1980until 2009. kurtz was also organized human- ism's most prolific composer of posi- tion documents. When he joined thehumanist movement, it was still strongly influenced by the Humanist Manifesto of 1933. Drafted and signed by unitarian ministers (with the con-spicuous exception of signer JohnDewey), the original Manifesto explic- itly envisioned humanism as a new re- ligion. On kurtz's view, a more secular formulation was needed. As editor of The Humanist he led a campaign for a new and more relevant Manifesto. Hu- manist Manifesto II was published in 1973, having been co-drafted by kurtz and fellow humanist leader edwin H. Wilson. Where its predecessor was re- Skeptical Inquirer | January/ February 2013 7[ PAUL KURTZ INMEMORIAM Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 78Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirerligious, Manifesto II explicitly abjured religiosity. In a passage reflecting kurtz's writing style, it \"Some human- ists believe we should reinterpret tradi- tional religions and reinvest them with meanings appropriate to the current sit- uation. Such redefinitions ... perpetuate old dependencies and escapisms; they easily become obscurantist, impedingthe free use of the intellect. We need, instead, radically new human purposes and goals.\" Manifesto II was signed by 114 ac- tivists and thought leaders at first pub- lication, and would eventually attract261 distinguished signers. Its releasegarnered worldwide media attention, including a front-page story in the New York Times. The previously mentioned A Secular Humanist Declaration (1980) was draft - ed solely by kurtz. It offered a secular humanist interpretation of many of theideas developed in Mani festo II but steeped in the recognition that an un-questionably nonreligious humanist in- stitution needed to be created, close tobut slightly outside of a larger humanistmovement that in cluded both religious and nonreligious humanists. In the late 1990s, kurtz began to compose a new successor document.Originally he planned to title it Human- ist Manifesto III , asserting the right to do so as the sole living coauthor of Manifesto II. After the Amer ican Humanist Asso- ciation asserted ownership of the Mani- festo title and threatened legal action, kurtz retitled his document Humanist Manifesto 2000 . Humanist Manifesto 2000: A Call fora New Planetary Humanism was issued in 1999 with about 200 signatures. It was book-length, far lengthier than the previous Manifestos , and represented the fullest statement of kurtz's vision for hu- manism as a planetary commitment tran- scending national and ethnic identities. Besides challenging religion and cham- pioning the scientific outlook and free- dom of thought, kurtz called for a popu-larly elected global parliament, a World Court, a global environmental monitor- ing institution, and a new international tax to aid the developing world. These in- ternationalist contentions engendered substantial controversy within the hu- manist movement. Principal Contentions kurtz consistently asserted that moral- ity should be rooted in human flourish- ing and happiness, not in supernatural revelation. He attached high priority to individual liberty in a robustly demo- cratic culture. His ethics were primarily utilitarian, but he tempered his utilitar- ianism with a strong commitment to basic liberties. As early as 1969 he had written that \"there are two basic andminimal principles which especially seem to characterize humanism. First, there is a rejection of any supernatural conception of the universe and a denial that man has any privileged place within nature. Second, there is an affirmationthat ethical values are human and have no meaning independent of human ex-perience.\" re peatedly he characterized secular humanism less as a set of moral or philosophical prescriptions than as a process, a template for the conduct of ethical inquiry. Two further contentions strongly in- fluenced kurtz's thought and writingbeginning in the mid-1980s. The first was his growing sense of humanism as necessarily planetary. He argued that since the principal problems con- fronting humankind were global in scope, they required transnational solu- tions. This view was accompanied by an assertive cosmopolitanism that viewedKurtz consistently asserted that morality should be rooted in human flourishing and happiness, not in supernatural revelation. In 1988, Paul Kurtz led CSICOP's first study visit to China.Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 8traditional religious, ethnic, and na- tional identities as archaisms to be jet-tisoned whenever possible. In addition, he sought an authorita- tive answer to the question \"If secularhumanism is not a religion, what is it?\"His solution was to coin a new word, eu- praxophy (in later years spelled eupraxso- phy). Formed from Greek roots meaning roughly \"good wisdom and practice inconduct,\" the word was meant to label a novel category of intellectual and moral systems that met some of the socialneeds served by religions without the su- pernaturalism or authoritarianism of tra-ditional faiths. kurtz made his most ex- tended argument for the coinage in his1989 book Eupraxophy: Living without Religion . A subsequent edition was titled Living without Religion: Eupraxsophy.The neologism's move from title to sub- title re the coinage's fate. kurtz'sarguments for eupraxsophy were re and some activists eagerlyrestyled themselves \"eupraxsophers.\" ul- timately, however, the term failed to maintain traction and it is in frequentlyused in the movement today. Later Life While kurtz's son Jonathan had suc- ceeded him as president of Prometheus Books, kurtz continued to exercise day-to-day control of the nonprofit organiza-tions he had founded well past his eight- ieth birthday. After 2005, there was heightened concern on the part of the organizations' directors to implement a specific succession process. In June 2008, attorney and philosopher ronald A. lind - say succeeded kurtz as president and CeO of the Center for Inquiry, the Council for Secular Hu man ism, and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. lind - say was kurtz's personal selection for theposition. kurtz continued to serve as board chair until June 2009, when Buffalo investment advisor richard Schroeder was elected Chair and kurtz assumed the new position of Chair emer itus. kurtz faced this process with increasing reluc- tance, and on May 18, 2010, he an- nounced his resignation from all of hisremaining positions at the three non- profit organizations. His office continuedto be reserved for his use whenever theCenter for Inquiry-Transnational inAmherst was open. late in 2010, kurtz announced the founding of a new organization, the In- stitute for Science and Human Values.It released a manifesto-style document titled Neo-Humanist State ment of Secular Principles and V alues with more than 150 signers and an nounced a new quarterlyjournal, The Human Prospect. Conclusion ultimately, Paul kurtz did much to shape the American and world hu man - ist movements during the final third of the twentieth century. He was a prodi- gious organizer, responsible for much of the social landscape through which non religious Americans moved before the emergence of the so-called new Atheist movement in the middle 2000s. At the same time, a vibrant and varied skeptics' community now served by dozens of local and national organiza- tions might not exist at all\u2014and surely would not have its current form\u2014if notfor kurtz's founding of the first modernskeptical organization, CSICOP . His most enduring legacy may be the Center for Inquiry, which continues to stand asthe larger movement's largest, most active, and highest-budgeted organization. n \u2014Tom Flynn is the editor of FreeInquIrY magazine and the executive director of the Council for Secular Humanism.

There would be no network of local, regional, and national skeptics groups. like all of us here, I have enormous admiration, respect, and affection forPaul. It has been my privilege to haveworked closely with you, Paul, for nearly a third of a century. He is, truly, one of the world's extraordinary persons. (If hereally is a single person. For all he does and all he has accomplished, many of us have long suspected he must be at least three different people all wrapped up into one human body. Maybe we at the S kePTICAl InquIrer should look into this phenomenon more carefully.) A professor of philosophy, a scholar, and an intellectual yet very pragmatic philosopher, who writes about not ar- cane academic disputes but how life should best be lived, taught thirty years at SunY Buffalo, and retired to emeritus status with great distinction. Author or editor of well over thirty books, with more under way. To men- tion just a few I have on my own shelves: The Transcendental Tempta - tion,The New Skepticism ,Skeptical Odysseys, Embracing the Power of Hu- manism ,The Courage to Become: The Virtues of Humanism, Forbidden Fruit: The Ethics of Humanism , and my fa- vorite title of all: Exuberance: A Philos- ophy of Happiness. An entrepreneur who creates and runs organizations, international or gan iza - tions, movements, really. non profit organizations, many of them (includingthose I've mentioned), and a noted book publishing company (Pro me theus Books). A philosopher/entrepreneur!Who would have imagined! An international diplomat. That's an- other way I think of him. With his in- ternationalist perspective and his driveto bring diverse people from all over the world together to work toward common causes. An inspiring leader who has extraor- dinary vision\u2014always focused on biggoals, big tasks, big ideas. The father and great philosopher of the modern secular humanism movement, and certainly a father of the modern movement for open-minded, affirma-tive scientific skepticism. See his Hu- manist Manifestos, and his Affirma- tions of Humanism and his Affirma- tions of the new Skepticism. One small sentence from the latter: \"We ask for facts, not suppositions; experimental evidence, not anecdotal hearsay or con-jecture; logical inference and deduction, not faith or intuition.\" Of all his many qualities, I want to emphasize two. They are related. Courage and an extraordinarily posi- tive outlook. When others think small, he thinks big. When others dither, he says do. When others would retract, he would expand. Where others see prob- lems, he sees opportunity. He stresses not negativism but the affirming values of humanism and of skepticism. He believes strongly in (to borrow his own words from his latest essay in Free Inquiry ), \"a set of common moral virtues that cut across cultures\u2014such as being truthful, honest, kind, keeping promises, being dependable and re sponsible, avoid- ing cruelty, etc.\" He has lived life to its fullest, with exuberance and extraordi-nary service to others. By elucidating, liv- ing, and advancing strong missions, eth- ical credos, and causes greater than ourselves, he inspires us all to try some- how to do the same. Some years back Paul coined a new term, eupraxophy, from the Greek roots for good/well, conduct/practice, and sci- entific and philosophic wisdom. He de- fines eupraxophy as \"a set of convictions and practices offering a cosmic outlook and an ethical guide to life.\" And, not surprisingly, he wrote a book by the same title. For his extraordinary leadership to the causes of humanism and scientific skepticism, his lifetime of accomplish- ment, and his moral and ethical guid- ance, I am pleased and honored to pres- ent to Paul this very special award, The Eupraxopher Award .

In 1973, soon after both he and I had encountered uri Geller, James randimet with me in Portland, Ore gon, tosuggest we create a skeptical organiza-tion to counter the fraudulent claimsand the exploitation of scientists by al-leged psychics such as Geller. He sug- gested we use the acronym SIr (Sanityin research) for the name of our organ- ization. The letters SIr were an anagramof SrI (Stanford research Institute),where Geller had been investigated. We also included Martin Gardner in our group. Although Gard ner, randi, and I spent a day formulating the plans and objectives for our group, none of us had organizational or administrative experi- ence. So when Marcello Truzzi asked to join our group with an offer to help with organizational and administrative mat- ters, we readily agreed. Soon afterwards, Truzzi encountered Paul kurtz at a con- ference. At this time, kurtz, as editor of the Humanist magazine, had been wag- ing a campaign against fraudulent para-normal claims. kurtz and Truzzi decided that Paul and his colleagues should join SIr to form a national skeptical organi-zation. Al though Truzzi did not consult Gard ner, randi, or me in making thisdecision, we agreed to the partnership. In 1976, randi, Gardner, and I joined Marcello and Paul kurtz\u2014alongwith a few others such as Phil klass, JimAlcock\u2014to create CSI (originallyknown as CSICOP). At first, Paul kurtz and Marcello Truzzi served as co- chairs. However, before our first meet- ing after the organizational one, a seri-ous division of opinion on the function and goals of CSICOP became evident. Truzzi wanted our journal, then called The Zetetic , to be a scholarly publication aimed at academics. Paul and the otherexecutive Council members wanted the journal also to serve the general public.An even more contentious issue wasTruzzi's insistence that skeptical andpro-paranormal proponents be givenequal space in our journal. Paul and the other executive Council members re-jected this proposal. We argued that theparanormalists already had several pub-lications and media outlets. At the time of CSICOP's initiation, there were nooutlets for the skeptical viewpoint. As aresult of these disagreements, Truzzi re-signed from CSICOP to pursue his own vision for a \"skeptical\" journal. under the leadership of Paul kurtz, CSICOP grew and inspired new skep-tical groups, both on the local and the international scenes. Paul was the rightperson at the right time. I believe thatwithout Paul, we would not have had a successful skeptical movement. Al - though he was an academic and a philosopher, he defied the stereotypes for these occupations and was an ex- traordinary organizer, leader, and entre-preneur. rarely, if ever, does one en- counter the collection of abilities in oneperson that Paul kurtz possessed. Paul was a scholar, philosopher, prolific au- thor, editor, successful publisher, organ- izer, leader, and tireless advocate for the truth. He was truly unique. \u2014Ray Hyman is professor emeritus of psychology, university of Oregon, and a founding member of the Committee for Skep-tical Inquiry's Executive Council. 12Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerThe Modern Skeptical Movement Would Not Exist without Him RAYHYMAN In Memory of a Most Remarkable Man JAMESALCOCK I first met Paul in 1976 at the meeting at the university of Buffalo that launch - ed CSICOP , and from the get-go I was amazed by his energy, his enthusiasm, and his determination to do something to stem the rising tide of pseudoscience.A few years later, as a member of the executive Council, I had the privileged opportunity to observe his dynamism at close range. One thing that stands large in my memory is how he never seemed to slow down.

He was a man with a purpose, deter- mined to stand up for reason, to fightpseudoscience, and to challenge religiousdogma. He dedicated himself to that goal,and through his many books, articles, and public lectures, he urged all who would lis- ten to find strength and purpose in our humanness rather than seeking succor through supernatural supplication. He was a builder. He gathered people around him who were experts in all man-ner of things, but it was his rare ability toorganize, harness, and disseminate such expertise that created the skeptical move- ment that we have today. He dreamed large, and he worked tirelessly to makethose dreams come true. I recall a meetingof the CSICOP executive Council many years ago when Paul announced that CSI- COP needed its own building. He had asite in mind: a small parcel of land border-ing on the university of Buffalo. Yes,wouldn't that be nice, we thought, but dream on, shall we? And in technicolor, for CSICOP was all but penniless. Thatdid not deter Paul; it still astonishes me that he was able to raise the necessary funds, supervise the purchase of the prop- erty, and oversee the design and construc- tion of the building, until voila! \u2014CSI- COP was headquartered in a modern and permanent home. And that was just the beginning. Through his determination and stewardship, the skeptical movement took shape around the world. On a personal level, I shall miss Paul for his friendship and inspiration. A man of high ideals, boundless energy, kindness, dignity, and grace, Paul has left the world a better place than he found it, and for that, all who value reason need be grateful. \u2014James Alcock is professor of psychology, Glendon College, York university, Toronto, and a long- time member of the Committee for Skeptical In-quiry Executive Council.Paul kurtz was such a good friend for so many years .... When ray Hyman, Martin Gardner, and I got concerned about rising uncritical acceptance of paranormal nonsense in the 1970s, we had no experience in creating a useful group to counter that stuff. Then Paul kurtz came along, with similar con- cerns and his own plans to create justsuch an organization, and we andmany others quickly joined together in that collaborative cause, forming CSICOP in 1976. Paul came with the credentials, the zeal, and the work ethic that served us all so well for thirty-plus years. Along with my colleagues in the community of skeptics and rationalists, I will deeply miss Paul and our fre-quent exchanges over those decades.When our small group first met in the 1970s to start the organized skepticsmovement, little could we have pre- dicted its worldwide growth under hisguidance.

We are thoughtful, inquiring, and reflective, and in a way we are the watchmen who guard against badideas, consumer advocates for goodthinking who, through the guidelines of science, establish a mark at which to aim. Paul kurtz was one of the founders of themodern skeptical movement, and he em- bodied the principle of skepticism as thoughtful inquiry. He truly was a watch-man who provided a mark at which weskeptics may all aim.

He was one of the founders of the modern skeptical move-ment\u2014someone who was there at thebeginning. kurtz had something that the others did not\u2014the ability to organize a movement. Other giants, like Jamesrandi, ray Hyman, and Martin Gardner, got together and knew that the world needed a dose of reason. kurtz had theskills to make that happen. He founded two \"sister\" organizations, the Council for Secular Human ism andthe Committee for the Scien tific Inves-tigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP , now CSI\u2014the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry). re garding secularhumanism, he took the existing humanist philosophy and essentially purged it of supernatural fluff to craft it into secularhuman ism. This he presented as a philo-sophical alternative to supernatural-based religions. He made a powerful philosoph- ical argument that one could lead a moral life without any appeal to a supernatural belief system.Meanwhile, CSI focused on promot- ing science and reason, mainly through confronting popular pseudoscience.When I joined the skeptical movement in 1996 CSI was pretty much the only game in town. Michael Shermer was just getting started with the SkepticsSociety, but that was never a member- ship organization and was largely WestCoast based. The James randi educa- tional Foundation had not yet been founded. So as the organizer of a local group, CSI was the only national organ-ization to reach out to, and they were definitely helpful in getting us off theground. kurtz also founded Prometheus Books and the S kePTICAl InquIrer (the official pub lication of CSI). I remember meeting Paul kurtz for the first time. He was very interested in who I was and what I was doing in mylocal group. He had a clear passion for promoting rationalism. I was also struck, however, by how closely tied sec- ular humanism and skepticism were in his approach. This would ultimately cause some tension between CSI and the local groups, a tension that exists tothis day within the skeptical movement. In his later years kurtz would also have to deal with another internal tension\u2014 that between the aggressive \"new athe- ists\" and the softer approach that kurtz advocated. Despite these internal conflicts, kurtz remained active until the very end. I saw him for the last time at last year's Amazing Meeting. He was stillengaged and very interested in the fu-ture of the movement he helped to cre- ate. As late as 2010 he was still trying to put his stamp on humanist thinking. He published his Neo-Humanist Statement of Secular Values and Principles, in which he lays out what he thinks is the path forward for secular humanism. no matter where you stand with re- spect to the philosophical debates re- garding the nature of humanism and skepticism, kurtz was a powerful and thoughtful voice who always pushed the discussion forward. \u2014Steven Novella is president of the New Eng- land Skeptical Society, professor of neurology at Yale university School of Medicine, and a member of the CSI Executive Council. Skeptics Society and Skeptic magazine, and as such I have come to respect more than ever before what Paul kurtz did for our movement. In terms of the day- to-day grind of keeping a movement afloat through the constant battering and assaults that come from variegated sources, there are few that can be com- pared with Paul kurtz. So I close this brief remembrance with my favorite passage from what I consider to be kurtz's finest work, The Transcendental Temp ta tion , which should be mandatoryreading for all skeptics and humanists: The skeptic is not passionately in tent on converting mankind to his or her point of view and surely is not inter- ested in imposing it on others, though he may be deeply concerned with raising the level of education and critical inquiry in society. Still, if there are any lessons to be learned from history, it is that we should be skeptical of all points of view, in - cluding those of the skeptics. no oneis infallible, and no one can claim a monopoly on truth or virtue. It would be contradictory for skepticism toseek to translate itself into a new faith. One must view with caution the promises of any new secular priest who might emerge promising a brave new world\u2014if only his path to clarity and truth is followed. Perhaps the best we can hope for is to temper the intemperate and to tame the perverse temptation that lurks within. r.I.P . Paul kurtz.

He graciouslywelcomed us\u2014and many others\u2014tothe project, and was a tireless organizer and expediter of all sorts of activities. He saw, before many others, that thesewere issues worth devoting your life to,and that is what he did. We owe a great debt of gratitude to his vision and en- ergy. \u2014Daniel Dennett is professor of philosophy and co-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts university.A Seamless Enterprise EDWARDTABASH We mourn the loss of our true founder, Paul kurtz. It's a daunting task to sin- gle out any of his myriad accomplish-ments for special attention. However, I would like to focus on his pioneering work in making challenges to the para-normal/supernatural a seamless enter- prise. The rules of empirical investiga- tion should be applied to any claim, be they the miraculous claims of religion or those of pseudoscience. Paul kurtz leaves behind his worldwide insight that no aspect of human experience should lie beyond criticism and doubt. It is now up to us to build on this legacy as we strive to free the world of superstition. \u2014Edward Tabash is chair of the board of di- rectors, Center for Inquiry, Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and Council for Secular Humanism. Paul kurtz was my dear friend and an inspiration to me. His humanity, his passion, his creativity, and his always- grand plans were the building blocks ofa number of international organiza- tions, and he worked tirelessly to grow the worldwide skeptics and humanist movements. In this respect, his impact remains unrivaled. But what was most meaningful to me about Paul was his truly contagious opti- mism. He had unshakable faith in human- ity\u2014in people\u2014and that we can work to- gether despite our differences and makethe world a better place without giving in to the transcendental temptation. I've never known anyone who loved life more. I can still hear him sermoniz-ing about the good life's \"tang\" and the \"zest of living.\" It fills my heart to re- member this now. He gave so much to so many people around the world through the organi- zations he founded, but also often be-hind the scenes, never looking forrecognition. They say no man is a hero to his valet, but the more I got to know Paul over the years, the more I came to love and respect him. He is deeply, deeply missed. \u2014D.J. Grothe worked with Paul Kurtz at CSI for many years and is now president of the James Randi Educational Foundation.The House That Kurtz Built DANIELLOXTON I am saddened, as a skeptic and a hu- manist, to hear of the passing of Paul kurtz. I didn't know him personally, yet kurtz had an immense and last- ing impact on my life, values, and ca-reer. As a defining leader in secular humanism and a founder of north America's first successful organiza- tion for scientific skepticism, his life'swork made my life's work possible.

Spreading Skepticism Worldwide AMArDeO SArMA The death of Paul kurtz is a blow for skeptics well beyond America. Manyskeptical groups around the worldwould not exist but for him. He was al-ways encouraging and strongly com- mitted to the international nature of skepticism. Without him there would be no GWuP in Germany nor many other organizations operating in eu- rope and elsewhere. He moved the ini- tiative in the 1980s to spread skepti- cism all over the world\u2014from China to europe, and from Africa to latin America. His example is a constant re- minder to maintain our commitment to the \"new skepticism\" as a strong tool of science for consumer protection anda rational world. \u2014Amardeo Sarma is chairman of GWuP (the German skeptics group) and a member of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry Ex-ecutive Council.

My own journey intoskepticism has a very definite beginning.up until reading James Alcock's bookParapsychology: Science or Magic? in 1981, I was no skeptic. All of the booksI had read until then on such topics aseSP and uFOs were very pro-paranor- mal, and there simply was not mucharound in the way of proper skepticalanalysis. Perhaps naively, I had simply accepted what I had read in such books.reading Alcock's book was a revelationto me. I realized that there was another way of thinking about the paranormal and related topics, one that I found fas- cinating and convincing\u2014one based upon reason and evidence. I also realized that there was skeptical literature out there. Alcock's book contained many references to a publication I'd never heard of before called the S kePTICAl InquIrer , as well as the work of people that, up until then, were unknown to me\u2014such as James randi, ray Hyman,and, of course, Paul kurtz. I immedi-ately subscribed to SI, as well as later subscribing to its British cousin, The Skeptic (a magazine that I would subse- quently edit for over a decade). I also devoured books by my new skeptical he- roes. I probably now have more books on my shelves published by Prometheus Books than by any other publisher. I fully appreciate just how much influence Paul kurtz's initiatives had on the course of my life\u2014and for that, I will al- ways be grateful. \u2014Chris French is professor of psychology and head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research unit, Goldsmiths, university of London.[ PAUL KURTZ INMEMORIAM Book of Seasons: An Elegy, for Paul Kurtz It's as though these yellowed trees are newly gilded by the sun, their fallen leaves oldhammeredgold.So you are gone with the season, before snow's white pages are scribbled again with passages you'd find decipherable, that would flow like a spring thaw.We'll see you often,wherever reason grows,flowers anew. \u2014Joe design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 1718Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerCalled \"the lourdes of America\" (after the famous French healing shrine), el Santuari\u00f2 de Chimay\u00f3 in new Mexico is a place of pilgrimages.Scores visit the little adobe church daily,while thousands walk miles to worship there on Good Friday. Some carry heavy crosses, while others approach on their knees. Many come seeking a cure fortheir afflictions, scooping from a smallpit in the church floor a reddish soil that they rub on afflicted areas of their bod- ies or even sprinkle on their food or brew in tea (eckholm 2008). (Figure 1.) The Legend The word Chimay\u00f3 derives from hot springs that were sacred to the Tewa In- dians (a linguistic group of Pueblos) who called Tsimajopokwi pokw\u00ec in Tewa means \"pool of the name was shortenedto Tsimayo (nealson 2001, 62). Accord- ing to a pious legend (of which there are many versions), brethren from the secret Penitente Brother hood were engaging in rites on a nearby hill on a dark Good Fri-day in 1810 when one saw a mysterious light coming from the valley. Investigat- ing and finding a half-buried crucifix, the men sent for a priest, the nearest church being ten miles away in Santa Cruz. The priest had the wooden crucifix carried in a procession to his church, but by the next morning it had disappeared\u2014hav- ing been miraculously re turned to its original site! This removal and return occurred two more times before people understood the message: the crucifix was to remain on the spot, which had reportedly been a sacred area for thePueblo Indians (eckholm 2008). This grafting of a roman Catholic el- ement onto a native one\u2014a process called syncretism \u2014was common. It was often similarly accomplished by theshrewd use of a \"miracle.\" (For example,a \"miraculous,\" actually tempera-painted, image of the Virgin of Guada lupe ap- peared in Mexico City in 1531 to prompt the building of a Catholic shrine\u2014on a hill where the conquered Aztecs had had a temple to their virgin goddess, To- nantzin [nickell 1988; 2004].) One of Bernardo Abeyta, built a small hermita (shelter) onto his house to enshrine the miracle crucifix. The hermita also al- legedly \"covered a hole from which came a blessed dirt that cured all ail- ments\" (kay 1987, 35). Abeyta himself was \"instantly healed\" of an undisclosed illness (kutz 1988, 46-47). Alternately, Indian stories from the twentieth cen- tury suggested that a Tewa pueblo hadonce stood on the spot next to a pool whose mud had healing properties (Harring ton 1916, 342). revealingly, the chapel's full de nuestro Se\u00f1or esqui - pulas) evokes a shrine in Guate mala that had long been venerated for its miraculous healing crucifix and sur- rounding earth with curative powers. As well, there are much-touted healing mud baths at Chilca, Peru (which I vis- ited with a guide in 2006). In any event, in 1816 a chapel was completed on the Chimay\u00f3 site by Father Fran cisco de Otocio, who was in charge of all newMexico missions (kay 1987, 29-37;eckholm 2008). The Nitty Gritty on the Dirt Today, pilgrims visiting el Santuari\u00f2 de Chimay\u00f3 stoop to enter a small, single- windowed room that is said to be Abeyta's original hermita . The central hole, El Posito (\"little well\"), measures some sixteen to eighteen inches wide and less than nine inches deep. Con - sider ing the great amount of earth that must have been scooped from it during its almost two centuries of history, how- ever, this is a small hole indeed! Hence, there grew a pious legend \"that the pit was refilled by divine intervention\" (eckholm 2008). (This was similar tothe claim that regardless of how many pieces were taken from the True Cross, the alleged holy relic of Jesus's Cruci- fixion, it never diminished in size [nickell 2007, 91-92].) But even though \"legend still main- tains the miraculously replen- ishes itself,\" in fact \"priests periodically refill the hole with dirt from outside the church\" (kay 1987, 77). Indeed, previ- ously tipped off to this fact by a televi- sion cameraman (Del Monte 2001), we searched for and found the storage area where five-gallon containers of the red- dish soil are stored (Figure 2). In recent years, priests at el Santuario de Chi- may\u00f3 have increasingly taken pains to point out the shed where the trucked- in soil is stored, with one complaining, \"I even have to buy clean dirt!\" (eck- holm 2008). In fact, the \"holy dirt\" is nothing very special.

I agree. I had collected my own sam- ples for testing on a visit to Chi may\u00f3 in2003 with investigator Vaughn rees. Inthe guise of a pilgrim needing healing(again see Figure 1), I obtained a smallplastic container from the gift shop,sold empty but labeled \"Blessed Dirt.\"My examination, in my little lab at CSIheadquarters, showed that the \"dirt\"contains no appreciable humus but islargely sand, consisting of tiny grains ofminerals and small bits of rock. (Appli - ca tion of hydrochloric acid yielded astrong pro- Prussian-blue reaction thatidentified a significant amount of iron,consistent with its color of red ocher, an earthy iron oxide. Stereomicroscopicexamination showed grains of suchcommon minerals as crystalline quartzand mica, as well as small lumps of sandstone and occasional bits of or-ganic material, including tiny frag-ments of bone and fine root stems. 1) Chimay\u00f3 priest Father Jim Suntum concedes that the dirt itself has nomiraculous power (Miracle Detectives2011). In fact, the local dirt has actually acted in a very anti-miraculous way: ithas posed a threat to the church's art-works. As conservators found in 2003-2004, they \"had to deal with the dirt.\"Indeed, \"It had drifted down from theceiling and walls in the almost 200 years the church had existed, covering thepaintings on the five altar screens, the crucifix and the carved bultos [sculptures] with a fine dust that needed cleaning. Dirt also had fallen behind the mainaltar screen to push it out of joint and threaten its very existence.\" Still, a writer would claim that the preservation process itself, at least, was \"almost a mir- acle\" (russell 2004, 36, 40). The Healing 'Miracles' nevertheless, while Father Suntum concedes it is not the holy dirt thatheals but rather one's \"relationship with God,\" quantify it. We can't document it. We do ask people to tell their story\" (Miracle Detectives 2011). In fact, \"offi- cially, the Church has never investi-gated any of the claims\" ( El Santuari ... 1994, 26). The complete lack of records re - garding alleged miraculous experiencesmeans that claims are entirely depend-ent on anecdotal evidence, such as the unverifiable stories told by an aging priest at the site. For example, in the mid-1950s, he recalled, a man carried his frail, ill mother into the church. \"A few minutes later,\" said the priest, \"he called me, something has happened. She was kneeling in front of the altar. Shewas talking and full of health\" (Hamm 2006, 42, 45). Yet we do not need to in-voke the miraculous to explain whatmay have been only a simple rejuvena- Figure 1.

Or consider the tale about a girl from Texas whose family \"was told she had lit- tle time to live\" and that even an opera-tion might not save her. Follow ing theirvisit to Chimay\u00f3 the child was well andno operation was necessary. \"Two dayslater,\" recalls the old priest, \"they cameback to thank God for the cure\" (qtd. inHamm 2006, 45). now, we cannot provethis story is untrue, but fortunately we donot have to. The tellers of such unverifi- able tales have the entire burden of proof. However, when such cases can be investigated, they are invariably illumi- nating. For instance, The Miracle Detec - tives examined the case of a Colo rado woman, Deseree \"Dese\" Mar tinez, who claims the dirt of Chimay\u00f3 helped hercancer go into remission. Diagnosed atthe age of fifteen with aggressive bonecancer at numerous sites in her body,she visited Chimay\u00f3 where she mixed the holy dirt with spit and applied it to a sore spot on her leg. The pain was gone by the next morning, and scans the following week showed the areahealed. Inexplicably, she did not then rub dirt on the other lesion spots, but they soon disappeared too. However, the woman's doctor, Brian Greffe, at The Children's Hospital in Denver, observed that with such non- Hodgkin's lymphoma in pediatric cases, the hospital's \"cure rates are quite high.\" He attributed Martinez's success to the chemo treatments, which had worked\"within days\" of their be ginning. Obvi- ously, there is no evidence that the in- terim application of holy dirt to a singlesite had any effect, although Greffe didsay Martinez's positive outlook and the support of her family were helpful ( Mir- acle Detectives 2011). As invariably shown by the evidence, so-called miraculous healings are neverscientifically verified. Such claims, likethose at lourdes, the most famous\"miracle\" shrine, are derived from casesthat are supposedly \"medically inexpli-cable\"; therefore, they are really exam-ples of a logical fallacy called \"arguing from ignorance\"\u2014that is, drawing a conclusion from a lack of knowledge.Besides, some illnesses are known toexhibit spontaneous remission, andother reputed cures may be attributableto a host of other factors: misdiagnosis, psychosomatic conditions, the body'sown healing mechanisms, and the like, including\u2014as in the case of Mar-tinez\u2014prior medical treatment (nick- ell 2008). While the church displays crutches and canes\u2014ostensibly cast off after previous cures\u2014they may well have been discarded prematurely. Persons may feel better temporarily after expe-riencing the hope and excitement of a pilgrimage. Writer Anatole France, on visiting lourdes and seeing the aban- doned canes and crutches there, sagelyremarked, \"What, what, no wooden legs???\" (qtd. in Hines 1988, 250).Conclusions As the evidence shows, therefore, claims made for holy dirt at Chimay\u00f3 are unwarranted. Despite borrowed andcontrived legends that the site is mirac-ulous, the soil is actually an ordinary va- riety trucked in from elsewhere and merely blessed. Priests admit that the \"something\" that happens at the site cannot be quantified or documented\u2014 and indeed a major healing claim fellapart on investigation. One suspects that the \"something\" is merely what is termed confirmationbias\u2014the willingness to credit any sup-posed benefits while ignoring countlessfailures. One writer offers the apolo-getic, \"It is a mystery why certain peo- ple and situations are granted a miracle and others are not\" (Hamm 2006). But it is only a \"mystery\" if one chooses to be blind to the evidence. n Note 1.

He then proceeded tofill the book with (unwittingly) philo-sophical arguments concerning cosmol-ogy and fundamental physics. even more egregiously, lawrence krauss blurted out something to the ef-fect that philosophy of science is a bigwaste of time during an interview inThe Atlantic. He was prompted to apol- ogize by philosopher Dan Dennett inthe pages of Scientific American, but he only managed to dig himself into a sig-nificantly larger hole. A hole that be -came a downright abyss in the courseof yet another public commentary by krauss on philosophy, this time duringan exchange with philosopher Julian Baggini in The Guardian. What is going on here? Hostility across what C.P . Snow famously labeled \"the two cultures\" is nothing new, going back at least to Plato's stated indiffer- ence toward natural science (countered, however, by his pupil Aristotle's proto- scientific investigations in biology and physics). Years ago, nobel winning physicist Steven Weinberg\u2014usually a very thoughtful author\u2014wrote a chap- ter of his Dreams of a Final Theory enti- tled \"Against Philosophy.\" On their part,some philosophers have been writing ei-ther unflattering or downright ill-in- formed things about science (there is, for example, an unintentionally hilariousessay on relativity by Bruno latour, notto mention Jerry Fodor's recent attack on evolutionary theory in What Darwin Got Wrong ). Then again, most philosophers of sci- ence are highly sympathetic and respect- ful of science, and some have ad vanced criticisms that have been taken in dueaccount by sensitive scientists (see, forinstance, elliot Sober's wonderful Evi- and within the academy, is\u2014ideally\u2014meant to beconstructive, and is sup posed to be part and parcel of the intellectual life, thoughit is understandably difficult to take when it comes from practitioners out-side one's own discipline. So why the un-usually strong rhetoric by krauss and Hawking in particular?Besides issues of ego and of wounded professional pride, I think there is a sys-tematic misunderstanding on the part of many (certainly not all) scientists about what philosophy is, how it works, andwhat it aims at. To begin with, the goalof philosophy\u2014and particularly of phi-losophy of science\u2014is not that of solv- ing scientific problems. We've got sci- ence for that, and it works very well on its own, thank you very much. rather, philosophers of science are interested in looking at science from the outside, ask-ing questions pertinent to the structure and logic of scientific theories, to theepistemic warrant of scientific method- ologies, and in some cases even to thesocietal impact of scientific discoveriesand concepts. This is the sort of stuff that practicing scientists can certainly safely ignore in their day-to-day opera-tions, but this doesn't justify declarations of the death of philosophy on grounds[THINKING ABOUT SCIENCE MASSIMO PIGLIUCCI Massimo Pigliucci is professor of philosophy at the City University of New York, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and author of Answers for Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead Us to A More Meaningful Life.

Physicists against Philosophers One reason why so many scientists misjudge philosophy is because they tend to use their own standards of progress to assess everyone else's usefulness.Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 2122Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirerof irrelevance to science. To insist on that line of argument is to commit what philosophers call a category mistake\u2014like asking about the smell of triangles. Another reason why so many scientists misjudge philosophy is because they tendto use their own standards of progress toassess everyone else's usefulness, thus en-gaging in yet another common fallacy,that of thinking of every problem as a nailjust because the only tool one has available is a hammer. There is no question that sci-ence does make progress, though certainlynot in a linear fashion, nor without the oc-casional blunder (think of eugenics, or thePilt down man). Indeed, it is philosophersof science like karl Popper, Thomas kuhn, and others who have spent quite a bit of time trying to articulate precisely how science makes progress and how wecan make sense of it. But there are nonscientific disciplines that also make progress without beingsciences. logic and mathematics imme-diately come to mind. These are not sci-ences, in the sense that their advance does not depend on empirically verifiablepropositions. Progress in logic and mathis often a result of deductive reasoning, not the inductive thinking that is more typical of science. The situation is analo-gous, albeit more messy, in philosophy.Philosophers make progress by exploring the logical space, so to speak, of possibil- ities relating to a particular problem thatinterests them. For instance, philosophers of science have been debating the difference be- tween realism (the proposition that scien- tific theories are\u2014at least ideally\u2014de- scriptions of the world as it actually is) and anti-realism (the idea that scientific the- ories are empirically adequate, but that we cannot actually tell whether they are true or not). The debate has unfolded over a number of decades (things typically movemore slowly in philosophy than in sci-ence), and it has seen sophisticated argu-ments and counter-arguments on both sides. But has there been progress?Y es! At least in two senses: first, no cur- rent defender of realism (or anti-realism) could possibly be such on the basis of theoriginal arguments, be cause those have been criticized and refined by a number of thinkers. So these days one has to es- pouse a significantly more sophisticated form of realism (or anti-realism) than was typical early on in the debate. Second, an intermediate position\u2014called structuralrealism (according to which scientific the- ories aim at describing the \"structure,\" not necessarily the substance, of reality)\u2014hasnot only emerged but attracted an increas- ing number of supporters, coming as closeto a consensus as one might reasonablyhope for in philosophy. Increasingly, new areas of logical space have been explored,and the debate has moved from naive to more sophisticated positions. That is what philosophical progress looks like, and if people such as Hawking and krauss don't get it, that is their (surprisingly, somewhat anti-intellectual) limitation, not philoso- phy's problem. n For details, visit www.gse.buffalo.edu/online/science Questions?

Hitler's South Pole Hideaway \"Searching for Hitler's DnA in Antarctica.\" This is the bizarre headline that made the news a few months ago, launched by russian news agency ria novosti and picked up by the world media after scientists were able to successfully drill into Antarctica'slake Vostok. The lake, a massive liquid reservoir cut off from daylight for four- teen million years and buried beneath two miles of ice, is the object of a years- long project to study its waters, which may house life-forms new to science. But what immediately caught the imag- ination was what seemed to be a re- vamping of the long-held myth thatAdolf Hitler did not commit suicide in his Berlin bunker in May 1945 but was able to escape via submarine to a secret base at the South Pole. Doubtful Death Such an idea started circulating imme- diately after the end of the war. In 1952, President Dwight D. eisenhower said: \"We have been unable to unearth one bit of tangible evidence of Hitler's death.Many people believe that Hitler escaped from Berlin.\" Stalin's top army officer, Marshall Gregory Zhukov, whose troopswere the first to enter Berlin, flatly stated after a long thorough investigation in 1945: \"We have found no corpse that could be Hitler's.\" The chief of the u.S.trial counsel at nuremberg, Thomas J. Dodd, said: \"no one can say he is dead.\" Former Secretary of State Jimmy Byrnes in his book Frankly Speaking stated that, after the war, at the Potsdam Conference of the Big Four, he met Stalin, who \"left his chair, came over, and clinked his liquor glass with mine in a very friendlymanner. I said to him: 'Marshal Stalin, what is your theory about the death of Hitler?' Stalin re plied: 'He is not dead. He escaped either to Spain or Ar- gentina.' \" Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 23If so many nazi officers and crimi- nals, like Adolf eichmann or Joseph Mengele, were able to escape undis-turbed from defeated Germany, who'sto say that a diabolical mind likeHitler's could not have set up a plan inorder to simulate his own death? Afterall, it was known that, like many dicta-tors, he used doubles in order to disori-ent his enemies. What if he had left thebody of one such double in Berlin while he was fleeing to the South Pole? It appears that in the early 1930s, the imaginations of nazi hierarchs andmaybe Hitler's as well was captured by theories that the earth was hollow in-side and inhabited by a superior race. Inparticular, Madame Blavatsky's esoteric theories had inspired the notorious Thule Society, the extremist right-wingGerman secret group that later reorgan- ized and became the nazi Party. Anx- ious to demonstrate the superiority of the Aryan race, theorists accepted leg-ends of advanced civilizations living in-side the earth: such a superior breed had to be the reich's progenitor. Nazis on Ice Proof is lacking, but some claim that Hitler had ordered an expedition aiming to find the entrance to the inside of theearth and that this had been located atthe South Pole. Admiral karl Doenitzreferred to this during the nurembergtrial when he stated: \"The German sub-marine fleet has even now established anearthly paradise, an impregnable for tress,for the Fuhrer, in whatever part of theworld.\" Although he did not specifywhere the exact location was, many be-lieved it was Antarctica. After the war, nazi sympathizer ernst Zundel claimed that Hitler and a trusted group of men had been able to escape aboard a ship in which theyentered the earth through a hole at theSouth Pole. Inside the earth, nazi sci-entists worked to build a new army with which to take over the world. An army that could count on revolutionary round, flying vehicles: uFOs. Daring fantasies that, only fifty-five years after the end of the conflict, were dissolved after documents from the russian secret service came out. The dictator had taken his life; eva Braun and trusted propagandist Joseph Goeb - bels had as well. Following Hitler's or- ders, the bodies had been burned. When the soviet army arrived they found the charred remains and could not recog- nize who they belonged to. Stolen by soldiers, the remains were subsequently examined with forensics, and their true identities were ascertained. The corpses were then buried and in 1970 Breznevordered them ex humed, incinerated, and dispersed in the waters of the ehle, in order to prevent fanatics' pilgrimages. Legends Never Die If all of this is clear, then why is it that the claim of a possible escape by Hitler can still make front-page news? Be cause urban legends never really die, and with the new findings at lake Vostok, some- one unearthed a forgotten story. Some claim that according to German marine records, months after the nazis surren- dered to the Allies in 1945, a u-530 submarine reached Antarctica from keil. There, the members of the crew did not build a fortress for the Fuhrer,but inside an ice cave they may have hidden some crates containing Third reich relics and, even, DnA samples of Hitler and eva Braun for cloning pur- poses. With their mission accomplished,the sailors reached Argentina and sur- rendered to Mar del Plata authorities. However, notwithstanding sensa- tional headlines in some newspapers, it appears highly unlikely that we willsoon read about the finding in lake Vostok of such a cave and its crates. And this silence, without a doubt, will represent further proof that the relics really exist, at least to those who love to see conspiracies everywhere. n 24Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerIn the early 1930s, the imaginations of Nazi hierarchs and maybe Hitler's as well was captured by theories that the earth was hollow inside and inhabited by a superior race.

Whew! And that doesn't even count the usual controversies, and complaintsfrom proponents, over our core mis- sion\u2014critical examinations of the latestclaims of paranormal happenings, psy- chic powers, quack medical remedies,uFOs, aliens, and monsters! In our July/August 2012 issue we published what I considered an en -lightening and provocative article by our colleague Chris Mooney, \"Why the GOP Distrusts Science.\" I thought it important for all open-minded skeptics to consider the evidence that one of our main political parties has apparentlyshifted so far in one ideological direction over the past several decades that it (or at least a significant component of it) has become essentially the anti-science party. Mooney provides lots of published data and explains why that might well be the case. If that's true (and Mooney gave a lot of evidence for it), then I think that is important for us all to know and face. SI and our Committee for Skeptical Inquiry are nonpartisan. SI is a magazine of science and reason. We don't deal with partisan political issues per se. We don't take political stands on issues unrelated to the advocacy and protection of good science. We welcome people of all polit- ical stripes. There is no political litmus test for skepticism. But we doadamantly de fend good science, critical thinking,and open-minded free inquiry. I expected that some readers might be a bit troubled by Mooney's article. I alsothought that perhaps even our conserva- tive and libertarian colleagues might have some of these same concerns themselves . But here's what I noticed. Many readers liked the article, but of those who wroteto complain, and there were many, al- most all objected in an almost personalway, with sarcasm or anger. Few men- tioned the actual published evidence Mooney cited, let alone engaged or re- butted it in any way, or discussed its im- plications for the nation, if true. Oneeven canceled his subscription. Another wrote his complaints on his copy of the SI article, tore out the pages, and mailed them back to us, as if to doubly empha- size his indignation. It was left for our own ron lindsay to do the first real critique in our pages of what Mooney had to say, and he did so in I think a very respectful and thoughtful and nuanced way, which isthe appropriate way, in a review in the following issue (September/October 2012). I appreciated his ultimate conclu- sion: the real concern is dogmatism, wherever it comes from along the polit- ical spectrum. In 2007, the same kind of thing hap- pened over what I considered our rela- tively innocent publication of news of the latest consensus scientific informationabout climate change. This is another scientific field, like evolution, where thereis a big gap between the science and pub- lic acceptance. That alone makes it an issue for us. Many readers were furious. They bombarded us with critical letters. More than half a dozen wrote to cancel their subscriptions. (One supporter and ex pert on the climate controversies, forwhom I am eternally grateful, immedi-ately counteracted those cancelations by sending us a contribution equaling the value of six subscriptions.) I am continually surprised at that kind of reaction from people who are for the most part fellow skeptics, but I am slowly learning not to be so sur- prised. We are all human. Psycho logical research shows that the thing we tend to do when we face an uncomfortable set of facts\u2014our very first im pulse in fact\u2014is to attack the author or publi- cation; dismiss, distort, or deny the ev- idence; and deflect the argument back on itself (and yes, I know liberals can be anti-science too; look at nuclear poweror genetically modified foods). nevertheless, despite all that, I still have a, perhaps naive, faith\u2014if I can use that word here\u2014in the common sense and collegiality and civility of most peo- ple, and certainly most of our readers. On scientific findings that raise trou- bling concerns, let us resolve always to employ the best available scientific facts and evidence . . . and then engage in free, open\u2014and civil\u2014discussion. \u2014k enDrICk FrAZIer Notes 1. For another thoughtful and illuminating new look at some of these same issues, I heartily recommend the chapter \"right, left, up, Down: On Politics\" in our colleague Massimo Pigliucci's just-published book Answers from Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead us to a More Meaningful Life (Basic Books 2012). As most of you know, Pigliucci is both a biologist and a philosopher, and in this particular chapter he pro- vides a nuanced look at recent scientific re searchinto how people think about politics. unlike Mooney's article, his examination is not directed at any one political party. It doesn't deal with po- litical attitudes toward science specifically, but it is nevertheless a valuable contribution. He starts with recent findings from biological and cogni- tive sciences, reports on a study showing that ourstereotypical views about party affiliations are flawed and simplistic (people's views are usually more complicated and nuanced than anyone can easily portray), discusses why despite that fact we've had increasing polarization, and ends sum- marizing a study that shows six different defense strategies we employ when faced with evidence that counters our beliefs. 2.

Ivisited it about two years ago and wasvery impressed by its powerful and rel-evant exhibits on the subjects of atomictesting and the Cold War. now that museum, an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution in Washing ton,DC, is getting heavily into claims about Area 51 and uFOs. It presently has aspecial exhibition on Area 51 that re -quires a separate admission ticket. Thisexhibit was not there when I visited. Ithought that the Area 51 exhibit re -stricted itself to aerospace-related mat- ters, but Post , \"Among the many items dis- played are materials presented as'Authentic Alien Artifact'\u2014samples ofsmall objects originating from an allegeduFO crash in russia\" (http://tinyurl.com/9qx6wtj), and he provides a photo of it. So if you want to see an \"Authentic Alien Artifact,\" the national Atomic Testing Museum claims to have one. not satisfied with that absurdity, the national Atomic Testing Museum isnow getting into full-fledged promo-tion of uFO claims. On September 22, 2012, they an \"Area 51 Spe- cial lecture\u2014Military uFOs: Secretsrevealed\" (http://tinyurl.com/9kgxfo5).There was nothing at all skeptical about this panel. One of the speakers was nick Pope, who for years has been warning about an \"alien invasion\" (http://tinyurl.com/ 9z8gcx6). Most recently, just before the london Olympics, Pope warned, \"The government must\u2014and has planned\u2014 for the worst-case scenario: alien attack and alien invasion. Space shuttles, lasers, and directed-energy weapons are all committed via the Alien Invasion War Plan to defence against any alien ships in orbit,\" he said, apparently un- aware that America's Space Shuttle or- biters have been dispersed to variousmuseums and the rest of the system scrapped. Pope didn't say anything more about alien invasions and didn't reveal any \"se-crets.\" Instead he told the audience the history of Britain's Ministry of Defence uFO investigations, which he workedon for three years almost twenty yearsago and has not stopped talking about since. His relatively low-key talk em-phasized the \"unexplained\" nature of many reported sightings. Another speaker was Col. Charles Halt (uSAF retired), who was the deputy base commander of the Bent - waters u.S. Air Force Base in eng land,and a major witness to the supposed rendlesham \"uFO landing\" in De cem -ber 1980. the British skep-tic Ian ridpath (http://tinyurl.com/c5 hqcch), the tale told by Col.

By 2010, his ac- count had expanded so that the objects zoomed up over his head and sentdown a laser-like beam at his feet. The audience at las Vegas heard the newand improved version of Col. Halt's tale, with no hint of any reasons to question it. As ridpath wrote in refer-ence to a posting by David Clarke: Halt's superior officer at the time of the events, Col Conrad, has been scathing of his claims, saying: \"He should be ashamed and embarrassed by his allegation that his country and england both conspired to deceive their citizens over this issue. He knows better.\" (http://tinyurl.com/3yr3et4) lee Speigel wrote in the Huffington Post, \"Former Air Force Col. Charles Halt accused the federal government of a uFO cover-up that involves a secretagency to deal with what might be ex-traterrestrial visitations.\" Halt said, \"I'mfirmly convinced there's an agency, andthere is an effort to suppress\"(http://tinyurl.com/csoavza). Former intelligence officer Col. John Alexander (u.S. Army retired) also spoke. He was part of the Pentagon's \"remote viewing\" project, and other far- out taxpayer-funded projects. Alexan- der is a bit unusual among uFO pro- ponents in that he absolutely does notbelieve that the u.S. Govern ment is covering up any \"uFO secrets\" or is en- gaged in any uFO conspiracy. So thatrules out belief in the roswell crash (which got him jeered while speaking at the MuFOn Symposium last year, see http://tinyurl.com/bp2lqsk). Yet Alexander is a strong proponent of Col. Halt and the other supposed witnesses at rendle sham. uFO skeptic James McGaha and I each told Alexander personally about Col. Halt's changing uFO claims and asked how he could continue to have confidence in Halt's story. But Alexander does not seem troubled by Halt's inconsistency or his claims of a big u.S. government cover-up that Alexander believes does notexist, or by the dressing-down of Col.Halt by his superior officer, Col. Con- rad. It's bizarre that Alexander, the guywho says there is no u.S. government uFO cover-up, is a big supporter ofHalt, the guy who says there is. Also speaking were retired Air Force Cols. William Coleman and robertFriend. Friend was the director of the Air Force's Project Blue Book. Coleman, an Air Force public information spokesman,was the producer of the former nBC- TV program Project uFO , which ran two seasons (1978 and 1979). The show wasso bad that, as I wrote in my \"Psychic Vibrations\" column (SI, Fall 1979):\"edward Winter, one of the stars of theseries, explained how the writers for Project uFO got their material: 'As I understand the story, the Air Force fi- nally got tired of looking at us, becausethey said, \"Anything your writers can dream up, we can find. ... There are over 12,000 cases in the Blue Book re- port.\" So instead of finding it first and then writing about it, they let the writ- ers write it and then they go find one like it!'\" Friend did not make any new uFO claims at the museum, but he empha-sized that \"uFO sightings are real\" and that those who report them should betaken seriously. However, when later asked by Speigel if he thought we werebeing visited by extraterrestrials, Friend replied, \"Do I believe that we have beenvisited? no, I don't believe that,\" and he went on to cite some of the well-knowndifficulties involved in attempting in- terstellar travel (http://tinyurl.com/d8 cchzl). If either of these gentlemen, Col. UFO skeptic James McGaha and I each told Alexander personally about Col. Halt's changing UFO claims and asked how he could continue to have confidence in Halt's story.Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 2728Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerFriend or Col. Cole man, ever had any actual \"uFO secrets,\" they should haveappeared in the Blue Book files. Or atleast in Project uFO. When interviewed before the panel by the pro-uFO journalist Billy Cox,Coleman told a tale of a close en -counter with a nuclear blast: The World War II veteran and 36 military colleagues have settled into 4.5-foot deep trenches bordering the shot tower, maybe 3,000 yards fromground zero, to watch the latest edi- tion of a 14-part nuclear bomb series called Operation Teapot. Actually,they're not watching it at all; their backs are facing the bomb. Coleman has his head swaddled in blankets. At t-minus 13 seconds on the count- down clock, the wind takes an abrupt shift and blows directly toward the trenches. But it's too late for ignition abort . . . he and his trenchmates see an anthropomorphic dummy fixed to a post behind them is ablaze. The needle on the scintillator is pegging into the red, making the zone so hot the command center refuses to send trucks. (http://tinyurl.com/965s489) All that radioactivity, said Coleman, gave him leukemia within three years, and a doctor gave him just four months to live. However, as a last resort he vis-ited a family physician who prescribed two quarts of \"some kind of tonic,\" hesays. Coleman says he never found outthe ingredients, but it was a red liquidthat tasted awful. \"I have no idea what happened,\" he says. \"But suddenly, theleukemia went away.\" At the museum Coleman did not repeat his tale of miraculous healing. Instead he told an exciting tale of his alleged pursuit of a uFO while flying a B-25 bomber in 1955. When the uFO supposedly dived to treetop level, Cole - man followed it at the B-25's top speed of 300 MPH. He reported putting the plane into a 90-degree bank at top speed at treetop level. This maneuver would very likely have crashed the plane had it actually taken place. Cole- man also told the audience to open their Bibles and read the account ofezekiel's wheel of fire, which he de- scribed as an example of alien contact. The true irony is that none of the speakers even mentioned Area 51, and nobody revealed any \"uFO secrets\"\u2014a classic \"bait-and-switch\" deception. During the question and answer ses-sion, las Vegas skeptic John Whitesideasked about the supposed \"authentic alien artifact\" in the Area 51 exhibit.The moderator referred the question to reporter George knapp, in the audi-ence, who (scandalously) was the sourceof that \"artifact.\" knapp has made a ca- reer out of reporting on weird stuff like alleged saucers at Area 51, robert Bigelow's Haunted ranch in utah, etc.Who had verified that supposed artifact? The russians and others. Who exactly?no answer. The moderator encour aged the two to take the discussion off-lineafter the session. Immediately after the close of the questions, Whiteside says he was approached by Jim Brown, who identified himself as the acting director of the museum. Brown berated him forasking such a question, claiming that it threatened their funding. If a museum'sfunding is threatened by asking a legit- imate question, the fault lies not with the questioner but with the museum. Whiteside went looking for knapp after this, no more than five minutes later, to find that he had quietly slipped out the door. On September 23, the night after the Museum panel, George knapp was the guest host on Coast-to-Coast AM , the radio show that brings you paranor- mal claims all night every night (http://tinyurl.com/8whe2tf ). One of his guests was Paul Stonehill, coauthor ofthe book Russia's Roswell Incident (http://tinyurl.com/9b5r9rt). knapp acknowledged bringing the \"artifact\"back from russia and giving it to the museum. knapp says he went to Dalne -gorsk in 1996, and apparently brought the sample back with him then. So ap-parently knapp has had the thing for more than fifteen years. Stonehill says: \"Based on some very serious researchand analysis, most likely what we have there is a crash of a reconnaissance probe, a Western, most likely nATO, re- connaissance probe crashed into the hill in the area of Dalnegorsk,\" although he says that some russian \"uFO experts\" concluded otherwise. Stonehill also said, \"There is a big black market for uFO ar-tifacts in the former Soviet union. So alot of junk is being sold.\" He said that \"researchers\" in South korea and Japan are paying prices in the thousands of dol-lars per gram for uFO crash metal, rais- ing the question of how much, if any-thing, knapp might have paid for his \"artifact.\" Whiteside wrote to the director of what should now be called the national Atomic Testing and uFO Museum,Allan Palmer, relaying an offer fromPenn Jillette to arrange proper scientific testing of the supposed \"artifact.\" Palmer refused to even consider the idea. Palmer's CV on his company's website describeshim as anexample of what the American Associa- tion of Museums would consider a \"peer re viewed\" exhibit. For whatever reason, we are now seeing once-respected names in educa- tion dragging themselves through the swamp of uFO and alien claims. First national Geographic, whose TV chan- nel is embracing uFO claims as if there were no tomorrow, with Chasing uFOs merely the most egregious example. now even a Smithsonian-affiliatedmu seum is shamelessly promoting en- tirely uncritical uFO claims. What will be next: Bigfoot exhibits? Astrological displays? Are museums to be the next venue for tabloid entertainment? If America's museums are willing to shed all scholarly rigor and self-respect to bring more visitors through the doors, then it will be a sorry day for science education in America. nJan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 28Does anyone ever get the feeling that popular evolutionary science is bursting with bull and ob - sessed with sex? Consider scholar and science writer Jesse Bering as oneprominent example. In the title cut of his new book, Why Is the Penis Shaped Like That? ... And Other Reflections onBeing Human (FSG, 2012), Bering en- gages in a neat bit of \"reverse engineer- ing\" to explain the evolutionary signifi- cance behind the mushroom-shapedcap and lip separating the human penis'sshaft from its glans. Okay, we're not exploring the origins of the universe here, or even the mys- tery of human consciousness. But it'snot a bad question either. After all, chimp, gorilla, and orangutan phalluses are essentially all shaft, and cat penisescome with about 150 sharp, backward- pointing spines ( Ouch !). So what on earth was nature thinking, so to speak? Citing a 2004 study published in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, Bering offers the \"semen displacement theory.\" rape, group sex, prostitution, and fe- male promiscuity, the theory goes, have generated intense male competition for access to the female ovum. In response, evolution, an eccentric artist if there ever was one, sculpted a human penis that when thrust into and out of the vagina would \"upsuck\" and displace the semen of other men. You might wonder just how this study was conducted. Well, as it turns out, with water, unbleached flour, and prosthetic genitals\u2014both male and fe- male\u2014from a local erotic novelty store, of course! Whatever your appraisal of the study's methodology, the upshot wasgenerally as follows: Phalluses with coronal ridges displaced 91 percent ofthe fake semen compared to 35.3 per- cent for their headless counterparts. But aren't chimpanzees at least as promiscuous or violent as we are, and what about those yowling cats? Bering'sanswer is identical to the one I once provided to a quarrelsome creationistwho wondered why, if evolution was sopowerful, it didn't create perfect solu- tions or at least very similar solutions among species to the same problems. Precisely because evolution does not transpire by intelligent design. \"It occurs by selection,\" Bering observes, \"and theraw material for such selection consistsof nothing more than random genetic accidents.\" Thus, male chimps compete in their own way, by depositing the most or the most potent semen. Male cats, by contrast, with their \"scratching posts,\"attempt to stimulate ovulation in addi- tion to competing for access. now consider psychologist and bi- ologist David P. Barash's account ofhuman menstruation in his new book,Homo Mysterious: Evolutionary Puzzlesof Human Nature (Oxford 2012). An extraordinary phenomenon, no other animal comes even close to the humanfemale in terms of both blood loss(about 40 ml) and tissue disruption\u2014 forcing her to literally reconstruct heruterine lining by the conclusion of each reproductive cycle. As such, menstruation is a very costly proposition. Along with the shedding of fresh blood, severe cramps surely ren-dered ancestral women more susceptible to grisly predation. But the most per- plexing fact of all, perhaps, is that men-struation thwarts evolution's ultimate goal, pregnancy, for three to five days out of every reproductive cycle. All of which,in Barash's estimation, just screams for a barrage of scientific hypotheses. First, menstruation could have served early humans as a signal to the woman that she wasn't pregnant. That would certainly have been a valuable thing to know in a world predating pregnancy tests. Or perhaps it was a signal to men that a girl had finally become a woman.\"logically unlikely,\" Barash teases. The costs are still too high.

And if the objec- tive was to reveal reproductive capacityto men, why not use something moreakin to pheromones? So is all hope lost for the signaling hypothesis? Maybe not. What if na-ture's ambition was a bit broader in so-cial terms\u2014to inform the entire tribe or clan, perhaps? not so fast, Barashwarns. Though competition amongwomen is usually less violent than among men, it still exists. Indeed, in many species, dominant females will in- timidate, attack, or otherwise inhibitthe reproductive opportunities of theirsubordinates. That humans are amongthose species, Barash admits, remains an \"unproven assumption.\" even so, he says, young and thus vulnerable girlswould always be well advised to concealtheir reproductive viability. Second, sex is a very messy business. Intercourse introduces foreign sub-stances deep inside the female body, be-yond the influence of her more common defenses. Sperm carry pathogens like Chlamydia , which causes pelvic inflam- matory disease, and thrusting penises convey bacteria like Strep tococcus and Staphylococcus beyond the vagina, where they pose little if any harm. Thus, some experts contend, the object of menstru- ation must be primarily hygienic\u2014in other words, to cleanse the woman's upper reproductive tract. But the \"cleansing hypothesis\" hasits own set of shortcomings, according to Barash. Menstrual blood, for exam- ple, contains nutrients, including iron, that actually facilitate pathogen devel- opment. And although one might ex- pect some correlation between men- strual intensity and pathogen load,none seems to exist. Or, if the uterus isunable to sense pathogen invasions, we might alternatively predict a similar re-lationship between menstruation andsexual frequency. But, again, the evi- dence just isn't there. And if menstruation serves to di- minish the uterine pathogen popula- tion, why does bacterial diversity actu-ally expand following menstruation?Finally, determined proponents of thecleansing hypothesis should explain why women in traditional, non-techno- logical societies who reproduce more frequently than their Western counter- parts and, thus, experience fewer men- strual cycles, aren't more susceptible touterine infections. Yet a third possibility defines men- struation, somewhat more cynically, as asystematic competency test that essen- tially pits potential mothers against their weakest embryos. We know thathumans invest more time and energy ineach offspring, and take more risks inthe process, than any other species. Werecognize as well that for every success-ful pregnancy many \"spontaneous abor- tions\" are caused by the failure of em-bryos to implant in their hosts' uteruses.In addition, as implantation proceeds,embryos begin secreting gonadotropin, a hormone as Barash suggests, menstruation is \"how a woman's body evaluates her would-be offspring and does so early in the 'investment' cycle,thereby minimizing wasted investment in case of a thumbs down.\" evolution,in other words, may have selected against embryos whose burrowing or secretory capacities are found wanting. But here's a surprise\u2014the author re- mains unconvinced. The \"evaluation hypothesis,\" he cautions, is unsupported by reality because, like the cleansing hy- pothesis, it should predict a link be- tween menstruation and sexual activity.And what about other species that tend to invest heavily in individual offspring?Why, for example, don't elephants, blue whales, or manatees menstruate? \"It's amystery,\" Barash concludes. \"Period.\" writ- ers' and researchers' (let's say) abun- dantly creative explanations and meth- ods? Is popular evolutionary science little more than lazy-minded specula-tion followed by impulsive waffling? I certainly don't think so. Imagina tion and conjecture, after all, are the fertilesoils in which truly great scientific ideas are often sowed. That these thinkers re- consider their original hy potheses and frequently conceive new ones is testa-ment to their intellectual integrity. Be- sides, I'm a big fan of just about anything that makes evolution more fun and ac- cessible for young people. And what about the obsession\u2014are we being exploited for our fascination with the tawdry and titillating? I don'tbuy that either. Indeed, why wouldn't any evolutionary science writer preoc- cupy herself with sex to some degree?For humans, heterosexual intercourse isthe indispensable mechanism by which our evolutionary machine has func- tioned for millions of years. regardless, show me a person who isn't fairly obsessed with sex and I'll liftthe cover and show you a toe tag. nImagina tion and conjecture, after all, are the fertile soils in which truly great scientific ideas are often sowed.

Since 2006, be-tween 20 and 40 percent ofthe bee colonies in theunited States have suffered massive die-outs called \"colony collapse.\"This is not an abstract or academicproblem\u2014it's an environmental andeconomic disaster. Honeybees pollinate $15 billion per year in crops and are es-sential for the health of many agricul-tural products. Many explanations have been pro- posed for the unexplained deaths, rang-ing from pesticides to cell phone signalsto climate change. As liz Day (2010) of Discovery news noted, \"scientists arefingering their latest culprit in the dra-matic disappearance of honeybees: afungus and virus team.... The virus af-fects bees' abdomens, often turningtheir tissues a purplish tone. The fun- gus, which also targets the bees' guts, is called Nosema ceranae.

PhillipsQ: Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 31The \"code,\" of course, is revelation 13:18. even today many believe the verse is prophetic, and the number inthe verse, 666, identifies the coming Anti-Christ. On the other hand, someserious biblical scholars interpret theverse as a historical reference to nerosince the emperor's Greek name andtitle, ????? ?????? , codes to 666 using a traditional Hebrew numbering system. removing the ending, n, also lowers the number to 616, and indeedthere are manuscript variants with that number. That multiple names code to 666 is known (Gardner 1985). The prophetic interpretation, then, requires that the number of names be sufficiently smallthat eventually the \"true\" code can bededuced. Fortunately, the quantity of such names is something we can deter- mine by considering the mathematics behind two typical coding methods proposed for the verse.In one method, the position of the letter in the alphabet is simply multi- plied by a number. For Z=156 was a code cir-culated in the early 1970s when it wasfound the assignments summed the sur- name of then Secretary of State, Henrykissinger, to 666. Alternatively, the letter Acan first be assigned a number and each successive letter then increased by a given amount. This method produces codes such as A=100, B=101, C=102 ... Z=125. This too is a famous code and works for the name Hitler. From simple algebra it can be shown that both methods arise from a single equation: 666 = mSb(i)+ nc Here mand care integers, and nis the number of letters in the name. The summation, Sb(i), represents the addi- tion of english, b(A)=1, b(B)=2, b(C)=3 ... b(Z)=26. Then if m = 6 and c=0, we have the \"kissinger\" code. With m=1 and c=99, we have our code for Hitler. Therefore,anyone searching for the \"hidden\" namein revelation 13:18 is actually looking for non-zero integer solutions for this or similar equations. The problem is that single equations with multiple unknowns do not have unique solutions. True, the name kissinger codes with m=6 and c=0, but also with m=3 and c=37. Hitler codes 32Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirer[FORUM The Math Behind the Myths CHARLES F. COOPER Many people seek (and find) hidden codes in num- bers, books, and images. To them the revealed mes- sages are too unusual and infrequent to arise simply from chance and so must have hidden and prophetic meanings. But others dismiss the \"solving\" of such codes as meaningless number fiddling and claim any alternate and ambiguous interpretations negate any real meaning. rarely does one side ever influence the other. But with computers on our desktops and compilers in our browsers, we should be able to come to some definitive conclusion if we revisit one of the classic \"coding\" cases. Simple arithmetic can show hidden codes are simply random phenomena.Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 32Skeptical Inquirer | January/ February 2013 33to 666 with any one of nine solutions. But more important, the primary variable, Sb(i), is not unique to any sin- gle name. So it isn't surprising that mul- tiple names sum to 666. But what is sur- prising is just how many. From a database of 18,839 Amer ican surnames (Census Bureau 2000) and with the computer searching for solu- tions for mand c, fully 81 percent of the names coded to 666. In addition, thecode used for kissinger was shared byseventy-two other names, and ninety-six names shared the code with Hitler\u2014including that of But thecode where A=9, whopping 340 names, including\u2014ironically\u2014the sur-name Jesus. Of course, by including first and middle names, initials, titles, andsuffixes, virtually any name can, asGardner pointed out, sum to 666. If there is any question that we are simply seeing a chance phenomenon, aglance at the histogram of the principlevariable, Sb(i), dispels any doubt. It is a textbook random Gaussian distribution.Of course, the randomly distributedvariable will then produce randomlydistributed codes.It remains a popular interpretation that revelation 13:18 is a prophetic code for future generations, and that itidentifies the coming Anti-Christ. But we have seen that any such code could never be deciphered due to the almost endless number of solutions that arise from chance alone. Fortunately, we have also seen that proper analysis of the un- derlying math can reveal how such\"hidden codes\" arise from random co- incidence and not from design. n References Gardner, Martin. 1985.

These regularities allow us to use a variety of relatively arbitrary mathematical systems to provide dates for all sorts of useful things, such as the proper seasons for agriculture. In view of the arbitrary nature of these systems, however, it is reasonably obvious that specific dates within any given system have no particular significance for sweeping change in the human or natural realms. This leads to a fascinating psychological question: Why do such arbitrary dates cause so many human beings to be- come so hysterical? We are currently being told by some media sources that the world will end on December 21 of this year. It is suggested that this was predicted by the Maya, given that this date co- incides with the end of a specific calendric cycle, a baktun , within their \"long count.\" This date has also been suggestedto coincide with a \"galactic alignment,\" a phenomenon that would seem to rely more on vague terminology than on actualastronomy for its very existence (krupp 2009), but that would,even if valid, have no terrestrial significance whatsoever. It is also true that there is at least one Maya document that men-tions this date without affording it any apocalyptic significancewhatsoever (Bower 2012). However, we are also told that the same date was of signif- icance for the Hopi people of the American South west. Of course, the Mexican (Aztec) pochtecatl, or long-range mer- chants, maintained a trade network that reached from theMaya country at least to the southern reaches of the Amer ican Southwest. It is not an impossible speculation that a few cal- endric ideas, together with tourmaline, obsidian, and Central American parrots, might have been passed along these traderoutes. Although this possibility presents an interesting question for archaeology, the alleged Maya/Hopi coincidence in dates simply doesn't provide sufficient cause to sell your house andmove up into the mountains, away from this doomed civi- lization, with a rifle and a staggering number of canned goods. This is espe-cially true in view of the fact that human beings have an abysmal record of predicting the future. Of course, this is not surprising, as the future hasn't happened yet. even so, from the oracles at Delphi and Cumae all the waythrough the surprisingly inaccurate pre- dictions of the precise consequences of climate change in the modern world,people have always sought accurate knowledge of the specifics of the future. Human beings have repeatedly failed, and these failures have occasionallybeen horrendously consequential. During the Greco/Persian wars, for example, the Delphic Oracle's predictionthat the Athenians would be safe behind their \"wooden wall\" did not work out so well for the Athenians, who built such walls around the Acropolis and werepromptly slaughtered by the Persians (wooden walls are amazingly flamma- ble). This prophecy of wooden walls was immediately fine-tuned by the admiral Themistocles to refer to his ships at Salamis (Herodotus 2006); ad mittedly,they were made out of wood, but a shipis not a wall, and to claim them as suchwas, and is, something of a stretch. Apocalyptic dates have come and gone many times. In recent years, we have This leads to a fascinating psychological question: Why do such arbitrary dates cause so many human beings to become so hysterical?Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 36Skeptical Inquirer | January/ February 2013 37seen the \"Heaven's Gate\" hysteria (Vick 1997), in which people sold their possessions, gathered under a charismatic leader, and prepared to leave earth in a uFO apparently hiding be hind theHale-Bopp comet (a physical impossibility). Physics aside, the Heaven's Gate devotees committed mass suicide so that at leasttheir souls could travel to Heaven, nirvana, or somewhere else,flying to this indefinable infinity in the company of hypotheticalspace aliens in their physics-proof starship. The Y2k phenomenon provided another well-documented instance of apocalyptic revelation (nolte 2009), in which manypeople sold all and headed for the hills because, somehow, all of our computers were going to fail, providing the basis for thedeath of civilization. Obviously, these things didn't hap pen.Despite these facts, however, many people remain wedded to the idea of apocalyptic prophecy. We are currently inun-dated with cable-television programs on the forthcoming endof the world. The authors, together with the rest of the world,have seen numerous documentaries \"proving\" the apocalyptic significance of December 21,2012. These programs have roped in everythingfrom the Maya and the Hopi to the predictionsof nostra damus and even the influence of spacealiens. What is the psychological basis for this phe- nomenon? What do people actually think isgoing to happen on December 21? We decided to find out. The Psychology of 2012 One hundred and ten college students at a Cal- ifornia university completed several surveys inwhich they were asked to rate the degree oftheir belief that major world changes wouldhappen on December 21, 2012. They were also asked about the sources of this belief; about their beliefs in a variety of re- lated areas, including various kinds of prophecies; about their specific beliefs concerning what, precisely, is supposed to hap-pen on the infamous date; and finally about their own char-acteristics. One of these characteristics lay in the realm of dis- sociation. Dissociation was measured by means of the Dissociative experiences Scale (DeS), which directly addresses this psy- chological attribute. Dissocia tion leads to a diminished critical assessment of reality. As discussed in an earlier S kePTICAl In- quIrer article (Sharps 2012), dissociated people may feel \"strange\" about themselves and the world around them. They may have anomalous perceptions of the passage of time or of their own experience. The world may appear to be \"not quite real or . . . diffuse\" (Cardena 1997, 400). Prac tically everyone feels this way, to a limited extent, from time to time; dissoci- ation per se is not a mental illness. However, the disconnection with reality might incline those with even subclinical levels of dissociation\u2014levels typical of many people in the general pop- ulation and in no way diagnostic of mental illness\u2014to view impossible or highly improbable things with an en hanced levelof credulity (see DePrince and Freyd 1999). Is this supposition correct? In previous published work (Sharps et al. 2006; Sharps et al. 2010), including a recent ar- ticle in the S kePTICAl InquIrer (Sharps 2012), our labora- tory ad dressed the role of dissociation in paranormal beliefs. We found that not only are the dissociated likely to believe in ghosts, aliens, and \"cryptids\" such as Bigfoot, but they are ac- tually more likely to seethese things, to interpret ambiguous stimuli as paranormal in nature. Where others see a hoax, the dissociated see Bigfoot. It is important to reiterate that disso- ciative tendencies are endemic in the general population; any- one, in any walk of life, may possess dissociative tendencies that influence the accurate judgment of reality. Given the relationship between dissociative processes and beliefs in the \"paranormal\" realm, it was anticipated that peoplewith dissociative tendencies would be prey to paranormal be- liefs, such as those surrounding the 2012 phenomenon, at a higher level than those without such tendencies. Do People Really Believe in the 2012 Apocalypse? The population for this research, college students, is continu- ally involved in the scientific evaluation of textbook informa- tion and media sources, together with courses that emphasize critical thinking. even so, this population gave evidence of un- expected levels of credulity in the case of the 2012 apocalypse. When asked if \"major changes\" would occur as a result of De- cember 21, 44.6 percent stated that they anticipated no such changes, or that such changes would be very unlikely. However, 9.8 percent anticipated such changes as either very likely or certain. 45.6 percent endorsed such changes as possible, with- out a strong opinion either way. The inference is that over half of this population, 55.4 percent, is at least somewhat influ- enced by the 2012 hype, either believing or at least entertain- ing the hypothesis that this date may result in major changes to earth and to human ways of life upon it. Dissociative Tendencies As suggested by our previous research, dissociative tendencies played a role in this phenomenon. A series of regression analyses was conducted, examining dissociation with refer- ence to the variables discussed above.What is the psychological basis for this phenomenon? What do people actually think is going to happen on December 21?Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 3738Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerThere was some good news. Dis sociative tendencies were notassociated with belief that major changes, either physical or social, would occur. How ever, there was bad news as well: regression analyses showed that those with more dissociative characteristics tended to believe that Maya prophecies, to- gether with the Maya calendar, predicted these changes if they in fact occurred. More dissociated individuals did not endorse the predictive power of the Hopi prophecies, nor of biblical prophecies, nor such prophecies as those of nostradamus. nor were they more likely to believe in the return of quetzalcoatl, other messiahs, or the advent of space aliens. Specific predictions of the apoc- alypse, including terrestrial causes such as global warming, also remained unendorsed. So did those of human origin (e.g., war, terrorism) and extraterrestrial origin (e.g., asteroids). However, dissociation did predict belief in the power of unspecified prophecies, including those that were \"religious\" or derived from \"computer simulations.\" Taken together, these results provide a complex but reveal- ing pattern. Al though the dissociated did not evince belief in major physical or social changes as a result of December 21,they believed in the power of the Maya prophecies to predict these changes, an obvious cognitive incoherency. At the same time, no additional specific prophecies, other than those of the Maya, were endorsed. However, more general realms of prophecy (religious, computer, etc.) for which no specific fea-tures were provided were endorsed as having predictive power.How are we to explain this psychological pattern? Gestalt and Feature-Intensive Processes In previous research (Sharps and nunes 2002; Sharps 2003; Sharps 2010) we discussed a continuum in human informa- tion processing. This continuum ranges from feature-intensive processing , in which a given concept is subjected to the consid- eration of its specific features, to gestalt processing , in whichsuch feature-based considerations are absent and therefore moot, and in which the logical consideration of specific details is reduced in favor of a more global, uncritical acceptance of the given phenomenon as a whole. This continuum is strongly relevant to the pattern of results observed here. In the present research, we see a statistically sig-nificant relationship between dissociative tendencies and thetendency to process the 2012 phenomenon as a gestalt whole, without attention to the details (feature-intensive processing)that might otherwise give rise to an appropriate skepticism. Thisinteraction of gestalt and dissociative processes appears to be a major source of credulity and to the essential cognitive inco- herency that makes apocalyptic beliefs possible. What is the evidence for this pattern of cognitive process- ing? As mentioned above, a major incoherency is immediate and obvious; dissociation led to an acceptance of the Maya prophecies of apocalypse, even when there was no belief in the apocalypse predicted . Those with dissociative tendencies be- lieved in the Maya prophecies, but not in the phenomena that those prophecies predicted. Also, there was a notable absence of feature- intensive processing in the cognitive systems involved. There was no endorsement of specific causes of change (e.g., war, global warming). In other words, when the specific causes of the apocalypse were \"pinned down\" in a feature-in- tensive manner, the dissociated were not in- clined to believe that anything was going to happen. even when the prophecies in question were specific (biblical, nostradamus, etc.), noendorsement of the end of the world was forth-coming. However, when the prophecies wereleft without specificity (with only vague, gestalt references to \"computers\" or \"religion\"), disso-ciative tendencies predicted significant apoca- lyptic beliefs. What Makes the Maya So Special? This argument might seem to be contradicted by the specific endorsement of Maya prophecies observed. How ever, \"Maya prophecies\" are a major em phasis of the vast corpus of apoc- alyptic nonsense currently infesting television and the Inter- net. According to the availability heuristic (Tversky and kah- neman 1973), sources of information that are relatively available are likely to influence human judgment even when there is no factual basis for this influence; and nonspecific,quasi-mystical references to the Maya are nothing, at the present time, if not available. Also, the average believer in these prophecies is typically not a Maya scholar. lacking thefeature-intensive information characteristic of the relevant expertise, it would be anticipated that, in general, the Maya references to 2012 would be processed by the average person in a gestalt manner, with an absence of the feature-intensive considerations that would engender reasonable skepticism. Those with dissociative tendencies believed in the Maya prophecies, but not in the phenomena that those prophecies predicted.Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 38Skeptical Inquirer | January/ February 2013 39In Summary In this study, we have seen that dissociative tendencies, at a sub clinical level and in the general population, incline people to cognitive incoherency; the dissociated believe in prophecies of apocalypse, even when they do not be lieve in the apoca-lypse itself. There is a belief in prophecies of the apocalypticfuture, even in the absence of belief that major physical or social changes will actually take place. How is this incoherency possible? The answer lies in gestalt/feature-intensive theory. Those who tend toward dis-sociation generally fail in the feature-intensive dynamics thatwould lead to appropriate skepticism. rather, they deal ingestalt processing, in which the relative absence of definable features and cognitive structure makes it possible to hold con-flicting thoughts simultaneously. In the present study, this was demonstrated in the rejection of specific apocalyptic consid-erations, even by the relatively dissociated, in favor of moreamorphous, general predictions of doom. This was high-lighted by general dissociated acceptance of the Mayaprophecies, both because of the availability heuristic (Tverskyand kahne man 1973) and because of relatively nebulous andethereal understanding of the specifics of Maya thought andculture. How to Promote Rational Skepticism These results provide a scientifically co herent explanation of current beliefs in the 2012 apocalypse. These beliefs have their source entirely in scientific human psychology, rather than in parapsychology or in unknown mystical factors. Of potentially greater importance, however, these results may also point theway to the reduction of absurd, mystical, or apocalyptic think-ing in the future. It should be noted that even those of highdegrees of dissociation did not endorse \"prophecies\" when these were made explicit and amenable to feature-intensive processing . The implication here is that the key to the avoidance of superstitious thinking, including apocalyptic thinking such asin the current 2012 absurdity, lies in the promotion and fa-cilitation of feature-intensive processing. If concepts are dis-sected in terms of their features, elements, and processes, there is no room for the vague, gestalt ideas that lead to such non-sense as the un critical acceptance of such ethereal conceptsas \"Maya prophecies\" and \"the end of the world.\" This idea is not unprecedented; a similar insistence on the specific (feature-intensive) definition of terms was demanded by Plato (Cornford 1957). However, in the present research,it is shown that such attention to detail, to the feature-inten-sive nature of argument, leads to the ability to reject such vague, gestalt concepts as \"Maya predictions of the end of theworld,\" and thus to the beginning and basis of rational con-sideration. The implication is obvious. Better education in the scien- tific basis of reality, in the precise, feature-intensive consider- ation of facts, can reduce vague, gestalt processing, and can even provide a defense against the superstitious inclinationsinherent in dissociative tendencies. It is hoped that the pres- ent results will incline educators to provide such feature-in- tensive analyses of ethereal and apocalyptic concepts, such as those inherent in the current 2012 hysteria, thus reducing the cognitive incoherency of those caught up in the hype, and fur-ther enhancing the rational consideration of the realities of the natural and social worlds. nn References Bower, B. 2012.

GARY LONGSINE AND PETER BOGHOSSIAN For many Muslims, including an in- fluential council of Muslim scholars (rubin 2012), the apology was greeted with righteous indignation. The re- sponse of the rioters was continued (and perhaps even in tensified) rage, as demonstrated by the murder of people who had nothing to do with priorevents. A second outbreak of such vio- lence in libya and other Muslim coun- tries occurred in Sep tember 2012 after a virulent independent anti-Islamic video appeared on the Internet via YouTube. The problem of righteous indigna- tion is conspicuous in, but not unique to, the Muslim world\u2014it permeates cultures across religious, ethnic, and na-tional boundaries. The destruction of Andres Serrano's artwork Piss Christ by Catholic fundamentalist protesters in Avignon, France, is another well-known example. Profound feelings of personal insult resulting from attacks on deeply held beliefs rank among the most pervasive,powerful, and potentially dangerous failures of human reasoning. This reac- tion carries with it both practical dan-gers that threaten harmonious interac- tions between and among peoples, and also the capacity to insulate not merely a person, but an entire culture, fromcriticism and self-reflection. We argue that \"Appeal to righteous Indignation\" and the related \"Appeal toSanctity\" warrant recognition as falla- cious types of reasoning and should beincluded in the larger lexicon of fallacies. (See \"The Top 20 logical Fallacies\" byJesse richardson in the July/August 2012 S kePTICAl InquIrer for an over - view of commonly recognized fallacies.) Righteous Indignation: A Brief, Incomplete Genealogy righteous indignation, perhaps rooted in primitive instincts for social enforce- ment (Haidt 2001), appears to be an emotional response perceived injus-tice (Haidt be more mod- ern (rossano 2006; kirkpatrick 1999), but the impulse to sanctity may be rooted in emotions like disgust (as op- posed to anger) (rozin et al. 1999). Science is only beginning to piece to- gether the potential neurological basis for the impulse behind righteous indignation and its role in human behavior. Scientist and author David Brin, for example, has appealed to the scientific com munity to study righteous indignation more closely. Brin suggests that dogmatic thinking isdriven by the emotional impulse torighteous indignation and the underlyingbrain biochemistry of behavioral addic- tive reinforcement (Brin 2011)\u2014such as is involved in gambling (Blaszczynski et al. 1986). In recent years, related phenomena (e.g., the role of punishment in the evo- lution of cooperation and the emotionalbasis of moral judgment) have beensubjects of inquiry in anthropology (Sosis and Alcorta 2003), economics (Grant 2008), game theory (Dreber et al. 2008), psychology (Hunter 2005), and evolutionary psychology (kirk patrick 1999). righteous indignation may have evolved to trigger participation in group punishment for non-compliance with group norms and influenced the evolu-tion of cooperation (Boyd and richerson 1992; krebs 2008; Jaffe and Zaballa 2010). There is also a line of research lit- erature suggesting some specific emo- tional foundations for moral behaviors, with indignation link ed to anger, for ex-ample (rozin et al. 1999).Riots erupted on the streets in Afghanistan in late February 2012 in response to an apparently acciden- tal burning of a few copies of the koran. Placed in an incinerator along with other materials confiscated from Taliban prisoners, the singed remains were discovered later by Afghan workers. Apologies from united States officials were immediately forthcoming. However, rioting contin- ued and reports indicated that at least twenty-nine Afghans and six American soldiers were killed in the vio- lence (rubin 2012).

Twological fallacies are routinely employed to shield ideas from such inspection. Inaccordance with the custom of the tax-onomy: Appeal to righteous indignation (argumentum ad probus indignatio); and Appeal to sanctity (argumentum ad sanctimonia). An Appeal to righteous Indigna tion is a logical fallacy in which a personclaims to be offended, in sulted, or hurt bycriticism of a proposition they hold, or bythe advancement of a proposition with which they disagree. The expected con-sequence of the demonstration of the ver-bal or physical behavior associated withrighteous indignation is that no furtherdiscussion or criticism is allowed. An Appeal to Sanctity is a logical fallacy in which a person attempts todeflect criticism of an idea by claimingthat the idea or argument is holy, sacred,sacrosanct, or otherwise privileged andimmune from critique. A few possible rebuttals might be of- fered. It could be argued that an Ap pealto righteous Indignation is merely anappeal to emotion, which seeks to ignitean emotional response and dampen sus-ceptibility to further reasoned discourse.It could be argued that an Appeal toSanctity is merely an example of circular reasoning. The Appeal to Sanctity may be considered a compound fallacy, compris-ing an appeal to authority and emotion, at least to the extent that the ideas inquestion are associated with institution-alized dog ma. However, the Appeal to righteous Indignation and the Appeal toSanctity have distinguishing traits. The salient feature of an Appeal to Sanctity is that it is employed as a shield against the critique of an idea, or even a wholesale ideological critique. An Ap- peal to Sanctity is a claim that one mustnot critique an idea because the idea inquestion is sacrosanct, holy, or sacred. In other words, an Appeal to Sanctity, re-duced to its simplest form, asserts as a moral virtue the claim that an idea is be- yond critique. The circular appeal to special privilege frequently carries an implicit and credible threat of violence,for example, the decades-long aftermath of the fatwa against Salman rushdie forhis book The Satanic Verses, the Danish cartoon controversy, the murder of Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh,Christian millennium terrorist plots in Israel, and the bombing campaigndubbed \"saffron terrorism\" in 2008 inMalegon, India. An Appeal to righteous Indigna tionsimilarly attempts to place an idea be- yond the reach of critique, but it em- ploys a different mechanism. rather than suggesting that the idea itself is privileged and thus must be immune from criticism, an Appeal to righteous Indignation implies that a critique of an idea is equivalent to an attack on a per- son. Intrinsic to an Appeal to righteous Indignation is the notion that attackson an idea are morally equivalent to (verbal or physical) at tacks on people, that an attack on an idea justifies a re-sponse at least proportionate to an at-tack on a person. Credible threats of vi- olence often accompany displays of righteous indignation and are some- times viewed as justified by members of There exists no nonideological reason why any given idea or belief should be placed beyond con-templation, discussion, investigation, or criticism.Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 4142Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirerthe community. Consider the odd case of a man who burned a VFW flag in adrunken fit. He was taped to a flagpolefor several hours the next day by an in-dignant VFW member, who then spokeabout his actions openly to a local tele-vision reporter (Gardinier and Mart\u00ednez2009), apparently unconcerned aboutany possible legal repercussions. Those who engage in these fallacies believe that becoming indignant, or re-fusing to question a particular belief, are virtues. In other words, one should become indignant, and not becoming indignantindicates a moral flaw in one's character;one should refuse to question priv ileged beliefs, and persistence in questioningrepresents a character defect. In recent years a growing number of public intellectuals, including richardDawkins (Dawkins 1996), Salmanrushdie (Duffy 2004), and DouglasAdams (Adams 1998), have asserted thegeneral fallaciousness of the Appeal toSanctity, but no standard label exists,and no attempt to promote these as astandard part of the taxonomy of falla-cies has been advanced. The Harm righteous indignation undermines civil discourse and often corrodes efforts aim -ed at reasonable compromise. Whenrighteous indignation is invoked, conver-sation stops and violence may begin. For the indignant party, reason may be sus- pended. righteous indignation mud dlesthinking, elevates emotional reactions toprimacy in the discourse, and displaces its alternative: impassioned, reasoned,thoughtful analysis. righteous indignation may be a valid emotional experience and re sponse to in- justice. As Greta Christina has ob served (Christina 2007), anger can be an impor- tant tool for motivating social change. However, its use to shield ideas from crit- icism impedes rather than advances dis- course. The Appeal to righteous Indig- nation is therefore fallacious in the context of rational discourse. The continuing demonstrations of the pervasiveness and disturbing natureof appeals to sanctimony and righteousindignation as primary or even sole argu- ments, and in an effort to end, rather than further, discussion in Afghanistan andelsewhere, make a compelling case for theurgency of this project. It may seem somewhat overdue to skeptics, atheists, and freethinkers that these classificationsare necessary, but the cultural, social, and political world situation give these classi- fications an added urgency. n References Adams, Douglas. 1998.

In the area of literary and linguistic studies, they misinterpret, misrepresent, and mistranslate Beowulf to fit their agenda. EVE SIEBERT Most skeptics are familiar with the questionable nature of the scientific arguments made by young-earth creationists\u2014those who take the Bible literally andbelieve that earth is less than ten thou-sand years old. What is less often appre-ciated is the violence some creationistswreak on works of literature and fineart, especially those that feature dragonsand other monsters. In particular, Be- owulf has recently enjoyed popu- larity with a Beowulfdisplay, 1and the Creation Museum in kentucky has a statue of Beowulf overthe door of its Dragon Hall Bookstore. 2 Curiously, creationists not only interpretthe Bible as the literal, inerrant word ofGod, they read fictional works like Be- owulf as literal, if not inerrant, accounts of actual events. The most thorough creationist treat - ment of Beowulf appears in the book After the Flood: The Early Post-Flood History of Europe Traced Back to Noah by Bill Cooper, a trustee of the Creation Science Movement, the \"oldest creationist move- ment in the world,\" according to its web- site (https://www.csm.org.uk/index.php). Cooper's primary purpose is to test the accuracy, veracity, and validity of the Table of nations in Genesis 10 and 11 and, by extension, the rest of the Bible. He com- pares the Table of nations, which de- scribes the descendants of noah's sons, with Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, and Scandina- vian gene alogies that trace various euro-Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 4344Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirerpean dynasties back through a collection of pagan heroes and gods to a son of noah, often one born on the ark. Cooperargues that these genealogies more or less accurately preserve pre-conversion tradi-tions that are independent of the Bible.However, since they mention noah, hissons, and the ark, Cooper interprets themas independent corroboration of the bib-lical account. In fact, the evidence sug- gests that noah and his sons were a late addition to the genealogies. 3 In the last two chapters, Cooper shifts from genealogies to stories of monsters and suggests that these mon-sters were actually dinosaurs. To Coop -er, tales of dragons and sea monsters provide evidence that humans and di- nosaurs lived at the same time and thatearth is therefore much younger than scientists will admit. Beowulf ties his themes together: it mentions the Flood and Cain; it refers to some of the char- acters who appear in the genealogies;and it contains monsters. As in the case of the genealogies, Cooper finds it nec- essary to move the date of Beowulf back to a time before the Anglo-Saxon con- version to Chris tianity. Indeed he argues that the \"poem pre-dates the migration of the Saxons to these isles\" (147). While the date of Beowulf is controver- sial, 4such an early date is impossible. For one thing, the Anglo-Saxons beganarriving in Britain in the fifth century, slightly before the main events of the poem unfold. Further more, if Beowulf is a continental composition, it is in the wrong language. Since it focuses onScandinavian tribes, one would expectit to be in Old norse or perhaps evenProto-norse, but it's not: it's in Old English , a language that evolved in Eng- land after various tribes had migrated there from their continental homelands. Cooper needs to push the date of Be- owulf as far as he can into the past, partly so he can argue that the poem is inde- pendent of the Bible and Christianthought and therefore confirms the bib-lical account of the Flood, and partly so he can argue that it is a poetic but basi-cally historical account of real people, real events, and real animals. He notes that the poem preserves \"not just the physical descriptions of some of the monsters that Beowulf encountered, but even the names under which certain species of the ani-mals were known to the Saxons and Danes\" (150). In an appendix, he includes a list of \"Zoo logically applied terms in theBeowulf epic\" (Appendix 10, 238-40).none of these resemble what we usuallythink of as zoological descriptions, andmany pre-Christian poem. While Beowulf recounts stories of feuds, battles, and alliances, the poem focuses primarily on the protagonist'sencounters with monsters. In his youth,the Geatish hero travels to the court of the Danish king Hro\u00e7gar to fightGrendel, who has been ravaging the halland killing and eating the men. When Grendel's mother seeks revenge for her son's death, Beowulf tracks her to her lair and kills her as well. In his final bat-tle, Beowulf, now an old king, faces adragon that is attacking his own home-land. In addition to his main antago-nists, Beowulf also encounters a number of sea serpents. In his analysis of Beowulf , Cooper discusses words, phrases, and passages in some depth, giving the impression that he has some familiarity with Oldenglish. In one instance, he provides hisown translation of a short passage. The passage is not particularly difficult, and the gist of his translation is accurate enough but reveals that he does not ac- tually understand how the language works. 5elsewhere, he relies on the translation by Michael Alexander, al-though it is not always clear from his ci-tations when he is using Alexander'stranslation. He calls Alexander's trans- lation \"the best translation\" of the poem(154). 6To be clear, there is nothing wrong with Alexander's translation, but it is a verse translation, and Alexander uses poetic license in adapting the story. For a discussion of precise word usage, a verse translation is largely useless. For such adiscussion, a fairly literal prose translation is necessary\u2014at the very least. Much bet- ter would be a text in Old english thathas a good glossary, such as an edition by Frederick klaeber. Cooper cites and quotes klae ber\u2014and in places criticizesklaeber's commentary\u2014but to a large ex- tent, he ignores klaeber's glossary in favor of Alexander's translation. In doing so, he ends up making mistakes, such as dis-cussing at some length the name of a sea serpent \"species,\" unaware of the fact that the word he's discussing, y\u00f0gewinn , doesTo Cooper, tales of dragons and sea monsters provide evidence that humans and dinosaurs lived at the same time and that Earth is therefore muchyounger than scientists will admit.Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 44Skeptical Inquirer | January/ February 2013 45not refer to the creature but to its move- ment.7 Cooper turns Beowulf 's three main antagonists into dinosaurs by interpret- ing poetic descriptions as zoological terms and cherry-picking details of a poetic translation, while giving the im-pression that the Old english textbacks up his argument. unsurprisingly,Cooper identifies the dragon as apterosaur. More specifically, he believesthe use of the term widfloga (far-flyer, ll. 2346, 2830) \"would have distin-guished this particular species of flying reptile from another similar species which was capable of making onlyshort flights\" (152). He therefore con-cludes that it is a pteranodon, despitethe fact that pteranodon remains havebeen found exclusively in north Amer -ica. In addition, the word pteranodon means a winged, toothless creature, while the dragon in Beowulf definitely has teeth. More importantly, he as- sumes that the creature can be identi- fied as a specific animal based on a po-etic de scription. Old english poetry isbased on alliteration rather than rhyme.A poet may use many different terms torefer to the same creature, person, or object, often choosing the term that best fits the alliteration and meter. Oc-casionally, this can lead to confusion forthe reader. For instance, in Beowulf, the same people. Both times widfloga occurs, it alliterates and fits the meter of the line. 8 Cooper also mentions that the poet calls the dragon ligdraca or fire-dragon (ll. 2333, 3040),9but he does not ex- plain how this appellation is appropri- ate to a pteranodon. The poet re - peatedly associates the dragon with fire. It uses fire to wreak its vengeance on Beowulf 's land, burning homes and killing people, and Beowulf has a shield of iron prepared to protect him from the dragon's flames. Yet the paleonto- logical record is conspicuously silent about pterosaurs' ability to breathe fire.Another notable characteristic of the dragon is its inordinate love of treasure.It had spent 300 years in its barrow, lying on its treasure until the theft of a single cup spurred it to fury. The loveof treasure is common among Ger- manic dragons, mentioned in many Old english and Old norse works. If the Beowulf poet were describing a real animal as Cooper claims, we would ex- pect to find pteranodon bones on top of or near treasure hoards, yet the mas- sive Anglo-Saxon treasure trove re- cently discovered in Staffordshire, eng-land, is surprisingly free of pterosaurremains, as are the great ship burials, such as Sutton Hoo in england and Gokstad and Oseberg in norway. While the association between drag- ons and dinosaurs is common among young-earth creationists, Cooper goes a step further and argues that the other monsters in Beowulf are dinosaurs as well: \"Our attention must now bedrawn towards another reptilian mon- ster which was surely the most fierce- some [ sic] of all the animals encoun- tered by Beowulf, the monster called Grendel\" (152-53). poem, theDanish king Hro\u00e7gar provides then provides Alexander's translation of the passage: [A]nd one of them .......................................... was in woman's shape, but the shape of a man, though twisted, trod also the tracks of exile \u2014save that he was more huge than any human being. (ll. 1348-52)10 \"But,\" asks Cooper, \"what exactly do the descriptive terms tell us that is of such importance? Simply this: that the fe- male was in the shape of a woman . .. and the male was in the shape of a man. ... In other words, they were both bipedal , but larger than any human\" (155, emphasis in original). Actually that's not really what the description tells us at all. Alexander, presumably for poetic reasons, leaves out one word: o\u00f0er, \"other\" (l. 1355b). Grendel was larger than any other man. Cooper's en- tire argument hinges on the omission of one little adjective.11Grendel was ab- normally large, but he was man-shaped, Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 4546Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirerand his mother had the likeness of a woman. Twice the Beowulf poet con- nects the Grendel-kin to the race of Cain (ll. 104-114, 1256-68), and sev-eral times he either calls Grendel agiant or associates him with giants. 12 never does he describe them in a waythat would suggest that they are rep- tiles. He calls the dragon wyrm (ser- pent) and draca and repeatedly refers to it as \"coiled.\" Similarly, the water mon- sters (that are not called y\u00f0gewinn) are called wyrm and draca. no such terms are applied to Grendel or his mother. Having turned more or less human creatures into mere bipeds, Coopertwists the description of Beowulf 's bat-tle with Grendel into something quite different from what the poet describes. Cooper says that the Danes \"had them-selves attempted to kill Grendel with conventional weapons. ... Yet his im - penetrable hide had defied them all, and Grendel was able to attack theDanes with impunity. Beowulf consid-ered all this and decided that the onlyway to tackle the monster was to get to grips with him at close quarters\" (155- 56). In fact, Beowulf chooses to fightunarmed because he knows that Gren- del does not use weapons. He regards itas a matter of honor (ll. 433-40). 13It is only during his battle with Grendel's mother, to which he does bring a sword,that he discovers that the two are invul- nerable to ordinary weapons. Despite Beowulf 's explanation for his actions, Cooper argues that it was astrategic position because \"the mon- ster's forelimbs . ... were small and comparatively puny. They were the monster's one weak spot, and Beowulf went straight for them. He was alreadyrenowned for his prodigious strength of grip, and he used this to literally tear off one of Grendel's weak, small arms\" (156). Cooper is coy about identifying what kind of dinosaur Grendel is. \"Is there,\" he asks \"a predatory animal from the fossil record known to us, who hadtwo massive hindlegs and two compar-atively puny forelimbs?\" (159). He an- swers that there are several. After de- scribing the species he refers to as \"the Grendel\" for another page, he con-cludes, \"I doubt that the reader needs to be guided by me as to which particularspecies of predatory dinosaur the details of his physical description fit best\" (160). Though he refuses to say it di- rectly, he clearly means to imply that Grendel is a Tyrannosaurus rex. 14The problem is that his description is inaccurate. The poet never says that Grendel's arms are puny, weak, or small, or that his hind legs are massive. As Cooper says, Beowulf 's strength is prodi-gious: he is said to have the hand-grip of thirty men (ll. 379-80). Grendel imme- diately recognizes Beowulf 's strength and wants to get away (ll. 750-56). Strictly speaking, Beowulf does not tear off Grendel's arm at all. rather, it is the combined strength and determination of the two combatants that results in Gren- del's injury. Beowulf is determined to retain his grip on Grendel, while Grendel is desperate to escape. In the end, both achieve their goals: Grendel flees to the mere, and Beowulf is left holding his arm. Although Cooper misidentifies Gren - del as Beowulf 's most formidable foe (each fight is more difficult than the pre- vious one), 15he diminishes Grendel's sig- nificance and Beowulf's accomplishment by continuously misrepresenting the text. Cooper's Grendel is not only puny-armed but is \"only a youngster, and not by all ac- counts a fully mature adult male of his species\" (156). I'm not sure what \"ac- counts\" Cooper is reading, but the poem in no way supports his assertion. Gren- Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 46Skeptical Inquirer | January/ February 2013 47del, as we have established, is much larger than any other man and unusu- ally strong. He is not an immature,puny-armed T-rex; he is a large, strong, man-shaped creature who has a taste for Danish. Cooper's book may seem a slightly silly contribution to the creationist ar-senal. Certainly, it is easy for anyonewith a background in medieval history, languages, or literature to refute many of his arguments. unfortunately, his target audience probably does not in - clude many medieval scholars. Very few people have expertise in the medievalgenealogies of Wales, Ireland, Anglo- Saxon england, or Scandinavia, for in- stance. The scholarly trappings of Cooper's work give it an air of authority,and it has become extremely popular among creationists. A Google search of the words \"Beowulf \" and \"dinosaurs\" re- turns over twelve million hits. Some of these sites refute creationist claims, butmany are verbatim copies of all or partsof After the Flood or adaptations of it. Most disturbingly, Cooper's ideas are repeated in works intended to educatechildren. ruth Beechick recyclesCooper's arguments in \" Beowulf : or History\" on Crosswalk.com, a home-schooling site. 16Although her language is geared toward young children, she fol-lows Cooper's arguments very closely,occasionally adding her own errors. Also aimed at homeschooled chil- dren is the \"audio adventure,\" Jonathan Park and the Hunt for Beowulf . The Hunt for Beowulf is volume IV (of eight) of the Jonathan Park Adven tures, radiodramas that are also sold as CD sets. The series is sold by Answers in Gene- sis 17and the Creation Museum gift shop (as is After the Flood ), was origi- nally developed by the Institute for Creation research,18and is currently produced by Vision Forum Mini - stries.19The series follows the Creation response Team, led by Jonathan's fa- ther, kendall Park, a paleontologist who, based on \"scientific evidence,\" has converted from a belief in evolution to strict adherence to young-earth cre- ationism. In The Hunt for Beowulf, the Creation response Team seeks to re- cover the stolen Beowulf manuscript, \"the oldest english manuscript everdiscovered.\"20The team is eager to find the manuscript (far more eager than ei- ther the British police or the British library, apparently) because it containsevidence that dinosaurs and man livedtogether. As in Cooper's book, Grendel has been added to the list of (compara- tively) modern dino saurs. In the Jona -than Park adventure, he has also be- come a dragon. each audio adventure comes with a substantial study guidethat includes fun activities and much false information and pseudoscience.earnest advertisements after each install-ment also encourage listeners to findmore study material at www.jonathanpark.com. When creationists co-opt Beowulf as a tool for their agenda, they contribute to the misinformation they are providing their homeschooled children. Beo wulf is twisted and mangled to ac commodate pseudoscience and pseudo-history. Al -most as disturbing is the way it limits theappreciation and understanding of one of the earliest masterpieces of our language.literary criticism allows multiple inter- pretations of any work, as long as thoseinterpretations can be supported by tex-tual and contextual evidence. Crea tionistsallow only one interpretation of Beowulf , and it is one that is in direct conflict withtextual and contextual evidence. By try- ing to force the poem to fit a rigid andfallacious understanding of world events, creationists also ignore the literary merits of the work. Cooper condescendingly de - scribes the poetic language of Beowulf : \"The Anglo-Saxons (like the modernGer mans and Dutch) had a very simple method of word construction, and theirnames for everyday objects can some- times sound amusing to our modern english ears when translated literally. ... It was thus an intensely literal but at the same time highly poetic language pos- sessing great and unambiguous powers of description\" (150). This definition of the language of Beo wulf fits Cooper's agenda: the word construction is simple, and the descriptions are unambiguous, makinghis interpretations self-evident. In reality, there is much in Beowulf that is obscure or ambiguous, and the cultural and lin- guistic gap between modern readers and the poet makes interpretation all the more challenging. In addition, it is diffi-cult to see how a poem that heavily em-ploys kennings, a type of metaphor, can be considered \"intensely literal,\" though Cooper's view may help us understand why he mistakes poetic de scriptions for \"zoologically applied terms.\" Though Cooper and his followers may occasionally give lip service to Beo - wulf 's poetic power, it is clear that to them, its only value is as a tool of in - doctrination, and children cannot be trusted to interpret it for themselves. n Notes 1.

Cooper translates lines 815b-818a as, \"Searing pain seized the terrifying ugly one as a gaping wound appeared in his shoulder. The sinews snapped and the (arm-)joint burst asun- der\" (155). He assumes that the noun that pre- cedes the verb in the first clause is the subject, andthe noun that follows it is the direct object; infact, the second noun is in the nominative case and must therefore be the subject. To accommo- date the reversal of subject and direct object, hechanges the meaning of the verb. later he makes a plural noun singular. A more accurate transla- tion of the passage is \"The terrible, ferociousfighter experienced bodily pain; a very great wound became apparent on his shoulder; the sinews sprang asunder; the joints burst.\" 6. He says this specifically about the passage that describes Grendel and his mother. We will see why he favors Alexander's translation of this particular passage. 7. Cooper translates y\u00f0gewinn as \"wave- thrasher\" (51, 61 n. 9). It actually means \"wave- strife,\" a kenning or short metaphor for \"swim- ming.\" When shot with an arrow, the creature is\"deprived of life, of wave-strife\" (ll. 1432-35). \"Wave-thrasher\" comes from Alexander (l. 1433), although Cooper does not cite him in this in - stance. Alexander's version poetically captures the feel of the passage, but it is far from being a literal translation. 8. Beowulf from wounds. . .). emphasis added to high- light alliteration. 9. The dragon is also called fyrdraca (fire- dragon, l. 2689). 10. When Cooper quotes Alexander, he prints the lines as prose, as he does with the Oldenglish. This may be a quirk of formatting, but it disguises the fact that Alexander's translation is a non-literal verse translation. He also leaves out the subtitle \"A Verse Translation\" when he cites it (Cooper cites the 1973 edition, but it too was subtitled \"A Verse Translation\"). 11. This omission is particularly glaring be -cause, when Cooper quotes Old english, hetransliterates \u00feand \u00f0as th. Consequently, he in - cludes the phrase, \"thonne aenig man other,\" which is not difficult to translate into modern english; however, since he prints a large chunk of Old english (ll. 1345-54) as a block of italicizedprose, with two phrases bolded ( idese onlicness of a woman, and weres w\u00e6stmum , the form of a man), it's unlikely that most readers will look too closely at it. 12. Eoten , ll. 761 and 112; \u00feyrs, l. 426. In l. 112, giants (eotenas) are said to have sprung from the race of Cain, along with elves and monsters. The poet says that Grendel lived for a time among the race of Cain. 13. Beowulf says, in part, \"I have also heard that the wretch, because of his recklessness, does not care about weapons. Therefore, I . . . scorn that I should bear sword or large shield, yellow shield, to battle, but rather I shall grapple with the fiend with my grasp.\" later he says, \"I do not claim for myself any lowlier battle-stature than Grendel [claims for] himself; therefore, I will not put him to sleep with a sword, deprive him of life, although I can\" (677-80), clearly indicating that he doesn't realize that a sword would be useless against Grendel. 14. As with the pteranodon, the T. rex has only been found in north America. In their book Claws, Jaws, and Dinosaurs (Pensacola: CSe Pub - lications, 1999), born-again cryptozoologist William J. Gibbons and kent Hovind echo Cooper's arguments concerning Grendel and the water monster, although they don't credit him. However, they suggest that Grendel was \"the fear- some Megalosaurus, a dinosaur found in Britainand similar to Tyranosaurus-rex [ sic]\" (19). 15. Beowulf successfully fights Grendel un - armed, but he brings a sword to face Grendel's mother. When that sword fails, he uses a magic sword he finds in her lair. For the fight with the dragon, he is fully armed and has a specially made shield. In addition, he is only able to overcome the dragon with the assistance of Wiglaf, and he is mortally injured in the battle. 16. The article is no longer on crosswalk. com's website.

The Beowulf manuscript, written c. 1000, is not the oldest english manuscript. Among theearliest copies of Old english poetry are texts of \"C\u00e6dmon's Hymn\" included in latin copies of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People . Cambridge, university library MS kk 5 16 and St. Petersburg, national library of russia MS lat. q.v.I.18. Both date to the eighth century. Possibly even earlier is the ruthwell Cross, which pre- serves part of the Old english poem The Dream of the Rood . This, however, is not a manuscript, but a runic inscription on a stone cross. There are prose works that pre-date Beowulf as well. For in- stance, Bede's Ecclesiastical History was translated into Old english in the late ninth or early tenth century. All four major Old english poetic codices (the Beowulf MS, the exeter Book, the Vercelli Book and Oxford, Bodleian library MS Junius 11) date from roughly the same period.

One day later, halfway acrossthe world in a destitute village in Southeast Asia, as reported by Aid to Special Saints in Strategic Times, anunnamed, unspecified, TB-positive elder was miraculously cured of tuber- culosis through divine intervention in the name of Jesus Christ by a mission- ary sponsored by an evangelical organ-ization based in Carrollton, Texas (AS- SIST news Serv ice 2010). Did the divinity of the Gospels truly channel divine will to heal this man? From a scriptural stance, yes, of course, partic- ularly so because of God's long-stand- ing feud with tuberculosis. Validationsfor faith in this vein are of growing con-cern right here in the united States. The first microbe to have the dubi- ous honor of supposedly being exor- cised out of a patient by an Abrahamic prophet was the causative agent of lep- rosy (and similarly its sister disease, tu- berculosis), Mycobacterium leprae , and one can only wonder what the little mycobacterium must have thoughtabout having the light of God chan- neled through its peptidoglycan mem- brane. According to the Gospel of Matthew, the prophet Jesus miracu- lously healed an afflicted leper by laying his hands upon the man and com- manding him to be healed (Matthew8:1-4). The Gospel of Matthew existsas a cornerstone for Christian theology and continues to deliver advice and al- legory on how to live a healthy life. Yetmiracles are by definition extraordinaryand unique, and so reliance upon divineintervention pales in comparison to the repeatability of modern medicinal sci- ence. Indeed, evidence-based medicinehas left religious supporters right where they believe they have come from: in the dust. Consider as an example of faith that for 1,957 years after Christ came, my- cobacterium continued to ravage hu-manity, with only one recorded miracu-lous curing. Prior to the invention of rifamycin in Milan in 1957 as a treat-ment for mycobacterium, humanity hadsuffered from tuberculosis and leprosyfor millennia, with tubercular decay Skeptical Inquirer | January/ February 2013 49Mystics, Mycobacterium, and the Gospel of Matthew Mycobacterium has plagued humanity for millennia and is singled out in the Christian Bible (as leprosy). Today, two thousand years later, Christians contend that the Bible holds clues for cures and miracles relevant to combating infectious disease. The persistence of Biblical commentary on evidence-based healthcare raises a worrisome red flag. C.A. PORTER Of Microbes and MenWhere would you place your faith in a cure for tuber- culosis? On September 6, 2010, the New York Times published an article updating the world on a novel tuberculosis detection device (Xpert MTB/rIF) developed by Cepheid and funded by the national Institutes of Health (nIH) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Mcniel 2010). The new test was hailed by the New Eng- land Journal of Medicine as a breakthrough for detecting Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 4950Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirerfound in egyptian mummies entombed as early as 2400 BCe (Zink et al. 2003). lacking germ theory or natural ideas for origins of diseases and their trans- missions, early man naturally used reli- gion as an alternative explanation for in-fectious diseases. As medical science has progressed since our earlier history, thediscovery of a pivotal drug against my- cobacterium has dramatically and re- producibly accelerated cure rates for lep- rosy and tuberculosis, as well as eliminating mengingococci from carri- ers. On the side of the prophets, one may wonder why more prophets with such miraculous healing powers had not been sent down by God in the mean- time as a way of healing the sick untilantibiotics had been invented. But Christianity has not given up its claim to cleanse the body from diabol-ical bacteria. With thousands of gener-ations of people affected by the beliefs of a handful of Mesopotamian artisans already inculcated with religious expla- nations for disease, the role of religionhas not retreated from medicine. Thisis in spite of Christian miracle-work- ing's complete inability to fulfill any one of koch's Postulates. The persistence of religion in mat- ters of health and healing raises an ob- vious, if not inconvenient, red flag for modern practitioners: if faith cannot ex- plain disease or proffer treatments, thenwhy is faith being encouraged to com- ment on medical matters in academic and clinical settings? One wonderswhich our little mycobacterium is moreapt to fear: the light of God or the ad-ministration of an antibiotic. Tuberculosis: 2,010 Years Later As the united States continues to ab- surdly trumpet its piety as a Chris tian nation (and a faithfully illiterate one atthat, according to an embarrassing study put out by the Pew Forum in 2010), calls for incorporating Christian doctrine in hospitals and clinics as al- ternatives or as complements to medi- cine have stepped up in frequency. But clinicians, and hopefully the patients themselves, can see that there is no practical use for adopting Christian But Christianity has not given up its claim to cleanse the body from diabolical bacteria.

Faith is perfectly fine out-side the hospital, but when faith isplaced on the same high grounds as sci-entific medicine on the surgery table,the patient ultimately suffers. The enthusiastic inclusion of reli- gion in the clinic\u2014nominally passedover as only cultural sensitivity but withdeeper Christian undertones\u2014doesexist as an espoused contender for a pa-tient's attention and choice as a therapy.So acting as the devil's advocate, whyshould faith be singled out and ex- cluded from legitimacy as an augmen-tation to medical treatments, particu-larly against infectious disease? Becausefaith does not faze unbelieving, heathenbacteria in the slightest, as our modelorganism of mycobacterium reveals with further investigation. Mycobacterium's Immunity to Divinity The consequences for reliance on faith at the expense of medical science can in -deed be dire. On May 31, 2002, atwenty-four-year-old Oklahoma womandied eleven months after diagnosis of tu-berculosis, having refused available treat- ment. She instead had paid a priest to pray over her during her sickness and hadinsisted to providers that divine interven- tion would save her (killacky 2002). Thelate evangelist Oral roberts subscribed to a literal scripture interpretation to mean that divinity can, and does, cure disease, and he had established a career as a television preacher praising divine intervention as the therapy that had cured him of his tuberculosis at age sev- enteen (Fox news 2009). This concept of disease being caused by spiritual forces and hence susceptible to spiritual exor- cisms is found in the opening pages of the Gospel of Matthew: \"And when [Jesus Christ] had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease\" (Matthew 10:1). All one has to do is pray for health and if God judges the prayer worthy, Christian apologists assure the sick and afflictedthat by God's grace they will be healed. A petition for divine intervention on behalf of curing illness is among the old- est and most widespread practices in- tended to alleviate suffering and disease. Prayer is arguably the oldest petition in the Christian tradition and is certainly the most portable (sacrifices require ad- ditional effort and preparation, but these,too, are not without reported divine favor [luke 22:19, Corinthians I 5:7, Hebrews 10:12]). Prayer in the clinical setting has been investigated ad nauseum from the standpoint of scientists with limited, if any, positive implications on patient re- covery. recently the Cochrane Review published a double-blind study on the salutary effects of intercessory prayer (n=7,646 patients) for the comparisoneffects of prayer versus standard care alone and concluded that there existed \"no clear effect of intercessory prayer ondeath\" (roberts et al. 2009). But from a biblical point of view, prayer and peti- tions to the divine boast salubrious ef- fects\u2014\"boast\" being the operative word. Praying to cure illness is advocated in the new Testament in multiple places ( James 5:13, 5:16; Isaiah 59:16; Acts 4:29-31; Corinthians I 12:9), and if Matthew is any authority on the matter then reported accounts of praying to Jesus Christ for healing have yielded Christians miraculous results, in cluding a cure for blindness (Mat thew 21:14), re-suscitation from death (Matthew 9:21- 22), cessation of epi lepsy and paralysis (Matthew 4:24), relief from demonic in- festation (Mat thew 4:24, 8:16), and cures 9:35, 12:15, 14:14, 14:36, 15:28), all in addition to combating my- cobacterium. Moreover, intercessory prayer has a testimonial applauding its ability to alleviate sickness at a distance (Matthew 8:5-13). Petitions to the di- vine for assistance with combating dis- ease are understandable\u2014because an- cient peoples had no knowledge of bacteria or viruses or protozoa\u2014but ul- timately seem incredulously superstitious now that we know better. The intersection between faith and medicine today is a bewildering one. Two hundred years of marvelous ad-vancements in microbiology, evolution- ary theory, and immunology have greatly expanded our concepts of dis- ease and have afforded humanity an ef- fective arsenal with which to defend, and thereby extend, our lives. Yet we also arrive at a time when faith is being actively pushed as an alternative or as a complement to these scientific and medical achievements. What we need more of is science, not blind faith. questioning wisdom in the Gospels is the first step toward alleviating medi- cine from the specter of the Holy Ghost and would reaffirm commitment to delivering patients only the best ev-idence-based practice. n References ASSIST news Service. 2010.

The French-born JacquesVallee, a computer scientist and uFO author, was one of the few persons whoknew Hynek's secret. Hynek once told Vallee that he had become an astron - omer in order to discover \"the very lim- itations of science, the places where it broke down, the phenomena it didn't explain\" (Vallee 1996, 232). nonethe less, the scientist's public u-turn gave a big boost to the uFO movement, lending it a measure of credibility, and made Hynek into a celebrity as the nation's \"foremost expert on flying saucers\" (O'- Toole 1966). For two decades people could point to Hynek and say, \"He's a trained scientist, an astronomer no less: if even he believes in this uFO stuff then there must be something to it.\" Who was Josef Allen Hynek? He was born on Chicago's West Side on May 1, 1910, only a little over a week after Halley's Comet had swung around the sun. Hynek's Czech-born father made cigars for a living while his mother, Bertha, taught at a local gram-mar school. Josef credited his mother for his early interest in astronomy. \"When I was seven, I had scarlet fever and was quarantined with mymother in our apartment at 15th andAyers,\" Hynek explained. \"There was nothing to do except read, and since I was so young, my mother read to me. Pretty soon we ran out of children'sbooks and she started reading text- books. Among them was a high schoolastronomy book. I guess it interested me the most\" (Berland 1962). Maybe astronomy textbooks didn't give him the answers he wanted, and so,as a bookish teenager, Hynek began tostudy what he called \"esoteric subjects.\"After reading widely in the occult, hedeveloped a particular fondness for the writings of the rosicrucian secret soci- eties, with their tantalizing promises of hidden ancient knowledge, and those of the so-called hermetic philosophers, es- pecially rudolf Symbolical Philosophy: Being an of the Secret Teachings Concealed within the Rit-uals, Allegories and Mysteries of All Ages , better known simply as The Secret Teach- ings of All Ages . \"All my student friends thought I was crazy: why didn't I buy a motorcycle instead, as they all did,\" Hynek later told Jacques Vallee (Vallee 2010, of science,\" Hynek decided on acareer as an astronomer. After receiving his bachelor's degree from the uni - versity of Chicago in 1931, Hynek went on to pursue a doctorate in astron omy. He worked on his doctoral thesis\u2014\"Aquantitative Study of Cer tain Phases of F-Type Spectra\"\u2014at the Yerkes Ob- servatory, a romanesque temple of as-tronomy on the serene shores of lake Geneva in Wisconsin. \"The whole thing had a sort of mys- tical quality,\" Hynek would later at Yerkes. \"One shouldn't say that in con- nection with science, I guess, but I was so utterly absorbed in the life of the ob-servatory that I had hardly heard of Hitler\" (ridpath 1973, 423). Shortly after receiving his PhD in 1935, Hynek obtained a position as an 52Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical InquirerThe Secret Life of J. Allen Hynek According to legend, the astronomer J. Allen Hynek was a skeptic before becoming an outspoken UFOlogist, but is the legend true? This article takes a look at Hynek's unusual life and career. JOHN FRANCH It was a \"road to Damascus\" experience for the Mad Men era. In 1966, the respected astronomer J. Allen Hynek had gone\u2014seemingly overnight\u2014from a determined debunker to an ardent apostle of the uFO gospel. A long- time consultant to Project Blue Book noted for his skepti- cal stance toward uFOs, Hynek suddenly began telling anyone who would listen that the uFO phenomenon mer- ited serious scientific scrutiny. The great director Stanley kubrick was among the many who listened. In a 1968 Playboy interview promoting his science-fiction epic 2001: A Space Odyssey , kubrick spoke approvingly of what he termed Hynek's \"belated but exemplary conversion\" (Phillips 2001, 58). Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 52instructor at Ohio State university and four years later became a professor there. He wasstill teaching at Ohio State in 1948 when a trio of Air Force officials approached him: They were looking for a scientist to help them with a puzzling problem that had re- cently cropped up (ridpath 1973, 422-24). On June 24, 1947, a salesman by the name of kenneth Arnold reported seeing aformation of shiny objects pass in front ofMount rainier while he was flying his pri-vate plane. In the weeks following Arnold'salleged sighting, hundreds of persons claimed to observe similar \"flying saucers.\" Fearful that that these so-called \"saucers\" might be Soviet aircraft, u.S. Air Force of-ficials formed Project Sign early in 1948 toinvestigate the phenomenon. Hynek wasrecruited to be the project's astronomicalconsultant. In his role as Project Sign's scientific ad- visor, Hynek made periodic trips from Columbus to Wright Patterson Air Force Base (where Project Sign and its successors, Projects Grudge and Blue Book, werebased) to examine the uFO case files. Heproved to be a shrewd and relentless de-bunker, a Sherlock Holmes of sky phenom- ena. \"I'd go through them and say, 'Well, this is obviously a meteor,' or 'This is not a meteor, but I'll bet you it's a balloon,'\" herecalled in 1985. \"I was a thorough skeptic,and I'm afraid I helped to engender the idea that it must be nonsense, therefore it is nonsense\" (Weintraub 1985, 74). One of Hynek's earliest efforts at de- bunking\u2014and one of his most famous\u2014 concerned the 1948 case of Cap tain Thomas Mantell, an Air Force pilot who, while in- vestigating a uFO, died when his P-51 Mustang crashed. In his report of the inci-dent Hynek suggested that the uFO may have been Venus, even though, as he later admitted, the planet would have been too faint to be seen in the bright daylight sky (ruppelt 1956, 41-47). The astronomer had another\u2014probably correct\u2014theory on that case: the uFO Mantell observed and pur- sued too high was a Skyhook balloon (Vallee 1987, 72). Hynek at first figured flying saucer sightings were merely \"a post-war craze that would disappear as quickly as the hula- hoop\" (Hall and Connors 2000, 240). But the uFO reports kept on coming as Project Sign turned into Project Grudge in 1949Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 5354Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirerand then into Project Blue Book in 1952. During the latter year a wave ofuFO sightings prompted Hynek tobegin reconsidering his views on thesubject. He openly speculated thatuFOs might be a new kind of natural phenomenon he dubbed \"nocturnalmeandering lights\" (Swords and Powell2012, 191). The astronomer's change ofmind was so apparent that Captain ed-ward rup pelt, the first director of Proj- ect Blue Book, judged Hynek to be\"very much pro-uFO\" (Hall and Con-nors 2000, 205, 212). Hynek later attributed this shift in his thinking to two things: One was the completely negative and unyielding attitude of the Air Force. ... everything had to have an expla- nation. I began to resent that, eventhough I basically felt the same way, because I still thought they weren'tgoing about it in the right way. Sec- ondly the caliber of the witnesses began to trouble me. quite a few in- stances were reported by military pi- lots, for example, and I knew them to be fairly well trained, so this is when I first began to think that, well, maybe there was something to all this. (Stacy 1985) As early as 1960, Hynek had begun to argue behind the scenes that uFOs deserved serious scientific scrutiny. \"I need only remind you,\" he wrote to an Air Force official that year, \"that less than two centuries ago the entire province of meteorites was kept out of legitimate astronomy because stories of 'stones that fell from the sky' were re- garded as old wives tales. Had these ac- counts been given careful attention by the scientists of that day, the productivebranch of astronomy which we nowknow as meteoritics would have beenborn well over a century earlier than it was\" (Hynek 1960). Hynek would oftencite this incident from the history of as- tronomy to justify himself when helater became an outspoken uFO pro- ponent. Hynek's true views on uFOs were still unknown to the public when the as- tronomer, now teaching at north - western university, first met Jacques Vallee in the fall of 1963. Taking a job as a computer programmer at north - western, Vallee became a close friend of Hynek and soon they formed a uFOdiscussion group: The astron omer would eventually nickname this group\"the Invisible College\" (Vallee 1996, 270)\u2014a term first used by crucians in the early 1600s. Vallee beganprodding Hynek to break with the AirForce and publicly admit that the uFO phenomenon was real and worthy of se- rious scientific investigation. Project Blue Book's longtime scientific consult- ant\u2014still known as a staunch uFO de - bunker\u2014stubbornly resisted this ad vice (Vallee 1996, 80-94). Hynek had a lot to lose. He enjoyed a respectable reputation in the astro- nomical world: while he had a sizeable number of journal articles on stellar as- tronomy to his credit, he was better known for his work behind a desk thanfor his labors in front of a telescope. Hehad been a director of the McMillin Observatory in Ohio, a co-director of the Operation Moonwatch satellite tracking program, secretary of theAmerican Astronomical Society, andthe guiding force behind the Project Sky Gazer balloon astronomy program (ridpath 1973, 422-24). He under- eager to risk hisname\u2014and his career\u2014in the interestof uFOs. The astronomer was waiting, in Vallee's words, for \"the single big case that no one would be able to deny be- cause the evidence would be over- whelming\" (Vallee 1996, 96). And then, on April 24, 1964, the sin- gle big case arrived, or so it seemed. In Socorro, new Mexico, police officer lonnie Zamora was chasing a speederin his squad car when he suddenly hearda roar and noticed a flame in the sky. In- vestigating, Zamora spotted an egg-shaped, \"aluminum white\" object with legs that extended to the ground, and he noticed two white-cloaked figuresnearby. As the officer cautiously ap- proached it, the object began to bellow,and Zamora high-tailed it back toward his car. The uFO then ascended into the sky and soon disappeared from view (Hynek 1972, 144-45). Badgered by the news media, Major Hector quintanilla, Project Blue Book's director, reluctantly dispatched Hynek to Socorro to investigate the alleged sighting. At the landing site Hynek ex- amined charred plants and four impres-sions that had been left in the ground and persuaded Zamora to reenact the events (Huyghe 2001, Mexico \"more puz- zled now than I arrived,\" he confessed to a reporter, but he was convinced that Zamora had in deed seen something (Chicago Tribune 1964). 2 Hynek and Vallee frequently dis- cussed the Socorro case, but the as- tronomer was still unwilling to publicly come out as pro-uFO (Vallee 1996, 118). Things changed in the spring of 1966. On March 20 of that year, dozens of persons reported viewing glowing objects hovering over a swamp near Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the follow- ing night, eighty-seven students at Hillsdale College, also in Michigan, claimed to have seen strange red, white, and blue lights. The Michigan sightings received massive media coverage, and Major quintanilla once again sent Hynek out into the field. The professor Hynek in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 54Skeptical Inquirer | January/ February 2013 55rushed out to Michigan and conducted his investigation in an atmosphere of \"near-hysteria,\" dogged almost every step of the way by reporters and cam- eramen. After interviewing thirty-two witnesses and conferring with several university of Michigan professors, Hynek concluded that at least two of the Michigan uFOs may have been manifestations of swamp gas (Hynek 1966a, 20). On March 26, Hynek announced his findings at a packed press conference in Detroit\u2014supposedly \"the largest in the history of the Detroit Press Club\" (House of representatives 1966, 6006). After suggesting swamp gas as a likely explanation for some of the Michigan uFOs, Hynek stressed that he could not prove \"in a court of law that this is the full explanation of these sightings\" ( Los Angeles Times 1966). The media mostly ignored this qualifier and Hynek imme- diately became a national laughingstock for his swamp gas theory, lampooned in cartoons and lambasted in editorials as a puppet of the Air Force (Huyghe 2001, 9-10). Hynek's swamp gas theory also at- tracted the notice\u2014and the ire\u2014of Gerald Ford, the powerful republican congressman from Michigan and fu- ture president. In response, Ford promptly requested the u.S. House Armed Services Committee to investi- gate the uFO phenomenon, believing that \"the American public deserves a better explanation than that thus fargiven by the Air Force\"\u2014meaning the explanation given by Hynek (House of representatives 1966, 6047). The wishof the House minority leader was equivalent to a command and so the uFO hearing took place only one week after Ford had made his request. On April 5, 1966, Hynek made his first public break with the Air Force, boldly using the occasion of his testi- mony before the Armed Services Com - mittee to do so. Stung by the \"swamp gas\" criticism, the astronomer apparently wanted to show that he wasn't the Air Force's or anyone else's puppet. In a statement not cleared by Major quin - tanilla, the Project Blue Book director, Hynek told the sitting congressmenthat there were aspects of the uFO phe- nomenon \"worthy of scientific atten- tion,\" and he called for the creation of a panel of physical and social scientists toseriously analyze what he termed the\"uFO problem\" (House of representa- tives 1966, 6007-6008). \"The swamp gas episode boom - eranged like hell on me and the Air Force,\" Hynek later explained hisabout-face. \"I began to feel guilty aboutmy skeptical attitude. And once youopen the gates to the possibility that allthese people can't possibly be mistaken, then you see a lot of other cases in a to-tally different light\" (Huyghe 2001, 33). As we have seen, Hynek's \"skeptical at- titude\" was in fact a fa\u00e9ade for public consumption. A longtime student of the occult, he happened to be very open to outr\u00e9 notions: he, for example, be-lieved that there were planes of exis- tence beyond the physical, and he even endorsed alleged instances of \"psychicsurgery\" and \"psychic photography\"(Vallee 1996, 240, 306). But it took the media furor over the \"swamp gasepisode\" for an angry and embarrassedHynek to publicly air his long-heldviews on uFOs. It was a risky move for Hynek but not as risky as it would have been a few short years before. Since then his astronomicalcareer had stalled in a big way. 3In 1957, Hynek launched in collaboration withthe Air Force a program for balloon- based astronomy\u2014later named Project Star Gazer. The plan was to send tele-scope-equipped balloons high above the image-distorting lower layers of the at-mosphere. un fortunately, a series offailed test launches prompted the Air Force to scrap Project Star Gazer in1963. The decision was devastating for Hynek, who seems to have bet his pro- fessional career on the success of theproject. In a scathing final report to the Air Force the astronomer didn't holdback. \"In any event,\" he wrote, \"the set- ting aside of a project which had engaged so many for such a length of time, at atime when success seemed assured, canonly be listed in the scientific annals as a criminal act, and one carried out in a cal- lous, cavalier manner without regard for the desires, objectives and ideals of thepeople involved\" (Hynek 1966b). Was Hynek's emergence into the open as a pro-uFO crusader partly an at tempt,whether subconscious or not, to get back at the Air Force for torpedoing Project Star Gazer? As Hynek had recommended during his congressional testimony, the Air Force soon funded a scientific study ofuFOs and the renowned physicist ed- ward u. Condon, of the university of Colorado, was chosen to direct it. Afterthree contentious years, the Condon Com mittee concluded in 1969 that \"further extensive study of uFOs prob- ably cannot be justified in the expecta- tion that science will be ad vancedthereby\" (Hynek 1972, 192-93). Hynek predictably dismissed the committee's report, calling it \"a waste of time\" (ko-tulak 1969), but the Air Force went ahead anyway and closed Project BlueBook later that year. The professor was now on his own as a uFO investigator. Back in 1966, Hynek had chosen the biggest megaphone he could find toannounce his new career as a uFO ad-vocate: He sent a bombshell letter to the prestigious and widely read journal Science in which he argued that uFOs merited scientific investigation. The Science editors grudgingly published the letter but only after the astronomer had leaked its contents to the Chicago Sun- Times (Vallee 1996, 222). Hynek sub- sequently wrote articles on uFOs forHynek had chosen the biggest megaphone he could find to announce his new career as a UFO advocate: He sent a bombshell letter to the prestigious and widely read journal Sciencein which he argued that UFOs merited scientific investigation.Jan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 5556Volume 37 Issue 1 | Skeptical Inquirersuch national publications as The Sat- urday Evening Post , The New Yorker , and even Playboy, and he became a ubiqui- tous presence on television and radio shows. \"Media men hire Allen as they would hire a guitar player,\" JacquesVallee wrote in his journal. \"He rushes wherever he sees a spotlight, and if thespotlight moves, he moves with it\"(Vallee 1996, 259). Hynek's fame came at a great cost: he lost the respect of his peers in the scientific community. \"His colleagues' attitude towards him is changing to thepoint of contempt, and this pains him,\" Vallee noted in 1968. \"He is no longer taken seriously among astronomers\"(Vallee 1996, 339). Determined to prove his colleagues wrong, Hynek began working on a bookthat he said would take a scientific ap-proach to the study of uFOs. Pub lishedin 1972, The uFO Experi ence: A Scientific Inquiry argues for the reality of the uFO phenomenon in a dry, matter-of-factmanner. The book is most noteworthyfor its classification of certain uFO re-ports into Close en counters of the Firstkind (sightings), the Second kind(sightings with physical effects), and theThird kind (sightings of uFO occu-pants) (Hynek 1972, 86). unfortunately for Hynek, The uFO Experience did further damage to his academic standing. According to an as- tronomer friend of Vallee, Hynek's book \"created antagonism among the(northwestern) Faculty and made hima controversial figure. In spite of a fairreview in Science Magazine, many pro- fessors have felt that the reputation ofthe school was tainted\" (Vallee 2010,156). Indeed, speaking for his faculty colleagues in 1982, the dean of north - western's College of Arts and Sci ences categorically declared to a university official: \"We are not, have not been, and will not be proud of Hynek's uFO af- fairs. There are many who think that what he's up to has nothing to do with research\" (Wein gart ner 1982). Hynek may have genuinely wanted to restore his scientific standing, but his behavior during the 1970s certainly didn't help matters. The bespectacled, goateed astronomer was a familiar sightto television viewers of the era, pontif- icating on the \"uFO problem\" on pro- grams ranging from The Dick Cavett Show to In Search Of. late in 1973, he endorsed the alien abduction claims of two Pascagoula, Mississippi, shipyard workers, saying the men had \"a very real experience\" ( Los Angeles Times 1973). He joined a uFO panel formed by theNational Enquirer : $50,000 was to be awarded to \"the first person to prove to the panel that uFOs are from outer space and are not natural phenomena\" (Dick 1972). near the end of thedecade Hynek even made an eight-sec- ond cameo appearance in Steven Spiel- berg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Huyghe 2001, 32). He was also a pop- ular figure on the lucrative college lec-ture circuit. He later boasted to a friend \"that each one of my lectures brings me more than my monthly pay fromnorthwestern\" (Hynek 1978). Hynek's extracurricular activities did not endear him to the northwesternuniversity administration. In the fall of1973, following a wave of alleged sight- ings, the astronomer formed the Center for uFO Studies to serve as a clearing-house for uFO reports. He hoped that the Center could be located on thenorth western campus, but university of- ficials adamantly rejected this idea. School administrators insisted that there be no connection whatsoever between northwestern and the uFO center; Hynek was not even allowed to use his northwestern mailing address for any Center-related correspondence. eventu-ally protesting, the professor fired off aseries of angry letters. \"Frankly, I amquite embarrassed to have to say that theuniversity has been so conservative as to not see the potential here, both for sci- ence and for publicity,\" he raged in one letter. \"And, of course, I personally resent the implication that the subject is sheer nonsense and that anyone connectedwith it is a crackpot (speaking bluntly!)\" (Hynek 1974). After he retired from northwestern in 1978, Hynek devoted much of his time to the Center for uFO Studies. De- spite having a good track record as a fundraiser\u2014he had obtained money from private donors for northwestern'slindheimer Astronomical research Cen ter\u2014Hynek struggled to put his uFO center on a secure financial footing:Wealthy would-be benefactors fre- quently tantalized him with offers of monetary support only to let him down in the end. Finally in 1984, Hynek packed up his research files and relocated his uFO center to Scottsdale, Arizona, having been lured there by a rich eng-lishman with promises of money and the use of his \"quite luxurious\" home (Witt 1984). Once again the astronomer was doomed to disappointment: this partic- ular patron \"was only interested in keep- ing a few scientists in his entourage topromote his personal theories about the (uFO) phenomenon,\" Jacques Valleemaintained (Vallee 1996, 423). Hynek was often evasive when asked to give his own theories on the nature ofuFOs. Despite his cameo in 1977's Close Encounters of the Third Kind , he had by then rejected the notion that uFOs were \"nuts and bolts\" spacecraft piloted by ex- traterrestrials (Gardner 1997, 247). His occult studies had pointed him in a very different direction. As early as 1967, he speculated that uFOs might be \"obser- vational devices that are materialized into our world by the denizens of an-other\" (Vallee 1996, 306). He later of- fered a variation on this theory: uFOs as \"psychic projections\" created by an \"extradimensional intelligence in someparallel reality\" (Gardner 1997, 253). Speaking to the uFOlogist Jerome Clark, Hynek was more specific. The as- tronomer allegedly told Clark that he believed \"elementals\"\u2014nature spirits\u2014 were behind the uFO phenomenon (Clark 1998). It is easy to question the veracity of Clark's startling claim, but it makes sense when one realizes that Hynek was strongly influenced by rudolf Steiner,the Austrian mystic. Steiner argued that the hard sciences merely offer human - kind \"a vast amount of popular informa- tion.\" By employing sense-free thinking,the enlightened individual, on the other hand, could \"pierce the veil\" and discover what lay behind the material world re-vealed by science. In Steiner's view, ele- mentals\u2014spirits of air, earth, water, andthe ether\u2014dwelled in this hidden realmJan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 56Skeptical Inquirer | January/ February 2013 57inaccessible to the senses. If Hynek did indeed believe that uFOs were naturespirits, he may have specifically identi- fied them with this last class of elemen- tal\u2014the \"beings of the higher elements.\" Steiner claimed that \"what exists in the sky is not merely the phys- ical sun, but that with the sun's warmth and light etheric beings stream down to earth\" 1922). Did Hynek that uFOs were Steiner's \"ethericbeings\" streaming down to earth? For those very few who knew of Hynek's fascination with the occult, his 1975 piece on Johannes kepler\u2014the great seventeenth-century astrono - mer\u2014in the journal Vistas in Astronomy had an extra meaning. In this eye-open- ing, one-page article Hynek argued that science historians are wrong to dismisskepler's practice of astrology as merelysomething he did to keep alive. \"Bothhis [kepler's] astrology and astronomygrew out of and partook in large meas-ure of his deep mystical outlook,\" Hynek (1975) wrote. He went on to as- sert that modern astronomy, with its ex-otic concepts like quasars, pulsars, andblack holes, offered \"a broad and kepler's brand ofmetaphysics, both systems of thought being \"the repository of funda- mental questions not entertained on the present playing field of physical sci-ence\" (Hynek 1975, 455). Hynek ap- parently saw kepler as a kindred spirit,and, in this article, he was defendingnot only kepler's beliefs but his own. \"I have never stopped thinking about what must lie beyond all this,\" Hynek once remarked to Vallee in Colorado as he sweepingly gestured toward the rockies and the Great Plains (Vallee 1996, 232). For the professor, uFOs rep- resented the \"beyond,\" that point where science could not reach. Having become an astronomer in order to discover the limits of science, Hynek wanted, maybe even needed, to believe in uFOs. It was a case of wishful thinking. Hynek died of a brain tumor at Me- morial Hospital in Scottsdale, Ari zona, on April 27, 1986 (Folkart 1986). Hal-ley's Comet was then making its return appearance after a seventy-six-year jour- ney through the solar system. like Mark Twain, Josef Allen Hynek came into the world with the great comet, and he went out with it as well. n Notes 1. rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) was an Aus- trian-born mystic who propagated a belief known as anthroposophy or spiritual science. According to robert McDermott, the purpose of anthropos- ophy was \"to bring to humanity an entirely new capability\u2014knowledge of the spiritual world by conscious sense-free thinking\" (McDermott 1984, 3). In his classic Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, Martin Gardner called Steiner's Anthroposophical Society \"the fastest growing cult in post-war Germany\" (Gardner 1957, 169). 2. In a recently unearthed 1968 letter, the then-president of the new Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology indicated to the chemist linus Pauling that the Zamora episode was in fact a hoax perpetrated by a student (Sheaffer 2010, 25). 3. According to the SAO/nASA Astro - physics Data System, out of the over 100 astro- nomical publications Hynek had to his credit,only about a dozen appeared after 1966. nearly one-half of these dozen articles related to Image Orthicon\u2014a ground-breaking system using tel- evision technology to boost the light grasp of tel- escopes that Hynek helped develop in the 1950s and 1960s (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observ -atory/national Aeronautics and Space Admin - istration, n.d.).

Broad application of this lineof argument has proven effective inshielding even the most implausible re-covered memory narratives\u2014suppos- edly brought to consciousness during the course of reintegrating the multiplemind\u2014from scrutiny. Judy Byington, former therapist and author of Twenty-Two Faces , the suppos- edly true story of an MPD-diagnosedsurvivor of satanic cult abuse, preemp-tively strikes at skeptics in her epilogue. \"Some contend that Satanic ritual Abuse [SrA], dissociation [MPD], and repressed memories are false, or don't exist,\" she writes. How ever, having \"in- terviewed hundreds of SrA survivors, therapists, and police investigators,\" as well as having re viewed \"dozens of suc- cessfully litigated cases that have sa- tanic overtones,\" Byington warns that she \"would seriously question why one would defend such a stance\" (417). To be sure, this is where the battle lines are drawn. To express doubts regarding By- ington's claims of a satanic cult conspir-acy will doubtlessly be interpreted\u2014for her convenience\u2014as an assault not only upon dissociation and repressed mem- ories but as a heartless assault upon vic-tims of child abuse in general. After all,if traumas may be repressed and recov-ered memories are true, then recovery of any narrative, no matter how bizarre,is evidence of its own veracity. It is, of course, worth pointing out that \"recovered memories\" are the stuffof past life regression, and that recov- ered memories form the evidentiary basis of \"abductology,\" the study ofearthly kidnappings perpetrated by ex- traterrestrial beings. A voice of authority further warns that disbelief in the Twenty-Two Faces narrative is at best naive. Joyanna Sil- berg, president of the International So-ciety for the Study of Trauma & Dis -sociation (ISSTD)\u2014an organizationfor professionals studying dissociative disorders\u2014assures readers in a blurbendorsing the book that she and herpeers \"are all too familiar with the kindsof crimes and disorders described in Twenty-Two Faces.\"However, an honest appraisal of Twenty-Two Faces must acknowledge that it is, undeniably, a supernatural tale.The protagonist, Jenny Hill, is born under the auspice of a prophecy, pre- destined to \"do important things on this earth\" (402). early abuse endowsher not only with a convoluted family tree of alternate (\"alter\") personalities\u2014 some of which sever into further altersof their own\u2014but with extrasensory perception (eSP) as well. Her abuse is overseen by a cartoon- like villain, Dr. Greenbaum, who man- ages to fulfill nearly all conspiracy the- ory stereotypes by being not onlyJewish but a Jewish Nazi and a Satanist brought to the united States under the sponsorship of the CIA. Greenbaum and his two bumbling teenage henchmen (upon whom the evil doctor liberally applies beatings with his gnarled cane) are like most B- grade villains in that they discuss muchof their devious plans while in the act, with Hill remembering every word . .. including full sentences spoken back-ward (in Satan-ese, if you will).

As it happens, insistence that tyrannosaurs and ziphodont theropods were herbivores is not necessary for the creationist doc- trine of original herbivory. For all his powerful alliances, Green- baum is still careful to ensure that Hill re- turns home\u2014brainwashed of course\u2014from her demon-appeasing torturesessions on time to finish her chores andenjoy supper, so as not to raise the ire ofher parents. However, a senseless twist inthe plot comes when we learn that herparents were in on the whole thing all along. (Further narrative incoherence oc-curs when Hill, after recovering \"memo-ries\" of her father sexually abusing her andaccusing him of such, is nonetheless dis-traught at not being invited over for thefamily Christmas.) The climax of the story comes early in its pages when Hill is spared, by way of divine intervention, from being executed during a ceremonial sacrifice. A barefoot \"white-robed male personage, surrounded in a glorious White light\" (393) appears hovering above the altar-bound toddler, sending the Satanic scofflaws scattering in fear. Hill, a devout Mormon, is exonerated from every misdeed she's committed\u2014years of prostitution and drug abuse\u2014onthe grounds that impious alters were act- ing without Hill's conscious knowledge.But if this sounds a bit much like spirit possession, Byington is clear that the phe-AMONG THE CREATIONISTS: Dispatches from the Anti-Evolu- tionist Front Line.

Some who are familiar with the Satan ism scare of the 1980s and '90s,may recognize shades of the early \"Sa-tanic Panic\" classics Michelle Remem bers by lawrence Pazder and Michelle Smith(1980) and Satan's underground by lau- ren Stratford (1988).

Journalists, inves-tigating the claims in each, ultimately de- bunked even the more mundane ele- ments of the stories, with Satan's under ground being discredited to the point of being withdrawn from publica-tion. Disgraced (yet shame less) Stratford changed her name and was found yearslater, still posing as a victim of abuse, this time as a Holocaust survivor. either unaware of or unconcerned with these facts, Byington lists both books in the Twenty-Two Faces bibliog- raphy, openly crediting Michelle Re mem - berswith bringing the satanic cult epi- demic into the public awareness. The references to spirit possession and eSP in Twenty-Two Faces are espe- cially interesting given that the book contains a forward by Colin ross, MD, famed dissociation expert, past president of the ISSTD, and lead author of the Dissociative Disorders Interview Sched- ule (DDIS), a survey that measures dis- sociative tendencies. A section of the DDIS questions interviewees regarding their experiences with paranormal phe-nomena, including possession and eSP . As a psychiatrist, ross should be con- cerned about the perception of paranor- mal happenings. However, his endorse- ment of Twenty-Two Faces suggests a belief in their reality. (ross, in fact, is a known conspiracy theorist twice sued for malpractice related to instilling clients with false memories of satanic abuse). Silberberg, ross, and Byington are by no means unique.

Whitley Strie - ber, author of numerous best- selling books of fiction, horror, and some that defy categorization, spinsa few more yarns as he re-hashes somefamiliar old ones. In his best-selling books Communion (1987) and Transfor - mation (1988), Strieber claims to have experienced inexplicable en counters\u2014including an infamous one involving ananal not to know who\u2014or what\u2014the visitors really are. His latest book,Solving the Communion Enigma: What Isto Come , picks up where these other tales leave off in an effort to provide a solu- tion to their unbelievable, though famil-iar, otherworldly mysteries. It is notthose who've experienced such encoun-ters who are delusional, says Strieber\u2014it's those who deny the truth of them. So if you doubt that Strieber was stalked innew Y ork and Texas by \"a sinister chain-smoking dwarf \" who was apparently able to climb walls but could not bephoto graphed, you are probably delu-sional. Strieber's attempt to bolster his mes- sage with the help of prestigious intel- lectuals and authors separates Solving the Communion Enigma from the au- thor's previous Whitley-isms. Jeffrey J. kripal, Chair of religious Studies at rice university, writes in his foreword to the book that Strieber understands that \"we sit on an intellectual precipice, that a 'new world' is just over the hori- zon, that science and its clunky methods are not going to get us there. ... Only the future can finally read a great book like Communion .\" Someone of kripal's credentials should know better than to write something like that. Strieber alsocalls upon the uFO writings of authors such as leslie kean, Jacques Vallee, John Mack, Paul Hill, and kenneth ring\u2014the latter two of whom provide a suitablyesoteric and obscure complement to Strieber's own homespun wisdom. But take away the pretension and the same old Whitley emerges from this book, describing his latest hair-raising scrapes with the paranormal. One rainy night, Strieber awoke to find himself ex- periencing \"the consciousness of a num- ber of different Whitleys\" who exist, ap- parently, \"in different parallel universes.\" Another night, he awoke and \"found myself to be invisible. I had no body. ... A cold uneasiness went through me. Where was my body?\" Fortunately, helocated his missing body nearby. At breakfast the next morning, his son andthe son's friend chirped about how \"Whitley came down through the ceil- ing last night!\" Perhaps the most extraordinary claim in the entire book, though, is Strieber's repeated claim of poverty. He laments that in the early 1990s he ranout of money and could no longer af-ford either his upstate new York cabinor his new York City apartment: \"InAugust of 1994, we ceased to be able to pay our mortgage.\" He moved his fam- ily to the small, modest condominiumREVIEWS] Pretentious Whit ROBERT SHEAFFER Solving the Communion Enigma: What Is to Come.

So, what solutions to \"the Com - munion enigma\" does the book offer? Sadly, none\u2014although Strieber does suggest that \"one thing our visitors are doing is creating situations that are de-signed to increase our left-brain func-tioning.\" He views this as a hopeful con-clusion since \"nobody who is trying to improve our brain function is interested in our death.\" In fact, Strieber \"began to see, more and more, that the dead were involved with our supposed alien visi- tors, and through them with us. ... I have seen the joy of the dead, but I have also seen their suffering.\" (See my review of Strieber's earlier book The Key , \"He Sees Dead People,\" SI, July/August 2011). Toward the end of the book hewarns, \"Mankind is going to die, one way or another, to the world that we know now. But, at the same time,mankind is going to be born\u2014literally born again.\" According to the website for his book Hybrids , the Striebers now have residences in new York, Texas, and Cal- ifornia\u2014which means, I'm sure, that the visitors will provide Whitley Strieber with many more profitable adventures before he ever solves his \"enigma.\" n Robert Sheaffer has tracked and exposed UFO claims for decades. His most recent book is Psy- chic Vibrations (Create Space, 2011), based on his long-running S KEPTICALINQUIRERcolumn. Science Journalist Leon Jaroff, Eighty-Five leon Jaroff, a noted science journalist and strong defender of science and rational- ism, died October 20, 2012 (earlier in the same day Paul kurtz died), at the age ofeighty-five. He was an original founding fellow of CSICOP , now the Committee for Skept ical Inquiry. Jaroff was the science editor at Time magazine who famously convinced his bosses to start a dedicated science mag- azine, Discover , of which he was the ini-tial managing editor. He was that rare science journalist who understood the need to take on pseudoscience directly. He wrote a column for Time called \"The Skeptical eye.\" As editor of Dis- cover he also made sure his magazine took on the pseudosciences of the day, such as uFOs, eSP , creationism, and al- ternative medicine. He apparently left Discover to return to Time magazine over conflicts regard- ing the expansion of Discover to cover psychology and psychiatry, of which Jaroff was skeptical. Jaroff was also rare (although not unique, certainly) in recognizing science denialism, such as the anti-vaccinemovement, for what it was. He wrote in a Time column in 2000: Still, facts do not deter quacks or fa- natics and the parents they dupe. School boards across the country this fall were again pressured to admit un- vaccinated students. That would be a disservice not only to these kids, who would be vulnerable to a host of dis- eases, but to their classmates whose shots didn't take or who were excusedfrom vaccinations for medical or re- ligious reasons. About chiropractors, he wrote in Time in 2002: Chiropractors also employ a bewilder- ing variety of weird practices to diag- nose their patients. Some use applied kinesiology, a muscle test that suppos- edly can diagnose allergies and dis-eased organs. Hair analysis and iris readings are commonplace in the pro- fession. even sillier are many of the treatments that chiropractors use and recommend: homeopathic potions, colon irrigation, magnetic therapy, en-zyme pills, colored-light therapy, and something called \"balancing body en- ergy,\" among other mystical proce-dures with undocumented effects. Who, now, at Time magazine will have the fortitude to call out \"quacks\" and label alternative medicine practices as \"weird\" and \"silly\"? \u2014Steven Novella Steven Novella writes the column for the S KEPTICALINQUIRER. [OBITUARYJan Feb 13 2_SI new design masters 11/29/12 11:26 AM Page 62Skeptical Inquirer | January/ February 2013 63INBOX] Art & Skepticism The expansion of the S kePTI - CAl InquIrer in the Septem- ber/October 2012 issue into art as a new area of inquiry was most interesting. The article bySamuel Mcnerney, \"Confirma- tion Bias and Art,\" was very thought provoking. He notes that \"confirmation bias influ- ences our aesthetic judgmentsjust as it does any other judg- ment.\" But he goes on to note that \"although there are plenty of conventionalists who made great art by reinforcing precon- ceptions. ... Art doesn't have platonic standard; good art isform-breaking.\" It seems, how- ever, that modern art has be- come so preoccupied with form- breaking that all standards havebeen cast aside and it has be- come like \"playing tennis with the net down.\" Skeptics interested in mod- ern art might find interesting two books on the subject that take their titles from MarcelDuchamp's attack on traditional art by drawing a mustache and beard on a copy of the iconic Mona lisa. Terence Harold robsjohn-Gibbings published in 1947 Mona Lisa's Mustache , in which he views the pioneers of modern art very critically, notingthat many of them were believers in psychic phenomena. In 2001,Mary Settegast published Mona Lisa's Moustache (note difference in spelling: mustache vs. mous- tache), which presents the early modern artists as pioneers of anew Age worldview. These two books certainly reflect contrast- ing confirmation biases and may interest skeptics interested in art, although the former is probablymore in tune with a skeptical outlook. let us hope that the S keP- TICAl InquIrer continues to expand its areas of inquiry withspecial issues and might seekreaders' suggestions of areas to investigate. David W. Briggs, PhDMarion, MassachusettsPsychics on Drs. Phil and Oz Bryan Farha's interesting short article \"Dear Dr. Phil\" (news and Comment, SI, Septem- ber/October 2012) coincided with an episode of the Dr. Oz show broadcast August 20, fea- turing \"medium\" Theresa Ca- puto. \"Dr. Bryan's\" review had criticized Dr. Phil because that show had four allegedly psychic guests but only one skeptic. Dr. Oz's show with Caputo was even worse. There were no skeptics. Dr. Oz did tell Caputo that skeptics claim mediums use a technique called \"cold reading.\" Caputo had the au- dacity to say, \"I don't know what that is.\" Interestingly, there were peo- ple seated right on the stage, and all but one of Caputo's readings involved these specially seated audience members. As Bryan Farha pointed out in his Dr. Phil article, one wonders how her subjects were selected. Did they fill out questionnaires be- fore the show? Were they special guests of Caputo's staff? Overall Caputo's performance was good. Of course, not being privy to the inside details of where her se- lected subjects came from and how much information they re-vealed before the show, I can reasonably conclude that Ca- puto is an entertainer with onlyfive senses. It is astounding that people can't imagine all the ways she could be cheating! Caputo is becoming another Sylvia Browne, and that is the last thing grieving people need! Ann Gresko Colorado Springs, Col-orado Yearnings for UFO Visitors uFO articles in recent SI issues remind me of queries that in- variably arise when I lecture on the search for life in the uni- verse. While most people are genuinely interested in the sci-entific aspects of the topic and in SeTI there is always that lin- gering \"Yes, but what about uFOs?\" question. Folks accept that most reports stem from unreliable witnesses, fuzzy pho- tographs, mis identified aircraft, outright hoaxes, natural phe- nomena, and other mundane explanations, but still ask \"Okay, you can explain away 95 percent of uFO reports, but what about the rest?\" That's tougher to handle as I have just told them that science is open- minded, does not deal in ab- solutes, encourages theorizing, etc. Since lay people don't usu-ally appreciate how science op- erates, they often suspect some- thing is being \"hidden\" in that last 5 percent. Amateur astronomers are most skeptical of uFOs because they know the sky, have some scientific and technical under- standing, and appreciate unusual astronomical phenomena. The attitudes of college students and the general public, however, varyconsiderably depending on their backgrounds. While most indi- viduals accept rational uFO ex- planations, many do so only re- luctantly. I attribute that to disappointment that titillating claims of alien visitations are un- true and to a universal hope that some higher intelligence is out there to welcome us. This can take on quasi-religious longings as demonstrated by the Heaven's Gate cult. After my most recent pres- entation, followed by many ex- cellent questions, an elegant, ar- ticulate lady stood up declaring, \"You have completely ignored the overwhelming evidence that aliens have been here and inter-bred with humans since the roswell incident in 1947. Oh,but you are probably a govern- ment scientist and were told to keep this from the public.\" klaus r.

The film was aired in Canada on national televi- sion in 1991 with much bally-hoo. I lived in Ottawa at the time, not far from Carp. A week or so after the program aired, a small article appeared in the Ot- tawa paper in which a hot-air balloon pilot re ported that hisflight log indicated that he had made a night landing at the time and place of the supposed uFO sighting, after dropping flares to light up the ground. He saw no flying saucer and no aliens. r. Osczevskinewmarket, OntarioCanada Empirical Evidence ronald A. lindsay's review of Chris Mooney's The Republican Brain (SI, Sep tember/October 2012) is dutifully skeptical, but I'm gratified that he also cor- rectly considers the book to be \"important and provocative\" and \"meaty and rewarding,\" for I believe it to be all those things,as well as factually accurate(though we don't have \"hard numbers\" to prove it). It should be remarked that Mooney cannot \"explain\" whythe republican Brain exists be- cause we do not yet understand enough about how the brain works. How ever, I suspect (un- supported by hard numbers)that a lot of what we call per- sonality\u2014our beliefs about the difference be tween right and wrong, the capacity for compas- sion, or selfishness and indiffer-ence to the pain and discomfort of others\u2014is hard-wired into our DnA. Mooney is not trying to ex- plain it; he's trying to show the empirical evidence that cer- tainly implies that it does exist, and I believe the evidence is compelling. Fifty years ago in new York, at a party down the hall from my apartment at which I wasthe only white person, having labored in vain to convince ayoung man that not everyonefrom South Carolina is a bigot, I was told by an older man who was a professor at City College that \"education is clearly the an- swer,\" to which I respectfullyreplied that you cannot teach a bigot to stop being a bigot. You cannot educate a hate-monger- ing nitwit (pardon the pejora- tive, I got carried away) to think differently. I didn't know whythen, and I still don't know why, but I believe it to be true, and everything I've seen abouthuman behavior corroborates it. (Still, we need those hard numbers, don't we, to make lindsay happy.)

John Sack Del Mar, California Who Has Lost Trust? In his special report \"Why the GOP Distrusts Science\" (SI, July/August 2012) Chris Mooney cites the decline in trust for the scientific community as evidence that conservatives are more rigid and closed-minded than they were in 1974. I can't find where he ad- dresses the possibility that it was the scientific community that changed over this time and be- came less trustworthy in theview of conservatives. All that would require is that they be seen as becoming more politically active and more liberal. Both are true. This cre- ates at least the appearance of a conflict of interest and an in- creased incentive to do bad sci- ence or even outright lie to ad- vance their political agenda. This is precisely what happenedin the debate on gun control during that time. Fool meonce. ... But it's worse than that. Many scientists today want thepower to regulate. Some even want to be the food police. Forty years ago the question was, \"Do you trust the scientists who sent men to the moon andbrought them safely back?\" Yes. now the question is, \"Do you trust the scientists whothink they are superior to youand have a divine right to take away all your freedom (for your own good) and forcibly micro- manage every aspect of yourlife?\" no. I would have given the same answer forty years ago. I'm not the one who changed. Paul kelly Delta, Colorado I have noticed a disturbing trend in this publication of politicizing skepticism.

William robinsonJacksonville, Florida Crossing the Line One of the things I've always enjoyed about S kePTICAl In- quIrer is the varied points of view. However, kenneth W. krause's latest column (\"Saving us from Sweets: This Is Sci- ence and Govern ment onSugar,\" SI, September/October 2012) threatens to cross the line into cartoonish attack. He crit- icizes a Nature paper by three public health advocates at- tempting to regulate sugar byusing ad hominem attacks. First, Dr. lustig, MD, is never acknowledged to be what he in fact is, a medical doctor. This may be because Mr. krause is neither a doctor nor a scientist and so would lose any credential fight. lowering the bar further, he then refers to the authors ofthis paper repeatedly as \"The San Franciscans.\" I'm inferring that he's invoking the stereotype that everyone in that city of over three quarters of a million peo-ple are liberal and therefore theyall support more regulation on everything\u2014a ridiculous idea,which is why it's a stereotype. liam McDaidAstronomy Coordinator & Professor of Astronomy Sacramento City CollegeSacramento, CaliforniaWorth Ignoring I am grateful for kenneth krause's response (letters, SI, September/October 2012) to the feminist critique offered by Jen nichols. There are so many writ- ers out there who offer thought- ful points of view; so it is good to know which ones I can safely ig- nore. krause has joined that list, as he has presented himself as one who can't handle criticism, makes up his facts as he goes along, and seems to belong to a long-forgotten century. To wit: \"When I was a young man [looking for work],\" says krause, \"a safe clerical position would have been preferred ... to a back-breaking construc- tion [job]. ... Clerical jobs often paid more.\" What planet, Mr. krause, did you grow up on? Clerical jobs paid more than construction jobs, and young men would have preferred them? Please! Then, \"neither men nor women have to endure the hard- ship of pregnancy and child- birth. reproduction is a choice.\" Such an observation is so conde- scending and ad hominem that it is nauseating. It is almost embar- rassing to point out that, when the choice is positive, it is the woman who bears the child. Finally is his insistence that \"there is no such thing as 'the same work' . . . [because] factors other than discrimination are likely at play.\" If you, Mr. krause, are going to take a broadside shot at such a basic assertion of femi- nism, you need to do a whole lot better than claim that \"other fac- tors are likely at play.\" remember, you are writing in a magazine that prides itself on being scien-tific. If there were a continuum between science on one handand myth, prejudice, or male chauvinistic piggery on the other, that comment of yours is so far on the non-science side that you probably need to be writing for some other publication. James J. PhillipsBerkley, MichiganNew Claim about Acupuncture Vickers et al. have just pub- lished a major meta-analysis of acupuncture for chronic pain that concludes an effect beyond the placebo. This study, the most extensive of its kind ever, examined twenty-nine \"high quality randomized controlled trials\" from an initial pool ofnearly 18,000 patients. \"High quality\" acupuncture placebo controls incorporated sham acupuncture in which needles were inserted superficially, at non-acupuncture points, or non-needle stimuli (electrical, laser, mechanical) de signed to mimic the feel of inserted nee- dles. A small but significant ef- fect size emerged for acupunc- ture, even when compared with controls. let me caution that even the best acu puncture studies typically fail to institute true double-blind controls, one in which neither the presenter northe patient know which treat- ment is real or placebo. Some studies use \"trained\" acupunc- ture specialists to apply needles, destroying the ignorance of pre- senter to the treatment being presented. under these condi- tions, patients might detect from subtle presenter cues if they are receiving the real thing. Second, true acupuncture in- volves significant needle inser- tion, generally from .25 inches to more than an inch. I find it dif- ficult to accept that a patient (even blindfolded) cannot detect the difference between a one- inch insertion from a sham nee- dle-like thump. If someone jabbed me with a one-inch nee- dle, my cognitive and affective response would be considerable,possibly obliterating any head - ache I might have. until adequate double-blind controls are instituted in acu - puncture research, we must conclude that either acupunc- ture is a placebo, or that signif- icant non-acupuncture needle insertion has some effect be -yond suggestion. If non-acu - puncture needle insertion has some effect, then researcherswould have to compare it with other forms of pain and torture, such as pinching, burning, freez ing, spanking, and water boarding.
