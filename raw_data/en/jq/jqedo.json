Although various elementswill all play crucial parts in achieving this goal, from diagnosis and case management to integrated surveillance and outbreak response, sustainable vector control, vaccine implementation and nally oper- ational and implementation research, it seems clear that new tools (e.g. a safe and effective vaccine and/or effective vector control) are key to success. The rst dengue vaccine was licensed in December 2015,Dengvaxia /C210(CYD-TDV) developed by Sano Pasteur. The WHO has provided guidance on the use of CYD- TDV in endemic countries, for which there are a variety of considerations beyond the risk-benet eval- uation done by regulatory authorities, including public health impact and cost-effectiveness. Population-level vaccine impact and economic and nancial aspects are two issues that can potentially be considered by means of mathematical modelling, especially for new products for which empirical data are still lack- ing. In December 2014 a meeting was convened by the WHO in order to revisit the current status of den-gue transmission models and their utility for public health decision-making. Here, we report on the main points of discussion and the conclusions of this meeting, as well as next steps for maximising the use of mathematical models for vaccine decision-making. 1. Background Over the last few decades dengue has become the most impor- tant and wide-spread, vector-borne viral infection affecting humans [1,2] . The geographic expansion of dengue's two mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus , together with ongoing globalisation and urbanisation have resulted in more frequent and bigger epidemic outbreaks as well as endemic establishment of dengue in previously unaffected areas. Infection with one of dengue's four antigenically related sero- types (DENV1-4) can result in a systemic viral illness, with symp- toms lasting for around 2-7 days. Infection with one serotype is assumed to provide life-long, homotypic immunity but might leave the individual more vulnerable to develop clinically severe out-comes upon secondary, heterotypic infection [3-5] . The common- est severe outcome is hypovolemic shock, called (Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)) and is precipitated by a vascular leakage syn- drome that manifests between days 4-7 of illness. Treatment of dengue is limited to supportive care and when done carefully can decrease mortality to <0.5% of hospitalised cases. In the absence of effective vaccines, current control efforts against DENV transmission are targeted against the mosquito vectors, either through direct measures (e.g. application of insecticides) or through the limitation of vector breeding habitat (e.g. environmental management). Although vector control efforts can show reductions in entomological indicators, there is a limited evidence base to demonstrate effectiveness against dengue disease of any of these public health interventions [6]. There is clear consensus that new tools are needed to prevent and control dengue, including the development of a safe and efcacious vaccine to control dengue. The most advanced vaccine candidate to date is Sano Pasteur's recombinant live attenuated tetravalent http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.06.082Corresponding author at: Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia.

Simmons).Vaccine 34 journal homepage: www.else vier.com/locate/vaccine dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV), which has been evaluated in Phase III clinical efcacy trials across various endemic countries in Asia and Latin America [7,8] . The vaccine has recently obtained licen- sure in Mexico, the Philippines, Brazil, El Salvadore and Paraguay, with applications submitted in several other endemic countries. Overall vaccine efcacy of CYD-TDV was estimated to be around 60% against virological conrmed dengue (VCD), with high levels of protection offered against hospitalisation and severe disease [7,8] . However, marked variations were observed between ende- mic settings and between individual serotypes, with efcacies ranging from 35% (in the case of DENV2) to well over 70% (for DENV3 and DENV4). A signicant difference in vaccine efcacy was also observed between naive individuals and individuals with pre-existing antibodies to one or more dengue serotypes, where na\u00efve individuals were on average twice as likely to experience asymptomatic break-through infection. Recent pooled analyses of the rst 2-3 years of long-term follow-up provided further sup- portive evidence of efcacy against hospitalised dengue in children 9 years of age or older [9]. There was however a concerning signal for increased hospitalised dengue illness amongst participants 2-5 years of age (RR = 7.45, 95%CI 1.15, 313.80). There are multiple hypotheses that could explain this increased risk [10], including age-specic susceptibility to severe disease, suboptimal vaccine immunogenicity and/or waning immunity in vaccine recipients who were seronegative for dengue viruses at baseline, and temporal clustering of cases in the CYD group [11]. As a result, Sano Pasteur has limited the age indication to individuals 9+ years of age. As the vaccine is licensed, countries are faced with decisions about whether and how to introduce a dengue vaccine, and what the public health impact might be, both in terms of the reduction in disease burden and potential risks. Depending on disease epi- demiology, vaccine price, and other factors, these decisions may not be straightforward. Mathematical models can provide policy makers with additional potential considerations to inform their decisions on optimal vaccine use in the context of the broader den- gue control program. To this end, a meeting was held at the WHO in 2014 in order to revisit the current status of dengue intervention models and to discuss their utility for public health decision- making. Here we summarise the meeting with regards to the challenges faced by modellers and health policy makers identied during this meeting. 2. Role for modelling in shaping national and international recommendations on dengue vaccination Mathematical models have long been recognised as useful tools for addressing public health questions. Their ability to both sim- plify and elucidate complex relationships have contributed greatly to our understanding of epidemiological concepts, including the basic reproductive number ( R 0), herd immunity and vaccine escape. Consequently, models of vaccination are used at both national and global levels to inform decision making. Often, several models exist which examine the same vaccine-related decision question using different input data sources, modelling methods and levels of complexity. Comparative modelling exercises can be used to understand the similarities and differences between differ- ent models in order to draw overall conclusions about the likely impact of vaccination strategies [12]. Such exercises are useful to inform countries, which rely on the results of models but do not have the technical capacity to appraise an entire suite of models. Mathematical models can also be used to inform global recom- mendations and policies about vaccines, which need to take into account a variety of settings and potential strategies. For instance, WHO is advised by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE)on Immunization to make global vaccine-related recommenda- tions, with input from models that have been appraised by its advi- sory committee, the Immunization and Vaccines related Implementation Research Advisory Committee (IVIR-AC). Recently, the outputs of a coordinated mathematical model comparison of the potential impact of the RTS, S malaria vaccine were used in the decision-making process for WHO recommendations on the use of this vaccine [13,14] . The modelling revealed that despite the overall low efcacy, the vaccine could have a substantial addi- tional public health impact across a broad range of settings repre- sentative of malaria parasite prevalence in Africa in the presence of other ongoing interventions. It also provided indication on cost- effectiveness and performance in various transmission settings. WHO has also used comparative modelling to inform country decision-makers on the use of cost-effectiveness tools for othervaccines, including pneumococcal vaccines, rotavirus and human papillomavirus vaccines [15-18] . With a similar exercise now under way with regards to a dengue vaccine, it is important to note that the level of certainty we can have in model conclusions ultimately depends on the avail- ability of suitable data as well as our understanding of the biolog- ical and epidemiological mechanisms driving disease dynamics. Given currently available data dengue disease dynamics and performance of dengue prevention tools (i.e. vaccine and vector control effectiveness), there are several policy questions that can be well-informed by mathematical modelling, such as: what is the impact of different vaccination strategies on disease, taking into consideration different target age groups, variable vaccine ef- cacies and/or vaccine coverage levels? Or what is the cost- effectiveness of different strategies for a dengue vaccination pro- gram? There is also substantial programmatic interest in exten- sions of mathematical modelling to other aspects, such as the impact of integrated vaccination/vector control programs or the change in disease dynamics and dengue epidemiology following vaccine introduction. However, due to the current limitations in empiric data on vaccine performance and mechanism of action, many of these should be considered as exploratory at this stage and with great uncertainties attached to their outputs. 3. Model and other uncertainties There is an appreciable degree of freedom, by which biological and ecological phenomena can be described mathematically. Con- sequently, models of dengue transmission and/or intervention can be found in various shapes and sizes, ranging from differential equation models to spatially explicit agent-based approaches that include most of the known ecological and immunological determi-nants influencing the transmission cycle of dengue; for an over- view of recent models investigating dengue epidemiology and control see e.g. [19-21] . Regardless of the wide range of modelling taken to investigate the potential impact of individual or inte- grated control strategies on reducing the burden of disease, an important issue that was highlighted during the meeting was that of uncertainties, not only those relating to underlying model assumptions but also those relating to vaccine action and the (long-term) effectiveness of vector control. That is, ambiguities still exist relating to the various factors affecting dengue virus transmission and immunity, which mostly revolve around the short and long-term effects of a primary dengue virus infection on the immuno-epidemiology and pathology of subsequent infections. For example, it is commonly assumed that following an infection the host remains fully protected against reinfection by all other serotypes for a certain length of time (between 6 months and 2 years) [22-24] and that due to the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement, severe infection outcomes4462 M. Recker et al. / Vaccine 34 (2016) 4461-4465are not only much more likely during secondary, heterologous infections but also much more transmissible. This view has recently been challenged, however [25]; and with the majority of dengue infections going unreported and much of the available epi- demiological data based on clinical cases only, robust empirical evidence that conclusively relate age, prior exposure, infection pathology and viral transmission is still lacking. Similar uncertainties also apply to vaccine induced protection, such that data from the recent trials do not allow us to discrimi- nate whether the vaccine offers any protection against infection or against clinical disease only, or what effect breakthrough infec- tions have on the immune status of the vaccinees. The vaccine tri- als further highlighted signicant uncertainties associated with a partially efcacious vaccine. That is, the observed differences in vaccine efcacy between individuals that were seropositive orseronegative at baseline indicate that serostatus is an important consideration and possibly relevant for other live attenuated den- gue vaccine candidates, too. For CYD-TDV in particular it will therefore be important to investigate vaccine efcacy under differ- ent levels of transmission intensity and target age groups for vac- cination to maximise impact whilst preventing adverse outcomes, given the reported elevated risk of hospitalisation with dengue amongst the 2-5 yr old CYD-TDV vaccine recipients in the 3rd year post-vaccine initiation. More generally, though, while the trans- mission models themselves can be applied across all dengue vac- cine candidates, the mode of action of the different vaccines may need to be considered differently, based on the available immuno- genicity and efcacy data. Given these uncertainties it is imperative that thorough model sensitivity analyses are to be carried out [26], not only to gain a better understanding of the full range in qualitative and quantita- tive model behaviour under parameter changes, but also to high- light the most important knowledge gaps. In that respect, sensitivity analyses need to go beyond nding and reporting on the most influential parameters but crucially have to incorporate uncertainties in parameter values as well as in the underlying model structure and assumptions [27]. 4. Model comparisons To develop global policy recommendations, SAGE constituted a Working Group on Dengue Vaccines, for which a key input for decision-making is the predicted disease impact and cost- effectiveness of a dengue immunization program based on mathe- matical modelling. SAGE reviewed CYD-TDV as well as model- based predictions of public health and economic impact in April 2016. SAGE recommended countries consider introduction of thevaccine only in geographic settings (national or subnational) with high endemicity, with seroprevalence thresholds informed by the mathematical modelling analyses (see http://www.who.int/immu- nization/sage/meetings/2016/april/SAGE_April_2016_Meeting_ Web_summary.pdf?ua=1&ua=1 ). A WHO vaccine position paper outlining WHO recommendations is expected to be published in July 2016. The above mentioned uncertainties underlying the immuno- epidemiology of dengue and vaccine action will undoubtedly have signicant effects on the models' ability to make quantitative and robust predictions about the impact of integrated control measures. In light of these ndings, the WHO initiated a model comparison exercise in April 2015 [28,29] with the aim of quanti- fying the health and economic impact of a dengue vaccination campaign based on our current understanding of the action of the CYD-TDV candidate. Such a model comparison exercise adds signicant value towards an evidence-based decision making process. Not only does it yield a much better understanding ofthe features, similarities and differences between models, it also crucially enhances communication between the modelling groups, and between modellers and other scientists, stakeholders and policy-makers. The results from this exercise, based on eight mod- els using standardised input datasets representing a variety of dengue-endemic settings, have now been appraised by both IVIR- AC and SAGE's Dengue Working Group, with the detailed results expected to be published later this year. At this stage, however, emphasis is predominantly placed on vaccination impact without explicitly taking vector control mea- sures into consideration, due to the added complexities and uncer- tainties underlying the large-scale application and effectiveness of vector control. Nevertheless, more data, especially from the CYD- TDV long-term follow-up studies will become available in the near future. It is thus expected that some of these uncertainties will getresolved before too long, which will greatly facilitate model har- monisation and a shift in focus towards integrated intervention programmes. 5. Endemic country perspectives Mathematical models may also inform country-specic deci- sions about vaccine introduction, although interpretation of the results must always be put in the context of local data quality and uncertainty in model predictions. There are a number of efforts to model dengue and vaccine impact locally to inform decision- making. In these efforts, local priorities and questions for dengue vaccine programs can best be taken into account. To date, there has been no published systematic survey of what dengue endemic countries most desire as outcomes from a dengue vaccine program. Feedback from endemic country clinical and pub- lic health professionals suggests a desire for a vaccine-mediatedreduction in the number of fatal cases and those requiring hospi- talisation. This priority is driven by multiple realities. First, hospi- talised case incidence can be measured by existing surveillancesystems and hence endemic countries have an available tool to measure and communicate to their internal stakeholders the impact of vaccination, i.e. a vaccine interrupted time series. Second, the public perception of dengue as a public health problem is driven partly by media reports and images of large caseloads in hospital settings; these make for strong visual messages that undermine community condence in the competence of government to manage public health. Third, hospitalised cases account for much of the economic cost of dengue to health care systems. Against this backdrop it is reasonable to assume that endemic countries require, at a minimum, that a dengue vaccine will deliver reductions in fatal and hospitalised cases. These priorities should be reflected in vaccine modelling efforts, which can allow policy makers to consider the potential impact of various interventions utilised as a component of their overall dengue control programme. Given the competing demands for nancing, modelling efforts could ultimately help countries design the optimal dengue control program package, considering local dengue epidemiology and resource constraints. This, however, crucially relies on more effort being put into improving communication between the modellers and policy makers as well as the development of more user-friendly models for countries to use in decision-making. 6. Enhancing input from mathematical models into vaccine decision making Different models make different, and often untested or unvali- dated assumptions about the key drivers of dengue epidemiology and vaccine performance due to underlying uncertainties. In orderM. Recker et al. / Vaccine 34 (2016) 4461-4465 4463for policy makers to understand the assumptions, allowing their own evaluation of the integrity of the results and condence in the model predictions, it is important that sufcient detail is pro- vided on the model assumptions and parameters. These include assumptions for infection states, disease states, serotype or strain differences, transmission, vaccine response, vector, seasonality, and spatial aspects ( Box 1 ). A possible strategy for reporting based on supporting of an archive of vector-borne disease models and using an online questionnaire for researchers to ll in their model specications and key features. As mentioned earlier, reproducibil- ity of model results is imperative to improve transparency and enable comparisons between different approaches. Models should therefore be described in sufcient details, including initial condi- tions and the data used to inform and/or justify their choice of parameter values. 7. Concluding remarks The availability of epidemiological and clinical data from the Phase III efcacy trials of Sano Pasteur's tetravalent dengue vac- cine has provided a great opportunity for mathematical models to make semi-quantitative predictions about expected outcomes, including short-term reduction in disease burden as well as poten- tial unintended effects. Point estimates for vaccine efcacy, partic- ularly those that are variable by serotype, age, host immune status, and severity, only provide one kind of information to policy- makers considering vaccination in their specic setting. Mathe- matical models are valuable tools to translate these data into country- or region-specic impact estimates as an additional input into the policy-making process. However, data sharing and com- munication with policy-makers, especially regarding the extent and nature of uncertainties are critical for the success of mathe- matical models to provide the best possible predictions and to maximise their use health policy recommendations.Box 1 Reporting requirements for dengue transmission models of vaccine impact to improve transparency. /C15Infection states How many serotypes are considered in the model and how many possible infections are assumed? Following an infection, what are the assumptions about the infec- tiousness and susceptibility of every subsequent infec- tion? Details about the infection state should also extend to the vector (if explicitly modelled) and their interactions with the host should be detailed. Finally, what are the assumptions regarding cross-protection and/or cross-enhancement? /C15Disease states Details should be provided about the modelled out- come of an infection (e.g. in terms of clinically apparent disease or hospitalisation). Related to this, what is the link between infection outcome and infectiousness? Furthermore, does the probability of disease changewith subsequent infections and/or is it a function of other model states, such as age or immunisation? /C15Serotype or strain differences Does the model assume heterogeneities in the trans- missibility and/or pathogenicity between serotypes or (if considered) between different strains? Are there het- erogeneities in terms of cross-protection and/or cross- enhancement? Equally, are vaccine efcacies assumed to be symmetric or different for different serotypes? /C15Transmission What are the assumptions underlying the transmission coefcients (e.g. biting rate, transmission probabilities, etc.)? What is the assumed basic reproductive number and what data is that based on? Are vectors explicitly modelled in the model, which would warrant a descrip- tion of human ?vector and vector ?human transmis- sion probabilities? And for more detailed models, temporal and spatial contact structures should be described if assumptions are made regarding age- or location-dependent probabilities of infection. /C15Vaccine response What assumptions are made regarding the action of a vaccine, e.g. 'all-or-nothing' (i.e. the vaccine offers complete protections to some part of the population but not the other) or 'leaky' (i.e. vaccine offers partial protection to every vaccinated individual)? Does vacci- nation have an effect on infection, disease or both? Are there serotype/strain- or age-dependent differences? How does the immune status prior to immunization affect the vaccine response? Finally, does the response vary with time, e.g. during a multi-dose regime or because of waning immunity?/C15Vector If vectors are explicitly modelled, what is their relative population size? What mosquito life-stages are consid- ered and what states are considered in terms of their infection status? How their natural histories are rea- lised and are there temporal variabilities in demogra- phy? How should heterogeneous, focal transmission, which arises from the biology and landscape on which mosquito biting and pathogen transmission unfold, be modelled? Attention should focus on the ecological and social context of mosquito biting behaviour. /C15Seasonality How is seasonality incorporated in the model, e.g. tem- poral variation in biting rates, temporal variability in population densities and/or temporal variability in incubation rates and how are these parameterised? /C15Parameterisation The data used for parameterising the model should be described in sufcient details and, where possible, either with references to published literature or better included.
