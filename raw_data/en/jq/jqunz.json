(I know it's not very 'yogi' to complain, but I gotta this one off my chest) You know the phrase, 'If it ain't broke don't fix it?' Well, I don't like it. In fact, I'd go as far as to say it can be dangerous in the context of encouraging people to put their own needs on the back burner. The body whispers before it screams so if you learn to tune into the whispers you won't need to \"break\" or scream order to get your own attention. I happen to believe we're not broken, that we're all doing the best we can and that in itself is awesome! Giving yourself a break should mean a vacation, not a breakdown! That's why it makes me so happy to see healing holiday time trending! You don't have to be sick to heal yourself, even a Ferrari needs a tune-up a healing holiday is more like an upgrade or a remodeling ;) \"If I were a medical man, I should prescribe a holiday to any patient who considered his work important.\" Bertrand Russell Feeling a bit meh? That's cool, it's a sign you need a break. The tricky part is taking one! It's almost as if we've been programmed to feel guilty when taking time to do things that aren't seen as traditionally productive. Well screw that jazz it's time to break the mold! When we're getting those feelings of \"meh\" we would do well to pay them close attention and work out what the message behind the \"meh\" instead of just pushing through and using the \"F-Bomb\"? I'm also not a fan of the \"F-Bomb\". (I'm a bit ranty today, sorry! ) 'Gasp!' I hear you exclaim, \"Don't use the F-Bomb!\" But don't worry I'm not talking about THAT F-Bomb I'm talking about the worse one...\"Fine\" ... blurrrggghh! I could spend my life warning of the dangers of the \"F-Bomb\" But instead, I'd rather talk to your lovely face about pro-active steps towards positive life changes in the form of a \"Healing Holiday\". One of the biggest dangers to our collective mental health is the f-word. No, not that one. F-I-N-E. 'How are you?' Fine Fine is all we ever have the courage to muster in response to what could otherwise be a big, deep, and healing question. If given the chance to answer truthfully, how would you answer that question?? Tired? Overwhelmed? Exhausted? Lonely? Hurt? Learning how to step back and observe how you're really feeling opens up space to get to the root, solve whatever issue brought you there, and fill up your proverbial tank so that you can keep going. And if you don't, what happens. The biggest epidemic of the 21st century: burnout. I'm gonna get serious for a moment. Burnout is an actuall syndrome and it's hard. It's state of emotional, physical and mental exhaustion from prolonged stress. It's sneeky little business, it doesn't happen over night, it creeps in on you and it's tough to deal with. The trick is picking up on symptoms and taking actions where you can. I like to call it \"listening to the whispers.\" Physical symptoms can include: - Feeling tired most of the time - Lowered immunity, getting sick frequently - Headaches and or muscle pain - Changes in eating habits - Changes in sleep habits - Shaking - Digestive issues - Dull skin Emotional symptoms can include: - Sense of failure - Constant self-doubt - Feeling trapped, helpless or defeated - Feelings of detachment or loneliness - Lack of motivation - Increasingly negative or cynical outlook - Low satisfaction Behavioral symptoms can include: - Avoiding responsibilities - Going into isolation - Procrastination - Self medicating with food, drugs, alcohol - Easy to anger - Avoiding work, leaving early, arriving late - Poor or no self care, eg bathing, housework etc [Burnout](https://bookretreats.com/8-day-burnout-recovery-yoga-retreat-in-beautiful-mexico) is pretty scary place to be, but there is hope and there is always a solution. If you're suffering from burnout there is [help](https://www.15minutes4me.com/) out there. If you're concerned this sounds like you, I'm so happy you found this post today!

It's not all tree-hugging, cuddle puddles and naked fire pits! Well... unless you want it to be ;) Healing vacations can be literally anything you need to recenter yourself! Pack your nourishing getaway full of things that make you go \"ahhhhh\" that's the beauty, it's your time to just be!

We highly recommend a [wellness retreat](https://bookretreats.com/s/wellness-retreats) for anyone suffering symptoms of burn out, anyone under stress, anyone who feels a little tired, or really anyone with a pulse ;) You don't normally wait for the engine to fall out of your car before you take it to the garage, it needs to be serviced. It's not enough to just fill the fuel tank, you have to change the oil, replace the tires and get new wiper blades so you can see things clearly. Think about the amount you've invested in your car, the amount you rely on it. It would be ludicrous not to take care of it...see where I'm going here? PSSTT... Wanna check out all of our healing retreats? My dear you can go anywhere and do anything! You can expereince what it's like to meditate in Bali. You can enjoy surf in Costa Rica, emerald jungles in Nicaragua, white beaches in Barbados, detox in Koh Phagnan, massage on Koh Samui, holistic healing in Vietnam, spirituality in Japan! You can find yourself in the Sedona desert, loose yourself in a luxurious spa in Italy, enjoy mountain retreats in Spain, experience holistic wellbeing in Portugal... the possibilities are endless! It's up to you! First of all, let's try and work out what type of [healing](https://bookretreats.com/blog/top-10-healing-retreats/) it is you need from your trip. After all this is all about you! How does that make you feel? Ask yourself a question and start to filter it eg. - This first big question in life is \" [To Spa or not to Spa](https://bookretreats.com/s/wellness-retreats/spa-retreats)?\" - Do You wan to [stay in the US](https://bookretreats.com/blog/best-wellness-retreats-usa/)or go abroad, maybe [Asia](https://bookretreats.com/blog/top-10-luxury-asian-retreats/)? - What do you need more, rest or adventure? Beach or Dessert? - Bali or Sedona? - Is it physical or spiritual healing? Detox/Shamanic/Ayurvedic? - Do you want to pampered or put through your paces? Spa or Fitness (or both) - Do you want to be active or do you want to just rest and have someone do everything for you? - Do you wanna [take a road trip](https://www.exploretheroadwithdonnamarie.com/road-trip-guide-how-to-plan-and-execute-the-ultimate-journey)or a train or fly during your vacay? Take the first steps in having your needs met by writing down what it is you actually want, write what your dream holiday looks like and what needs you perhaps aren't having met, like sleep, attention, exercise, etc. Hint this is also a healing exercise Footwear - If you're doing a range of activities, some good indoor trainers are great - Lightweight hiking shoes if you're off to the mountains - And, of course, every holiday must have a good pair of flip flops! (With a back strap, look after your fascia). - Ladies, don't pack your heels. Go barefoot instead! Honestly, there's something totally liberating about leaving all your \"costume\" clothes behind Eyewear - Sunnies are a must - Poolside reading is quite likely so get your reading glasses - Snorkel gear, if needed, is likelyyyy provided by your retreat destination, but double check just in case Clothes - Healing holidays you can dress right down, so pack the minimum. You'll find that you don't wear everything you pack, anyway - If it's hot, wear super light fabric and layers to protect the skin - Do some research on the countries etiquette. For example, will you have to cover your shoulders and knees etc? - Always pack a sarong you can drape comfortably, it's so much lighter than a towel. Don't have one? Wait til you get to your destination, they're usually less than 10 bucks at the beach shops - Swimsuits and comfy underwear are a must - Loose-fitting comfy clothing for yoga and exercise - Depending on where you go, pack something slightly warmer for the nights - A lightweight puffy down jacket is always helpful because it's easy to pack away but keeps you super warm in a pinch (even if only on the airplane!) Journal This is a great piece of kit to take on a healing holiday. Journal writing is proven to be beneficial for getting everything out and clear plus you might want to write yourself notes so when it gets a bit tough back home you can just flip to the holiday page and be like \"ahhhh I got this\" Extras - Do you need to print your visa ahead of time (as is the case when traveling to India)? - Heck, do you need to sort your visa at all? - Don't forget your meds! Everything else you might need, like ibuprofen or antibiotics, can be found pretty easily and cheaply in most other countries - Check vaccination rules and malaria risk areas - I always travel with a bottle of laxatives and anti-diarrheal just in case :) - You'll likely need sunscreen, even in the snowy mountains - Take your phone and charge cables, but don't bring all your tech (a digital detox is great) - All your basic toiletries, toothbrush, toothpaste, and shampoo bars (great for the environment and traveling) - Earplugs because you never, ever know when you will be surrounded by new noises that keep you up!
