It will direct you to valuable information regarding the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the College of Educa-tion and the College of Business. It will lead you through our many programs of study, giving details about every course available at the time of printing, and it will guide you to the best opportunities for financial aid. It will give you useful information about our academic policies and procedures. In short, this catalog will provide a description of what we offer and how you can become a part of Frostburg State University. Like any map, what it cannot provide is the experience of Frostburg State University. It cannot describe the quality of our faculty and our support personnel. You may note that more than 80 percent of our faculty have Ph.D. 's, but it is important to know that they publish in the most prestigious books and journals in the world, while still giving their full support and attention to their students. They pride themselves on the close and personal connections they form with students. It doesn't tell you that we employ one faculty member for every 18 students and that you will never sit in a lecture hall with hundreds of students. It also cannot express the importance we place on providing support through our Advising Center, our Orientation Program or our Learning Communities, in which all incoming freshmen join a group of students with similar interests, then take some of their general education courses with those same students. Enduring friendships are often born of these communities. This catalog cannot give you a true sense of this beautiful, uncrowded campus in the mountains of Western Maryland, nor can it convey the environment that so many students say enhances both their learning and their development as human beings. These qualities can only be realized from experienc - ing this campus and allowing us the privilege of providing you an education. We are glad you have chosen Frostburg and look forward to your becoming an engaged member of our community who will remember mentors, friends, and intellectual challenges when you think of Frostburg State University in years to come.

The Governor selected Frostburg as a site because the residents offered the best suitable location without cost to the State. 1898 Townspeople raised the money to buy Beall's Park - a two-acre site - for the State Normal School. 1900 Old Main - the first campus building - was completed. 1902 Fifty-seven students attended the first classes of the State Normal School at Frostburg. We offered a two-year program of elementary school teacher training. 1904 Our first commencement. Students received a diploma and a life-time teaching certificate. 1913 The Model School began operating in its new building. This was our first campus training school which allowed student teachers to work directly with children in the classroom. 1919 We opened our first residence hall. 1930 A six-room training school for student teachers replaced the 1913 Model School. 1931 Our teacher training program expanded from two to three years, and then from three to four years in 1934. 1935 l The institution's name changed to State Teachers College at Frostburg. l The first four-year degree students graduated with Bachelors in Science in Elementary Education. 1946 The college first offered a liberal arts junior college program.

Paper applications are available through your high school guidance office or by contacting the Admissions Office at FSUadmissions@ frostburg.edu or 301.687.4201. A non-refundable application fee of $30 is also required and can be paid online or with a check or money order. As part of your application, you must provide the Admissions Office with an official copy of your academic records. Applicants may use the records request form included in the application. The University does not assume responsibility for requesting this information from your high school or any college you have attended. Either the SAT or the ACT is required for ad- mission. You should take the SAT or ACT in your junior or senior year of high school. All first-year applicants or transfer students with fewer than 24 transferable hours must have the results of the SAT/ACT sent to the Admis- sions Office. Frostburg State University's SAT identification code is 5402. Frostburg's ACT identification code is 1714. Application Dates The University may have to close admissions when no further space for students is avail- able. Consequently, applicants from high school should apply in the fall or early winter of the senior year. Beginning on September 15, the admissions office will start accept - ing applications for the fall semester of the following year. The University accepts applications from first- year students who would like to begin in the spring semester, and admission is granted on a space-available basis. High School GPA First-year college applicants are granted admission on a rolling basis. Many admission decisions are made, consequently, on grades you have earned only through the end of the junior year. However, the first semester of your senior year can be pivotal in gaining admission and your remaining high school work must be successfully completed. Performance on the SAT/ACT Your performance on the SAT/ACT should be in the range that would normally predict success in college. College Preparatory Program in High School Entering first-year students must have 4 units of English; 3 units of social science/history; 3 units of biological and physical science in at least two different subject areas (with 2 of the units including a laboratory experi- ence); 3 units of mathematics, including Algebra I, Algebra II and Geometry; and 2 units of a foreign language or, in Maryland, 2 units of advanced technology. For students entering ninth grade in fall 2011, 4 units of mathematics are required. Students who complete Algebra II prior to their final year must complete the four-year mathematics requirement by taking a course or courses that utilize non-trivial algebra. If you have not taken the required courses, you may be admitted to the University with the understanding that courses in the deficient area(s) must be completed during the first year if you want to continue your studies. Through advanced placement, applicants may have completed advanced courses before high school and opted out of certain required courses in high school. If you have taken advanced courses, the University as-sumes minimum requirements have been met. Admission for Mature Adults If you graduated from high school a minimum of three years prior to applying to FSU, you are excused from the SAT/ACT requirement. You still need to submit a transcript of your academic work, including the receipt of a high school diploma or GED.Diagnostic Placement Tests All entering first-time students and any transfer student not transferring Freshman Composition and/or a college-level math course, will take diagnostic placement tests in reading, writing and mathematics to de - termine appropriate placement. If you score below a predetermined standard on these examinations, you will be required to enroll in specified courses your first semester to develop your skills to a level which will enable you to function successfully at the University. You are expected to reach these levels within two semesters. Transfer students See separate section on the next page. Special Standards Admission to specific University degree programs may require higher standards or be limited by opportunities to complete the courses required for that program. Right to Refuse Applications The Associate Vice President for Enrollment Management reserves the right to deny or revoke applications for admission or readmis- sion of any applicant whose former record(s) and/or observed conduct is incongruent with the established guidelines for student behav -Office of Admissions 114 Pullen Hall 301.687.4201 FAX 301.687.7074 e-mail: FSUAdmissions@frostburg.eduGaining Admission The University encourages applications from students prepared to join in the life of an intellectual community. First-year college students are granted admission on the basis of high school grade point average, performance on the SAT, completion of a college prepara- tory program, optional letters of recommendation, and an optional admissions essay. The University's admissions policies are governed by the Policy on Undergraduate Admissions (III-4.00) of the Board of Regents of the University academic responsibility at Frostburg State University. Campus Visits The University does not require a campus visit for admission, but touring our facilities and speaking with students, faculty and admin- istrators can give you a valuable perspective. Campus tours and personal interviews can be scheduled throughout the year. Contact the Office of Admissions between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to set up an appointment. Admission for GED Recipients Applicants who received a general equiva-lency diploma must show GED subtest scores of at least 50 in English composition, social studies, natural sciences and literature (read-ing) and a score of at least 60 in mathemat - ics. They must earn the same minimum SAT scores as other applicants. Admission of International Students The University welcomes applications from undergraduate international students who demonstrate university-level language profi- ciency in English. Students with international credentials, those who have completed part or all of their secondary and/or tertiary level education outside the United States, must follow the guidelines below in preparing their application. Students who are already studying in the U.S. on an F1 visa must provide all admissions documents and complete a \"Transfer Eligibility\" form in order to receive a new I-20. Exchange students who plan to study at FSU for only one or two semesters should contact the Center for International Education directly for application materials (301.687.4714). 1) An application for admission can be submitted online at www.gobobcats. frostburg.edu. The $30 (U.S. currency only) non-refundable application fee can be paid online with a valid credit card at the time of the application submission. 2) If your native language is not English, you are required to demonstrate English lan- guage proficiency. The University requires a minimum TOEFL score of 79 (iBT) or a minimum IELTS score of 6. Comparable scores on the paper or computer-based test will be accepted as well. 3) Provide official or notarized secondary school academic records which show grades earned, annual mark sheets, ex -amination sheets and leaving certificates as they apply in your home country. 4) Have transcripts for institutions other than American institutions translated and evaluated by an approved evaluation service. No final action will be taken on your application for admission until the evaluation has been received. 5) Complete the Certification of Financial Support form and submit it to the Office of Admissions. This forms attests that either you or your sponsor is aware of the educational and living expenses and is prepared to provide the necessary funds. You must pay all educational costs for the semester in full at registration. 6) International students on F-1 and J-1 visas are required to purchase health insurance for the time they are in the United States. Cost of health insurance will be included on the student's bill each term. The Center for International Education enrolls stu- dents in the insurance program. 7) All required documents should be on file by June 1 for Fall admission, or October 15 for Spring admission. You cannot be granted admission or issued an I-20 until all required information has been received by the Office of Admissions. If you are an international student residing outside the United States, you should not attempt to come to Frostburg State University before receiving a formal letter of admission and an I-20 issued by Frostburg State University.More detailed information about F-1 and J-1 visa category requirements may be found on the university's web site. Admission for Transfer Students If you want to transfer to Frostburg State University from a two-year or four-year institution, your academic records will be evaluated by the Admissions Office follow - ing the guidelines listed below. Review your transfer credit evaluation carefully and bring any questions or concerns to the attention of the Transfer Coordinator and your advi- sor within your first semester of enrollment at FSU. If you still have questions about the evaluation of transferable credits or the ap - peals process for this audit, please contact the Director of Admissions. 1) Ordinarily, you must have a 2.0 cumula- tive average on a 4.0 scale and must have earned a minimum of 24 transferable semester hours of credit. If you have attended more than one institution, the cumulative GPA will be computed on grades received in courses from all institutions attended. If you are a transfer student with fewer than 24 transferable credits, you must have a 2.5 minimum cumulative average and provide an official high school transcript and SAT scores to the Admissions Office prior to admission. However, if you would have been admitted to the University as a high school senior and have achieved a 2.0 cumulative grade point average at a Maryland community college, you are eligible for transfer regardless of the number of credits you may not transfer more than 70 credits from a community or junior college. These credits are normally limited to the first two years at the undergraduate level and half the baccalaureate degree program requirements. 3) You are limited to a maximum of 90 credits when transferring from other four-year colleges and universities. 4) You are required to complete at least half your academic major requirements at FSU. Additional requirements to complete a degree are listed in the Academic Program chapter. 5) When you transfer, grades earned at other institutions are not included in your FSU grade point average. The credits you earned transfer but the grades do not. 6) You must meet the graduation require - ments of the Frostburg State University catalog in effect when you were enrolled as a first-year student at the sending institu- tion. If you had more than two sequential years of non-enrollment since enrolling in an institution of higher education, you must meet the graduation requirements of the FSU catalog in effect at the time you first enroll at Frostburg State University. 7) If you are admitted to degree candidacy while still enrolled at another institution, you must maintain the required cumula-tive grade point average and remain in good academic standing during your most recent semester at that institution. Failure to meet this requirement will result in cancellation of the University's original offer of admission. Transfer Policies The Maryland Higher Education Commission has set policies for students transferring within the public higher education system in our state. These policies allow students in other state colleges and universities to plan a total degree program and make un- interrupted progress toward finishing that program if they transfer. The complete text of the Maryland Higher Education Commission General Education and Transfer Policy is reprinted in the Policies chapter at the end of this catalog. To sum- marize, when you first transfer to Frostburg State University, if you have earned credit for a course that meets the general education requirements at a Maryland public higher education institution, you will receive gen- eral education credit at Frostburg State University, up to a maximum of 36 credits (from a two-year institution). Once you are a degree-seeking student at FSU, you can only transfer equivalents of the specific courses in the FSU general education program for general education credit. This general education transfer policy does not apply to students transferring from private institutions in Maryland or from non-Maryland institutions. Courses transferred from these institutions will be evaluated on a course equivalency basis. If you have completed an associate's degree or have completed 56 semester hours of credit at a Maryland community college with a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher on a scale of 4.0, and if the credit is from a college or university parallel course, you will be given direct transfer to FSU. If you have taken courses at a Maryland com- munity college as part of a recommended transfer program leading to a baccalaureate degree, those courses will be applied to a related degree program at FSU. Acceptance of Transfer Credit Transfer credit may be awarded for successful completion of course work compatible with the Frostburg State University curriculum, as documented by official transcripts forwarded directly by the sending institution to the FSU Office of Admissions. Such credit normally will be transferred only from regionally accredited institutions or institutions that are candidates for regional accreditation and for course work completed during military service that has been evaluated in the American Council on Education's Guide to the Evaluation of Edu- cational Experiences in the Armed Services. Credit earned at degree-granting higher education institutions that are not region-ally accredited but that hold national or specialized accreditation recognized by the U.S. Department of Education; and at non-degree-granting institutions that are approved by the Maryland State Department of Education, the Maryland Higher Education Commission, or a state or local government agency authorized to approve curricula, will be considered for transfer only if an articula- tion agreement exists between Frostburg State University and the other institution or, at student request, on a case-by-case basis. If an individual review is requested, the student must provide the FSU Admissions Office a copy of the institutional catalog or program of study, and copies of course syllabi for those courses for which transfer credit is desired. The Admissions Office will evaluate this transfer credit in consultation with the FSU departments offering the courses. Readmission If you previously were admitted and attended the University but did not earn a degree and have been absent for one semester or more, you must submit an application for readmis-sion. Contact the Admissions Office for a readmission application form. (See section on Leave of Absence in the Academic Regula-tions chapter of this catalog). Restricted Grade Forgiveness Policy for Returning Students If you are an undergraduate student applying for readmission after an absence of at least five calendar years, you may petition the Admissions Office to remove up to 16 credits and their corresponding course grades from the calculation of your cumulative grade point average. To earn this grade forgive - ness, you must (1) consult with the chair of the department in which you are majoring and (2) file a petition specifying the course credits to be deleted. This petition must be filed at the time of readmission and before you register for classes. To be eligible for this restricted grade for - giveness policy, you must re-enroll in course work at Frostburg the restricted grade forgiveness policy for returning students once in your undergraduate career. Residency Students enrolling at Frostburg State will be classified as in-state or out-of-state based on guidelines set by the Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland. This residency classification influences admission, tuition and other charges. Resident status is granted to students who have established permanent residency in Maryland based upon factors like living quarters, Maryland income tax payments, voter registration and a valid driver's license. The complete Board of Regents' Policy on Student Residency Classification, which fully explains the policy and the procedures for establishing in-state residency, is reprinted in this catalog's chapter on policies and is available on the Board of Regents web site: www.ums.edu/regents/bylaws/SectionVIII/VIII270.html Residency status is determined for first-time entering students by the Office of Admis-sions. Students seeking a review of their residency status will be required to respond to a petition available through the Office of Admissions. Once you are enrolled at the University, resi- dency status is determined by the Registrar's Office. Students desiring a review of their residency status after enrollment can obtain the petition from the Registrar's Office. Certificate Programs Degree-seeking undergraduates and non-degree-seeking community members may earn a certificate in specialized areas. Cer - tificate programs are designed to provide specialized skills and knowledge that may enhance your undergraduate program and/ or provide skills useful in employment. Un-dergraduate certificates include a minimum of 12 credit hours. If you are not currently an FSU student, you may be admitted as a non-degree-seeking student to complete a certificate program. You must file an admission application and present evidence that you have a high school diploma or GED, or that you have been ap - proved to participate in the dual enrollment high school/college program. Particular certificate programs may have additional admission requirements. Credits earned to - wards a certificate may later be applied to a degree if you choose to request, and qualify for, admission as a degree-seeking student. Credits also are transferable.Academic Common Market Frostburg State University participates in the Academic Common Market of the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB). Through this program, students pay resident tuition rates to attend unusual, specialized programs in other participating states.

All fees must be paid prior to the beginning of each semes - ter or before the date shown on the statement of fees. Students will not be allowed to regis- ter for the next semester. Failure to meet the due date may result in the cancellation of the student's schedule. A previous balance results in the grades and transcripts of the student being withheld until full payment is made. Students failing to withdraw or make pay - ment will be charged a $60 deferment fee, a $30 late payment and a $30 late registration. Deferred Payment Plans The TuitionPay Plan From Sallie Mae TuitionPay is the interest-free, debt-free way to spread tuition payments over a number of months. The TuitionPay Plan is not a loan, so there are no interest payments, only a low annual enrollment fee. The Plan allows you to break down your education expenses into easy-to-manage installments, rather than one lump-sum pay - ment. It's simple and convenient. How to Get Started Just visit www.TuitionPayEnroll.com, click \"Enroll Now\" and in a few easy steps your enrollment will be complete. You can also complete and mail a paper application. Fast, Easy Payment Options TuitionPay is all about convenience. That's why we offer you the option to make your payments online* by eCheck or credit card, or by mail with your monthly statement. Or if you prefer the worry-free simplicity of automatic deductions from your checking or savings account, you can sign up for recurring payments with our ACH plan. Manage Your Account Online Once you're enrolled, you can set up your own InfoLink account, which allows you to view your account information and status, and make payments any time \u2014 day or night. There's no easier way to pay tuition than with the TuitionPay Plan. So enroll today! For more information, visit www.Tuition Pay. com, or call 1.800.635.0120 to speak with a TuitionPay consultant. *No check processing fees when you pay online on or before the due date. Charges for Collection of Unpaid Bills If a student's account is not promptly paid, the University will turn it over to the Maryland State Central Collection Unit and a 17- percent collection fee will be added to the bill. If fur - ther collection action is needed, an outside agency will be retained and those charges will also be billed to the student. The state may also withhold any refund due to the student from the Maryland State Income Tax and apply it to the overdue account. Refund Policy The following regulations govern refunds available upon withdrawal from the Univer - sity or when other changes of status take place. To withdraw from the University, you must complete an official withdrawal through the Registrar's Office before you are entitled to any refund. Because refund amounts change depending upon when you file, the date used to determine refunds will be the date on which you submit the final filing or change of status to the Registrar's Office. If you register for a full schedule (12 credits or more) and you drop courses to 11 credits or fewer after the end of the registration period, you are not entitled to a refund based on a credit-hour charge. Students dismissed for disciplinary reasons are not entitled to any tuition or fee refund. Student Refund Policy for Title IV Recipients Federal regulations mandate a student re - fund policy for Title IV recipients. The policy requires institutions to provide a pro-rata re - fund to any new student withdrawing before 60% of the enrollment period has elapsed. Information in regard to the calculation process or details of the policy may be ob - tained from the Financial Aid Office, Pullen Hall, 301.687.4301. Personal Funds If your balance reflects a credit of personal funds, you must write a request for a refund.Refund Schedules fall and Spring Semester Before the end of each registration period 100% tuition refunded Before the 15th calendar day after the official start of classes for that session 80% tuition refunded From the 15th day until the end of third week after the official start of classes 60% tuition refunded During the 4th week after the official start of classes 40% tuition refunded During the 5th week after the official start of classes 20% tuition refunded At the end of the 5th week after the official start of classes 0% tuition refunded fee refund Schedule (including summer session) Application fee 0% refund Board fee - Up to mid-semester prorated on a weekly basis plus one week - After mid-semester 0% refund Summer Sessions Before the end of the summer registration period 100% tuition refunded Before the end of one-fifth of the length of the session, but in no case beyond the 7th calendar day of the session 80% tuition refunded Before the end of two-fifths of the length of the session 40% tuition refunded At the end of two fifths of the length of the session, but in all cases beginning with at least the 15th calendar day of the session 0% tuition refunded *In the case of special courses of short duration (i.e., one week or less), this policy will be applied on a pro-rata basis in a manner consistent with the policy. non-refundable fees The following fees are non-refundable after the end of each registration period including the summer session: Room rent fee Auxiliary Facilities fee Directed Practice fee Activities fee Private Music fee University fee Athletic fee Student Union Operating fee Vehicle Registration fee Special Instruction Fee financial aid & scholarshipsFinancial Aid The University program of financial aid helps students who have limited financial resources.

This is the only application necessary for Federal and general State aid. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid includes detailed instruc - tions and is available on-line at www.fafsa. gov. In order for Frostburg State University to offer you financial aid, you will need to include FSU on your FAFSA using our school code (002072). You must reapply for financial aid each year. Types Of Financial Aid The major federal and state financial aid programs administered by Frostburg State University are described in the next two pages. For more detailed descriptions of the programs, see the Financial Aid and Scholar - ship brochure distributed by the Financial Aid Office for the year in which you want to receive the aid. Federal Aid Grants Grant money does not have to be repaid. Federal Pell Grant Program This program provides financial aid to all eligible undergraduates and is intended to be the base of a student's total financial aid package. Apply for the Federal Pell Grant by completing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The applicant will receive a Stu- dent Aid Report indicating eligibility after submitting the FAFSA. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program (SEOG) Criteria established by the Federal Govern- ment states that you must be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant in order to receive Federal SEOG funds. You must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid to determine eligibility. Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program The TEACH Grant program provides $4,000 a year for students who want to teach in a high need field in a high need area. There are a number of additional tasks you must complete to obtain the TEACH grant; there - fore, you are required to meet with a finan- cial aid counselor. Work Federal Work-Study Program - This federally-funded program provides recipi-ents with a paid work experience as part of the financial aid package. Employment may not exceed 20 hours per week while classes are in session, and 40 hours per week during other periods. Most students work 5-8 hours per week in jobs that, in many cases, are re - lated directly to their fields of study. Minimum wage laws apply. You must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid to apply. In addition, the University offers students an opportunity to be employed in community service positions through this program. Federal Loans A word of caution at the outset: a loan is money borrowed and MUST be repaid at a specified time in the future, under the terms specified in the promissory note that is signed before you receive your first loan disburse - ment. Before signing the promissory note, be sure you thoroughly understand your rights and responsibilities relative to any loan received. Federal Perkins Loan Students enrolled at least half-time at FSU who demonstrate significant financial need by filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid are eligible for a Perkins Loan. This program provides long-term loans at a 5% interest rate with repayment beginning nine months after graduating or leaving school for other reasons. The Financial Aid website gives detailed information regard- ing deferment and cancellation provisions. Borrowers should be aware that if default occurs and accounts are transferred to the Office of Education for collection County Resident** Resident Tuition* $5,304 $11,356 and Board * 8,752 8,752 8,752 Books 1,200 1,200 1,200 Transportation 750 750 950 Personal 1,000 1,000 1,000 *Amounts subject to change The above figures are based on a 9-month academic year.

Federal Stafford Loans NOTE: In order to borrow through any of the following Direct Loan Programs, you must be enrolled for at least 6 credits (and those credits must be leading toward a degree). Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan The Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan pro - gram enables you to borrow directly through the federal government. The interest rate is fixed at 3.4% for 2011-12 award year (rate subject to change). Qualifying for a Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan means that the federal government will pay the interest on your loan while you are enrolled at least half- time. Six months after you terminate your education or cease to be enrolled half-time, repayment of your loan(s) begins. Repay - ment, in most cases, must be completed within 10 years. Freshmen may borrow $3,500 per year; sophomores, $4,500; and for those who have attained junior class standing, $5,500 per year. However, the amount you may borrow in any given year may not exceed the educational costs as certified by the Financial Aid Office. The aggregate amount one may borrow as an undergraduate cannot exceed $31,000. A graduate or professional student may borrow up to $8,500 per year. The maximum outstanding debt for graduate or professional students, which includes any outstanding Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan borrowed for undergraduate study, is $65,500 (exclud- ing unsubsidized loans). The interest rate for graduate students is 6.8% To apply for a Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan, you must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid and other forms as re - quired. As with the Perkins Loan, the amount of your loan is based on several factors: amount of documented need, enrollment status and academic progress. All first-time Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan borrowers must complete an entrance interview. In addition, all Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan borrowers must complete an exit interview before graduation, withdrawal or leaving FSU, even though they may plan to return at some time in the future. Repaying your student loan is an obligation. Failure to repay your student loan(s) on the required repayment schedule will result in default. One of the many consequences of being in default is that FSU has the right to, and will, withhold the processing of all academic transcripts. Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loans Same terms and conditions apply as Federal Subsidized Stafford Loans, except that the borrower is responsible for interest that ac - crues while he/she is in school at a fixed 6.8% rate. This loan program is open to students who may not qualify for Federal Subsidized Stafford Loans or may qualify for only par - tial Subsidized Stafford Loans. To apply for a Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, you must first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and other forms as required. The borrowing limit for dependent students is $2,000 per year. For independent students, additional borrowing levels exist. Note: Eligibility for borrowing through both Subsidized and Unsubsidized loan programs during the summer is limited. If eligible to apply, an applicant must be enrolled for at least six credits per session and the credits taken must be leading toward a degree. Check with the Financial Aid Office regarding loan availability during summer sessions. Note: The Department of Education requires that stu- dent loan borrowers be provided with information on the availability of the Department's Office of the Ombudsman for student loans. This office provides information to stu-dents who have had problems resolving issues related to a student loan. FSU recommends that financial aid & scholarshipsing the Student Financial Assistance Ombudsman if this occurs. The U.S. Department of Education's Ombudsman Office can propose solutions that may help you and other parties (such as lenders, guaranty agencies, etc.) come to a final agreement. For additional information, contact this office at 202.401.4498 or toll-free at 1.877.557.2575. Their Web site is http://ombudsman.ed.gov Federal Plus Loans (Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students) The Federal Plus Loan is a federal loan pro - gram that allows parents of dependent, un-dergraduate students to borrow an amount equal to the cost of education, minus other aid. Special note: Federal regulations require your written permission to deduct miscellaneous insti - tutional charges such as library fees from your annual financial aid. You must sign and complete a permission form. If at all possible, you should submit this permission form prior to billing. If you choose not to complete the permission form, you will be responsible for paying any miscellaneous obligation(s) from personal funds by the bill payment date. The University may not apply your loan funds to any charge(s) assessed to you in a prior award year. FSU reserves the right to withhold academic transcripts from students who have defaulted on their student loans. State Aid Maryland State Scholarships The State of Maryland provides funding for the following major state scholarships: Howard Rawlings Educational Assistance Grant Howard Rawlings Guaranteed Access Grant Senatorial Scholarship Delegate Scholarship Applicants for these awards must: (1) Be a Maryland resident (2) Most require that you file a Free Ap - plication for Federal Student Aid by March 1. For requirements and applications specific to a particular scholarship, contact the FSU Financial Aid Office or the Maryland Higher Education Commission (410.260.4565). FSU Grants Criteria: You must be a U.S. citizen. You must demonstrate financial need through the federal application process. You must file the FAFSA as soon after January 1 as possible. The Financial Aid Office must receive the results by March 1. Students must meet academic standards to be considered for this award. State Student Work This program provides a limited number of jobs on campus for students who are not eligible for the Federal Work-Study Program. These positions are available in every academic, administrative and auxiliary area. Interested students should contact the Financial Aid Office during the first two weeks of classes. Financial Aid for Collaborative Engineering Programs Students enrolled in the mechanical engi- neering program offered by FSU in collabo - ration with University of Maryland, College Park are subject to a different financial aid arrangement due to the unique nature of the program. During the freshman and sophomore years, students are eligible to apply for financial aid through FSU. After completing 45 credits of designated course work, students formally apply for admission into UMCP's Clark School of Engineering and are considered UMCP students at that time. At that point, a student must reapply for federal or state aid through UMCP's Office of Student Financial Aid. For assistance in the ap - plication process, contact FSU's Engineering Program Coordinator, Dr. Yi-Zun Julie Wang, at 301.687.3208. Refund\\Repayment Policy See Title IV Refund Policy in the Fees section of this chapter. Implications of Withdrawal From the University Effective Fall 2000, all students who withdraw or are dismissed from the university (includ- ing unofficial withdrawals) and attend less than 60% of the enrollment period (semes-ter), will have their Title IV federal financial aid prorated based on the actual days of attendance. Therefore, before a student con- siders withdrawal, he/she should meet with a financial aid counselor to determine the financial impact on his/her federal financial aid. Title IV Federal aid includes Pell Grant, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant, Perkins Loan, Stafford Loans (Subsi- dized and Unsubsidized), and Parent Loan to Undergraduate Students (PLUS). Under this policy, the Financial Aid Office will determine the percentage of Title IV aid earned based on the length of enrollment. Once determined, the student may be responsible for charges that were once cov - ered by Title IV aid. In some cases, a student may have to repay a portion or all of aid & scholarships refund as a result of withdrawing before 60% of the enrollment period elapses. After the unearned portion of financial aid has been established, the funds will be returned to the federal programs in the following order: Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, Subsidized Stafford Loans, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Federal Pell Grants, Academic Competitiveness Grant (ACG), National Sci- ence and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grant (SMART), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants. In cases where a student is receiving institutional funds, he/she should check with the Financial Aid Office for policies concerning these awards. Satisfactory Progress Standards (SAP) The United States Department of Education mandates that Frostburg State University has an established Satisfactory Academic Progress policy for financial aid recipients. The policy must be qualitative and quanti- tative. The policy must be at least as strict as the academic policy governing students not receiving financial aid. If a student completes the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), he or she is subject to these regulations. Qualitative Requirement FSU requires students to have a 2.0 cumula-tive grade point average to graduate. The graduated standard for the minimum GPA throughout the academic program is as follows: Total Credits earned (including transfer credits) 0-14 1.00 15-29 1.40 30-44 1.60 45-59 1.80 60- above 2.00 Students need to be aware that they could be required to appeal to both the Provost's Office to remain in school and to the Fi- nancial Aid Office to maintain financial aid eligibility. Quantitative Standards minimum Passing requirement Students must complete 67% of all courses attempted including courses transferred to FSU in order to meet SAP regulations. To financial aid scholarships determine the completed average, a student needs to add all attempted hours (including credits transferred to FSU) then add all the hours of completed courses(including credits transferred to FSU) then divide the completed credit hours by the attempted credit hours. 6 completed credit hours / 12 attempted credit hours = 50% completion rate Maximum time to completion FSU students cannot attempt more than 180 credits for a first bachelor's degree and no more than 240 for a second bachelor's degree. Attempted credits include the following grades A, B, C, D, F, P , N, FX, W, WF, NC, NR, CS, I, AP , CE, CL, IB, PT and all transfer credits. Completed credits include the following grades A, B, C, D, P , AP , CE, CL, IB, PT and all transfer credits. All students will be evaluated at the end of each semester (Summer, Fall, Intersession and Spring). Students will need to review the progress rules and their transcript when making enrollment decisions. Frostburg will now be required to evaluate and measure students by standards estab - lished in the federal law. Each student will have one of four statuses: 1. Meets all components of the SAP standards (eligible to receive financial aid) 2. Academic Warning (explanation below) 3. Probation (explanation below) 4. Does not Meet Standards (not eligible to receive financial aid)Academic Warning Students who do not meet standards for the first time in their academic career will be placed on academic warning. A warning is as- signed to a student who fails to meet SAP but is allowed to continue to receive Title IV aid for one additional payment period (semester). Probation Students who do not meet SAP standards after one payment period on Academic Warn- ing will be denied financial aid. However, students will then have the right to appeal. If the appeal is granted, the student will be placed on probation and continue to receive Title IV aid for one additional payment period. Appeals will be granted for the following circumstances: 1. Students who demonstrate the following extenuating circumstances: death of a relative, injury or illness of the student, or other special circumstances; 2. The school has determined that the stu- dent will be able to meet SAP standards after the subsequent payment period or; 3. An academic plan had been established by the student and/or his or her advisor to meet graduation requirements and the student continues to follow the academic & scholarshipsScholarships Frostburg State University is firmly committed to academic excellence and we strive to rec - ognize outstanding students. A number of institutional scholarships have been established through the auspices of the Frostburg State University Foundation to reward academic achievement, as well as service in the community. Funds for these scholarships are provided by private and institutional sources. In addition, nearly every academic department at FSU offers departmental scholarships. The eligibility criteria for these scholarships vary. Many are based on academic performance, others on need, still others on the program of study or a combination of requirements. Scholarships are awarded on an annual basis. Students must meet satisfactory progress standards and scholarship selection requirements each semester as defined in the scholarship brochure or in the information provided with your award notification. The Financial Aid Office publishes a list of scholarships that describes all of the scholarships and the criteria to be considered, as well as the contact person and deadline date for each award. Contact the Financial Aid Office at 301.687.4301 for information or review online at www.frostburg.edu/scholarships. In addition, Frostburg State University offers academic scholarships which are screened by our Admissions Office. These scholarships are for entering first-year and transfer students who demonstrate outstanding academic ability. The academic scholarships will be part of the published list of scholarships or you may contact the Admissions Office Activities 23 campus life & activities Residence Life The mission of Residence Life is to create a comprehensive living-learning environment that complements the academic mission of the University.

Core skills You will become proficient in reading, writ - ing, speaking, and listening skills necessary for effective communication. You also will develop quantitative literacy, technology literacy, and information literacy. You will demonstrate foundational skills in the comprehension and interpretation of information in written and oral forms; communicate information and ideas effectively; understand and apply mathematical reasoning to solve quantitative problems and to evaluate quantitative information and arguments; use technological resources as appropriate to access and communicate relevant information. 2. Liberal knowledge and skills of inquiry, critical thinking, and synthesis You will develop the foundational skills neces- sary to acquire knowledge in the humanities, the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the arts, which collectively embody the hu-man cultural heritage. You will be introduced to critical thinking. You will demonstrate foundational abilities to apply different methods of inquiry from various perspectives and disciplines to gather information; comprehend and use various fundamental research methods to evaluate information critically; use problem-defining and problem- solving skills by synthesizing core concepts within and across disciplines; demonstrate sustained intellectual curiosity through exploration of emerging issues.General Education Program (GEP) Minimum of 40 credit hours required of all students 3. Values and social responsibility You will develop the foundational skills necessary to critically explore, evaluate, and define your values and become responsible citizens in a complex and changing society. You will demonstrate respect and tolerance for other cultures and societies; make personal judgments based on ethical considerations and societal values; exhibit civic responsibility and leadership; understand the purpose and value of community service in advancing society. 4.

GEP Grading Policy The P/F grading option is not permitted in the General Education Program. The grading policy for all Core Skills is as follows: A-F grades will be assigned, with a CS possible for students who have met the CS criteria stipulated in the course syllabus. The grade of CS may be earned only once per course; any CS assigned thereafter will revert to an F. Exceptions to this policy will be made only with the recommendation of the instructor. A grade of C or better is necessary to satisfy each Core Skill.Double-counting GEP Courses A particular course may be counted to meet only one General Education requirement. Courses that count for both the General Education Program and major/minor requirements are noted in the major/ minor descriptions. You can complete your degree in a shorter time by choosing GEP courses that match the requirements of the majors/minors that interest you. Core Skills All Core Skills may be satisfied by examination. You are expected to take these courses during your first 30 hours, with the exception of the advanced composition course requirement. If you are placed in a required section of ENGL 101, ENGL 105 (Critical Reading), or DVMT 095 (Pre-Algebra Mathematics) based on your scores on University placement tests, you may not withdraw unless you are withdrawing from the University. Once you are enrolled in ENGL 101, Freshman Composition, you may drop the course only during the drop/add period of one week at the beginning of the semester (except for required developmental courses, which may not be dropped). Under unusual circumstances, the chair of the English department may approve exceptions. Poor performance would not normally constitute a basis for an exception. You must continue taking a course which satisfies the requirement each semester until you have passed it with a grade of C or better. Modes of Inquiry In Group E, IDIS 150 (First-Year FSU colloquium) or IDIS/SUST 155 (Intro- duction to Sustainability Studies) is required. The selected course should be completed prior to earning 45 hours or soon after transfer, if applicable.

The Honors Program encourages interaction among good students engaged in the study of diverse disciplines and offers the interdis- ciplinary Honors Seminar (see IDIS courses in the course description section). The Freshman Learning Communities also foster the development of interdisciplinary insights by grouping students, faculty and courses to look at a common theme from different perspectives. Finally, every student will have the oppor - tunity for interdisciplinary study in the First- Year FSU Colloquium and/or the Advanced FSU Colloquium in the General Education Program. Experiential Learning and Internships Every program at FSU offers you the oppor - tunity to apply your knowledge to real-world situations through internships, field experi- ences, service learning, special problems courses, applied research, competitions, simulations or use of actual case studies. As you advance in your major, you will have increasing opportunities to apply your new knowledge and skills, culminating for some students in a full-time supervised internship for academic credit. See the 400 series in the course descriptions for application course offerings, though you will note that many other courses also include use of simulations and case studies. You are strongly encouraged to participate in courses that provide an opportunity for you to apply your knowledge prior to graduation and employment. Catalog Governing Graduation Requirements Please note that you are responsible for know - ing and meeting graduation requirements as stated in the catalog you are following. Graduation requirements include the basic requirements to earn a bachelor's degree, the General Education Program, and major and minor requirements. The following provisions apply to part-time as well as full-time students. 1. If you begin your college course work at Frostburg State University, you must meet the graduation requirements of the catalog in effect when you first enroll. 2. If you transfer to Frostburg State Uni-versity after having begun your college course work at another institution, you must meet the graduation requirements of the Frostburg State University catalog in effect when you first enrolled at the other institution. Or, you may choose to meet the requirements of a later Frost - burg State University catalog, provided that you indicate your choice when you are admitted to this university and that you meet all the requirements of the later catalog chosen. If you had more than two sequential years of non-enrollment since enrolling in an institution of higher education, you must meet the graduation requirements of the Frostburg State University catalog in effect at the time you first enroll at Frostburg State University. 3. If you reenter Frostburg State University after an absence of one semester or more, regardless of whether you have attended another institution in the meantime, you must meet the graduation requirements of your previous Frostburg State Univer - sity catalog. Or, you may choose to meet the requirements of a later Frostburg State University catalog, provided that you indicate your choice when you are readmitted to this university and that you meet all the requirements stated in the later catalog chosen. 4. The following qualifications apply to the provisions stated in 1-3 above: a. If the University changes a program in a way that prevents your meeting any graduation requirement as stated in your catalog, the change may neces- sitate substitutions but will not result in any increase in your requirements. b. Any substitution of a major or minor requirement must be approved by your department chair; all other exceptions to graduation requirements must be approved by the Academic Standards Subcommittee. Significant depar - tures from stated major requirements (e.g., substitution of more than one course) must also be approved by the Academic Standards Subcommittee. Substitutions must be reported with written rationale to the Registrar's Of-fice. c. If a major/minor program undergoes revision after the year in which you enroll, you may choose to substitute the new requirements in full for those which appear in the catalog of your entry year. In order to select a particular set of major/minor requirements, you must enroll in and complete course work at Frostburg State University dur - ing a term when the new requirements are in effect. The catalog under which you first enrolled at Frostburg State University shall continue to govern general education and graduation requirements other than those which apply to the major/minor program. At the time you apply for graduation you must declare in writing your intention to follow a revised program. d. If more than seven years have passed since you were last enrolled in college course work, you will have to meet the requirements of the catalog current when you re-enroll. Also, if you take longer than seven years to complete a degree, you may, after the seventh year, be subject to the catalog current at that Life Additional Academic Opportunities Special Academic Services The Office of Special Academic Services provides a wide variety of support programs that complement the University's academic programs. Services include coordination, management and promotion of the Sum- mer Session and Intersession; management and coordination of Commencements; and administration of the University's academic eligibility compliance policy for all NCAA Division III sports. You are welcome to visit the office at any time if you have questions or concerns about any of these areas. Special Academic Services is located in Room 512, Ort Library. Learning Communities FSU Connections Learning Communities introduce first-year students to the concept of critical thinking and offer the opportunity to engage in an in-depth exploration of a theme, a career or selected majors offered at FSU. In addition, learning communities provide an environment which fosters the development of support networks with fac - ulty and other students, relationships that are important contributors to academic success. Each learning community consists of one to three classes linked by theme; all communi- ties include ORIE 101 Introduction to Higher Education (an orientation seminar required of all new first-year students). Learning com- munity students take their courses together as a group during the fall semester with a maximum enrollment of 20-25 students in each community. Learning communities comprise four to nine credit hours of an average first-semester credit hour load of 12-15 hours. Enrollment is limited to enter - ing freshmen. The faculty who teach in learning communi- ties often arrange supplemental learning activities, through special \"Connections Seminars, \" that highlight the themes of the community. A vast majority of learning com-munity courses fulfill FSU's requirements in general education. For further information, contact the Office of the Provost. Part-time Study Regularly scheduled classes are available to part-time students wishing to earn college credit or to improve their professional or vo -cational competence. Information regarding part-time study may be obtained from the Office of Admissions. Like full-time students, part-time students will be required to complete testing require - ments upon entrance and will be required to complete remedial programs in the basic skills of composition, reading, and mathemat - ics if they do not achieve scores at or above prescribed levels. Summer Session and Intersession The principal mission of Frostburg State Uni-versity's Summer Session and Intersession is to provide FSU undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to enroll in a variety of high quality traditional classroom, online, internship and distance education courses that will help to ensure or accelerate your degree completion. As part of this mission, the University provides a wide variety of online classes and more specialized courses during Summer Session and Intersession that are not as available to nontraditional or part-time FSU students during the regular academic year. In addi- tion, the University offers you opportunities to pursue unique educational experiences that are difficult to schedule while enrolled in other classes. Intersession Each January the University offers a com- pressed semester allowing you to pursue course work both online and in the classroom in the General Education program, in your major (either through regular courses or via special-topics courses), or through partici- pation in international studies courses. The semester is usually 18 to 20 days long and requires intensive study due to its shortened format. Enrollment in one three-credit course is recommended, although you can register for two courses and up to six credits. All courses offered carry the same level of credit as that applied during regular semesters. To register for Intersession, you may not be on academic probation during the fall semester. In addition, athletes who are involved in competition during Intersession should seri- ously discuss with their coach the feasibility of taking courses. For full information, refer to the Intersession bulletin distributed each fall, visit the Intersession Web site or contact Special Academic Services.Summer Session From May to August each year the Univer - sity offers a program of courses during six different sessions designed to meet almost every student's needs. There is no reason for learning to stop when the weather gets hot. Summer Session is a great time to take undergraduate and graduate courses to keep your academic program on track, lighten your schedule for the next year and accelerate your progress toward a degree. You can earn college credits by registering for on-campus and online courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in many subject areas. Summer Session provides specialized courses for FSU students, students from other higher education institutions, high school students and adults from the general public who seek higher education as a means for professional and personal development. For additional information, refer to the Summer Session bulletin distributed each spring, visit the Summer Session Web site or contact Special Academic Services. USM Inter-institutional Registration Full time, undergraduate degree-seeking students may enroll in course work that enriches and augments their programs of study at other institutions in the University System of Maryland. Participants must have at least sophomore standing and a 2.0 cumula- tive GPA or above. Additional information is available in the Registrar's Office. International Education Center for International Education The Center for International Education (CIE) promotes, coordinates and supports FSU's study abroad and international student programs and sponsors international co-curricular programs on campus. The Center's Director is advised by the International Education Council consisting of students, faculty and administrators. The CIE houses information on the many study abroad op - portunities available to FSU students. CIE's resource room includes program materi - als, guides to study abroad programs and financial aid information. The Center also hosts pre-departure orientation sessions for FSU students participating in study abroad programs. The Center serves the FSU inter - national student community by providing orientation programs for new F-1 and J-1 im- migration regulations and procedures and extracurricular programming. Study Abroad Programs at Frostburg State University Currently, you may choose from a wide range of study abroad programs that are designed to suit a variety of academic and financial needs. Most students study abroad during their junior year, although it is possible to arrange programs during the sophomore or senior year as well. Programs vary in length and academic focus. Some programs are de - signed specifically for graduate students. Par - ticipation in an FSU-approved study abroad program assures that CIE will assist you with the transfer of academic credit to FSU upon your return. Interested students are advised to attend the bi-annual study abroad fairs in September and March, visit the CIE Office for individual guidance in choosing a program, or attend one of the weekly CIE study abroad information sessions. For further information, either phone the CIE Office at 301.687.4714 or visit the CIE web page at www.frostburg. edu/admin/cie/. Other Opportunities Abroad In addition to the traditional study abroad programs mentioned above, you may par - ticipate in programs that allow students to travel abroad, work abroad, participate in volunteer projects or service learning proj- ects abroad or complete internships abroad. Some of these programs may offer academic credit. Programs are offered by other univer - sities, government and non-governmental organizations and international education organizations. The CIE resource room and website provide students with resources to identify programs of interest, and help students apply to participate. Study Abroad Scholarships Most FSU-sponsored or -affiliated semester or year-long study abroad programs allow students to use their financial aid packages. In addition, the Center for International Education awards scholarships to students who meet specific eligibility requirements. Scholarships in the amount of $500 and $1,000 per semester or session are awarded twice a year for programs taking place during the fall and spring semesters, the academic year, the intersession and the summer ses-sion. The Harold R. Rowe and Alan and Jane Wickert Scholarships of the FSU Foundation are available to support study abroad. The CIE also provides information on state, federal and other international scholarships, such as the Gilman Scholarship (for Pell Grant recipients), and scholarships through Rotary, NSEP and FSU-affiliated study abroad pro -gram providers. CIE is the campus support center for Fulbright awards for graduate study abroad. Students may apply at the CIE office. International Student Services at FSU Each semester Frostburg State University hosts a number of international students from all over the world. Faculty and scholars from international universities also join the FSU teaching faculty. In addition to provid- ing services in dealing with immigration and visa regulations, employment, academic counseling, and orientation programs, the CIE organizes social events and weekend excursions for international students. The CIE also administers the Harold R. Rowe Scholarship program which awards fund - ing to a number of international students each semester. Awards are available both to incoming and returning F-1 degree-seeking international students. For further informa-tion, call the Center for International Educa- tion at 301.687.4714 or visit the CIE web site at www.frostburg.edu/admin/cie/. Enrollment of Undergraduates in Graduate Courses Frostburg State University undergraduates may take no more than 7 credits in graduate courses for graduate credit prior to comple - tion of the bachelor's degree requirements. To enroll in a graduate course, you must be a senior with at least a 2.5 grade point aver - age and must have the recommendation of your advisor. Registration for graduate courses will be completed under the direction of the Reg-istrar's Office as a separate registration and will not be included in your undergraduate registration. If you are a full-time undergradu-ate student taking a graduate course during the academic year, you will not be required to pay tuition for the graduate course since you will pay tuition and fees as a full-time undergraduate. Credit earned in a graduate course may be considered only as graduate credit and may not be used as undergraduate credit for the baccalaureate degree. The credit, although technically graduate credit, may not be used for a graduate degree at Frostburg State Uni-versity unless it later becomes part of your graduate requirements. Exceptions to these policies are made only for students who are admitted to a combined baccalaureate-master's program at Frostburg State University or for programs that have received an exemption to these require - ments. See the degree program listings for descriptions of current programs, selection criteria, and exceptions allowed. Graduate Studies You may pursue such degree programs as M.B.A., M.Ed., M.A.T. and M.S. Most students study part-time in the evening. The Master of Arts in Teaching is offered as an intensive, year-long, full time program. You may enroll in courses and complete programs at the main campus in Frostburg or at the USM in Hagerstown. See the Graduate Catalog for further infor - mation. Post-Baccalaureate Study at the Undergraduate Level In addition to its graduate programs, FSU also offers undergraduate opportunities for bachelor's degree holders who wish to extend their baccalaureate education. Please note the limitations on transfer credit described elsewhere in this catalog.

In the event that the additional major would culminate in a degree other than the first degree earned by the student, a second diploma will be issued by the Registrar's Office. For details, check with the Registrar's Office one semester before the anticipated completion of the ad-ditional major. Teaching Certification If you already have a bachelor's degree and wish to pursue teaching certification at Frost - burg State University, your options are to: 1. Complete all the requirements of a Mary - land state approved program in teacher education as a second major (FSU graduates) or a second baccalaureate degree (graduates of other institutions). 2. Complete the Master of Arts in Teaching, including any undergraduate course work deficiencies. Information about the Master of Arts in Teaching is available from the Depart - ment of Educational Professions and in the FSU Graduate Catalog. 3. If you wish to teach in a state other than Maryland, it is your responsibility to ascertain if a Maryland state approved program will meet certification requirements. General Course Work: Bachelor's degree holders, like any other academically qualified students, may take general course work at FSU provided that they have the proper prerequisites, have been duly admitted to the university, and have paid the requisite fees. Interested students should apply through the Admissions Office. Certificate Programs Degree-seeking undergraduates and non-degree-seeking community members may earn a certificate in several specialized areas. Certificate programs are designed to provide specialized skills and knowledge that may enhance your undergraduate program and/or provide skills useful in employment. Un- dergraduate certificates include a minimum of 12 credit hours. If you are a currently enrolled, degree-seeking undergraduate student, you may declare your intent to complete a certificate by contacting the chair of the department that offers the program and on the application for gradua- tion. You must meet all prerequisites stated by the offering department for the particular certificate. If you are not currently an FSU student, you may be admitted as a non-degree-seeking student to complete a certificate program. You must file an admission application and present evidence that you have a high school diploma or GED, or that you have been ap - proved to participate in the dual enrollment high school/college program. Particular certificate programs may have additional admission requirements. Credits earned towards a certificate may later be applied to a degree if you choose to request admis- sion, and are accepted, as a degree-seeking student. Credits also are transferable. In order to earn a formal certificate, you must: 1. Earn at least one-half of the credit hours required in the certificate through course work or special departmental exams of- fered by Frostburg State University, and 2. Earn a minimum of a 2.0 grade point average in courses required in the cer - tificate and completed at Frostburg State University. (Exceptions to these standards may apply in the case of collaborative programs.) Successful completion of a certificate pro - gram will be noted on your official Frostburg State University transcript. You also will receive a paper certificate to document your accomplishment. The following certificate programs currently are offered. See the descriptions, and any spe - cial admission, prerequisite, and academic standards in the individual descriptions in the Courses of Study section of this catalog. 1. Addictions Counseling (Psychology) 2. Computer Print Graphics (Visual Arts) 3. Computing Technology (Computer Science) 4. Software Development (Computer Science) 5. Programming (Computer Science) 6. Networking (Computer Science) 7. International Area Studies (International Studies) 8. Professional Writing (English) 9. Public Administration (Political Science) 10. Leadership in Psychology (open to degree-seeking students only) 11. Child and Family (currently open only to degree-seeking Psychology majors) Pre-Baccalaureate Programs Get a head start on your college career! In addition to accepting AP and IB credit (see section on credit-by-exam), Frostburg State University welcomes talented high school students who want to take advantage of opportunities to complete college courses while in high school or the summer after graduation. Frostburg State University offers a limited number of college-level courses in Allegany County high schools. You take the same course and must meet the same standards as you would on campus. If you are an area high school student, you also may be admit - ted as a non-degree seeking student to take courses on the FSU campus. You must have the recommendation of your high school to participate in either of these programs. Credit is recorded on an official FSU transcript for application to an FSU degree or for transfer. The SOFI Program (Summer Online Fresh- man Initiative) allows incoming freshmen to take popular introductory courses before the start of the fall semester. You register for SOFI courses during your scheduled Preview FSU session in June as you plan your fall class schedule with the assistance of faculty advi-sors. SOFI courses take place during Frostburg State University's second six-week summer session. You may participate wherever you are because SOFI courses are AcAdemic lifeAcademic Regulations & Procedures Student Academic Responsibility You, the student, are responsible for planning your academic program and for meeting the requirements of the University and of departments. This responsibility includes developing a complete understanding of, and following all degree requirements, academic regulations, and procedures. You must obtain, retain, and consult regularly the sections from the applicable catalog that govern your graduation requirements. The degree requirements specified in the catalog assigned to you at the time of admission or readmission serve as a two-way contract between you and the University. The contract specifies that the basic requirements to earn a bachelor's degree, the General Education Program, and major and minor requirements will not be changed as long as you complete a degree within seven years of the time of your initial enrollment in college. In turn, you are responsible for meeting these requirements. The academic regulations and procedures described in this chapter may change during the period of your enrollment, and it is your responsibility to be aware of, and follow the academic regulations and procedures currently in effect. All changes in regulations and procedures will be published in official University publications such as the Undergraduate Catalog and Registration Guide, with prior notice of changes provided. You are assigned an academic advisor, whose role is to assist you in planning the academic program and in interpreting degree requirements and academic regulations. It is your responsibility to confer regularly with your advisor. The advisor will provide the best, most current information possible, but, ultimately, it is your responsibility to request and use this advice wisely and to meet graduation requirements and academic regulations. After you declare a major, you are assigned an academic advisor in the department in which you desire to major. It is your responsibility to promptly declare or change your major so that an appropriate advisor can be assigned. See the chair of the department in which you wish to major to declare or change your major or to change your advisor.Academic Advising Policies and Procedures At Frostburg, you always will have an aca- demic advisor to assist you in realizing your academic and career goals. You are encour - aged to see your advisor regularly to discuss your current academic work and future plans, to ask for advice about any problem you encounter, and to find out about other services on campus that are available to sup - port your academic success. You will need to see your advisor at least once per semester prior to registration to plan your schedule for the next term. Your advisor will activate your registration status in PAWS (the Student Administration computer system) so you can register and drop/add on the web. Most advisors post appointment sheets outside their office doors prior to registration, or you can call or e-mail your advisor to make an appointment. Plan ahead to make your advising experience successful. If you enter FSU as a first-time college stu- dent, you should plan to come to Preview FSU, our freshman orientation program. At Preview FSU, you will work with an experi-enced faculty advisor who enjoys, and is spe - cially trained, to work with first time students. During your first semester, your advisor will be the instructor of your ORIE 101, Introduction to Higher Education, class. ORIE instructors/ advisors include faculty and administrators who volunteer to assist in your transition to college. You will see your ORIE advisor at least once a week, so take advantage of this contact to ask any question you have. Whenever you are ready, you may officially declare your major. You then will be assigned a faculty advisor in your major department. If you aren't ready to declare your major, your ORIE instructor will continue to advise you until you do, or you may work with the Center for Advising and Career Services (Sand Spring Hall, 301.687.3132). If you enter FSU as a transfer student, and know what major you want to pursue, you will be advised by the department chair or a designated faculty member during transfer orientation/initial registration. You then will be assigned your regular faculty advisor. If you aren't sure about your major, you will work with the Advising Center staff, who are trained to work with exploratory students, until you are ready to declare your major. If all goes well, your major advisor will work with you throughout your academic career. But always remember that you can change your major, or request a change of advisor, at any time. Talk to the chair of the depart - ment that offers your major if you want to make a change.Academic Regulations life Registration The Academic Calendar lists the registration schedule for each semester and summer ses- sion. You may change your schedule within the period prescribed in the Calendar. You must satisfy your financial obligations to the University to complete registration. Class Standing Students achieve class standing according to the following table: Freshman 0-29 semester hours earned Sophomore 30-59 semester hours earned Junior 60-89 semester hours earned Senior 90+ semester hours earned Course Load The unit of course work is the semester hour, defined as the normal amount of work done in one 50-minute class period and two hours of outside preparation a week for one semester. The normal full-time load is 15-17.5 semester hours of credit. The minimum load for a full- time student is 12 semester hours of credit; the maximum, 17.5 hours. If you carry fewer than 12 semester hours of credit you will be classified as a part-time student. To enroll for more than 17.5 semester hours of credit, you must have earned an FSU cumula- tive G.P .A. of 3.0 or above, have completed at least one semester of course work at FSU, and have the written permission of your advisor. Exceptions to these overload guidelines shall be made only upon recommendation of the advisor and the approval of the department chair (or Associate Provost if the student has not declared a major). Forms for requesting an overload must be submitted prior to registration. You will not be able to register for an overload without permission. Course Changes (Drop/add/withdrawal) You may change your registration (add or drop a course or change sections or credits) using PAWS (The Web-based student infor - mation system) from the time of registration through the first week of classes (or the equivalent proportion of class days in a ses-sion that is shorter than a semester) if the course or section added has openings. If the course is closed, you must request an over - ride from the department chair involved. You may not add courses after the first week of classes (or equivalent).You are responsible for dropping/adding courses/sections at all times. Failure to do so will result in a grade of FX in the course or section \"dropped\" and no credit in the course or section \"added. \" However, if you are enrolled in a class and miss the first class meeting without notifying the instructor/ department, the department chair at his/her discretion has the authority to drop you from the course if other students are waiting for space in the class. All other drops must be initiated by you. After the first week of classes, to drop a class, you must complete the change-of-course form and file it with the Registrar's Office. If you drop a course during the first 60 percent of a term (beginning with the first day of classes), you will receive a W . Exact dates governing withdrawal from a course without penalty appear in the Academic Calendar. After this period if you drop a course, the WF and W described below will apply. See the section \"Withdrawal from the University\" for a description of the process for withdrawing from all of your classes. WF \u2014 withdrew-failing \u2014 for official with- drawal from a course after the first 60 percent of a term. (USED in computation of average.) W \u2014 withdrew \u2014 with approval of the Dean of the College offering the course, who will grant approval only under exceptional circumstances (e.g. serious illness) docu - mented by the student, after consultation with the instructor of the course. The Dean will notify the academic advisor if a W is ap - proved. A W will not be considered after the last day of classes. (NOT used in computation of average.)Class Attendance Faculty members individually set their policy on class attendance. You must understand clearly the attendance policy of each of your instructors and act accordingly. You are responsible for explaining the reason for any absence to your instructor. If at all possible, contact the instructor prior to your absence. The Health Center does not issue verification notices for routine treatment. In cases of sig-nificant or prolonged impairment, the Center will provide appropriate written verification of treatment at your request. If forced by an emergency to be absent from classes, you may notify the Office of the Vice President for Student and Educational Services, which will keep such information on file should instructors wish to confirm your absence. Absences for Religious Observances It is the policy of Frostburg State University that the academic programs and services of the University shall be available to all quali- fied students who have been admitted to its programs, regardless of their religious beliefs. Students shall not be penalized because of observance of their religious holidays and shall be given an opportunity to make up, within a reasonable time period, any academ- ic assignment that is missed due to individual participation in religious observances. It is the responsibility of the student to notify his/ her instructor of conflicts between religious observances and scheduled AcAdemic lifeAbsences for Activities The faculty recognize the value of such ac - tivities as attendance at meetings of regional and national scholastic and professional organizations, participation in University-sponsored dramatic or musical events, and varsity athletics. If you participate in such activities and incur class absences because of them, you are responsible for notifying your instructors in advance of such absences. An instructor who has any question regarding your absence for such activities may call the faculty member or other person responsible for the activity. If you are on academic probation, you may not incur class absences for non-credit activities without prior permission of your instructors. Since field trips connected with activities offered for academic credit are a part of the academic program, you are eligible regard-less of your grade average. Attendance at Another Institution Once you enroll as a degree candidate at Frostburg State University, you must request prior permission to pursue course work at another institution and transfer it into your program at Frostburg State. This procedure is for your protection to ensure that course work is transferable, is equivalent to the course for which you seek credit, and meets the re - quirement you want to fulfill. Once you are a degree-seeking student at FSU, you can only transfer equivalents of the specific courses in the FSU general education program for general education credit and equivalents of the specific courses in your major or minor for program credit. If you have 0-89 total credits earned (includ- ing previous transfer credit, credits in which you currently are enrolled at FSU or elsewhere, and the requested credits off-campus), you must follow these procedures: 1. Obtain a list of course offerings and catalog descriptions for the course(s) you want to take at another institution. 2. Complete the Authorization to Attend Another Institution Form in the Regis- trar's Office. 3. Have course equivalencies determined by the Transfer Credit Officer in the Ad- missions Office. 4. Return the form to the Registrar's Office for official signature. 5. Take the approval form to registration at the other institution.6. After completion of the course work, have an official transcript forwarded from the other institution to Frostburg State University. In addition to the steps noted above, the following special rules apply: If you have 90 or more total credits (includ- ing previous transfer credits and credits in which you currently are enrolled at FSU or elsewhere), you may transfer a maximum of seven additional credits of general education or general elective course work, provided that you still earn a minimum of 30 credits towards the degree at Frostburg State Univer - sity. These credits may include courses that count toward the major or minor only if you will earn half of your major or minor credits at Frostburg State University. After you have a total of 90 or more credits: 1. Your academic advisor (or department chair/coordinator) must give prior ap - proval for additional transferred credits of general education or general elective course work. 2. Your department chair or coordinator must give prior approval for additional transferred course work that counts toward the major or minor. If you have 70 credits transferred from two-year colleges, you cannot transfer additional credit from a two-year college. This is a State regulation and no exceptions are allowed. Exceptions to the rules specified above require a written appeal to the Academic Standards Subcommittee at least one month prior to the term in which you wish to study at another institution.Auditors To be an auditor (one enrolled for non-credit instruction in a course), ordinarily you must have earned a place on the Dean's List (at least a 3.40 average) the preceding semes-ter. You also may request to audit a class in which you previously have received credit if a period of time has elapsed since you enrolled in the course and you wish to refresh your knowledge prior to enrolling in a sequence course. Finally, if you are a non-degree stu-dent enrolling in a course for personal enrich- ment you may enroll as an auditor. You are charged the same tuition and fees for audit courses as for credit courses. You may be an auditor only if you have the consent of the instructor, ordinarily your advisor, and the Associate Provost and if space is available. If the space is needed, registrants for credit may supplant auditors. As an auditor, you are expected to attend regularly but do not participate in class discussion except upon request. You are not required to write papers or take quizzes, tests, or examinations. No credit or grade will be earned, but the audited course when com- pleted will carry the symbol AU (Audited). You are not eligible for credit by examination to cover a course you have audited. Courses which have been audited may not be taken for credit. To be admitted to class as an auditor, you must be officially registered. You may se - cure approval to audit through the life Testing The University provides testing programs designed to help students through their academic careers. As a result of these mea- surements of aptitude and achievement, students with varied personal and educa-tional backgrounds can evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses. Because other colleges throughout the country administer these same tests, it is possible to compare FSU students with other college students objectively. The University makes use of this knowledge in planning the curriculum and in advising students about their programs. Testing for First-year Students A. SAT: To enroll in the University, you are required to submit the results from the College Board SAT. Take these tests at any convenient center on one of the dates assigned by the College Entrance Examination Board. Get detailed information at local high schools. If you take the American College Tests, it is recom-mended that you request a transcript of the results be sent to the University. Individual departments may also require achievement tests in their areas to be taken after you have been accepted to the University. B. Testing Policies of FSU: 1. All entering first-time students will be administered diagnostic placement tests in reading, writing and mathematics to determine their strengths and weak - nesses in those areas. Transfer students with more than 12 credits who have not transferred Freshman Composition and/or a college-level mathematics course will also be required to take the appropri- ate diagnostic placement test(s).2. If you earn below a predetermined standard on these examinations, you will be required to participate in specified courses in your first semester to develop your skills to a level which is expected of all entering students. You may not withdraw from these courses unless you are withdrawing from the University. If you are unsuccessful, you must re-enroll in the relevant course(s) in your second semester, and in each subsequent se - mester until you receive a P or C grade in the course. If you receive an F or FX in the second semester (or any subsequent semester of required enrollment) you will be academically dismissed from the University. Senior Testing Some graduate schools and advanced pro - fessional programs may require aptitude or achievement test scores for admission. Most of the commonly needed tests such as the Graduate Record Exam and Graduate Management Admissions Test are given on campus. The PRAXIS exam, which is required for Maryland certification as well as for certi-fication in several other states, is also offered. Dates for these tests are publicized on cam- pus. Further information about these and other tests is available in Counseling and Psychological Services. Non-Graded Assessment Requirements Assessment is the evaluation of learning used to improve teaching and academic programs. It is designed to identify patterns of strengths and weaknesses in student learning so that changes can be made that will benefit students. Some non-graded as-sessment activities may be voluntary, others may be required for graduation. Credit by Examination In addition to earning credit at FSU or transferring course credit from other ac - credited institutions, you may acquire up to 30 additional credits through examination. Examinations accepted include: Advanced Placement Examinations, College Level Examination Programs (CLEP), the Interna-tional Baccalaureate Programme and special departmental examinations. Students who believe they may qualify for credit by exam must take the examination prior to signing up for the course. See the Policies section of this catalog for details on credit by exam procedures. Transcripts of Records To obtain an official transcript, fill out the proper form in the Registrar's Office or file a request online through your PAWS account. Official transcripts will be forwarded to desig-nated parties or may be picked up in person. Withdrawal From the University To leave the University, you must withdraw officially by completing the following pro - cedure. Failure to follow this procedure may jeopardize the right to withdrawal without penalty and to any refunds (see Refunds Policy in the catalog section on Expenses). To withdraw from the University prior to the end of the drop/add period for the semester in which you are enrolled, you must notify the Registrar's Office in writing. That office will remove you from your classes and notify the Business Office that you will not be attending the current semester. You must contact the Business Office to arrange any refund that may be due to you. If you withdraw after the end of the drop/ add period for a semester in which you are enrolled, your permanent academic record will always carry one of the following nota-tions, as well as the date on which withdrawal procedures were completed. You will receive a W in each class if you withdraw within the first 60 percent of a term; W or WF depend- ing on the circumstances surrounding your withdrawal after the first 60 percent of a term; or FX, unofficial withdrawal. A W or WF will not be considered after the last day of classes. To be eligible for the W after the first 60 percent of a term, you must provide of extenuating circum- stances (such as medical problems) to the Office of the Vice President for Student and Educational Services. With approval of the Office of the Provost, the Registrar's Office will post a W for all courses and notify all other relevant campus offices of your withdrawal. If you withdraw without notification, the date of withdrawal will not be known, and you will not be entitled to Ws on your transcript; grades will reflect instructors' appraisal of your overall performance, usually FX. If you officially withdraw from the University near the end of a semester because of aca-demic difficulty and receive WFs in courses for which you were registered, you may, as a result of your new cumulative grade point average, be academically dismissed from the University. Once you withdraw, particularly for reasons other than medical, the University is not obliged to readmit you. Readmission espe - cially will not be approved if you withdraw to circumvent regulations. Call to Active Military Duty A student called to active military duty during a national or international crisis or conflict should inform the University of the reason for his/her withdrawal prior to leaving, including presentation of copies of appropriate military orders, in order to benefit from special poli- cies and procedures governing interruption of one's academic career for such military service. Please contact any one of the follow - ing offices. The designated contact person in each office will assist in facilitating your withdrawal and will contact other offices to insure that special exemptions concerning refunds and W or I grades are applied: Veterans' Affairs Sand Spring Hall 110 Phone: 301.687.4409 301.687.4311 Fax: 301.687.4937 Leave of Absence If you withdraw from Frostburg State Uni-versity with the intent to return within a semester or a year, you may request a leave of absence. If you are on an official leave of absence, you will continue to receive com- munications from the University, will not have to submit a readmission application or admissions deposit, and will be able to participate at the same time as continuing students in such activities as registration and the housing lottery. You must notify the Financial Aid Office that you are on leave, and file financial aid and scholarship applications by the regular deadlines. To be eligible for a leave of absence, you must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average at the end of your last term of enrollment, and have no judicial system penalties or charges pending. You may obtain an application for a leave of absence at the Registrar's Office. The application requests information about the reasons you are requesting a leave, what activities you plan during the leave, and for how long you are requesting a leave (one calendar year maximum). Your advisor will need to sign off on your application, which you then must return to the Registrar's Of-fice no later than the last day of the drop/ add (late registration) period in your first semester of leave. If you are planning study at another college during your leave, you must complete an Authorization to Attend Another Institution form (available in the Registrar's Office) and obtain the required approvals. See the sec - tion of this catalog on Attendance at Another Institution concerning the rules for transfer of credit for students seeking a degree at FSU. If you plan study abroad during your leave, you must use the procedures currently in place for international study, administered by the Center for International Education. You must keep the University informed of your permanent and local addresses during your leave in order to receive the privileges specified. If you do not enroll at the Univer - sity at the end of the time period specified in your leave request, you will need to go through the readmission process whenever you return. Graduation To graduate with a baccalaureate degree, you must earn a minimum of 120 semester hours of credit and fulfill all degree requirements. Carrying a normal load of 15 semester hours of credit each semester, you can complete a degree program in eight semesters. You may graduate in fewer than eight semesters by attending summer sessions and/or Interses- sion, or by carrying more than 15 semester hours per semester. To accelerate, you should plan your program well in advance with your advisor. You may enroll as a part-time student, car - rying as many as 11 semester hours in the regular program. To graduate on a given date, you must make application on a form furnished by the Reg-istrar's Office (also available online in PAWS). Submit the application to the Registrar's Office when you complete 70 credit hours, or at least one year prior to your proposed graduation date. To participate in commencement, you must have successfully completed, or be enrolled in the semester prior to the ceremony, in all course work required for you to complete your degree. If you complete your degree requirements in January or May, you are eligible to participate in the May commence - ment ceremony. If you complete your degree requirements in July, August, or December, you are eligible to participate in the Decem- ber ceremony. Exceptions to these rules require a written request to the Registrar's Office at least three weeks prior to the commencement ceremony, accompanied by evidence that you have enrolled in, and paid tuition for, course work that will meet the remaining requirements during the summer session immediately following May commencement or the January Intersession immediately fol-lowing December commencement. Permis- sion will be granted only if you have no more than two courses totaling no more than nine credits remaining to complete your degree and have a 2.0 cumulative FSU grade point average and a 2.0 cumulative FSU grade point average in your major at the time of the request, as determined by the official degree audit performed by the Registrar. Participation in commencement does not confer a degree. Your degree will be posted on your official transcript and you will receive a diploma only after you have documented that you have met all degree requirements. Graduation With Honors If you have completed at least 50 credits at this University with a high cumulative grade point average, your scholastic achievement is recognized in the honors degree, awarded as follows: Cum Laude from 3.400 ARdsAcAdemic life Academic Standards Grades Your progress as a student is evaluated and officially reported at the end of each semester. Letter grades are used to record achievement. Generally, grades represent standards of comprehension of knowledge and the ability to communicate knowledge, and are recorded on your permanent record at the end of each semester. The grading symbols used at Frostburg State University are as follows: A Superior B Above average C Average D Passing, but below average F Failure P Pass W Withdrew WF Withdrew after the withdrawal deadline (counts as an F, failure) FX Withdrew unofficially (counts as an F, failure) NC No credit I Incomplete AU Audit (no credit earned) NR Grade not provided by instructor CS Continued Study Required (you must enroll in a course which satisfies the requirement in the next semester). Only available in English and mathematics courses that meet Core Skills Require - ments. N Non-pass (not permitted except where P/N is the only method of evaluation for a particular course) AP , CE, CL, IB, PT - Pass by examination Incompletes The grade I (Incomplete) may be given at the instructor's discretion in exceptional, documented cases if, after completing most of the work in a course, because of illness or other reasons beyond your control, you are unable to complete the remaining course requirements. An I may be removed and another grade substituted if you complete the course requirements to the instructor's satisfaction within six weeks of the beginning of the following semester. If you fail to remove the Incomplete within the prescribed period, the I will automatically be replaced by an F on your permanent record. It is your responsibil- ity to make arrangements to complete the course requirements for the removal of the I.Withdrawal W-Withdrew; WF-Withdrew After Deadline (Failing); FX-Withdrew Unofficially (Failing). The FX will be given only if you have failed to withdraw or drop officially or have stopped going to class prior to the end of the semester. Failure to pass the course because you did not take the final exam or complete other course requirements will be recorded as an F grade rather than an FX. NC Grade The grade NC (No Credit) is to be used at an instructor's option (instead of a grade of F) if you have put forth effort to master the content of the course but have not achieved at a level to warrant a grade above F. The NC grade may be used only if you have earned fewer than 60 credits at the end of the term preceding the term in which the NC is earned. Limited Pass/Fail Option You may take only one course per semester on the Pass/Fail Option and no more than four courses Pass/Fail during your college career. You will receive the grade of P for each of these courses passed. Credits earned in a course in which a P is received will be counted toward the number of semester hours of credit required for graduation. If you fail to do passing work in such a course, you will be graded F. The grade of P will not be used in the computation of cumulative grade point average; a grade of F will be computed. Upon approval of your advisor, at final regis- tration or up to eleven class days following registration, you may elect the P/F option for a course by submitting a form to the Registrar's Office. At no time during the semester will an instructor be informed by any administrative office which students are enrolled for P/F credit. The instructor will assign grades of A, B, C, D, FX, or F to each student, and the Registrar's Office will then enter grades of P for students earning A, B, C, or D but will retain a grade of FX or F. If you wish to transfer or attend graduate school where letter grades are necessary, you may request, in writing, that the Registrar's Office provide letter grades for those courses in which a P was recorded. Courses in the undergraduate program may be taken for P/F credit with the following restrictions: 1. The P/F option is not permitted to be used in the General Education Program.2. The P/F option may not be used for any course taught by your major or minor department or which fulfills your major or minor requirements, including those courses which are required by, but of- fered outside of, the major or minor department. 3. If you are on academic probation, you are not eligible to enroll in a course on a P/F basis. 4. You may not elect to take more than one course per semester for P/F credit. The total number of courses you may elect to take for P/F credits is four. 5. Once registered in a course on a P/F basis, you may not later choose to take the course on the conventional letter-grade system, except as noted in number 6 below. 6. If you change your academic program so that a course previously taken for P/F credit becomes a requirement for a major, minor, or a professional program, you will receive the conventional grade originally reported by the instructor. 7. You may drop a P/F course the same as any other course. 8. You are subject to the same prerequisites and requirements for the course as is the student enrolled in the course under the standard grading system. 9. To be eligible for the Dean's List, you must take 12 semester hours of graded credit; thus 9 graded credits and 3 credits on a P/F basis do not qualify you for consid- eration. Specifically, the P/F option may be used only for elective courses outside of the Gen-eral Education Program, majors, minors, and concentrations. Mid-semester Warnings Faculty members will assess students' prog- ress in all 100- and 200-level courses, and in all courses that meet Core Skills Require - ments in the General Education Program, prior to mid-semester. Students performing at the D or F quality level will be issued a mid-semester warning early in the seventh week of classes. Students are responsible for discussing their performance with their instructors lifeGrade Points and Grade Point Averages A four-point system is used to indicate qual- ity of academic work through a grade point average: Grade points per semester hour A 4 B 3 C 2 D 1 F, WF, FX 0 Grades of P , PT, N, NR, NC, I, W, AU, and CS are not used in computation of averages. The grade point average for a semester is determined by dividing the total number of grade points by the total number of semester hours graded with A, B, C, D, F, WF, and FX that semester. The cumulative grade point average is found by dividing the total grade points earned in all courses completed at Frostburg State University by the total number of semester hours graded with A, B, C, D, F, WF, and FX at FSU. For example: a junior has attempted 80 semester hours at Frostburg and has earned a total of 192 grade points. The cumulative GPA is 2.40. If a course is repeated, the last grade earned is included in the computation. (See Course Repetition section below.) As with most colleges and universities, credit hours earned at other institutions are accepted for transfer but grades are not. Consequently, the grades from transfer credits are not computed into the cumula- tive grade point average at FSU. However, academic progress is expected according to the total credit hours earned, including transfer credits. Calculation of GPA in Major: 1. All courses taken in the major depart-ment count in calculating the grade point average for that major (unless specifically excluded). 2. Courses required for the major but taken outside the major department are not counted in the computation, unless specified in the catalog description of the major requirements. 3. Interdisciplinary majors, however, count all courses specifically listed as meeting the requirements for the major. Interdis- ciplinary majors include Environmental Analysis and Planning, Earth Science, Ethnobotany, International Studies, Law and Society, Liberal Studies, Social Sci-ence and Urban and Regional Planning.4. Prior written approval of the advisor and the department chair is required to repeat a course in which a satisfactory grade has been earned (whether a grade is considered \"satisfactory\" in a given major is defined by each department). 5. If a course is repeated, the last grade earned is included in the computation. (See Course Repetition section below.) Calculation of GPA in Minor: Grades earned in all core and elective course options that can be applied toward minor requirements are used in calculating the grade point average. Course Repetition and Grading A course may be counted toward graduation requirements only once regardless of how many times it is repeated unless the officially approved course description states that the course can be repeated for credit. Beginning with courses repeated in fall 2007 and after, when you repeat coursework in which you earned a grade of A, B, C, D, F, FX or WF, the last grade earned, whether higher or lower, will count in your cumulative grade point average. Only a grade of A, B, C, D, F, FX, WF, or P (in courses where all students are graded P/F) can replace the previous grade earned. The earlier grade will continue to appear on your transcript, but the credit hours attempted or earned and the grade earned in the previous attempt will not be used in calculating the cumulative grade point average and cumulative credits. The coursework must be repeated at Frostburg State University. (See the special rule above concerning approvals required for course repetitions in your major.) Change of Grades A faculty member desiring to change a student's grade that has already been re - corded with the Registrar must submit to the Registrar a Change of Grade form stating the reasons for the change. If the change of grade is not from \"I\" (incomplete) to a letter grade, the form must be approved by the Chair of the Department (or the Dean of the College if the Chair is the instructor) in which the course resides. All grade changes must be made within six weeks of the beginning of the following se - mester. No grade changes are allowed after this date except in the case of an ongoing grade grievance that has reached Stage II; a late withdrawal due to documented extenu-ating circumstances; or, in exceptional cases, with the approval of the Dean of the College that offers the course. Faculty and students should raise issues about grades immediately upon recording and receipt. Dean's List Shortly after the end of each semester, the Dean of each School announces the names of students recorded on the Dean's List. The list includes all students who have earned a grade point average of at least 3.40 with at least 12 semester hours of graded credit for the And dismissAlAcAdemic life Standards Governing Academic Probation and Dismissal A cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is the minimum standard acceptable for work leading to a bachelor's degree. If your cumulative GPA falls below 2.0, you will be placed on academic probation or be subject to academic dismissal. Review of Student Records Your records will be reviewed for possible dismissal at the end of the fall and spring semesters and the second six-week sum- mer session. If you do not meet prescribed standards at the end of the spring semester, you will be so informed, but you will be permitted to attend any summer session except the third four-week session. You will need to meet the standard prescribed for your number of earned hours and number of semesters on probation no later than the end of the second six-week session or you will be dismissed and not allowed to apply for readmission until the following summer. Academic Dismissal You will be dismissed for unsatisfactory scholarship if any one of the following con- ditions applies: 1. Your earned cumulative grade point average is 0.0. 2. You fail to meet the basic skill standard in reading, writing and/or mathematics (as defined in the section of the catalog on testing policies). 3. You fail at least half of the semester hours of credit in any single semester while on academic probation. 4. You fail to meet the minimum academic progress standard for your number of earned hours while on academic proba- tion. (See table on this page.) 5. You remain on academic probation for three successive semesters without achieving a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0. Any enrollment in a summer session counts as one semester on probation. Dismissal Conditions 1. You will not be allowed to enroll at Frostburg State University for at least two semesters. The summer sessions are considered the equivalent of one semester. 2. After the minimum two-semester dis-missal period, you are eligible to apply for readmission through the Admissions Office. Readmission is not guaranteed. (See the section on readmission in the admissions section of the catalog.) Dismissal Appeals You may appeal your dismissal for unsatisfac - tory scholarship. To do so: 1. Submit a letter of appeal to the Academic Standards Subcommittee, c/o the Associ-ate Provost, who serves as Chair. 2. You must submit your letter of appeal and all documentation by the deadline specified in the academic dismissal no - tice. Letters of appeal received after the deadline will not be considered. 3. Your letter of appeal must demonstrate that your poor academic performance has resulted directly from serious physi- cal, emotional or other personal prob - lems. You must detail the reasons for your poor academic performance and provide documentation of the existence of the problems. You must show that the prob - lems described have been addressed and that there is reason to believe that these problems will no longer affect your academic performance. 4. The University reserves the right to deny the dismissal appeal of any student whose former records and/or observed conduct are incongruent with the estab - lished guidelines for student behavior and academic responsibility at Frostburg State University. 5. If you are reinstated on appeal, you will have to agree to meet specified condi- tions listed in the response to your ap - peal. Academic Probation 1. If you have earned a cumulative grade point average above 0.00, but below 2.0, you will be placed on academic proba- tion. 2. If you are a first-time FSU student placed on probation whose GPA is less than 1.40, you must meet with an assigned advisor to develop an academic recovery plan, and may enroll in no more than 13 credit hours during the following semester. Aca-demic recovery plans must be submitted to the Associate Provost. 3. You will be allowed to continue to enroll on academic probation if you meet the minimum academic progress standard for your number of earned hours (see table on this page), but for no longer than three successive semesters. 4. If you are on academic probation during the fall semester, you may not register for January Intersession courses. If you are on academic probation during the spring semester, or are placed on aca-demic probation at the end of the spring semester, you may not register for the third four-week summer session. Minimum Academic Progress Standards The minimum academic progress standards you must meet in order to be continued on academic probation are as follows: Total Hours earned = all earned hours, graded and ungraded, including transfer credits. 2Cumulative FSU GPA = all letter grades (A, B, C, D, F , FX, WF) earned in all courses attempted at Frostburg State University, excluding prior grades in courses repeated at FSU and grade forgiveness. Enrollment at schools other than FSU can not improve the GPA because credits, not grades, transfer from these institutions. Academic Warning If your semester GPA falls below 1.5 and your cumulative GPA is below 2.5 you will be placed on academic warning, and must meet the warning conditions specified below. Additional Probation and Warning Conditions If you are on academic probation or warning, the following rules apply: 1. You may not enroll for more than 15 credit hours per semester. 2. You must have your course schedule and load reviewed and approved by your academic advisor. You must meet regularly with your advisor throughout the semester. (The Academic Standards Subcommittee seriously considers the written report of your advisor should you be subject to academic AcAdemic lifeAcademic Eligibility for Athletes As a student-athlete, you must be eligible according to the regulations of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the aca- demic eligibility standards of Frostburg State University. Specifically, in order to be eligible to participate in intercollegiate athletics, you must meet the following criteria: 1. Be regularly admitted as a degree-seeking student. 2. At the time of participation in intercol- legiate athletics, be registered for and maintain enrollment in 12 or more credit hours, with the following exceptions: a. You may practice and compete dur - ing the vacation period immediately preceding initial enrollment provided you meet all other eligibility require - ments. b. If you are an undergraduate student enrolled in the final semester of a bac - calaureate program, who is certified as enrolled in all courses required to complete degree requirements by the Registrar's Office, you may practice and compete while enrolled in less than 12 credit hours with the approval of the Director of Special Academic Services. c. If you are a graduate student who pre - viously attended this institution as an undergraduate, you may practice and compete while enrolled in a minimum of nine credit hours with the approval of the Director of Special Academic Services. 3. Complete the maximum of four seasons of competition in any one sport during the first 10 semesters (15 quarters) of full time enrollment in a collegiate institution. 4. If you are a transfer student who has ever participated in intercollegiate athletics: a. Be certified by the transfer institution as academically and athletically eli- gible had you remained at that institu-tion. If you transferred from a four-year institution to a two-year college and then to Frostburg State University, you must have been both academically and athletically eligible had you remained at the previous four-year institution, or you must have completed 24 semester hours (or 36 quarter hours) of transfer - able degree credit and at least two full-time semesters (or three full-time quarters) of attendance at the two-year institution, in order to be immediately eligible at FSU, orb. Complete two full time semesters in residence at Frostburg State Universi- ty before being eligible to compete. 5. If you are a continuing or readmitted student: a. Pass a minimum of 24 credits since the beginning of the last season of competition in a particular sport, with the following exceptions: 1) You may request that credits earned in excess of the minimum 24 credits per year in previous years be counted to meet the 24-credit requirement. Each \"banked\" credit may be counted only once. Credits earned in repeated courses that are not repeatable for credit may be counted only once. Banking must be approved by the Director of Special Academic Services. 2) You may receive an exception to the 24- credit rule if you can document circumstances outside your control which interfered with your ability to complete the required credits in a particular year, but you are still mak - ing satisfactory progress towards graduation. Rules established by the NCAA for Divisions I and II serve as guidelines for acceptable circum- stances. To request an exception, you must submit a written appeal to the Athletics Program Advisory Group. b. By the beginning of the fifth full-time semester, declare an academic major as proof of normal progress towards the degree. c. Meet the minimum academic prog-ress standards defined for your aca-demic level (see table on this page), with the following exceptions: 1) If you are ineligible at the beginning of a semester, you may become eli- gible mid-semester only due to: a) Successful completion of a course in which you earned an incomplete (I) grade. b) An official grade change. c) A grade change due to recogni-tion of an institutional error. In any of these circumstances, you will not be eligible until the grade change is officially recorded in the Registrar's Office.2) You may request a waiver of the minimum GPA requirement (for an FSU GPA between 1.75 - 1.99 only) if compelling circumstances are present. Each request shall be considered on its own merits, independent of any other previ- ous request. To insure consistency, waiver requests must be submitted to the Athletics Program Advisory Group. A record is kept of all waiver applications and the decisions rendered. Decisions are sent to the conference office as well. d. If you are allowed to re-enroll on academic probation or based on a suc - cessful appeal of academic dismissal, or you are readmitted on academic probation, you will not be allowed to participate in athletics unless your Frostburg State University cumulative grade point average meets the mini- mum specified above for the number of semesters of enrollment, and unless you have earned a total of 24 credits since the beginning of the last season of competition in a particular sport. 6. Requests for the application of the excep - tions specified above must be submitted to the individual or committee listed. Requests for waivers of NCAA regulations must be submitted to the Director of Athletics for approval and transmission to the appropriate authorities.Minimum Academic Progress Standards for Athletes Semester at Minimum FSU Frostburg State1 Cumulative GPA2 First & Second 1.65 Third or more 2.00 1Semester at Frostburg State = number of semes- ters enrolled at FSU, including current semester and excluding summer and intersession. 2Cumulative FSU GPA = all letter grades (A, B, C, D, F , FX, WF) earned in all courses attempted at Frostburg State University, excluding prior grades in courses repeated at FSU and grade forgiveness.

Palardy, Simmons, Wakefield (Chair), Wheaton associate professors: Childs, Diehl, Tobery-Nystrom may elect to major in one of two areas: Early Childhood/Elementary Education or Elementary Education. All elementary majors are required to have an area of specialization. Professional education sequences for secondary and P-12 programs are provided in cooperation with other departments (see separate sections of this catalog). You cannot minor in education. An internship is required. You must complete application for each phase of the program. The requirements for entry in phases are described in this section. Further information is available in the Education Unit Advisement Center in Framptom Hall 223.Teacher Education Programs The Educational Professions Department offers an Early Childhood/Elementary major leading to eligibility for certification in PreK through grade 6 and middle school and an Elementary Education major leading to eligibility for certification in grades 1-6. The Educational Professions Department also offers approved teacher education programs leading to eligibility for certification in Secondary Education (biology, chemistry, English, foreign languages - French and Spanish, earth science, mathematics, physics, social studies), for grades 7-12 as well as middle school depending on subject area, and P-12 Education (art, music, health and physical education) for grades pre-kindergarten-12. Requirements for these majors and programs are listed in the catalog under Education: Early Childhood/Elementary Program, Elementary Program, Secondary School Programs, P-12 Programs and departments offering the areas of content specialization. The teacher education programs are committed to preparing professionals who are able to provide quality instruction, service, and leadership in a global community. The conceptual framework upon which each program rests focuses on the knowledge, skills and dispositions needed to develop powerful learning communities. The university, the public schools, parents and other community mem-bers link together using their hands, heads and hearts to prepare the finest pre-service teacher candidates. Educational Professions' graduates are expected to be dedicated professionals, instructional leaders, continuous assessors, educational advocates, collaborative bridge-builders and reflective decision-makers. Eligibility for Teacher Certification in Maryland For eligibility for certification in the Early Childhood/Elementary program or the Elementary program, candidates must complete the approved program requirements as listed, university graduation requirements and Praxis testing requirements. Passing Praxis II, demonstrating the knowledge and skills of a specialized content area at the Maryland State Department of Education prescribed score, is required to gain teacher certification. Therefore, candidates must take Praxis II to become program completers and to graduate in an approved teacher education program. Completion of P-12 teacher education programs and the secondary professional sequence also requires taking Praxis II. Candidates may apply for a certificate of eligibility directly to the Maryland State Department of Education or may apply for a Standard Professional Certificate I through the personnel office of a county offering employment. Eligibility for Teacher Certification in Other States If candidates wish to gain a teaching license in a state other than Maryland, candidates need to check the certification requirements in the state(s) for the program in which they wish to teach, including the passing standard for Praxis in that state. Having a Maryland certificate of eligibility may prove helpful in the out-of-state certification effort. Approved Program Since NCATE (National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education) and the Maryland State Department of Education have approved FSU's teacher education programs, the Department of Educational Professions authorizes the Registrar's Office to affix an approved program stamp on your official transcript upon satisfactory completion of all requirements. Special Admission Criteria In addition to the requirements set forth in the summaries of requirements for majors in Early Childhood/Elementary and Elementary Education, the Professional Education Sequences for Secondary Programs, and P-12 Programs (found in separate sections of this catalog), applicants must meet the following phase admission requirements in order to be accepted into and complete an education program. Application deadlines for Phase I, Phase II and Phase III for all candidates, including transfers, are established in October for spring semester and in May for fall semester by the Office of Unit Assessment. Accreditation Teacher Education Programs are accredited by the State of Maryland under the Redesign for Teacher Education and by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. Further, the education programs are recognized by 14 professional content area associa- tions which offer national recognition for being compliant with national standards. The University will continue to update education programs and discipline requirements in the major or specialization to meet national and state standards and directives, making substitutions when required.

Its distinctive and distinguished programs will contribute to the reputation of Frostburg State University as the premier educational and cultural center for the region and for serving as a catalyst for economic development. The college's efforts in undergraduate research and experiential learning will achieve national recognition for providing \"real life\" experiences for students and for serving as a national model for regional engagement. Mission The mission of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS) is to provide students with a rigorous liberal arts and sciences curriculum grounded in a flexible, broad-based general education program and enriched by the availability of challenging academic majors and minors, graduate programs, interdisciplinary offerings, and other newly evolving programs that are responsive to emerging societal needs. The college mission is implemented through a diverse, recognized, and credentialed faculty committed to excellence in teaching, learning, scholarship, and creative artistic production. CLAS fulfills its mission by preparing future leaders to enter a complex changing global society with competence and confidence. Core Values 1. We value a high standard of excellence in teaching, service, research, and other professional endeavors. 2. We value a stimulating, collaborative, and supportive setting for students, faculty, staff, and administrators characterized by creativity, innovation, and excellence. 3. We value lifelong learning and professional development for students, faculty, staff, and administrators. 4. We value an atmosphere of mutual respect and support, which promotes open sharing of ideas and viewpoints and debate of issues and concerns. 5. We value high standards of ethics, integrity, responsibility, and accountability. 6. We value the active participation of stakeholders in the planning and development of programs. 7. We value diversity. 8. We value interdisciplinary collaboration. 9. We value assessment as a mechanism for continuous improvement. 10. We value nimble response to change. Fundamental Assumptions 1. Teaching methodologies, strategies, curricula, and classroom architecture must be informed by research on the science of learning. 2. In an environment of accelerating change, FSU must be responsive to emerging needs of society. 3. A pattern of continuously diminishing state resources for public higher education has developed nationally. 4. New or expanded programs will be supported by reallocation of existing resources or through external funding. 5. Following the Board of Regents initiative, FSU will continue to improve effectiveness and efficiency. 6. Collaboration across programs, departments, divisions, and colleges can lead to enhanced student learning and improved effectiveness and efficiency. 7. Growth of FSU student population will continue but not uniformly across colleges or departments. 8. Faculty development is critical to achieving educational objectives. 9. CLAS will increase its support of economic development throughout the region.

Most law schools prefer that undergraduates interested in admission to law school not follow a prescribed \"pre-law\" curriculum. Rather, they prefer that students pursue a broad, liberal education. Almost all professional law schools require applicants to take the Law School Aptitude Test. In some cases, the Graduate Record Exam may also be required. Information regarding the L.S.A.T. may be obtained from this university's pre-law advisor. Information regarding the G.R.E. may be obtained from University Counseling and Psychological Services. Prospective law students should strive to acquire exceptional ability in communication; gain critical understanding of human values and institutions; and develop understanding in the use of various types of reasoning: deductive, inductive, and analogous. Students should develop the ability to think creatively and to analyze critically. They should also learn how to recognize, differentiate, and organize facts according to their relevance to particular issues.

Correctional System Law School Admission Test (LSAT) Preparation Course This non-credit course is designed to help students prepare for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), a prerequisite for all students seeking admission to law school. The course is offered twice during the academic year in preparation for the October and June tests. There is a fee for the course that covers the costs of instruction and a textbook that contains more than 500 questions and problems, in- cluding analytical exercises, practice tests, and a full-length home-study exam. The course covers each of the main sections of the LSAT in depth: application of rules, reading comprehension, logical games, logical reasoning, and essay writing. For each section, students are exposed to a wide variety of sample questions, which are analyzed in class, and various suggestions and methods are presented in lectures for approaching the types of questions in each section. Graduates of the LSAT prep course have gained admission to such law schools as The Georgetown University Law Center, Duquesne University School of Law, The University of Baltimore School of Law, The West Virginia University College of Law, Appalachian School of Law, Ohio Northern University College of Law, The Thomas M. Cooley Law School, and Liberty College of Law. For further information, contact Dr. Scott Johnson, pre-law advisor and instructor of mass c ommunication 1.

Students intending to enter health professions schools should plan their academic programs carefully to meet pre-professional, university and major requirements. 2. Pre-health professions students should continually examine the catalog of the institution they plan to attend in order to complete courses required by the professional school and to fulfill additional entrance expectations. Students should bear in mind that requirements change and they should maintain contact with any professional schools they want to attend. 3. A science major is not a prerequisite for medical school; therefore, a major should be selected in which the student has a high aptitude and interest and which provides career alternatives. A proper course selection is most important; consequently, we highly recommend early consultation with the chair of the department of your selected major, who will assign you to a pre-health profes-sions advisor. 4. Most pre-health professions students at FSU select biology or chemistry as majors. The Pre-Health Professions Option outlined in the Biology section of this catalog should be selected by students majoring in Biology. Chemistry students planning medical school and other pre-health professional programs complete either the Biochemistry concentration or Traditional Track outlined for the Chem- istry major. Students opting to minor in either department are advised to use sections 5 and 6 below as a guide to course selection. 5. Professional schools generally require a demonstrated proficiency in the basic sciences. The following courses are among the minimum requirements for students planning to prepare for medical, dental, optometry or veterinary school. BIOL 149 and 150 General Biology I and II 8 cr. CHEM 201 and 202 General Chemistry I and II 8 cr. CHEM 301 and 302 Organic Chemistry I and II 8 cr. PHYS 215, 216 or 261, 262 General Physics I, II or Principles of Physics I, II 8 cr.

The program is approved by the Maryland Board of Nursing and the Maryland Higher Education Commission, and meets the requirements of the Maryland statewide nursing education articulation agreement. The program design is a collaboration among Frostburg State University (FSU), Allegany College of Maryland (ACM), the Western Maryland Health System, and other regional health care providers. Resources, facilities, and expertise are shared to allow the most efficient delivery of coursework and services and to match students with the most appropriate clinical placements. The RN to BSN curriculum is designed to increase the registered nurse's knowledge and skills in the areas of leadership, quality improvement, evidence-based nursing practice, nursing informatics, population-focused health promotion and disease prevention, interdisciplinary collaboration, and professionalism. The program will prepare nurses to assume roles in leadership, complex clinical care coordination, and community/public health, and serves as the academic foundation for graduate study. The program is open to all registered nurses who meet the program admissions criteria including an active, unencumbered RN license from within the United States. The program builds on the elements of Associate Degree nursing education. Third or fourth semester students enrolled in an Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) program at a community college who meet the admission crite-ria (with the exception of RN licensure) are eligible to take 6 credits (limited to NURS 401 and NURS 403) prior to licensure. Courses are delivered in a part-time, online format to maximize scheduling flexibility and maintain the student-faculty connection that is essential to academic success. Program Goal The RN to BSN Program prepares the registered nurse to be a professional health care practitioner who provides compassionate care that is based on scientific evidence and who serves as the link between the patient (individual, family, community or population) and the health care environment across the lifespan. Program Objectives The RN to BSN Program prepares the graduate to: Utilize critical thinking and creativity to address professional practice and patient care issues. Apply leadership concepts and collaborative strategies to the process of nursing care delivery. Utilize quality improvement and safety management principles in clinical nursing practice. Identify and understand basic elements of nursing research. Integrate scientific evidence with clinical judgment and patient preference to improve patient outcomes. Safely use information technology to improve patient care. Describe the ethical, legal, political, and financial influences on the delivery of patient care. Demonstrate interpersonal communication skills and collaborative strategies that support the delivery of interdisciplinary, patient- centered care. Provide evidenced-based, preventative health care to families, communities, and vulnerable populations in community-based settings. Demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and attributes of professional nursing practice.Major MAJOR Hours transferred from community college: 30-55 Hours earned with unencumbered rn license: 30 Hours required at f rostburg Hours Required: 120 Coordinator: Heather A. Gable, Chair, Department of Nursing The RN to BSN Completion Program does not lead to licensure as a registered nurse.

Only courses in which a grade of C or better is earned will count toward satisfaction of major requirements. Academic credit is not given for life or work experiences. The Social Work program has a competitive admissions process. Department faculty reserve the right to select those candidates who demonstrate the greatest potential for developing as professional social workers. Students with a degree in social work are eligible to earn Maryland State certification as addiction counselors. Several social work courses count towards the requirements. See the Addictions Counselor Preparation section of this catalog.The major in Social Work is designed to prepare you for generalist practice. It is built upon a liberal arts foundation and provides you with the knowledge, values, and skills needed to help individuals, families, groups, organizations and communities. Content in the major forms the foundation for professional practice. The curriculum covers values and ethics, diversity, social and economic justice, populations-at-risk, human behavior and the social environment, social welfare policy and services, social work practice, research and field practicum. All students are required to complete a full-time internship which constitutes the last semester of the senior year. Graduates with a major in Social Work may begin professional practice in a variety of fields including mental health, aging, family and children's services, health care, addictions, juvenile and adult corrections, developmental disabilities, and community planning and development. The Social Work program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). Graduates of the program are eligible to apply to take state social work licensure exams at the baccalaureate level and to compete for employment positions where such a license is required. In addition, qualified graduates may also apply for advanced standing in graduate schools of social work which allows for completion of a Master's degree in less time than it would otherwise take.

These programs usually have a steering committee made up of faculty from all participating colleges and departments that recommends program requirements. Members also serve as academic advisors for students. Inter-College programs are housed in the department of the coordinator's primary appointment. If you like to consider various points of view and want to develop a broad range of skills for employment flexibility, check out the inter-college programs as well as the other interdisciplinary programs offered within the colleges. Dr. Joseph M. Hoffman Dean, College of Liberal Arts & Sciences241 Compton Science Center301.687.4120Dr. Cindy HerzogAssociate Dean, College of Liberal Honors Program offers a variety of courses specially designed for Honors students. These courses feature content and instructional methods that are challenging, provide a more active role for the student in the learning process, and emphasize understanding more than factual information, and quality of work rather than quantity. These courses seek to magnify problem-solving abilities, effective communications, an awareness of multiple perspectives, and a capacity for independent learning. Many of the Honors courses are variants of courses included in the University's General Education Program. These variant courses are primarily intended to be taken during a student's first and second years. For juniors and seniors participating in the program, the Honors Seminars and Thesis provide unique environments and opportunities for learning. In addition to the academic courses, the Honors Program offers a host of co-curricular activities, including the opportunity to reside in Honors/International Housing in Cambridge and Westminster Halls. Ultimately the program seeks to foster within students dignity, self-esteem, and a knowledge of their own potential as human beings. Admission Requirements Incoming first semester students are invited to join the Honors Program at FSU if they have a high school GPA of 3.5 and a combined SAT score of at least 1750 (or an ACT score of at least 26). Students who do not meet both of these requirements may apply for admission to the Honors Program based on the strength of one of these requirements, either an excellent GPA or an excellent SAT/ACT score. Normally, students will not be admitted without at least a 3.25 GPA or a minimum of 1500 on the combined SAT (23 on the ACT). Exceptions can be made on a case by case basis by the Honors Program. Students who have completed at least one semester of course work at Frostburg State University or at another institution may apply to the Honors Program if they have a GPA of 3.5 or above. Students demonstrating considerable creative ability, as evidenced by papers, projects, creative writing, musical composition, art work, or musical performance may also be admitted on an individual basis. Summary of Requirements for the Honors Program Most students participating in the Honors Program are pursuing the distinction of graduating with \"Honors in General Education.\" This distinction is awarded to students who complete the following Honors Program requirements: a) ENGL 111 or ENGL 312 b) 15-17 credit hours of Honors variants of General Education Program courses from an approved list c) 6 credit hours from the following: IDIS 351 Honors Advanced Colloquium IDIS 491 Honors Seminar IDIS 493 Honors Thesis Experiential Learning Option: Approved Study Abroad course, Undergraduate Research Project, Internship, Departmental Recital or other experiential learning experience. Three credits will count for the Honors Program requirement on approval of the Honors Program Advisory Group. Pre-approval necessary. 1. Honors students must earn a 3.0 average in all courses applied to meet Honors requirements and have at least a 3.0 cumulative grade point average upon graduation. 2. ENGL 111 is required of all students entering the Honors Program as first semester students. Students electing to join this program after their first semester are required to take ENGL 312. 3. Honors Experiential Learning course work, IDIS 493 Honors thesis and IDIS 491 Honors seminars may, with departmental approval, count towards requirements in the major. IDIS 491 credit hours may, with approval of the Honors Program Advisory Group, substi- tute for portions of the Modes of Inquiry section of the General Education Program. Grade Repeat Option Students earning a grade of D,F,FX, or WF in a designated Honors variant course may enroll in the non-honors equivalent and file the grade repeat authorization form requesting that the credit hours attempted and the grade earned in the first, Honors variant course not be used in calculating the cumulative grade point average and cumulative credits. All other regulations concerning the grade repeat option apply (see Course Repetition and Grading in the Academic Standards section of this catalog). Use of the grade repeat option in this manner constitutes withdrawal from the University's Honors Program.Director: Maureen Connelly, Professor, Departments of Sociology and Social Work Students who have demonstrated a high degree of academic skill, creative talent, and motivation have the opportunity to participate in the University's Honors Program.

Purpose To extend the benefits of its system of higher education while encouraging the economi- cal use of the State's resources,1 it is the pol- icy of the Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland (USM) to recognize the tuition categories of in-state and out-of-state students for the purpose of admission and assessing tuition at USM institutions. B. Burden of Proof The person seeking in-state status shall have the burden of proving by clear and convinc - ing evidence that he or she satisfies the re - quirements and standards set forth in this Policy. Assignment of in-state or out-of-state status will be made by the applicable USM institution upon a review of the totality of facts known or presented to it. C. In-state Status To qualify for in-state tuition, a student must demonstrate that, for at least twelve (12) con- secutive months immediately prior to and in- cluding the last date available to register for courses in the semester/term for which the student seeks in-state tuition status, the stu- dent had the continuous intent to: 1. Make Maryland his or her permanent home; and 2. Abandon his or her former home state; and 3. Reside in Maryland indefinitely; and 4. Reside in Maryland primarily for a purpose other than that of attending an education- al institution in Maryland. Satisfying all of the requirements in Section II (and Section III, when applicable) of this poli- cy demonstrates continuous intent and quali - fies a student for in-state tuition. Students not entitled to in-state status under this pol- icy shall be assigned out-of-state status for admission and tuition purposes. D. Presumption Either of the following circumstances raises a presumption that the student is residing in the State of Maryland primarily for the pur - pose of attending an educational institution and therefore, does not qualify for in-state status under this policy: 1. A student is attending school or living out - side Maryland at the time of application for admission to a USM institution, or 2. A student is Financially Dependent on a person who is not a resident of Maryland. This presumption may be rebutted. The stu-dent bears the burden of rebutting the pre - sumption. See \"III. Rebuttal Evidence\" below. II. Requirements Before a request for classification to in-state status will be considered, a student must comply with all of the following requirements for a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive months immediately prior to and including the last date available to register for courses in the semester/term for which the student seeks in-state tuition status. The student must demonstrate he or she: A. Owns or possesses, and has continuous- ly occupied, including during weekends, breaks and vacations, living quarters in Maryland. The student must provide ev - idence of a genuine deed or lease and documentation of rent payments made. In lieu of a deed or lease, a notarized affi-davit from a landlord showing the address, name of the student as occupant, term of residence, and history of rent payments made will be considered. As an alterna- tive, a student may demonstrate that he or she shares living quarters in Maryland which are owned or rented and occupied by a parent, legal guardian or spouse. B. Has substantially all of his or her personal property, such as household effects, fur - niture and pets in Maryland. C. Has paid Maryland income tax on all tax - able income including all taxable income earned outside the State and has filed a Maryland tax return. D. Has registered all owned or leased motor vehicles in Maryland. E. Possesses a valid Maryland driver's license, if licensed. F. Is registered to vote in Maryland, if regis- tered to vote. G. Receives no public assistance from a state other than the State of Maryland or from a city, county or municipal agency other than one in Maryland. H. Has a legal ability under Federal and Maryland law to live permanently with- out interruption in Maryland. I. Has rebutted the presumption that he or she is in Maryland primarily to attend an educational institution, if the student's cir - cumstances have raised the presumption. III. Rebuttal Evidence Satisfying the requirements listed in para- graphs A through I of Section II, does not rebut the presumption that a student is in Maryland primarily to attend an educational institution. To overcome the presumption, a student must present additional evidence. To determine a student's intent, the University will evaluate evidence of a student's objec - tively verifiable conduct. Evidence that does not document a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive months immediately prior to and including the last date available to register for courses in the semester/term for which the student seeks in-state tuition status is generally considered an unfavorable factor under this policy. Evidence of intent must be clear and convincing and will be evaluated not only by the amount presented but also based upon the reliability, authenticity, cred- ibility and relevance of the evidence. The absence of objective, relevant evidence is generally considered an unfavorable fac - tor. A student's statement of intent to re - main in Maryland in the future is generally not considered to be objective evidence un- der this policy. Additional evidence that will be considered includes, but is not limited to, the following: A. Source of financial support: 1. Maryland employment and earnings history through sources beyond those incident to enrollment as a student in an educational institution e.g., beyond support provided by work study, schol- arships, grants, stipends, aid, student loans, etc., (Tuition costs will be con-sidered as a student expense only to the extent tuition exceeds the amount of any educational scholarship, grant, student loan, etc.), or 2. Evidence the student is Financially Dependent upon a person who is a resident of Maryland. B. Substantial participation as a member of a professional, social, community, civic, po - litical, athletic or religious organization in Maryland, including professionally related school activities that demonstrate a com-mitment to the student's community or to the State of Maryland. C. Registration as a Maryland resident with the Selective Service, if male. D. Evidence showing the student uses his or her Maryland address as his or her sole address of record for all purposes includ-ing on health and auto insurance records, bank accounts, tax records, loan and schol- arship records, school records, military re -USM Bylaws, Policies and Procedures of the Board of Regents Policy on Student Classification For Admission and Tuition Purposes (Approved by the Board of Regents August 28, 1990; Amended July 10, 1998; Amended November 27, 2000; Amended April 11, 2003; Amended June 23, 2006; leases, etc. E. An affidavit from a person unrelated to the student that provides objective, relevant evidence of a student's conduct demon-strating the student's intent to live perma- nently in Maryland. IV. Non-Residents Who May Temporarily Qualify For In-State Status In addition, persons with the following sta- tus shall be accorded the benefits of in-state status for the period in which they hold such status: A. A full-time or part-time (at least 50 percent time) regular employee of USM or a USM institution. B. The spouse or Financially Dependent child of a full-time or part-time (at least 50 per - cent time) regular employee of USM or a USM institution. C. A full-time active member of the Armed Forces of the United States whose home of record is Maryland or one who resides or is stationed in Maryland, or the spouse or a Financially Dependent child of such a per - son. Students that qualify under this pro - vision will retain in-state status for tuition purposes as long as they are Continuously Enrolled regardless of a change in military assignment or status of the active member of the military. D. A veteran of the United States Armed Forces with an honorable discharge who, within one year of discharge, presents documentation that he or she attended a secondary school in the State for at least three years, and graduated or received the equivalent of a high school diploma from a secondary school in the State. The veter - an must present documentation and reg- ister at a USM institution within one year of discharge for this provision to apply. E. For UMUC, a full-time active member of the Armed Forces of the United States on active duty, or the spouse of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States on active duty. F. A graduate assistant appointed through a USM institution for the semester/term of the appointment. Except through prior arrangement, this benefit is available only for enrollment at the institution awarding the assistantship. V. Procedures A. An initial determination of in-state status will be made at the time of admission. The determination made at that time, and any determination made thereafter, shall pre - vail for each semester/term until the de - termination is successfully challenged in a timely manner. B. A change in status must be requested by submitting a USM institution's \"Petition for Change in Classification for Tuition\" . A student applying for a change to in-state status must furnish all evidence that the student wishes the USM institution to consider at the time the petition is due. The due date is based on the deadline set forth by the USM institution at which the student seeks to enroll. If the applicable USM institution has no such deadline, the due date is the last published date to reg-ister for the forthcoming semester/term for which the change in classification is sought. C. The student shall notify the USM institu-tion in writing within fifteen (15) days of any change in circumstances which may alter in-state status. D. In the event incomplete, false, or mislead-ing information is presented, the USM in- stitution may, at its discretion, revoke in-state status and take disciplinary action provided for by the institution's policy. Such action may include suspension or expulsion. If in-state status is gained due to false or misleading information, the in- stitution reserves the right to retroactively assess all out-of-state charges for each se - mester/term affected. E. Each USM institution shall develop and publish additional procedures to imple - ment this Policy. Procedures shall provide that on request the institution President or designee has the authority to waive any requirement set forth in Section II if it is determined that the application of the requirements creates an unjust result. These procedures shall be filed with the Office of the Chancellor. Vi. Definitions A. Financially Dependent: For the purposes of this policy, a financially dependent stu- dent is one who is claimed as a dependent for tax purposes. B. Parent: A parent may be a natural par - ent, or, if established by a court order recognized under the law of the State of Maryland, an adoptive parent. C. Guardian: A guardian is a person so ap - pointed by a court order recognized un-der the law of the State of Maryland. D. Spouse: A spouse is a partner in a legally contracted marriage. E. Child: A child is a natural child or a child legally adopted pursuant to a court order recognized under the law of Maryland. F. Regular Employee: A regular employee is a person employed by USM or a USM in- stitution who is assigned to a State budget line or who is otherwise eligible to enroll in a State retirement system. Examples of categories NOT considered regular em- ployees are graduate students, contingent employees, and independent contractors. G. Continuous Enrollment: 1. Undergraduate Student - An under - graduate student who is enrolled at a USM institution for consecutive fall and spring semesters, until completion of the student's current degree program or unless on an approved leave of ab - sence or participating in an approved program off-campus. 2. Graduate and Professional - Continuous enrollment for a graduate or profes-sional student is defined by the insti- tution in accordance with program requirement Vi. Implementation This policy as amended by the Board of Regents on February 15, 2008 shall be applied to all stu-dent tuition classification decisions made on or after this date. 1 Annotated Code of Maryland, Education Article \u00a712-101. FSU Procedure for Residency Status Appeals Any student who wishes to appeal the de - cision of residency status previously deter - mined by the Office of the Registrar or the Admissions Office, may do so in writing to the Appeals Board for Residency Status. This board shall consist of representatives des- ignated by the Provost, the Vice President for Student and Educational Services, and the Vice President for Administration and Finance. The appeal will be reviewed by the board members in the order listed. Only by unanimous agreement of the board members will the decision of the Office of the Registrar or Admissions be overruled. Upon request, the President or designee has the authority to waive any residency requirements if it is determined that the student is indeed a per - manent resident and application of the cri- teria creates an unjust result. A student desiring to appeal should obtain and submit the University System of Maryland \"Petition for Change in Classification for Tuition\" through the office that made the original residency status decision, the Office of the Registrar or the Admissions AnD trAnsFer .01 Scope and Applicability.

(3) A receiving public institution, in develop - ing its lower division course work, shall exchange information with other public institutions to facilitate the transfer of credits into its program. .03 General Education Requirements for Public Institutions. A. While public institutions have the auton- omy to design their general education program to meet their unique needs and mission, that program shall conform to the definitions and common standards in this chapter. A public institution shall satisfy the general education requirement by: (1) Requiring each program leading to the A.A. or A.S. degree to include not less than 30 and no more than 36 semester hours, and each baccalaureate degree program to include not less than 40 and not more than 46 semester hours of required core courses, with the core requiring, at a mini- mum, course work in each of the follow - ing five areas: (a) Arts and humanities, (b) Social and behavioral sciences,(c) Biological and physical sciences, (d) Mathematics, and (e) English composition; or (2) Conforming with COMAR 13B. 02. 02. 16D (2)(b)-(c). B. Each core course used to satisfy the dis-tribution of \u00a7A (1) of this regulation shall carry at least 3 semester hours. C. General education programs of public in-stitutions shall require at least: (1) One course in each of two disciplines in arts and humanities; (2) One course in each of two disciplines in social and behavioral sciences; (3) Two science courses, at least one of which shall be a laboratory course; (4) One course in mathematics at or above the level of college algebra; and (5) One course in English composition. D. Interdisciplinary and Emerging Issues. (1) In addition to the five required areas in \u00a7A of this regulation, a public institution may include up to 8 semester hours in a sixth category that addresses emerging issues that institutions have identified as essential to a full program of general ed- ucation for their students. These courses may: (a) Be integrated into other general edu-cation courses or may be presented as separate courses; and (b) Include courses that: (i) Provide an interdisciplinary ex - amination of issues across the five areas; or (ii) Address other categories of knowledge, skills, and values that lie outside of the five areas. (2) Public institutions may not include the courses in this section in a general edu- cation program unless they provide ac - ademic content and rigor equivalent to the areas in \u00a7A(1) of this regulation. E. General education programs leading to the A.A.S. degree shall include at least 20 semester hours from the same course list designated by the sending institution for the A.A. and A.S. degrees. The A.A.S. degree shall include at least one 3 semester-hour course from each of the five areas listed in \u00a7(A)(1). F. A course in a discipline listed in more than one of the areas of general education may be applied only to one area of general education. G. A public institution may allow a speech communication or foreign language course to be part of the arts and humani- ties category. H. Composition and literature courses may be placed in the arts and humanities area if literature is included as part of the con-tent of the course. I. Public institutions may not include physi-cal education skills courses as part of the general education requirements. J. General education courses shall reflect current scholarship in the discipline and provide reference to theoretical frame - works and methods of inquiry appropri-ate to academic disciplines. K. Courses that are theoretical may include applications, but all applications courses shall include theoretical components if they are to be included as meeting gen- eral education requirements. L. Public institutions may incorporate knowl-edge and skills involving the use of quan- titative data, effective writing, information retrieval, and information literacy when possible in the general education program. M. Notwithstanding \u00a7A(1) of this regulation, a public four-year institution may require 48 semester hours of required core courses if courses upon which the institution's cur - riculum is based carry 4 semester hours. N. Public institutions shall develop systems to ensure that courses approved for inclusion on the list of general education courses are designed and assessed to comply with the requirements of this chapter. .04 Transfer of General Education Credit. A. A student transferring to one public in- stitution from another public institution shall receive general education credit for work completed at the student's sending institution as provided by this chapter. B. A completed general education program shall transfer without further review or approval by the receiving institution and without the need for a course-by-course match. C. Courses that are defined as general edu- cation by one institution shall transfer as general education even if the receiving institution does not have that specific course or has not designated that course as general education. D. The receiving institution shall give lower- division general education credits to a transferring student who has taken any part of the lower-division general educa- tion credits described in Regulation .03 of this chapter at a public institution for any general education courses successfully completed at the sending institution. E. Except as provided in Regulation .03M of this chapter, a receiving institution trAnsFer require a transfer student who has com- pleted the requisite number of general education credits at any public college or university to take, as a condition of gradu-ation, more than 10-16 additional semes- ter hours of general education and specif- ic courses required of all students at the receiving institution, with the total num- ber not to exceed 46 semester hours. This provision does not relieve students of the obligation to complete specific academic program requirements or course prereq- uisites required by a receiving institution. F. A sending institution shall designate on or with the student transcript those courses that have met its general education re - quirements, as well as indicate whether the student has completed the general education program. G. A.A.S. Degrees. (1) While there may be variance in the num-bers of hours of general education re - quired for A.A., A.S., and A.A.S. degrees at a given institution, the courses identified as meeting general education require - ments for all degrees shall come from the same general education course list and exclude technical or career courses. (2) An A.A.S. student who transfers into a receiving institution with fewer than the total number of general education credits designated by the receiving in- stitution shall complete the difference in credits according to the distribution as designated by the receiving institution. Except as provided in .03M of this chap - ter, the total general education credits for baccalaureate degree-granting pub - lic receiving institutions may not exceed 46 semester hours. H. Student responsibilities. A student is held: (1) Accountable for the loss of credits that: (a) Result from changes in the student's selection of the major program of study, (b) Were earned for remedial course work, or (c) Exceed the total course credits ac - cepted in transfer as allowed by this chapter; and (2) Responsible for meeting all requirements of the academic program of the receiv - ing institution. .05 Transfer of Non-General Education Program Credit A. Transfer to Another Public Institution (1) Credit earned at any public institution in the State is transferable to any other public institution if the: (a) Credit is from a college or university parallel course or program; (b) Grades in the block of courses trans-ferred average 2.0 or higher; and (c) Acceptance of the credit is consistent with the policies of the receiving in- stitution governing native students following the same program. (2) If a native student's \"D\" grade in a spe - cific course is acceptable in a program, then a \"D\" earned by a transfer student in the same course at a sending institu-tion is also acceptable in the program. Conversely, if a native student is required to earn a grade of \"C\" or better in a re - quired course, the transfer student shall also be required to earn a grade of \"C\" or better to meet the same requirement B. Credit earned in or transferred from a com-munity college is limited to: (1) 1/2 the baccalaureate degree program requirement, but may not be more than 70 semester hours; and (2) The first two years of the undergraduate educational experience. C. Nontraditional Credit. (1) The assignment of credit for AP , CLEP , or other nationally recognized standardized examination scores presented by trans- fer students is determined according to the same standards that apply to native students in the receiving institution, and the assignment shall be consistent with the State minimum requirements. (2) Transfer of credit from the following areas shall be consistent with COMAR 13B.02.02. and shall be evaluated by the receiving institution on a course-by- course basis: (a) Technical courses from career programs; (b) Course credit awarded through ar - ticulation agreements with other segments or agencies; (c) Credit awarded for clinical practice or cooperative education experiences; and (d) Credit awarded for life and work experiences. (3) The basis for the awarding of the credit shall be indicated on the student's tran- script by the receiving institution. (4) The receiving institution shall inform a transfer student of the procedures for validation of course work for which there is no clear equivalency. Examples of validation procedures include ACE recommendations, portfolio assessment, credit through challenge, examinations and satisfactory completion of the next course in sequence in the academic area. (5) The receiving baccalaureate degree-granting institution shall use validation procedures when a transferring student successfully completes a course at the lower division level that the receiving institution offers at the upper division level. The validated credits earned for the course shall be substituted for the upper division course. D. Program Articulation. (1) Recommended transfer programs shall be developed through consultation be - tween the sending and receiving insti- tutions. A recommended transfer pro - gram represents an agreement between the two institutions that allows students aspiring to the baccalaureate degree to plan their programs. These programs constitute freshman/sophomore level course work to be taken at the commu- nity college in fulfillment of the receiving institution's lower division course work requirement. (2) Recommended transfer programs in ef-fect at the time that this regulation takes effect, which conform to this chapter, may be retained. .06 Academic Success and General Well-Being of Transfer Students. A. Sending Institutions. (1) Community colleges shall encourage their students to complete the associ- ate degree or to complete 56 hours in a recommended transfer program which includes both general education courses and courses applicable toward the pro - gram at the receiving institution. (2) Community college students are encour - aged to choose as early as possible the institution and program into which they expect to transfer. (3) The sending institution shall: (a) Provide to community college stu-dents information about the specif- ic transferability of courses at 4-year colleges; (b) Transmit information about transfer students who are capable of honors work or independent study to the re - ceiving institution; and (c) Promptly supply the receiving insti-tution with all the required docu- ments if the student has met all fi- nancial and other obligations of the sending institution for transfer. B. Receiving Institutions. (1) Admission requirements and curriculum prerequisites shall be stated explicitly in institutional publications. (2) A receiving institution shall admit trAnsFer students from newly established public colleges that are functioning with the ap - proval of the Maryland Higher Education Commission on the same basis as appli-cants from regionally accredited colleges. (3) A receiving institution shall evaluate the transcript of a degree seeking transfer student as expeditiously as possible, and notify the student of the results not later than mid-semester of the student's first semester of enrollment at the receiving institution, if all official transcripts have been received at least 15 working days before mid-semester. The receiving in- stitution shall inform a student of the courses which are acceptable for transfer credit and the courses which are appli- cable to the student's intended program of study. (4) A receiving institution shall give a transfer student the option of satisfying institu- tional graduation requirements that were in effect at the receiving institution at the time the student enrolled as a freshman at the sending institution. In the case of major requirements, a transfer student may satisfy the major requirements in effect at the time when the student was identifiable as pursuing the recommend-ed transfer program at the sending insti- tution. These conditions are applicable to a student who has been continuously enrolled at the sending institution. .07 Programmatic Currency. A. A receiving institution shall provide to the community college current and accurate information on recommended transfer programs and the transferability status of courses. Community college students shall have access to this information. B. Recommended transfer programs shall be developed with each community college whenever new baccalaureate programs are approved by the degree-granting institution. C. When considering curricular changes, in-stitutions shall notify each other of the proposed changes that might affect trans- fer students. An appropriate mechanism shall be created to ensure that both 2-year and 4-year public colleges provide input or comments to the institution proposing the change.

Transfer students are not required to repeat equivalent course work successfully completed at a community college. .08 Transfer Mediation Committee. A. There is be a Transfer Mediation Comm- ittee, appointed by the Secretary, which is representative of the public 4-year col- leges and universities and the community colleges. B. Sending and receiving institutions that disagree on the transferability of gener - al education courses as defined by this chapter shall submit their disagreements to the Transfer Mediation Committee. The Transfer Mediation Committee shall ad-dress general questions regarding existing or past courses only, not individual student cases, and shall also address questions raised by institutions about the accept - ability of new general education courses. As appropriate, the Committee shall con-sult with faculty on curricular issues. C. The findings of the Transfer Mediation Committee are considered binding on both parties. .09 Appeal Process. A. Notice of Denial of Transfer Credit by the Receiving Institution. (1) Except as provided in \u00a7A(2) of this regu-lation, a receiving institution shall inform a transfer student in writing of the denial of transfer credit not later than mid-se - mester of the transfer student's first se - mester, if all official transcripts have been received at least 15 working days before mid-semester.

(3) Unless a student appeals to the sending institution, the written decision in \u00a7C(2) of this regulation constitutes the receiv - ing institution's final decision and is not subject to appeal. D. Appeal to Sending Institution. (1) If a student has been denied transfer credit after an appeal to the receiving institution, the student may request the sending institution to intercede on the student's behalf by contacting the trans- fer coordinator of the sending institution. (2) A student shall make an appeal to the sending institution within 10 working days of having received the decision of the receiving institution. E. Consultation between Sending and Receiving Institutions. (1) Representatives of the two institutions shall have 15 working days to resolve the issues involved in an appeal.

The transfer coordinator is responsible for application of the policies and proce - dures outlined in this chapter and inter - preting transfer policies to the individual student and to the institution. C . The Maryland Higher Education Commission shall establish a permanent Student Transfer Advisory Committee that meets regularly to review transfer is- sues and recommend policy changes as needed. The Student Transfer Advisory Committee shall address issues of interpre - tation and implementation of this chapter. Effective date: December 4, 1995 (22:24 Md. R. 1901) Regulations .02, .03, and .05 amended. Effective date: July 1, 1996 (23:13 Md. R. 946)Revised: February 11, 1998 University Procedures for Review of Alleged Arbitrary and Capricious Grading Grounds for Grievance The following procedures implement the University System of Maryland Policy for Review of Alleged Arbitrary and Capricious Grading (BOR III-1.20) and are designed to provide a means for a student to seek review of final course grades alleged to be arbitrary and capricious. In this policy the term arbitrary and capricious grading means 1) the assignment of a course grade to a student on some basis other than performance in the course; 2) the assignment of a course grade to a student by unreasonable application of standards differ - ent from the standards that were applied to other students in that course; or 3) the assign- ment of a course grade by a substantial and unreasonable departure from the instructor's initially articulated standards. Alleging a final grade to have been deter - mined in an arbitrary and capricious manner is the sole ground upon which a student may seek review under these procedures. Since matters within the instructor's sphere of aca- demic judgment \u2014 such as choice of instruc - tional and evaluation methods, criteria, and standards for evaluation \u2014 are not grounds for grievance, the burden of proving arbitrary and capricious grading by clear and convinc - ing evidence will rest with the student. How to Undertake a Grade Grievance Students or faculty who desire additional in- formation about the procedures that follow should contact the Associate Provost. Class days are days classes are in session in the subsequent semester after the grade that the student wants to grieve is assigned. The timetable portrays the maximum time allot - ted. Participants can meet their responsibili- ties any time before the specified day.Stage I: Mediation A student seeking review for a final grade in a course should make a reasonable effort to confer with the instructor (in person or in writing)and attempt to resolve the matter informally. If this effort is unsuccessful, the student approaches the chair of the depart - ment offering the course to request media- tion of the grade dispute. This action must be taken no later than the 15th class day of the semester subsequent to the term in which the grade was received. The chair will inform the student of the grounds proper to a grade grievance, as stated above. The chair also will review relevant material and consult with the instructor in an effort to resolve the issue of the grade. (If the instructor involved is the chair, the student approaches the senior faculty member in the department to request mediation.) Mediation must be completed no later than the 25th class day. In cases where a resolution mutually accept - able to the student and the instructor is not forthcoming, and the student wishes to pur - sue a formal grievance, the student may pro - ceed to Stage II. Stage II: Formal Grievance As a precondition to filing a formal grievance, a student must fulfill all of his/her responsi- bilities and meet the deadline specified in Stage I: Mediation above. No later than the end of the 30th class day of the semester, a student still wishing to grieve a grade must file a written grievance with the instructor's College dean. This grievance must describe in detail the bases for the al- legation that the grade was arbitrary and ca-pricious, and include all evidence supporting that claim. The student must send copies of this statement to the instructor and the chair. Within 10 class days of receipt of a student's written, Stage II grievance, the dean will dis-miss the grievance if the student 1) did not participate in Stage I: Mediation and/or meet the deadline specified in Stage I; 2) did not file the Stage II appeal by the stated deadline; 3) does not furnish evidence that the allega- tions, if true, constitute arbitrary and capri- cious grading, as defined above; and/or 4) has filed a complaint concerning the same grade with the ADA/EEO Compliance Office alleging discrimination or sexual harassment. If the grievance is not dismissed, the dean shall ask the instructor to respond to the grievance in writing within ten class days, addressing the response to the dean and copying the student and the chair. The dean will ask the chair to forward all documenta-ry evidence collected during the mediation stage to the dean. If the grievance is not dismissed, the dean shall appoint a grade grievance committee of three tenured faculty members and shall set the date for an informal, non-adversarial grade grievance hearing to occur within five class days following the due date for a writ - ten response from the instructor. The student, the instructor, and the chair will be invited to attend the hearing, and may present rel- evant evidence. The dean also will attend and may choose to participate in the discussion. In keeping with the informal nature of the hearing, neither the student nor the instruc - tor may be accompanied by a representative or advisor. If the academic records of other students in the grievant's class are relevant to the discussion, the grievant must be ex - cused for that portion of the hearing to pro - tect the privacy of other students. The grade grievance committee shall forward its writ - ten recommendation to the dean within five class days after the conclusion of the hear - ing. The dean may accept, reject or alter the recommendation. The dean shall render a decision to the student in writing, either in support of the original grade or of a grade change, with copies to the instructor, the members of the grade griev - ance committee. If the dean recommends a grade change and the instructor refuses to change the grade, the dean will vacate and replace the grade in question. In deciding whether the circumstances jus- tify changing the grade, the dean shall de - termine whether the grievant has provided clear and convincing evidence of arbitrary and capricious grading. The dean's decision is final. Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students have certain rights regarding the inspection and disclo - sure of education records directly related to the student and maintained by the University. These rights include: 1. The right to inspect and review the stu- dent's educational records within forty-five (45) days of the day the University re - ceives a request of access. Requests for inspection should be made in writing and directed to the Office of the Registrar. 2. The right to request an amendment of the student's education records if the student believes that they are inaccurate, mislead- ing or otherwise in violation of the stu-dent's privacy rights under FERPA. . A re - quest to amend education records must be made in writing and submitted to the Registrar. The request must clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed and why it should be changed. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested, the University will no - tify the student of its decision, and if the decision is negative, the procedures for a hearing regarding the request. 3. The right to consent to disclosures by the University of personally identifiable infor - mation contained in the student's educa- tion records, except to the extent FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. The University discloses education records without a student's prior written consent under several exceptions to FERPA, in - cluding the exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate education interests. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill professional responsibilities for the University. A \"school official\" is any person employed by the University in any admin-istrative, supervisory, academic, research or support staff position; any person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an auditor or collec - tion agent); or any student serving on an official committee such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting an- other school official in performing his or her tasks. Upon request, the University also discloses education records without consent to offi-cials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. The following categories of information are considered by the University to be directo - ry information and may be disclosed with-out the student's prior consent unless the student submits a Directory Restrictions Form using PAWS: Name; local, home and email address; local and home telephone number; major field of study; classification; dates of attendance, degrees, honors and awards received; officially recognized ac - tivities and sports; weight and height for athletes; and most recent school or edu- cational institution attended. The Directory Restrictions Form in PAWS can be found using the following path: Student Center>User Preferences>FERPA restrictions>Edit FERPA Directory Restrictions. Note that directory information may be released to commercial organizations and may be used for solicitation purposes. However, restricting release of directory in - formation will prevent the University from providing such information to prospective employers and other organizations, media, friends and family. 4. A student may permit inspection of educa-tion records by parents, guardians or oth- ers by completing a Release of Information Form in PAWS on an annual basis. The form can be found using the following path: Student Center>\"other academics\" drop down box> Release of Information. Release of Information Forms are purged at the completion of each academic year. If a student wishes to permit inspection of education records for the upcom-ing academic year, a new form must be completed. 5. The right to file with the U.S. Department of Education a complaint if the student believes that the University has failed to comply with the requirements of FERPA. Complaints may be filed with the Family Policy and Regulations Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, DC, 20202-5901. Student Records "}
