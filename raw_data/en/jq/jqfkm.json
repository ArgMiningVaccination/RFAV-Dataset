Men's health is a topic that is often overlooked. However, men are at a higher risk of developing heart disease than women. In fact, heart disease is the leading cause of death for men in the United States. One in four men will die from heart disease. Of those that die suddenly, half of them exhibited no previous symptoms. This is why it is so important for men to be aware of their risks and to take steps to protect their heart health. Men on average develop heart disease 10 years younger than women. This may be due to the fact that estrogen has a protective effect on coronary arteries. Stress also takes a toll on men's health.

Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is diagnosed when a man has consistent trouble developing or sustaining an erection for successful sexual intercourse. Also known as impotence, it is a condition that is stressful, affects self-confidence, and can contribute to relationship problems. However, it is also a condition that, in many instances, is treatable. The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approach to treating erectile dysfunction (ED) is holistic, taking the view that a healthy body is a body in balance. As problems with sexual health are linked with imbalances of the kidney, liver, and heart, therapies focus on restoring balance and a smooth flow of qi in these vulnerable systems. Once the balance has been restored to the body, all functions, including sexual functions, improve. In addition to being an effective treatment for ED, TCM can also help to improve overall men's health by addressing common imbalances that can lead to other problems such as fatigue, poor digestion, and low libido. As a result, TCM is an excellent choice for men who are looking for a safe and natural way to improve their overall health and well-being.

Can TCM treat prostate cancer? One common problem that men face as they get older is an enlarged prostate gland. This can lead to prostate cancer, which is the leading cause of male cancer deaths. The incidence and mortality of prostate cancer rise exponentially after the age of 50, with a mean age of 72. However, there are some things that men can do to reduce their risk of developing this disease. Prostate cancer is a men's health issue that is often asymptomatic in the early stages. This can make it difficult to diagnose, as many men only seek help when the disease is already advanced. Lower urinary tract symptoms (obstructive or irritative symptoms), hematuria (blood in the urine), urinary incontinence, and symptoms of metastasis to other organs are all common presentations of prostate cancer. Metastasis most commonly occurs in the spine, lungs, and brain, which can lead to back pain, lower limb paralysis, cough, and bloody sputum, headache, and seizure respectively. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible for further testing and treatment. TCM treatments such as acupuncture and herbal medicine can help to reduce the fatigue, nausea, and other side effects experienced by men undergoing prostate cancer treatment. In addition, TCM can help to boost the immune system and improve overall health, making it an effective preventative measure against prostate cancer. For men facing this serious disease, traditional Chinese medicine can be an important part of their treatment plan. Is tcm for men's health covered by my insurance?
