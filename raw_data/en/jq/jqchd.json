Find your personal ground note. Nada Yoga - The Yoga of Sound. New findings support the notion that all living creatures are not simply a blend of matter but are shaped by sound energy in motion. While these vibrations are common to all living things each has their own individual sound frequency, called ground note - this includes HUMAN BEINGS. To experience a personal ground note is wonderfully spiritual. An Indian scientist Vemu Mukunda discovered that the key to each individuals personal ground note is to be found within the voice! Mukunda developed a method by which a specialized sound therapist can locate a personal ground note in a 2-3 hour individual session. This ground note resonates from the core of a person\u00b4s being, and once discovered can be relied upon to provide either energy or tranquility at any time. Ground notes are unique and are shaped by each person's own character, abilities and characteristics. In fact by practicing the special exercises originated by Nada Yoga an individual can extend effect of the personal ground note to benefit life on daily basis: confidence and personality will grow, debilities will be reduced. Because sound is working holistically, our whole energy system will get harmonized becoming a well-tuned instrument! If you are interested in discovering your personal ground note, you can make an appointment with a Nada Yoga teacher and authorized sound therapist at HOLIWAY GARDEN RESORT & SPA.
