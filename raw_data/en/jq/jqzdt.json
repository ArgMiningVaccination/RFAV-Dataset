Eyes reflect mind, eyes reflect psyche, and eyes reflect HEALTH! No wonder homeopathy that caters effectively the 'mind' of an individual has lot to offer in problems of eyes. Eye is certainly one of the most delicate organs of the body and therefore, caring for eyes has to be done by an expert. Here one should remember that while treating homeopathically, we should not give much importance to the diagnostic name of the eye problem but its signs and symptoms that point us to the accurate remedy.[1,2,3] Sudden Blurry Vision An abrupt and dramatic loss of vision may be a sign of a problem with the blood flow to your eye or your brain. Immediate medical attention can prevent serious damage and may even save your life. Even if your vision gets better quickly, it might still be a warning of a stroke or the beginning of a migraine headache.[1,2,3,4] Bulging Eyes Graves' disease causes your thyroid gland to release too many hormones, which can lead to this problem. It also may cause diarrhea, weight loss, and hand tremors. Medication or surgery can help control the amount of hormones your thyroid makes, but they won't cure the underlying disease \u2014 and may not help your eyes.[1,2] Sudden Blurry Vision An abrupt and dramatic loss of vision may be a sign of a problem with the blood flow to your eye or your brain. Immediate medical attention can prevent serious damage and may even save your life. Even if your vision gets better quickly, it might still be a warning of a stroke or the beginning of a migraine headache. Blurred Vision This can be a sign of diabetes, which causes too much sugar in your blood. If it isn't well managed, you may get diabetic retinopathy (when tiny blood vessels in your eyes leak blood and other fluids). You may have blurred vision and find it hard to see at night. Doctors can use a laser to seal the leaks and get rid of unwanted new blood vessels. This may affect your side vision, but it can save your central vision.[1,2,3,4] Ring Around Your Cornea This condition, called corneal arcus, causes a gray-white line of fat deposits to grow on the outside edge of your cornea (a clear, curved surface at the front of your eye that helps it focus). Sometimes, the deposits make a complete ring. If you're older, it's probably not anything to worry about. But if you're under 40, it could be a sign of dangerously high cholesterol.[1,2,3,5,7] Bulging Eyes Graves' disease causes your thyroid gland to release too many hormones, which can lead to this problem. It also may cause diarrhea, weight loss, and hand tremors. Medication or surgery can help control the amount of hormones your thyroid makes, but they won't cure the underlying disease \u2014 and may not help your eyes. Drooping Eyelids This can be a symptom of myasthenia gravis, which makes your immune system attack and weaken your muscles. It affects your eye, face, and throat muscles more than others and can make it difficult to chew, swallow, or even speak. Your doctor may filter your blood to help ease your symptoms, but that doesn't work for long. There's also medication for it. But in some cases, surgery is needed to remove the thymus gland.2,5,8 Yellow Whites of Your Eyes When your skin and eyes look yellow, that's called jaundice. It often means you have liver problems and is caused by high levels of bilirubin, something your liver makes more of when it's inflamed or damaged. Bad diet, cancer, infection, and chronic alcohol abuse can all damage your liver. Treatment ranges from lifestyle changes to medication to liver transplants.2,3.4 Night Blindness If it's hard for you to see in low light, you might need glasses or you could have cataracts \u2014 a natural part of aging. But night blindness is not common among younger people in the U.S. In unusual circumstances, you may not be getting enough vitamin A. This is fairly common in poorer countries. It's treated with supplements or a diet with foods high in vitamin A, like sweet potatoes, beef liver, spinach, carrots, and pumpkins.2,3,6 Age-Related Vision Problems Age-related vision changes happen to many people as they grow older. But eye problems aren't something you should simply write off as normal. Some problems stem from new or worsening vision disorders. As you get older, these might happen gradually. Others happen suddenly, quickly causing blindness. That is why regular exams with an eye doctor are so important. You can take steps to lower your risk of age-related vision problems. Or, if you have changes, you can slow their progression. Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) With AMD, the macula, or central part of the tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina), becomes damaged. This makes tasks involving central vision \u2014 reading fine print, for example \u2014 much harder. But you do maintain side vision. The dry type of AMD affects 9 out of 10 people with macular degeneration. It causes more gradual, subtle vision loss from the breakdown of cells in the retina. For example, you may see parts of letters, or straight lines may appear wavy. The dry type of AMD can develop into the wet type. Other symptoms include: Hazy vision Needing extra light or having trouble when going from bright to low light Trouble reading or recognizing people's faces Colors appearing less vivid The wet type of AMD causes sudden, severe loss of central vision from leaking blood vessels growing in or under the retina. You may see a large dark spot in the center of your vision. If you have these blind spots, see an eye doctor right away. Other symptoms include: Distorted vision Objects appearing a different size for each eye Colors appearing less vivid or differently in each eye You may be more likely to get AMD if you smoke, have a family history of AMD, or are obese. Other risk factors include genetics, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, and a lack of nutrients reaching the retina. There is no cure for AMD, but there are options that may slow the progression of wet macular degeneration. Anti-VEGF treatment limits growth of new blood vessels in the eye that can threaten vision. Thermal laser treatment uses heat to disrupt the disease. Photodynamic therapy destroys blood vessels in the eye that are leaking and damaging vision. Your doctor may recommend you take certain vitamins and minerals \u2014 including zinc, vitamins C and E, and lutein and zeaxanthin \u2014 in specific doses to slow down AMD when it's still in its early stages.6,7,9 Glaucoma Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that causes vision loss. High pressure inside the eye or poor circulation causes damage to the optic nerve. This nerve carries images from the eye to the brain. The more common forms of glaucoma develop slowly and show no clear symptoms early on. You may not know you have it. But it can cause blindness. Age makes it more likely, as do these things: A family history of glaucoma African or Hispanic ancestry High levels of farsightedness or nearsightedness Past eye injury High eye pressure or low blood pressure Diabetes Treatments include eye drops, other medication, laser treatment, and surgery.6 Cataracts With a cataract, the lens of the eye becomes cloudy and your vision gets blurry. They're often associated with aging. Half of all Americans have them by the time they reach 80. Symptoms of a cataract often develop slowly and can include: Blurry, cloudy, or dim vision \u2014 a little like looking through a dirty windshield Double vision with one eye Trouble seeing at night or in dim light Halos around lights Sensitivity to light and glare Faded or yellow colors, or trouble telling the difference between blues and greens Trouble seeing an object against a background of the same color These factors raise your risk for developing cataract: Lots of exposure to sunlight Smoking High cholesterol or high blood pressure Diabetes Previous eye injury or surgery Family history of cataracts At earlier stages, simply changing your eyeglass or contacts prescription is all you need. Using brighter lights for reading or a magnifying glass may also help. If halos or glare are problems, limit night driving. Glare can also happen during the day, so make sure your vision prescription is up to date, and ask if special tinting could lessen glare. If a cataract begins to interfere with your day-to-day life, an ophthalmologist specializing in cataract surgery can remove the cloudy lens and replace it with a clear lens implant.6 Other Retinal Diseases Diabetic retinopathyis a complication of uncontrolled diabetes. It happens when blood vessels grow in the retina and leak fluid or bleed. You may have blurred vision and trouble reading, among other symptoms. Laser treatment can \"zap\" leakage in early stages of the disease, sometimes preventing more serious complications. But the best way to protect vision is to monitor and maintain normal blood sugar levels. Retinal vessel occlusion is a common complication of diabetes or glaucoma. It happens when a vein in the retina becomes blocked. It's also more likely if you have high blood pressure or narrowing of the arteries. Depending upon the type of blockage you have, you may have subtle, painless, moderate vision loss that comes and goes. Or you may have sudden, severe vision loss and pain that requires immediate medical care. Management includes close observation and treatment of any complications. [7,8,9,10] Homeopathic approach to treating eye disease... The homeopathic approach to treating eye disease is much different than the traditional approach of using eye drops and surgery. I hope to explain that injections and laser for macular degeneration, cataract surgery go against homeopathic laws of healing and are causing suppression. This is leading to an decrease in our health and well being! In fact, the standard method of lowering pressure by blocking aqueous production with eye drops is much like treating a person with high blood pressure by giving him medication to stop the production of blood! It does not make sense! Homeopathic treatment is based on true laws of healing. True laws do not change over time. When I studied homeopathy I used the same text books that were used over 250 years ago. These homeopathic laws of healing have not changed unlike modern medicine which changes treatment methods every year. Are we benefiting from these modern approaches? I do not think so, in fact as a whole, eye disease, especially macular degeneration and glaucoma are increasing. There's been a dramatic increase in eye disease worldwide. Why is this happening? Can homeopathic laws explain this increase? According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, age-related eye disease including cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration are expected to dramatically increase from 28 million today to 43 million by the year 2020 The Archives of Ophthalmology published a study in the year 2003 looking at 10,500 patients. Age-related macular degeneration increased from 5 per cent to 27.1 per cent between 1991 and 1999. Primary open-angle glaucoma has increased by 13.8%. The first law in homeopathy is the Law of Similars. This states that a substance that produces (symptoms) or disease in a healthy person will be able to cure these symptoms in a disease state. An example is Belladonna. A healthy individual ingesting belladonna will develop a fever with a throbbing headache, red face, thirst and hallucinations. So a sick person presenting with these symptoms will benefit from taking Belladonna. The body has a wisdom and disease is an attempt for the body to produce homeostasis or a balance. When a person develops a fever the body needs this fever to fight off an infection. A homeopathic remedy supports what the body needs to do to achieve homeostasis. Traditional medicine treats with opposites so a person will receive a medication to lower the fever- a opposite affect. But this goes against the bodies wisdom in trying to achieve a balance. It does not heal but simply suppresses the symptoms and does not treat the underlying problem. It may seem very dangerous to give a substance that can cause the same symptoms. Wouldn't this cause an aggravation? Interestingly this approach helps the body achieve its goal of homeostasis. Once the homeopathic medicine begins to act the body no longer needs the symptoms or disease and the problem is eradicated. The second law is Herrings Law. This states that the body acquires disease in a certain direction and then disease will leave in the opposite direction. For example patients with skin disease who are treated with steroids with often develop asthma. The disease is pushed deeper into the body leading to a more serious disease. When this same person is treated homeopathically the asthma will improve but the skin condition will return. The last law is the Law of dilution. This for most people is the most difficult to understand. Homeopathic remedies are diluted to infinitesimal dilutions. How can they work? remember the Law of Similars. We select homeopathic remedies that produce the same action as the disease. We want the homeopathic remedy to act as a gentle catalyst to restore the boy to homeostasis. I'd like to talk about suppression as an explanation for the increase in eye disease. Unfortunately most modern medicine produces suppression by pushing the disease inward and deeper with the result of more serious problem.11,12,13 Here are some examples of suppression Antibiotics for conjunctivitis Treatment of chronic blepharitis Steroid eye drops Cataract surgery Laser surgery and injections for retinal disease Why? The disease is being treated with opposites and this causes the disease to be pushed deeper in the body. This will result in a more serious eye problem Here are some of the side effects or the results of suppression in using steroid eye drops. These are listed by modern medicine as \"side effects\" but they are the result of suppression Increase in intraocular pressure, sometimes leading to glaucoma. Causing cataracts Infections Herpes simplex Corneal ulcers Injections and laser for macular degeneration might help improve the vision for the short term but for the long term the results can produce serious side effects due to suppression. Glaucoma eye drops can particularly be suppressive when used to lower the intraocular pressure. Glaucoma medications suppress the natural production of aqueous humor, which is essential in transporting oxygen and nutrients to the eye. There are hoards of homeopathic remedies useful in the treatment of various eye problems. However, one must remember that for constitutional eye problems like cataract, glaucoma, recurrent blepharitis or conjunctivitis, corneal opacities, and/or recurrent styes, one must go for constitutional prescribing after carefully considering the physical, mental, and emotional characteristic of the individual; then only it is possible to impart perfect cure! But one must be acquainted with certain remedies that specifically render beautiful results in varied eye problems so that they can be used for acute prescribing as well. Here is the list of few homeopathic remedies for eye problems[14,15,16,17] (1) Euphrasia - Acute catarrhal conjunctivitis - Eyes water all the time with inclination to blink frequently - Acrid burning eye discharge that corrodes the margins of the lids - Corneal opacities with thick discharges that burn - Blistery cornea - One of the great remedies for rheumatic iritis that may be associated with partial ptosis - Almost always associated with bland and watery coryza - Swelling of the lids with burning, which feels better when in open air - Worse in the evening, indoors, light, warmth - Better open air, coffee, dark - Must be compared with Allium cepa while dealing with allergic rhinitis associated with conjunctivitis.
