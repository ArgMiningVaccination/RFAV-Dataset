As you plan for delivery at the Riley Maternity Tower, review the helpful information below on what to expect, and reach out to your physician if you have any questions or concerns. COVID-19 FAQs: Pregnancy & Childbirth COVID-19 FAQs: Pregnancy & Childbirth As an expectant mother, you may have a little more anxiety these days. We want to reassure you that you, your baby and our team members are our first priority. As part of the largest healthcare system in Indiana, we are well-positioned to adapt our approach to best meet your pregnancy care needs. Each patient's care will be evaluated on an individual basis. Visit our [COVID-19 online resource center](https://iuhealth.org/covid19) for the latest updates from IU Health. We value the trust you have placed in our skilled physicians, nurses and team members. We are proud to be your partner during this time. We will continue to bring an unwavering commitment to providing you and your baby with the compassionate, safe and quality care you deserve. We know you will likely have questions. We have answered the following questions to help ease concerns about your labor and delivery at this time. When it comes to labor and delivery, can I have a support person with me? If you are admitted to an IU Health hospital and in labor, one visitor is allowed with you. The visitor must be the same person throughout the entire stay and must screen negative for COVID-19. We encourage you to stay connected with your loved ones through video conferencing apps available to you. Am I a high-risk person for COVID-19 while I'm pregnant? Pregnant women are in the same high-risk category as the elderly, as well as women who are within 6-8 weeks after delivery due to immune system concerns. Data suggests that pregnant women are not more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 if they become infected. Am I allowed to have a doula during labor and delivery? Yes. A doula is considered part of your healthcare team and can also be allowed in addition to your support person. Will I or my newborn be close or come in contact with any COVID-19 patients? No. All patients and visitors are screened for COVID-19 upon entry. Patients with symptoms will not be near you or your newborn. You will be directed or escorted to the labor and delivery unit upon arrival. Additional personal protective equipment like eye wear and face shields are being worn by our providers. What if I test positive for COVID-19? Can I pass the infection to my newborn? If you test positive for COVID-19, we can help you take steps to reduce the risk of infecting your baby. We will make sure you receive the follow-up care you need to best manage potential symptoms and complications of infection. Babies who test positive for COVID-19 generally recover completely, but it is a new illness and the risk to newborns is not entirely understood. Will there be any changes in my care after delivery? Postpartum care will remain relatively the same in hospital. Depending on your location, the nursery may be closed, in which case rooming-in will be encouraged. Well-check appointments and postpartum check-ups will be moved virtually if appropriate. Can my prenatal appointments be virtual or over the phone? We will conduct some routine office visits by video or telephone based on your care needs. We have been reducing in-person visits to decrease the amount of in-office traffic. We are working hard to communicate changes before your visit, but please call your doctor's office if you have any questions about your appointment. Will I be able to schedule pre- or post-birth class, delivery suite tour or pediatric get-to-know you visits? Depending on your location, classes, tours and visits have been cancelled or moved virtually. To view all virtual classes and events, visit [iuhealth.org/classes-events](https://iuhealth.org/classes-events). For further details, talk to your provider or call your office. Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding? The CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines for all people who are pregnant, breastfeeding or trying to get pregnant now or in the future. The CDC also says pregnant people with COVID-19 have an [increased risk of severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html) compared with non-pregnant people. Pregnant people with COVID-19 also might be at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, compared with pregnant individuals without COVID-19. There is no evidence that fertility problems are a side effect of any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines. What do IU Health experts recommend for pregnant or breastfeeding individuals? IU Health supports the recommendations from the CDC. IU Health recommends that people who are pregnant or breastfeeding consult with their doctors on the right course of action for them. Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals can sign up for a COVID-19 vaccine by visiting [ourshot.in.gov](https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/vaccine/). Do I have to wear a mask in my room or while I'm in labor? Masking is required when any care team member is in the room. However, exceptions to masking are made when pushing begins to help mom be comfortable during delivery.
