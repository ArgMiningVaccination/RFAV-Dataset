The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Nature) We recognize your inherent healing ability. We identify and help you remove obstacles to recovery and support your healing ability. Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam) We identify and remove the underlying causes of your illness, rather than merely suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm (Primum Non-Nocere) We follow three principles to avoid harming you: Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects; Avoid, when possible, the harmful suppression of symptoms; Acknowledge and respect your healing process, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat your illness. Doctor as Teacher (Docere) We educate you and encourage self-responsibility for health. We also acknowledge the therapeutic value inherent in the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person (Tolle Totum) We treat you as an individual by taking into account physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, we encourage you to pursue your personal spiritual path. We treat people and not diseases. We are committed to healing our community for your environment contributes to your health. Prevention (Praevenire) We emphasize disease prevention, assessment of risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease and making appropriate interventions to prevent illness. We strive to create a healthy world in which we all may thrive Naturopathic Education We are Naturopathic Doctors who attended four years of post-graduate medical training at an accredited naturopathic medical school where we were trained as primary care physicians integrating traditional healing methods with modern scientific medicine to be able to provide you with the best care. The training involves four years of classes with two years of supervised clinical rotations toward becoming a primary care physician. The Naturopathic doctoral candidate averages 25-30 credits a quarter. The curriculum involves the standard classes of basic sciences, clinical diagnosis, and treatment of most major medical schools. In addition, Naturopathic Doctors receive training in diet and nutrient therapies, botanical medicine, osseous and soft tissue manipulation, hydrotherapy, counseling, and homeopathy. To be licensable, the Naturopathic doctor must pass a set of science boards taken after the second year and a set of clinical board exams taken after the fourth year. We are registered through the Minnesota Board of Medical practice. Several states, such as Iowa, do not have a license available for Naturopathic doctors. This means that anyone can claim the title \"Naturopath\" and put N.D. behind their name regardless of whether they have attended a four year accredited medical school. In Minnesota, Naturopathic Doctors who meet licensing requirements register with the MN Board of Medical Practice. This helps to ensure the title Naturopathic Doctor means the individual has met certain requirements such as having graduated from an accredited four-year naturopathic medical school and passed board examinations. Registration also provides a scope of practice that includes making diagnosis, ordering labs, and prescribing botanical medicine, nutrient therapy, homeopathic medicines, glandulars and providing therapeutic procedures. Please contact your legislators about improving the scope of practice for Naturopathic Doctors to allow us to provide you with better care. "}
