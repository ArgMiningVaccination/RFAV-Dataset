When I asked about her health history, there were lots of prior use of antibiotics for prior incidences of strep, pneumonia and earaches as a child/youth. At about eleven years of age, she'd begun her periods which were excruciatingly painful, for which her family's doctor had put her on \"The Pill\" (BCP). She was on this protocol until she married and tried to conceive a child. As an aside, did you know that \"The Pill\" was only tried on about 132 women and 3 of them died? Please read John Robbin's book, [Reclaiming Our Health: Exploding the Medical Myth and Embracing the Source of True Healing,](http://amzn.to/1RYNJbg) if you want to double check this reference. Also, there are no studies confirming what the long term effects are for keeping women on this deleterious drug, especially during their formative hormonal development. We've been used as the living test subjects where the patriarchal system hasn't a shred of concern for our long term health or procreative desires later on. By not solving the root cause for why this woman (I'll call her Janet) was in pain at 11 years of age, we suppressed her symptoms, mimicked that she was hormonally pregnant for more than 15 years, and then wonder why she can't make a baby now. It is asinine and a blight of medical mismanagement. Guess who's called in to mop up the issues?! Yes, while I'd MUCH rather be called in to serve the patient when she was 11, which is why I write so vehemently about these issues so consciousness and awareness starts to be raised enough and the word spreads to treat the root cause of issues such as these when the issues are first engendered. I may be really charged up about this, as this was also my plight. I was on 222s with codeine in my teens every time I got my period given the extreme pain. I was also left to bleed to the point of passing out in a Toronto hospital because the doctors did not take my dysmenorrhea seriously. I also had a \"mini-stroke\" on \"The Pill\" after driving myself to the hospital in my uncle's Cadillac, when I should have chosen an ambulance instead. You see, I didn't know a woman at 22 could have blood pressure so high that a stroke was even possible! Can you see where this is all going? One sick woman, one autistic babe, and a destroyed immune function by antibiotics and fibromyalgia-like symptoms later, became my own deleterious plight. The root cause of my own ills left at large by a system of medicine that had no capacity to solve them. There is no, natural law or 'like cures like' in their toolbox, which leaves most of us women feeling ultimately, and utterly, forsaken. So when Janet queried if Heilkunst principles and I could \"save\" her, I sighed to myself. How many women who suffer exactly this phenomenon have darkened our door. The answer is dozens and the scenario is always sadly the same! I let her know right away that we've helped many of these individuals succeed in becoming pregnant. You can read [Reanna's testimonial here](http://arcanum.ca/2015/02/03/reannas-fertility-story-i-knew-this-was-the-last-place-i-would-have-to-turn-to-have-a-baby/) if you'd like. The process for solving Janet's issue outright is dynamic. I asked her a barrage of questions during this FREE 20 minutes Question & Answer Session: - \"What's your blood type?\" (We need to use alkalizing foods to help neutralize the acid from a non-resonant diet.) - How much fermented foods are you getting? (We've found that homemade kefir, sauerkraut and kombucha can all help to get your intestinal flora back on track, creating a more resonant environment for hosting another living organism.) - \"Are there c [ancer](http://arcanum.ca/2015/07/13/cancer-and-how-we-solve-it-dynamically-with-heilkunst-homeopathy-orgastic-potency-oxygen-iodine-vitamin-d-and-gerson-therapy/), thyroid conditions, and diabetes up your family line?\" (In these cases, there always is and Janet is no exception, as the Miasm is coloured all through both her mom and dad's side, causing much of the health issues she suffers. We will apply natural law, like cures like, at the appropriate intervals to address this predisposition outright.) - \"Can you create a timeline of all the shocks and traumas of your use of BCP, antibiotic, strept., pneumonia and vaccines (including boosters)? If you choose to work with us, we'll forward a guide for how to plot this.\" (These bacterias and suppressive drugs will be gumming up her works preventing any new life from being easily received. The glut of over-estrogen from the BCP plays a big role in this. Please note that IVF protocols generally worsen the condition of the ground substance, doesn't solve the root cause, causing further feelings of victimization both mentally and physically. Also, there are no long term studies on how further hormone manipulation affects your long-term health.) - \"Can you please have your pH tested before we get started?\" (Babies can not easily be conceived in a hostile, low oxygenated environment and the cancer matrix, and all the drugs, will have made her incredibly acidic and unreceptive to new life. Quite often these individuals will come in around 4.5 pH when normal is 7.3 pH.) - \"Can you begin, also, by choosing alkaline protocols such as daily carrot juicing and using this baking soda home remedy for acidosis (see recipe below*)?\" (By de-acidifying the biological ground substance in the body, the individual will decrease acidosis, the risk for cancer, also making the internal bio-sphere more habitable for new life.) - \"Are you living a deep and resonant love with your beloved partner?\" (Admittedly, I've seen a whole case sabotaged as the patient, due to overt stress, has subconsciously reduced her beloved to \"a sperm donor.\" Like financial worries, conception worries and prior victimization make unworthy bedfellows in relationships and will also sabotage baby making.) I've illustrated this process for you in the hopes that you will share with others. For us women, infertility has become a scourge of our times. I wanted to explain this process as simply as possible so that you can see more clearly how to prevent this deleterious phenomenon and help me to back it up to its inception, when our children show the first signs of hormonal imbalance. By solving it naturally, without causing harm using Heilkunst principles, we can more easily fall in love with our resonant other and fully realize our unions by actualizing our full procreative powers endowed to us by our maker, a benevolent Mother/Father God. It is important to know that the oscillating force that put you here on this physical plane gets the final veto power or we produce fear and anger, producing even more acidosis. When we feel thwarted, we must remember that on occasion \"our will\" is trumped, or in contraindication to, \"thy will.\" Source gets the final yay or nay for reasons neither one of us may understand. Your pro-creativity may be destined for more lofty, spiritual purposes than you might deem at this moment in time. For example, my potential third child, instead, became serving folks like you and writing this piece. *Recipe Extracted from [RealFarmacy.com](http://www.realfarmacy.com/body-acidic/) Ingredients 1/3 tsp. baking soda (organic plus non-aluminum) 2 tablespoons fresh (organic) lemon juice or organic apple cider vinegar Method Mix everything together.
