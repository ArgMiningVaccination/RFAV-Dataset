Finally, we discovered a novel adjuvant enhancer which improved the adjuvant activities of TLR7/8 in vitro and in vivo. We found that certain amphiphilic oligonucleotides could improve TLR7 ligand induced NF-kB activation in the presence of albumin protein. In vivo, administration of imiquimod-adjuvanted vaccine mixed with structurally optimized amphiphilic oligonucleotide-based adjuvant booster induced markedly increased frequency of antigen-specific CD 8+ T cells and production of antigen-specific IgG in mice, while the same vaccine without adjuvant booster showed no effect. Thus, lipid functionalized oligonucleotide-based adjuvants booster could greatly improve immunogenicity of subunit vaccines. Collectively, lipid functionalized oligonucleotides not only accumulate in LNs by hitchhiking endogenous albumin, but also versatilely modulate the immune responses. Amphiphilic oligonucleotides may be broadly applicable for diseases involving the immune system, where immunomodulation is needed. Recommended Citation Yu, Chunsong, \"Immune Modulation By "}
