With the hot, muggy summer season arriving, kids will be heading to the pool to cool off. While swimming is refreshing, fun and good exercise, even chlorinated pools contain many germs that can make them ill. Mayo Clinic pediatric experts warn that many swimmers may not be aware of the water illnesses associated with pools due to the germs that can linger. VIDEO ALERT: To download broadcast quality video of this report, please register for the Mayo Clinic News Network. \"A swimming pool is basically a community bathtub without the shampoo,\" says Thomas Boyce, M.D., pediatric infectious diseases specialist, Mayo Clinic Children's Center. \"Children can still get sick in a properly chlorinated pool. Chlorine does not kill germs instantly and, in fact, does not kill cryptosporidium at all, which is a common germ that causes water-associated gastrointestinal illness.\" Recreational water illness outbreaks peak in summer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 21.6 percent of Americans don't know that swimming while they have diarrhea puts other swimmers at risk for water-associated illnesses. To help keep germs from entering the water, Dr. Boyce advises parents to take young children on bathroom breaks often; change their diapers in the bathroom, not poolside; and wash a toddler's bottom with soap and water before entering the water. Swimming is a great way for kids to cool off and get exercise in the summer, however, Dr. Boyce cautions that children who swallow water while they swim can be at risk for diarrhea, viral meningitis and other illnesses. Parents can keep children safe by having their children rinse off before entering the pool, not allowing children with diarrhea to swim and teaching children not to swallow the pool water that they swim in, he says. ROCHESTER, Minn. \u2014 June 14, 2012. Stopping smoking \u2014 at any age \u2014 offers almost immediate health benefits, according to the June issue of Mayo Clinic Health Letter. Recent reports about side effects of drugs used to help stop smoking shouldn't dissuade smokers from trying to quit. Side effects from these medications are usually infrequent, minor, and manageable \u2014 either by reducing doses or switching to another medication. Stopping smoking has many significant health benefits. Just 20 minutes after the last cigarette, the heart rate decreases. Twelve hours later, carbon monoxide in the blood returns to normal. A year after stopping, the risk of having a heart attack related to smoking drops by half. Stopping is difficult, and most smokers make many attempts before they have long-term success. Smokers who are successful often take advantage of behavior counseling and medications. A variety of drug options can help ease withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings. Mayo Clinic Health Letter provides an overview of medication options and potential side effects or risks. Nicotine patch: With a steady dose of nicotine, smokers double their odds of successfully quitting. The odds nearly triple when patches are combined with fast-acting nicotine replacement. Potential side effects include skin irritation, dizziness, racing or irregular heartbeat, sleep problems, headaches and nausea. Sleep problems can be minimized by removing the patch at night. Nicotine gum, nasal spray, inhalers and lozenges: These fast-acting nicotine replacements help minimize cravings. Using these products doubles the odds of successfully stopping. However, nicotine replacements may irritate the mouth, nose and throat, plus they can cause coughing, nausea, headache and minor digestive issues. Varenicline (Chantix): This drug decreases withdrawal symptoms and reduces the feelings of pleasure from smoking. It increases the odds of successfully stopping by at least 2.5 times. Possible side effects are nausea, headache, insomnia and vivid dreams. Rarely, it's associated with serious psychiatric symptoms such as depressed mood, agitation and suicidal thoughts. Bupropion (Zyban): Use of bupropion doubles the odds of successfully stopping and may help minimize weight gain. It increases the levels of brain chemicals that are also boosted by nicotine, decreasing withdrawal symptoms and reducing pleasure from smoking. Possible side effects are sleep disturbances, dry mouth and headache. It's very rarely associated with serious psychiatric symptoms. ROCHESTER, Minn. \u2014 June 14, 2012. Symptoms of gastric discomfort \u2014 indigestion, heartburn and stomach cramps \u2014 usually diminish in just a few hours. But for some people, digestive distress persists and becomes a constant concern. An eight-page Special Report in the June issue of Mayo Clinic Health Letter focuses on digestive health problems, which often can be successfully treated or managed. Highlights include: Many causes, many treatments: The Special Report covers treatments for digestive problems including ulcers, celiac disease, pancreatitis, Crohn's disease, diverticular disease, gallstones and liver disease. Seeking medical care sooner, rather than later, can help manage or even cure these conditions. Early action also may prevent a serious condition from becoming life threatening. Aging alone isn't the problem: People often blame aging for digestive problems. With aging, changes do occur. For example, the stomach loses elasticity and doesn't hold as much food. But, in general, changes due to aging have a mild impact on digestion. Heartburn (or heart attack?): Emergency care is recommended when heartburn seems different or worse than usual, especially if it occurs during physical activity or is accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, dizziness, nausea or pain radiating into the shoulder and arm. The heart and esophagus are in close proximity and share similar nerve connections. They both can cause chest pain, ranging from mild to severe. And distinguishing heartburn from heart attack is not always easy. Don't blame spicy food: Most ulcers develop because of a bacterial infection or as a side effect of medications, not because of last night's dinner. The most common ulcer symptom is gnawing pain in the upper abdomen between the navel and breastbone. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and medications to reduce the level of acid in the stomach and give it a chance to heal. Being 'regular' doesn't mean every day: Constipation \u2014 one of the most common complaints among older adults \u2014 is generally defined as having fewer than three bowel movements a week with stools that are hard and painful. In contrast, easy bowel movements, even if they occur just every other day, would be considered normal. Constipation may be caused by dehydration, overuse of laxatives, medication side effects, a pattern of delaying bowel movements or underlying medication conditions. Exercise and adequate fiber in the diet can help. A physician can recommend other treatments such as fiber supplements or a brief course of laxatives. ROCHESTER, Minn. \u2014 June 14, 2012.

Mayo Clinic announced today that Lawrence W. and Marilyn W. Matteson of Moline, Ill., have given $10 million to help launch the Mayo Clinic Proton Beam Therapy Program. With this gift, Mayo Clinic will also use matching gift funds to establish the Lawrence W. and Marilyn W. Matteson Fund in Cancer Research. Mayo's Proton Beam Therapy Program will use the most advanced intensity-modulated technology known as pencil beam scanning, which few centers now use. Construction of the proton beam facilities in Rochester, Minn., and Phoenix, Ariz., are under way, and one of four gantries in the proton therapy facility being built in Rochester, Minn., will be named in their honor. The first treatment rooms will be available for patients in 2015 in Rochester, Minn., and in 2016 in Phoenix, Ariz. Unlike conventional radiation therapy, which can damage healthy tissue while it destroys the tumor, proton therapy delivers nearly its entire dose within the tumor, sparing healthy tissue surrounding the cancer. This form of therapy is especially vital in sensitive areas such as the brain and lungs and is especially useful for treating children, who are at higher risk for radiation damage because their bones and tissues are still growing. \"Mr. Matteson is a grateful patient who has been very impressed with the care he received at Mayo Clinic,\" says Robert Foote, M.D.,chair of the Mayo Clinic Department of Radiation Oncology in Rochester Department of Radiation Oncology in Rochester. \"Mr. and Mrs. Matteson wanted a way to show their gratitude and chose to donate funds that will help us ease the burden cancer has on patients, especially young children.\" \"This gift is going to benefit children who are going through terrible cancers to not have the residual effects they would have with regular treatment,\" said Mrs. Matteson. \"The side effects won't be something that follows them for the rest of their lives.\" The Mattesons generously supported The Campaign for Mayo Clinic, a successful $1.3 billion fundraising initiative that concluded in 2009. Mr. Matteson and his son, Larry, of Burlington, Iowa, are the founders of L.W. Matteson, Inc., a marine construction and dredging company in Burlington. The company maintained one of the largest fleets of dredging and marine construction equipment on the Mississippi River. The company was sold in 2010. Mr. Matteson and his son maintain ownership of Matteson Marine, which operates switch boats on the Mississippi. Mrs. Matteson is retired from John Deere. ROCHESTER, Minn. \u2014 June 13, 2012. There is a lot of conflicting advice about prostate cancer screening. A recent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommendation against prostate-specific antigen testing, regardless of age, has added to men's confusion about how to protect themselves from a cancer that hits roughly 240,000 new patients every year and claims 28,000 lives. VIDEO ALERT: PSA: To Test or Not To Test To download broadcast quality video of this report, please register for the Mayo Clinic News Network. Mayo Clinic urologists recommend a personalized approach to determining whether or not a patient should consider PSA screening for prostate cancer. This approach should begin at age 40 and include: Individual and family medical history. The patient's age, recognizing the age-related increase in cancer risk. The patient's ethnic background, noting that African-American men have the highest risk of prostate cancer. A discussion of the pros and cons of PSA screening. Other medical conditions that can affect PSA score. Organizations that recommend PSA screening generally encourage the test between ages 40 and 75 and in men with a higher risk of prostate cancer, says Mayo urologist Jeffrey Karnes, M.D. \"It may be a simple test but it's not a simple decision,\" Dr. Karnes says. \"A PSA test is something you should decide after discussing it with your doctor, considering your risk factors and weighing your personal preferences.\" Cancer overall is the No. 2 health threat to men. June is Men's Health Month, highlighting health issues of particular concern to men and strategies for prevention and treatment. Dr. Karnes and other Mayo Clinic urologists are available for media interviews about prostate cancer screening strategies for men in their 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s that take into account the pros and cons of PSA testing. They're also available to talk about new gene-based prostate cancer screening tests on the horizon.

The billions of bugs in our guts have a newfound role: regulating the immune system and related autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, according to researchers at Mayo Clinic and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Larger-than-normal populations of specific gut bacteria may trigger the development of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and possibly fuel disease progression in people genetically predisposed to this crippling and confounding condition, say the researchers, who are participating in the Mayo Illinois Alliance for Technology Based Healthcare. The study is published in the April 2012 issue of PloS ONE. \"A lot of people suspected that gut flora played a role in rheumatoid arthritis, but no one had been able to prove it because they couldn't say which came first \u2014 the bacteria or the genes,\" says senior author Veena Taneja, Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic immunologist. \"Using genomic sequencing technologies, we have been able to show the gut microbiome may be used as a biomarker for predisposition.\" The roughly 10 trillion cells that make up the human body have neighbors: mostly bacteria that often help, training the immune system and aiding in digestion, for example. The bacteria in the intestines, in addition to a relatively small number of other microorganisms (the gut microbiome), outnumber human cells 10-to-1. Researchers found that hormones and changes related to aging may further modulate the gut immune system and exacerbate inflammatory conditions in genetically susceptible individuals. Nearly 1 percent of the world's population has rheumatoid arthritis, a disease in which the immune system attacks tissues, inflaming joints and sometimes leading to deadly complications such as heart disease. Other diseases with suspected gut bacterial ties include type I diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Researchers with the Mayo Illinois Alliance for Technology Based Healthcare say that identifying new biomarkers in intestinal microbial populations and maintaining a balance in gut bacteria could help physicians stop rheumatoid arthritis before it starts. \"This study is an important advance in our understanding of the immune system disturbances associated with rheumatoid arthritis. While we do not yet know what the causes of this disease are, this study provides important insights into the immune system and its relationship to bacteria of the gut, and how these factors may affect people with genetic susceptibilities to disease,\" says Eric Matteson, M.D., chairman of rheumatology at Mayo Clinic, who was not a study author.
