We believe that natural healthcare is more effective and efficient in optimizing your healthcare.", "sitename": "Live Well Holistic Health Center", "date": "2013-03-20", "cleaned_text": "Dr. Martin Orimenko combines a variety of powerful treatment modalities and draws from Nutrition & Cleansing, Gentle Chiropractic & Kinesiology (Muscle Response Testing), Acupressure & Auricular Therapy, Emotional & Lifestyle Counseling, Ayurveda and Natural Supplement Prescriptions in each Natural Healthcare Visit to holistically treat the whole person. Dr. Martin Orimenko has found that this multi-approach holistic healthcare is more effective and efficient in helping you heal and in optimizing your wellness. It also provides a continuity of care that cannot be matched when you are treating with different practitioners for each of your health concerns. In addition, it almost always will cost you less! Proper nutrition is a cornerstone of good health. Improper nutrition can be disastrous. The body is a complex organism that has long list of nutritional needs in order to function at optimum level. One important vitamin, mineral or other macro or micro nutrient missing can make the difference between good health and poor health. Fortunately our bodies are greatly adaptable so that we 'can' get away with junk food, fast food and otherwise nutrient-deficient foods. But this can not last very long. Eventually you have to pay for it. The best pro-health option is to eat nutrient-dense foods, full of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytonutrients and avoid nutrient-deficient foods with empty calories. It is also very important to make sure you are not eating foods that cause a negative reaction, gross or subtle, in your body. A case in point was a patient who came in complaining of daily headache for the past 30 years. She received no help from countless clinics, both medical and holistic, including Mayo Clinic. Dr. Martin Orimenko tested her for food sensitivities and 'dysbiosis' (imbalance of micro-organisms in the body) and found her positive for fungal infection (systemic yeast) and dairy sensitivity. No one had ever suggested either of those, and dairy foods didn't 'seem' to bother her. She stopped dairy that day and began her fungal cleanse. Her headache resolved within a week and never came back. Different diets work better for different people. Dr. Martin puts some people on 'ayurvedic' diets, some people on the blood-type diet, some people on gluten-free, or solanine (nightshade vegetable) free diets, and others on the metabolic-type diet. The diet that best serves an individual is determined from many factors including their health history, family history, constitution-type, metabolic-type and list of ailments. Generally an organic, plant-based, whole foods diet is very healthy, but there are individuals that need animal foods to function at their best. Nutrition is a big topic but there are basic rules that always apply, specific diets that work best for a given individual, and imbalances that occur that require abstinence from specific foods. Cleansing is a vital component of good health. The need for cleansing arises from the fact that we accumulate toxins, both from environmental pollutants we take in as well as eating improperly. There is basic cleansing such as colon, liver and blood cleansing and more specific cleansing such as 'candida' (yeast) and parasite cleansing. Fasting is also a wonderful cleansing tool for renewing the body. And what serves the body serves the mind and spirit as well. Keeping cleansed and nutritionally balanced can make or break your energy, clarity, mood, immune response, hormone balance and overall health. Here at Live Well Holistic Health Center, Dr. Martin Orimenko tests for food sensitivities, environmental sensitivities, toxic load and dysbiosis, and determines constitution and metabolic type, to get patients on the best program for their individual health and vitality. Ayurveda (the 'science of life') is the most ancient complete system of natural medicine in the world. It was developed in ancient India and refined over the ages. It combines physical, psychological and spiritual therapies in an approach to health that is as relevant to the modern world as it was to the ancient. Utilizing herbs and minerals, proper nutrition and purification and, above all, affirmative ways of living, Ayurveda treats not just the ailment but the whole person and emphasizes prevention of disease to avoid the need for a cure. One of the principles in Ayurveda is that each person is made up of their own particular mix of the three fundamental elemental energies, or 'doshas'. Although we can't see them, the three doshas are responsible for all processes of the mind and body. They affect our physical makeup and our mental and emotional qualities. These underlying forces determine who we are, what we like to eat, how thirsty we get, how much sleep we need, etc. They influence our reactions to stress and our predisposition to various illnesses. The doshas even affect how compassionate, relaxed, or talkative we are. Knowing a person's dosha is very valuable in determining which foods, herbs and lifestyle changes will be most beneficial for their healing and overall balance. In addition, since different doshas predominate in the different seasons, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of them so you can self regulate your diet and lifestyle. There also exists within Ayurveda a whole science of longevity. All in all, Ayurveda is a wonderful system to incorporate into health and wellness programs. Everyone is now aware of the impact emotions have on the body/physiology. The field of psychoneuroimmunology has blossomed as more and more discoveries have been made regarding physical reactions to stress, joy, etc. In holistic natural medicine it is essential to look at emotions and stresses as possible contributing factors in any health condition. Otherwise the picture of a person's health is incomplete. Fortunately there is a technique Dr. Martin Orimenko was trained in that helps to resolve, or at least relieve the charge on emotional issues rather quickly, which works very well in the context of a chiropractic and natural medicine visit. NeuroEmotional technique is an outstanding tool for addressing stress and emotional issues that are impacting a person's health, whether they are recent issues or older influences, and whether they are major traumas or nagging stresses. Another use of the technique is to help a person achieve emotional congruence for goals they have. This greatly enhances the ability to manifest one's desires. Between twenty years of practicing NeuroEmotional technique on many different patients and attending many seminars on emotional healing, Dr. Martin Orimenko is quite proficient at offering guidance in this area to those that want and need it. Following is a wonderful case study from our blog showing how the Emotional Counseling and the NeuroEmotional Technique can support healing seemingly physical conditions such as allergies.
