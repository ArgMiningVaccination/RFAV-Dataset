Herbal Power - Promotes healthy liver function. Reason to Love - Based on a combination of herbs inspired by Traditional Chinese Medicine, our herbalists blended dandelion and chicory roots\u2014bitter and earthy and used to stimulate your liver's natural detoxification processes\u2014with schisandra berries, whose use was first documented 5,000 years ago. Called \"five flavor berry\" in Chinese, schisandra is unique in that it has all five tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and pungent (or warmly spicy). A delightfully, complex-tasting tea, we love it because it gives the liver the love it deserves. Taste - A complex blend of all five tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, pungent and salty. Since 2009 we've been working with the Shuijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Cooperative for the sustainable wild collection of schisandra berries in 22 villages surrounding the Giant Panda Bear Nature Conservation Area in Sichuan Province. Sustainable wild collection of schisandra berries - a fruit that grows in abundance in these regions and that is used in our schisandra fruit extract - has helped enhance the lives of the collectors.
