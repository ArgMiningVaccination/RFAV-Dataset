Vitamin D metabolites play an important role in the initiation of the immune response and can be an easily modifiable risk factor in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3)-deficient patients. This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial to compare the effect of a single high dose of vitamin D3 followed by treatment as usual (TAU) of daily vitamin D3 daily until discharge versus placebo plus TAU in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and 25(OH)D3-deficiency on length hospital stay. We included 40 patients per group and did not observe a significant difference in the median length of hospital stay (6 days in both groups, p = 0.920). We adjusted the length of stay for COVID-19 risk factors ( = 0.44; 95% CI: 2.17-2.22), and center ( = 0.74; 95% CI: 1.25-2.73). The subgroup analysis in patients with severe 25(OH)D3-deficiency (<25 nmol/L) showed a non-significant reduction in the median length of hospital stay in the intervention group (5.5 vs. 9 days, p = 0.299).

Introduction [1](#B1-biomedicines-11-01277)]. Within a short time period, the virus spread quickly around the world, and led the World Health Organization (WHO) to reclassify the epidemic as a global pandemic in March 2020 [ [2](#B2-biomedicines-11-01277)]. [3](#B3-biomedicines-11-01277)]. Risk factors for a poor outcome of COVID-19 have been found to include older age, male sex, obesity, chronic respiratory conditions, cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic diseases, malignancies, [7](#B7-biomedicines-11-01277), [8](#B8-biomedicines-11-01277)]. [9](#B9-biomedicines-11-01277)]. However, the scientific community has not yet found a consensus about the role of vitamin D metabolites in the current pandemic. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial investigated if a single high dose of vitamin D3, in addition to standard dosed vitamin D3 supplementation, can positively influence the length of hospital stay in patients with 25(OH)D3 deficiency and COVID-19 compared to patients receiving the treatment as usual for 25(OH)D3 deficiency only. [10](#B10-biomedicines-11-01277)]. There are observational studies reporting independent associations between low serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3 and susceptibility to acute respiratory tract infection [ [11](#B11-biomedicines-11-01277), [12](#B12-biomedicines-11-01277)]. 25(OH)D3 supports the induction of antimicrobial peptides in response to both viral and bacterial stimuli, suggesting a potential mechanism by which vitamin D inducible protection against respiratory pathogens might be mediated [ [13](#B13-biomedicines-11-01277), [14](#B14-biomedicines-11-01277), [15](#B15-biomedicines-11-01277)]. [16](#B16-biomedicines-11-01277)]. So far, the influence of vitamin D3 in the pandemic is unclear, the current level of evidence is low and contradictory. This might be influenced by various factors, such as the lack of high-quality evidence, different methodological approaches, or inconsistent enrolment criteria. Some studies found significant differences on various variables, such as the time to resolve symptoms or biomarker, mortality, or ICU admission [ [17](#B17-biomedicines-11-01277), [18](#B18-biomedicines-11-01277), [19](#B19-biomedicines-11-01277), [20](#B20-biomedicines-11-01277), [21](#B21-biomedicines-11-01277)], whereas others did not find any relationship between those outcomes and vitamin D3 supplementation [ [22](#B22-biomedicines-11-01277), [23](#B23-biomedicines-11-01277), [24](#B24-biomedicines-11-01277)]. Most of the studies or reviews concluded that further research in the form of randomized controlled trials is indicated to clarify the impact of vitamin D3 supplementation in patients with COVID-19, as there are still unanswered questions and uncertainties that need clarification. Previous findings in vitamin D research found a reduction in ventilation days for critically ill patients, a better muscle tissue function, and suppressed cytokines in patients who were treated with high dose vitamin D3 [ [25](#B25-biomedicines-11-01277)]. According to previous studies, there was no increased risk for adverse events or side effects observed when patients were treated with high dose vitamin D [ [26](#B26-biomedicines-11-01277), [27](#B27-biomedicines-11-01277)]. Further, there are observations that a single high dose of vitamin D is more effective in elevating the serum 25(OH)D3 levels, whereas daily administration is more beneficial for health outcomes [ [28](#B28-biomedicines-11-01277)]. We therefore came to hypothesize that a single high dose of vitamin D3 in addition to standard treatment improves the recovery period positively in patients with COVID-19 and 25(OH)D3 deficiency compared to daily smaller doses of vitamin D3 only. That means that the time to recovery, which was defined as length of hospital stay, is shorter in the single high dose vitamin D3 group relative to standard treatment group only. 2. Materials and Methods [Table 1](#biomedicines-11-01277-t001)). The patients were recruited between December 2020 and August 2021. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either group and randomization was stratified by center using block randomization (block size = 4). [29](#B29-biomedicines-11-01277), [30](#B30-biomedicines-11-01277)]. The dosage recommended for the standard treatment of a vitamin D3 deficiency varies from 400 to 1000 IU per day [ [31](#B31-biomedicines-11-01277)]. In consultation with a pharmacovigilance expert (University Hospital of Basel), the study team considered that the dose of 800 IU was adequate to elevate the serum 25(OH)D3 level in the included patients. 2.1. Outcomes [32](#B32-biomedicines-11-01277)]. 2.2. Data Collection and Management [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-biomedicines-11-01277)). The patients had daily visits until discharge by treating physicians and nurses. The Short Form 12 item health survey (SF-12) to assess the health=related quality of life (hrQoL) on day 28 and day 90 days after randomization was assessed by a telephone visit. The data were collected in an electronic data capture system (SecuTrial\u00ae), which is accessible via a standard browser and personalized and password protected. 2.3. Statistical Analysis [33](#B33-biomedicines-11-01277)]. According to the calculation, accounting for 10% dropouts and the chosen block size randomization, a total number of 80 patients (40 per group) were included. [34](#B34-biomedicines-11-01277)]. 3. Results 3.1. Clinical Characteristics at Time of Randomization [Table 2](#biomedicines-11-01277-t002). The mean age of our population was 60.5 (range 35-91) years in the intervention group and 61.5 (range 29-93) years in the control group. There were more women in the intervention group (35.9%) compared to the control group (17.9%; p = 0.125). Mean 25(OH)D3 level at time of randomization was 31.03 (SD \u00b1 nmol/L in the intervention group and 28.54 (\u00b110.13) nmol/L for the control group (p = 0.232). The two groups did not differ in terms of mean vital signs on the day of randomization. The mean duration from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8 days (range 3-18) in the intervention group versus 7 days (range 1-19) in the control group (p = 0.335). Almost all patients (intervention: 100% vs. control: 95%) showed COVID-19 typical changes in the radiological imaging of the lungs (p = 0.152). The intervention group had a significantly higher mean CRP value at the time of randomization compared to the control group (intervention: 96.50 mg/L vs. control: 66.67 mg/L, p = 0.015); no other value in the hematology profile or blood chemistry showed a significant difference between the groups. The mean SF-12 mental score (hrQoL sub score) was significantly higher in the control group compared to the intervention group (intervention: 41.76 terms of co-morbidities at the time of randomization and concomitant medication during the hospitalization, no significant differences between the groups were observed ( [Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Table S3](#app1-biomedicines-11-01277)). 3.2. Primary Outcome [Table 3](#biomedicines-11-01277-t003), [Figure 1](#biomedicines-11-01277-f001)). Median time from symptom onset to discharge was 16 days for the intervention group and 15 days for the control group (p = 0.193). Median time from hospital admission to discharge was 8 days for both groups (p = 0.924) and the median time from randomization to discharge was 6 days for both groups (p = 0.920). [Supplementary Table The linear mixed effect model showed a significant time-by-treatment interaction for SF-12 physical evaluation (p = 0.023), indicating that the intervention group had a less pronounced increase of the SF-12 physical scores across time (4.56 per measured time point). On the SF-12 mental score evaluation, no significant time-by-treatment interaction was observed (p = 0.272, 2.75 per measured time point) ( [Supplementary Table S6](#app1-biomedicines-11-01277)). [Supplementary Table S7](#app1-biomedicines-11-01277)). There was no other significant difference in self-reported symptoms observable at day 5 after randomization. The groups did not differ in terms of vital signs ( [Supplementary Table S8](#app1-biomedicines-11-01277)). Ten days after randomization, there were no more significant differences in terms of self-reported symptoms observed between the groups. In terms of vital signs, the intervention group had a lower systolic blood pressure (p = 0.029), but no difference was observed in other vital signs ( [Supplementary Table S9, Supplementary Table S10](#app1-biomedicines-11-01277)). [Supplementary Table S11](#app1-biomedicines-11-01277)). We did not observe a significantly higher mean calcium level in the intervention group compared to the control group (intervention: 2.30 mmol/L (SD \u00b1 [35](#B35-biomedicines-11-01277)]. The median length of stay in our population was similar to the findings presented by Murai et al. (2021) [ [22](#B22-biomedicines-11-01277)]. [18](#B18-biomedicines-11-01277), [36](#B36-biomedicines-11-01277)]. [22](#B22-biomedicines-11-01277), [37](#B37-biomedicines-11-01277)]. With our study, we could not support previous findings that high dose vitamin D3 supplementation reduces ICU admissions [ [37](#B37-biomedicines-11-01277)]. The fact that more patients in the intervention group were intubated compared to the control was not significant and we therefore assume that individual predisposing factors or pre-existing conditions have had a greater influence than the intervention with high doses of vitamin D3 in patients with 25(OH)D3 deficiency [ [5](#B5-biomedicines-11-01277)]. This might also contribute to the significantly longer length of ICU treatment in the intervention group. Our study could not confirm the results that fewer patients needed ICU admission or less mechanical ventilation when treated with high dose vitamin D3 in addition to the best available other therapies [ [37](#B37-biomedicines-11-01277), [38](#B38-biomedicines-11-01277), [39](#B39-biomedicines-11-01277)]. However, the number of patients with COVID-19-related complications was very small and therefore the results need to be interpreted with the utmost caution. [24](#B24-biomedicines-11-01277), [40](#B40-biomedicines-11-01277), [41](#B41-biomedicines-11-01277), [42](#B42-biomedicines-11-01277)]. This indicates that a single bolus of high dose vitamin D3 in addition to daily low dose maintenance therapy is effective to elevate serum 25(OH)D3 levels quickly. This finding is in line with previous observations that investigated the effect of a single high dose vitamin D3 with or without daily maintenance dose in various conditions [ [29](#B29-biomedicines-11-01277), [43](#B43-biomedicines-11-01277), [44](#B44-biomedicines-11-01277), [45](#B45-biomedicines-11-01277)]. Another factor that might have influenced the outcome of our study is the individual response to vitamin D3 supplementation, as only 23.1% of the participants in the intervention group reached sufficient 25(OH)D3 serum levels [ [46](#B46-biomedicines-11-01277)]. [47](#B47-biomedicines-11-01277)]. The difference between the groups in the SF-12 mental sub-score was not observable anymore 28 days and 90 days after randomization. The increasing number of missing data over time might mediate this observation. Another aspect that should be considered in the discussion of the observation is the range of the SF-12 mental score in our population. In the intervention group, both the range and the variance were larger than in the control group. However, the sample with a completed hrQoL from baseline to day 90 was rather small and therefore possible effects of the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of self-reported symptoms or recorded vital signs. At day five after randomization, we observed that a significantly higher number of patients in the intervention group reported headache compared to the control group, but no differences in other symptoms or vital signs. Ten days after randomization, no more differences were observed in self-reported symptoms. When looking at the vital signs, we observed a significantly lower systolic blood pressure in the intervention group compared to control group, but still the values were in the normal range. Orthostatic hypotension can be caused by longer bedrest or infections [ [48](#B48-biomedicines-11-01277), [49](#B49-biomedicines-11-01277)]. Further, only 10 and 11 patients respectively were still hospitalized at day 10 after randomization and therefore the results must be interpreted with caution. Our study could not confirm the findings which reported faster symptom recovery early stage of the pandemic in Switzerland, it was observed that the majority of hospitalized patients were male (female: 37% vs. male: 63%), which might explain the lower number of females in our study [ [54](#B54-biomedicines-11-01277)]. In terms of hematological and blood chemistry parameters, we observed several values that were above or beyond the normal value range, which can be explained by viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, medication, systemic disorders, or [59](#B59-biomedicines-11-01277), [60](#B60-biomedicines-11-01277), showed significantly higher baseline CRP values than the control group. This difference might imply that patients in the intervention group were suffering from a more severe disease compared to the control group, as a higher CRP could be an early sign for more severe COVID-19 [ [63](#B63-biomedicines-11-01277), [64](#B64-biomedicines-11-01277)]. However, since there were no significant differences in baseline respiratory status suggesting a more severe disease in the intervention group (respiratory rate, SpO2, dyspnea, O2-supplementation), the authors cannot conclude if this imbalance had an effect on the overall results of this study. [22](#B22-biomedicines-11-01277), [24](#B24-biomedicines-11-01277), [35](#B35-biomedicines-11-01277), [53](#B53-biomedicines-11-01277), [65](#B65-biomedicines-11-01277), [66](#B66-biomedicines-11-01277)], which might influenced the [22](#B22-biomedicines-11-01277)]. Strengths and Limitations 5. Conclusions [36](#B36-biomedicines-11-01277), [67](#B67-biomedicines-11-01277), [68](#B68-biomedicines-11-01277)]. Whether this finding was due to the beneficial effect of vitamin D3 or due to chance remains unclear, since the subgroup analysis was underpowered, and the assumption needs further investigation for verification. In further studies focusing on patients with severe 25(OH)D3 deficiency, non-hospitalized patients or patients in nursing homes should be included and the outcome of fewer hospital admissions needed should be added. We could show that a single high dose vitamin D3 in addition to standard vitamin D3 is not associated with adverse or serious adverse events, and therefore a safe and effective way to elevate the serum 25(OH)D3 level quickly, whereas daily small dosages of vitamin D3 supplementation did not elevate the serum 25(OH)D3 level sufficiently. 6.
