The researchers have published a new study in Nature, which shows that restoring the metabolism of certain immune cells reverses cognitive decline in aging mice. In the study, manipulation of myeloid cells was able to restore the youthful metabolism and placid temperament of cells in living mice. This process also reversed age-related mental decline in older mice, restoring their recall and navigation skills to those exhibited by young mice. This study suggests that if you adjust the immune system, you can de-age the brain. Experiments on cells in the lab indicate that similar rejuvenation may be possible in humans.

Does CoVID susceptibility track with inflammation-associated comorbidity? Is there an opportunity to shift balance of aged myeloid cells from proinflammatory phenotype to anti-inflammatory phenotype. Thanks Margaretta for sharing your post. All the very best. Stay safe and healthy! Such a fascinating study can't wait to read the full paper! "}
