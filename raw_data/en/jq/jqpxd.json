Being filled with countless wonders, we seek to understand them all, and as we do so, we realize that human nature finds it natural to categorize things in ways that seem meaningful to us. We look through to the world with the lens that is our perception, and though there are things that reside outside of it, this method of categorization and understanding still have value. This kind of knowledge is an ancient one; it was done early the early days with priests, shamans, philosophers, astrologers. The work that they have done form the foundation for our tables of magical correspondences. For all the illustrative images in this post, we're using artwork from the [Golden Thread Tarot,](https://labyrinthos.co/products/golden-thread-tarot-deck-cards) a matte black plastic tarot deck with gold foil printing. [You can purchase it here.](https://labyrinthos.co/products/golden-thread-tarot-deck-cards) How to Use this Table of Crystal, Tarot and Herbal Correspondences The following is a list of major arcana tarot correspondences - alongside herbs and crystals that have the same symbolic properties as each card. We're hoping that you'll find these useful in your rituals and spells, as a means of being able to quickly look up items with similar energy that you're looking for. When casting, using objects with similar properties may help you amplify the strength of your magic. This is sort of a personally created system that you can use as a guideline for your own. Naturally, it's not meant to be comprehensive, so if you find something in the list that may not follow your own symbolic system, substitute and use what you wish! You may find that you look at the ascribed correspondence to an item according to one source and find that it doesn't ring true to you. In truth, each of us has our own unique experience and that which is symbolic to one person might not be to another. If you disagree with a stated correspondence, try to determine what prompted it. (I try to explain the reasons behind correspondence associations in the planetary and elemental pages to help you with this.) If you simply cannot come to agreement with your source, go with your gut. Shop Golden Thread Tarot Gold foil on black plastic deck.
