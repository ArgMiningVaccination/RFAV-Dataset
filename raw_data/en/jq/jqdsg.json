Philosophy, Science, Art After 90 Days Based on Homeostasis Placebo controlled trials (Effect vs Toxicity) For all? Patented Chemical Intervention to bring values back to their \"normal\" Vaccinations (same for all?) Surgery Medical Therapies based on science ?? Allostasis (\"stability through change\"), takes virtually the opposite view. In medicine, major diseases now rise in prevalence, such as essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes, whose causes the homeostasis model cannot explain....And treating these diseases with drugs to fix low- level mechanisms that are not broken turns out not to work particularly well. Principles of Allostasis: optimal design, predictive regulation, pathophysiology and rational therapeutics. Peter Sterling Cambridge University Consider the record of arterial blood pressure measured continuously over 24 hours in a normal adult Far from holding steady, 110/70 mm Hg for two hours As the subject dozes in lecture 80/50. When he is jabbed with a pin150/70 having recognized the joke 80/50. During sexual intercourse 170/90 during sleep to ~70/40 one hour as low as 55/30 . Blood Pressure In the morning pressure steps up nearly to its level during sex and remains high for hours Allostasis \"stability through change\" Pulse Pressure is difference between your systolic and diastolic blood pressure 120/80 = pulse pressure is 40 40 pp is normal and healthy Greater than 40 pp : stiffness of the arteries (atherosclerosis) fatty deposits damaged blood vessels= lack soluble fibers, medications severe iron deficiency = anti-acids/ poor diet overactive thyroid lower than 40 poor heart function treating high blood pressure chemically reduces pulse pressure Pulse Pressure and Viscosity The New Health Gage Blood viscosity is a measure of the thickness of blood. The thinner the blood, the less it resists flow Blood vessel flexibility = 120 days more fluid in the blood, the thinner it will be (Dehydration). High red blood cells increase in blood thickness ( spleen Function) Fats in the blood increasing viscosity (fast food vs Healthy Fats) low temperatures, blood becomes thicker= tissue dies Frostbite flow of blood is slow, blood will start to stick together, forming clumps that thicken the blood. thick blood can potentially clot in the patient's veins, High blood viscosity also forces the heart to work harder to pump the blood, Blood Viscosity and High BP Health vs Sick Blood Things That Cause Increase of Blood Viscosity Blood Pressure Meds NSAID's = Advil, Motrin, Ibuprofen, etc.. Diet Products : Formaldehyde, etc.. Packaged Products = Devoid of enzymes Dehydration All Medications except Rat Poison (Coumadin) Before 1986 - 3 vaccine manufacturers After 1986 - 8 vaccine manufacturers And the Vaccine Division became the most profitable division Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted.....It is not known whether [the vaccine] can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, or can affect reproductive capacity. [The vaccine] has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility. A shocking report from the National Coalition of Organized Women (NCOW) the 2009/10 H1N1 vaccines contributed to an estimated 3,587 miscarriages and stillbirths. NCOW : fact that the CDC failed to inform their vaccine providers of the incoming data of the reports of suspected H1N1 vaccine related fetal demise. NCOW collected the data from pregnant women (age 17-45 years) that occurred after they were administered a 2009 A-H1N1 flu vaccine. The raw data is available on the website. CDC allegedly falsifies reports--ignoring up to 3,587 Miscarriages from H1N1 Vaccine Over 460,000 people per year are now dying of a disorder called of sudden cardiac death according to CDC statistics. This is a condition striking otherwise healthy people, who have experienced no obvious symptoms of heart disease prior to their deaths. An alarming number of these deaths are occurring in young athletes, both in high schools, colleges, as well as among professional athletes. one mechanism is excitotoxic damage caused by food additives and the artificial sweetener aspartame. This is despite growing evidence More symptoms of excitotoxins Obesity ,Eye damage ,Headaches ,Fatigue and disorientation ,Depression Numbness ,Burning sensation ,Tingling ,Facial pressure or tightness ,Chest pain or difficulty breathing ,Headache ,Nausea ,Rapid heartbeat ,Drowsiness , Weakness MSG & Aspartame are excitotoxins = excite your brain excitatory neurotransmitter upsets the balance of the natural neural transmitters Msg / Aspartame = food industry can make food with no nutrient value and cheep to manufacture with a long shelf life that you crave In it he explains that MSG is an excitotoxin, which means it overexcites your cells to the point of damage or death, causing brain damage to varying degrees -- and potentially even triggering or worsening learning disabilities, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease and more.

Or at least at the beginning and end A. 5 Times a day for 3- 7 days take the Cleansing Drink: Add 3 tablespoonful of Bentonite Clay colloidal. Add 1 tablespoon Psyllium Put the cover on tightly and shake vigorously for 5 to 10 seconds. Drink quickly. Follow with fresh water, if desired. B. 1 \u00bd Hours after taking the above Cleansing Drink take the Whole Food Supplements: 6 tablets of Cholrella 3 capsules of Wheat Germ Oil 2 tablets of Natural Source Vitamin C 2 tablets of Whole Beet Plant Juice 4 tablets of Probiotics 3-7 Day Cleanse www.veirons.com A sample schedule might be as follows:7:00 am - Cleansing Drink 8:30 am - Supplements 10:00 am - Cleansing Drink 11:30 am - Supplements 1:00 pm - Cleansing Drink 2:30 pm - Supplements 4:00 pm - Cleansing Drink 5:30 pm - Supplements Juice fast the day/week before 3 sessions necessary to start Frequency dependant on your toxicity DNS Hydro-colon Therapists EDTA was developed by the Germans in 1931 to reverse heavy-metal poisoning from the ingestion of lead, mercury, aluminum, cadmium, and more. Methods: Oral, IV, Suppositories Before beginning a metal detoxification, 1. A colon cleanse 2. A liver cleanse 3. A consume a diet that is high in hormone free proteins (Vegetables / meats) This is because the sulfur-bearing amino acids present in proteins will help the detoxification process 4. Take quality organic mineral supplement It is also important to have 2-3 bowel movements per day while detoxing from heavy metals. If this is not occurring, increase insoluable fiber intake. 5. Never attempt to fast in any way while detoxing from heavy metals. During this kind of detoxification taking iodine to prevent thyroid gland. taking in too much iodine can leave toxin to your body. potassium iodide or iodine Effective in preventing thyroid cancer. Iodine-131 radiation (gamma and beta) to protect from radiation exposure only drug to produce only a temporary situation. Potassium iodide or iodine is able to eat before entering risk areas. 1-12 hours before the effects of the drug risk of allergic reaction of potassium iodide or iodine, such as suggesting that if so many did not participate in many areas at risk of radial diffusion of radioactive substances is not recommended for you. Due to possible side effects of this drug. The pregnant woman should eat only one volume size 130 mg tablets once. foods to be richest in potassium iodine 1. Kelp (high) 2. Low-Fat Yogurt 3. Raw Cow's Milk 4. Egg, whole, boiled 5. Strawberries 6. Mozzarella Cheese The Kelp has the highest amount of iodine with Mozzarella Cheese coming in last... but still containing a valuable amount. Intravenous Cocktails In cases of serious exposure, IV cocktails with high dosages of vitamin C, magnesium chloride or sulfate, sodium bicarbonate and very pure seawater full of all the minerals necessary for life would be ideal. Nutrients to the Rescue Spirulina and chlorella have been used heavily by the Russians after the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster. Spirulina and chlorella content and because it is like refined rocket fuel for the cells providing them with a broad range of concentrated nutrients. Spirulina contains about 70% protein, the vitamins E, C (beta carotene) and B complex, a number of minerals, phycocyanin and chlorophyll. Chlorella is a single-celled, water-grown algae that contains more chlorophyll per gram than any other plant. It is extremely rich in vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids and many other nutrients Miso is effective for detoxifying your body of radiation. During World War II, two hospitals that were located side by side were hit with atomic radiation, in one hospital people consumed Miso and all of them survived while many people in the other hospital that did not take miso died. Miso is rich in vitamin B therefore it is suitable for vegetarians who are in shortage of vitamin B. For best results do not cook miso.\" Whole Grains, Sea weed, Wheat Grass Consuming more whole grains has a multitude of benefits. Their high fiber content binds with toxins and lessens intestinal transit time. vitamin B6 content nourishes the thymus gland and their vitamin E content helps the body to better utilize oxygen. buckwheat is high in rutin and helps to protect against radiation and stimulates new bone marrow production. seaweed helps to prevent the reabsorbing of radioactive strontium 90. Following the bombing of Nagasaki, a group of surviving macrobiotic doctors and their patients avoided radiation sickness by eating brown rice, miso and seaweed. They also did not get leukemia. Seaweeds also help to break down fatty deposits. wheatgrass grass strengthen cells, transport oxygen, help to detoxify the blood and liver as well as help to neutralize polluting elements and stimulate RNA production. Detoxing Supplements and compounds misconception- namely that the sulfur compounds in the broccoli family bind the heavy metals. sulfur compounds trigger increased expression of your glutathione system, which results in both metal detoxification and free radical neutralization. polyphenolic antioxidants - pine bark extract, green tea extract, grape seed extract polyphenolics = Pine Bark extract, large amounts of liver cleansing dandelion root extract, natural iodine and minerals curcumin (an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound found in the curry spice turmeric) may help protect against radiation-induced damage to the skin. aloe vera is often touted as a natural remedy for radiation- induced skin changes preventing or minimizing radiation- induced skin reactions Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda) The oral administration of sodium bicarbonate diminishes the severity of the changes produced by uranium in the kidneys. The kidneys are usually the first organs to show chemical damage upon uranium exposure the United States Army recommends the use of bicarbonate to protect the kidneys from radiation damage *used by oncology centers to control chemo agent spills and it's actually used intravenously to protect patients from the hazardous toxicity of chemotherapy. Uranium is one of the only metals that get significant bonding from carbonate. Just flushing a lot of bicarbonate through the system No better therapy for radiation sickness then intense sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) baths. Minimum stocks should be 25 or 50 pounds. one pound of bicarbonate in a bath but that could easily be two or three pounds in an emergency situation. magnesium salts or magnesium bath flakes. Dead Sea salt is also quite fine for this application. Apply Aloe Vera After Bath baking soda baths And Aloe Vera Glutathione and Bicarbonate Nebulization Nebulization is one of the best ways to quickly increase glutathione levels The main cancer risk from inhaled uranium oxide and other airborne radioactive particles would be from tiny insoluble particles lodged deep in the lungs.. Uranium oxide can be inhaled, it sticks to the lining of the lungs, it is taken up by cells of the immune systems and gets into lymph glands, bone, brain, hormone producing glands, ovaries and testes Nebulization transdermally treats the lung tissues allowing for best effect on contaminated lung tissues. mercury, detoxification and chelation of radioactive poisons use the same pathways as mercury Consume sulfur rich foods garlic, onions and the cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, kale, collards, cabbage, cauliflower, watercress, etc.). phytochemical = protect cells from damage. fruit and vegetable juices are good sources of the traditional nutrients. Citrus fruits (grapefruit, oranges, etc.) provide healthy portions of vitamin C Carrot juice contains large quantities of vitamin A, in the form of beta carotene. green juices are a good source of vitamin E. Fruit juices are a good source of essential minerals like iron, copper, potassium, sodium, iodine, and magnesium, \"We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.\" Albert Einstein Dave 56 Years Old 15 Years of High Blood Pressure 10 Medications Joint Pain - Tylenol Asthma - Inhaler Steroids Indigestion - Prevacid High Blood Sugar - Metformin Constipation High Cholesterol - Lipitor Neck Muscle Spasms - Soma Sleep Problems - Ambian Sexual Dysfunction - Viagra Depression - Prozac Aspirin - To Thin Blood?

Third National Health Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) from 1988- 94. 13,492 participants: Almost 7 percent had asthma. Some 12 percent suffered from COPD. Almost 3 percent were plagued with both. Of the group, 4.3 percent of the participants said they used acetaminophen on a daily basis, compared to 8.2 percent who used aspirin and 2.5 percent who used ibuprofen. Researchers concluded acetaminophen use was linked to asthma and COPD--its risk increased in relation to the dosage. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine May 1, 2005;171:966-971 What makes green vegetables so healthy? One reason is that they are packed with luteins, an antioxidant found in green, leafy vegetables that is believed to help in maintaining good vision by keeping your retina strong. Indoles are another group of phytochemicals found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts. Indoles are believed to have a role in helping protect against breast cancer and prostate cancer. Next is the orange/yellow group. "}
