I have loved her assistance in dealing with acute symptoms, while focusing on a long-term, sustainable approach to feeling better all the time. She is very conscious of the challenges in implementing lifestyle changes and has suggested a plan that is practical, easy to follow, and tailored to my own needs. She is easy to talk to and I'm glad I made the decision to try naturopathy and holistic medicine as a supplement to my health and wellness routine. - 11/24/2021 Just called, receptionist/whomever answers the phone is incredibly rude and lacking in basic natural medicinal knowledge such as having no idea what muscle testing is. She seemed very angry/perturbed to be having to answer the phone at all and annoyed with having to answer basic questions like what the first visit cost is and what it entails etc. Please get someone else to answer your phone for the sake of your business, if that is the first person people encounter when they call, I can guarantee you are losing a lot of potential patients because of this person... was considering coming there, after this experience I will go to one of the other naturopathic doctors in the area. - 6/29/2016 Dr. Wallace has wonderful knowledge, a compassionate ear, and a very balanced approach to wellness. She combines lab work, vitamin therapy, diet, lifestyle, and herbal medicine to form a protocol that is holistic and easy to follow. She is a great listener and can accommodate your individual needs. Yes, she is a young doctor -- but from what I can see it is only a benefit as her knowledge is up to date and she is dedicated to helping you feel your best. - 1/13/2016First to Review Karrina is not only a wealth of health knowledge, she's easy to talk to and friendly. She is able to blend western and eastern medicinal ideas and practices to aid your body best. I'd recommend to ANYONE to go in for an initial consultation....you have nothing to lose! - 12/31/2016 Dr. Wallace has helped regain my health! I am in my late 30s and over the past few years I have seen a marked decrease in my energy levels in addition to an increase in daily stress complicated by digestive issues. These issues have taken a toll on the way I feel day in and day out. I have tried countless providers and spent a ton on various treatments; whether it be supplements, vitamin injections, and/or prescription meds. Most of these treatments were ineffective, while others provided temporary relief, and some never seemed to work at all. I began to see that these treatments were just a bandaid, covering up underlying health issues that went misdiagnosed and remained untreated. I needed a change. Thankfully, I found Dr. Wallace. I first saw Dr. Wallace in November of 2016, and within days of starting a new regiment I felt so much better. My sleep has been more restful, my digestive issues have continued to improve, and without question I have more energy each day than I have had for a long time. I will continue to work with Dr. Wallace to achieve optimal health in 2017. I highly recommend Dr. Wallace as a healthcare provider. I greatly appreciate her high level of care and expertise. Many thanks Dr. Wallace!!
