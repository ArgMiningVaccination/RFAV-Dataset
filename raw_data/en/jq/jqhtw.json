Edgar Allan Poe, Richar d Adam s Locke, Mark T wain, and Dan De Quille all used h oaxes to shock their readers into an awareness of the subtle shif ting of the basis for determ ining truth in Am erica away f rom humanistic epis temologies and toward scientific ones. Using contem porary discussions of each hoax preserved in archiv al so urces, I reconstruct a s et of common expectations that nineteenth century read ers had abou t scientif ic culture and science news. The in teraction and competition of these exp ectations in produc ing either belief o r doubt in th e hoaxes is modeled using a m ethodology d erived from Optim ality Theory. Redefining vi hoaxes in this way\u2014as exchanges with r eaders over scientific issues via news media, rather than stric tly as texts\u2014 enables m e to revis e traditional assu mption s about Poe's and Twain's use of science and technology in their writin gs. The concluding chapte r exp lores the f unctiona l similaritie s between hoa xes and machines and suggests applications of the m ethodology developed in this project to problem s in genre studies, reader-ori ented studies of hi storical Am erican literature, and the rhetoric of science. In an epilogue I analyze the recent Sokal hoax as an intervention by a scientist in a perceived m ovement by cultural studies scholars to recaptu re the right to de termine truth for the Am erican public. vii Table of Contents List of Tables .......................................................................................................... x Chapter One: Looking for Hoaxes Outside the P hysical Text ............................... 1 1.

The author and city editor of the paper, Mark Twain, caref ully repor ted all the s cientif ic particulars of the petrifaction to a r eadership eager for m ore of the recen t revelations of geologic wonders such as ice ages and fossilized mammoths. Twain's story was immediately picked up by Eastern and W estern newspapers and was perhaps wired as far as London\u2014all in spite of the fact that a careful reading of the narrativ e betray s that the m an was fossilized sitting up and thum bing his nose at the reader (Clem ens \"Me moranda\" 859). Twain was not the o nly writer to toy with antebe llum Am erica's fascination with science. From the m id-1830s to th e 1860s, at least a dozen similar hoaxes appeared in penny dailies or literary m onthlies. Edgar Allan Poe has at least four media hoaxe s on scientific or technological topics to his credit. Other contributors include Richard Ada ms Locke, lateral descendant of John Locke and perpetrator of the fam ous \"M oon Hoax\" of 1835 that sold a record number of copies of the New York Sun ; and , Dan De Quille, a coedito r of Twain's Armor\" hoax in which an inventor turns up a frozen corpse in the m iddle 1 of Death Valley because the wet-sponge suit he designed to cool him down worked a little too ef ficiently (Fed ler 40). This roughly thirty-year heyday m edia unexam ined and unexplained phenom enon in th e history of Am erican literature and popular science. In this project I w ill develop a rhetorical theory of these hoaxes. I consider th em interactiv e events, reactions to and perpetuation of a particular kairos\u2014an opportunity to speak up\u2014pr ompted by increasing tensions between scientif ic and artis tic cu ltures in a ntebellum Am erica. This new rhetorical definition of hoaxing acco unts for its rich tex tuality, as the ho ax itself lives outside the physical te xt as a tense relationship between reader reactions, media reputation, and authorial intentions. Redefining hoaxes rhetorically help s solve two m ajor problem s that plague tr aditional ge neric def initions of them : overgener ation and underspecification. Tho se problem s will be exam ined in the first sectio n of this chapter. Next, a brief history of hoa xing in the Anglo-Am erican tradition will uncover folk definition s of hoaxes that can s erve as a u seful foundation for redefining them as a rhetorical gen re wh ile simultaneously helping to distinguish them from the genres they are often c onfused with\u2014parody, burlesque, and satire, mainly. In the third section of this ch apter, I summarize certain cultural dynam ics in early nineteenth- century Am erica that fostered hoaxing. After layin g that gr oundwork, I will de tail the contrib utions th at a rhetorical analysis of nineteenth-centu ry scientific m edia hoaxes can m ake to curren t problems in th ree fields of textual cr iticism. Rhetoric ians of scientif ic 2 genres will find that the hoax's m imicry of nineteen th-cen tury sc ientif ic new s article y ields a m uch-needed profile of th at emergent genre. For scholars of the popularization of science, or ethnoscience (c ultural attitudes toward science), the hoaxes provide an opportunity to exam ine a rhetorical strategy of intervention by litera ry intellectu als in the process of scientif ic truth be coming public truth in America; th is type of strategy is still ef fective to day as a m ode of criticizing th e gaps in power and v alues be tween liter ary and scientif ic communitie s, as was made manifestly apparent by the recent S okal Hoax. For scholars interested in the history of reading s cientific lite rature in America, the se hoa xes of fer themselves for study as a fascinating experim ent by literary authors in guessin g and re - presenting readers ' expectations ab out science and science news. Finally and most im portantly, this pr oject is a reawakening and reworkin g of a histor ical tradition \u2014instig ated by Mikhail Bakhtin in his cr iticis ms of the Russian Form alists and later develope d by J.L. Austin and John Searle\u2014that combines r hetorical and pragm atic-linguis tic m ethods to exa mine literature in social context. Hoaxing is a social pr oject that expands beyond the physical text to enlist an author' s intentions and readers' knowledge about genres and scientific culture. Studying it requires a new m ethodol ogy that can take as its basic unit of study a whole cycle of rhetorical intera ction am ong an author, texts, a m edium, and a reading community, an expansion of focus that David Kaufer and Kathleen Carley argue is crucial to understandi ng how m edia affects culture over tim e (Kaufer and Carley 2). This new m ethodology uses reader-oriented and New Historical h euristics along with ality Theory\u2014a constraint-satisfaction 3 framework borrowed from linguist ics\u2014and will be detailed in the final section of this ch apter. Physical ho axes\u2014faked fossils and artifacts\u2014 proliferated in the period under ex amination here, and along with the media hoaxes, they cons titute a text of both cooperation with and resistance to the project of \"real\" science in antebellum America. Hoaxing is unquestionably a major factor in the developm ent of American science, along with the gradua l expulsion of the \"pseudosciences\" like mesmerism, alchem y, and phrenology from the ranks of the professional sciences. This social history of hoaxing is intri guing but is beyond the sc ope of the present study. Alexander Boese's book, The Museum of Hoaxes , along with his dissertation on antebellum hoaxing (in progress at U CSD), addresses the interaction of hoaxing with the scien tific community. Jam es Cook's new book The Arts of Deception connects hoaxing with ante bellum fascination with authenticity and fraud. These social c onnections, especially the status of antebellum science and pressures of i ndustrialization and imm igration on the American reading pub lic, en ter into this project because they are crucial to reconstructing the rhetorical opening that writers lik e Poe and Twain en tered with their hoaxes. However, in order to hold in view and trea t with rigor the c omplex of relationships hoaxes construct between authors, m edia, and readers, I have restricted my inquiry to scientific media hoaxes\u2014journalistic accounts of scientific discoveries or t echnologies that seem ed factua l to many readers but that were la ter re vealed to be author ial inv entions. 4 1. P REVIO US HO AX SCHOLARS HIP The scientific m edia hoaxes consid ered in this project have until this po int remained almost entire ly uns tudied. Scholarly work on the genre has overall been ham pered by a New-Critica l fixation with the ph ysica l text that is ill- equipped to cope with the tendency of hoa xes' generic status to shift and even dissolve over tim e. These m ethods produce a theory of hoaxes that ignores their recep tion an d thus can n either distin guish hoaxes from related genres nor describe the unique relationship a hoa x constructs between aut hor, audience, and m edium . Most treatm ents of hoaxes in books , articles, or on the internet are essentially anecdotal. One of the m ost thorough of these is Fred Fedler's historical survey, Media Hoaxes . In it Fedler provides al l the publica tion facts of many of the hoaxes considered in this project along with plot summ aries and stories of th eir effects o n readers. Howe ver, Fedler offers no analysis of why the hoaxes worked or did not, and he chalks up the phenom enon to a lack of objective standards on the part of newspaper ed itors during the m id-nineteenth century. Americanis ts working o n Poe and Twai n, especially, have had to confront these autho rs' hoax ing practices at some point , and this literature will be reviewed more com pletely in the chapter s on the indiv idual autho rs. However, som e repres entative exam ples will se rve to indic ate that th is work has bee n large ly author-b iographical and New-Critical. Joan Ross, in her dissertatio n about Twain's hoaxes, scientific and otherwise, lumps together as \"hoaxial\" stories as different as Twain's m edia hoax \"T he Petrified Man\" and his novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court . She assum es rather than defines 5 what she m eans by \"hoaxial,\" and h er bas ic claim that Twain used hoaxes to teach his readers, and to rem ind hi mself, that ev ery social in stitution was essentially an illusion con flicts with h er psycho logical typography of hoaxes acco rding to th e security, m oney\u2014the y offer the hoaxer. A hoax cannot both destabilize a person 's rea lity an d offer any kind of stability o r com fort. Marie-Louise Nickerson Matthe w's account of Poe's hoaxing in her dissertation suffers fro m similar difficulties with defining hoaxes and using that definition to psychoanalyze the auth or. Matthe w declare s that all of Poe's work s are hoaxes, either \"external\" hoaxes in tended to dupe reader s and prove Poe's superiority, or \"internal\" hoaxes Poe wrote to give him self a \" provisional\" fantasy of psychological s tability (Matth ew 3). This classification b reaks down because Matth ew does not con sider th e self-revea ling elem ents of Poe' s hoaxes that were designed to construct som e of his readers as kindred savants , not dupes, and that deconstru cted any s tability the hoa x offered during o r immediately a fter th e reading exp erience. The m ost fruitful studies of hoaxes, counterfeits, and fakes have been conducted outside of literary a nd rhetorical studie s, in the fields of social history and science studies. In The Counterfeiters Hugh Kenner develops hypotheses about how fakes and counterfeits function in society that can be productively extended to a study of scient ific m edia hoaxes. W hile m any of the historical counterfeits Kenner studies are not textua l, he does consider Swif t's satiric practices in A Modest Proposal among other texts. Kenner argues that the principal social benefit of a counterfe it is the hyper-awareness it confers upon its 6 viewers, once they have recognized its artif ice, of the \"realness\" of the object or skill the counterf eit is imitating ( Kenner 30). So, Maelzel's chess-playing autom aton, once Poe exposed it as a fake, highlighted the inim itable power of the human strategic faculty . ecial co-d ependence b etween artifice and \"reality, \" and between belief and doubt, w ill prove crucial for th is study of hoaxing, which seeks to locate the effect of a hoax in the reader's perception of reality. Why has there been no scholarly treat ment to date of these nineteenth- century scientific m edia hoaxes by Am erican ists or rhetoricians? First, m edia hoaxes in general have suffered from their association with mass culture, which at least until the 1960s was cons idered beneath the dignity of literary study. Certainly, comm unications a nd journalism departm ents have been consistently concerned with the historical rhetoric of the news, but in these typ es of analyses, of which Fr ed Fedler's is a prim e exam ple, hoa xes are dism issed as a funny but unfortunate epiphenom enon of the \"Dark Ages\" of the penny press and yellow journalism . More problem atic for the st udy of hoaxing, however, is an active folk definition of the practice that contains pr omising elem ents but still f ools us into thinking we know what hoaxing is without having to explain or exam ine our assum ptions. All of the studies reviewed above labor under this folk definition ; they do not offer working definitio ns of hoaxing because they assume we all know what the newscaster m eans when she reports on the latest \"anthrax hoax,\" the \"Sokal Hoax,\" or a \"foss il hoax.\" In daily use, the word \"hoax\" overgenerates to describe any situation in which the public initia lly m istakes an objec t or 7 communication. It also connotes a sens e that som eone has intended this misapprehension. This m ay be another cau se for the critical neglect of hoaxes\u2014 their s ticky associa tion with th e inten tional fallacy. If people m isapprehend a message or object, does the originator of the m essage or object have to have intended to fool people fo r it to be considered a hoax? The question of inten tiona lity will b e taken up in th e chapters o n each au thor's hoax ing and will be settled as far as possible in the conclusion to the project. A rhetorical redefinition of hoaxi ng, recognizing its expansive social textua lity, will help clarif y the us eful aspects of the f olk def inition of hoaxing while constraining it from overgenerati on. T he methodology of this project outlin ed at the end of this ch apter instanti ates th ese rh etorical goals. of de fining hoaxes circul arly\u2014as essentially rh etorical sim ply m ethods of this project are rheto rical\u2014I will begin with the folk definition of certain f amous histo rical hoaxes. I will show inition and some careful atten tion to the context of the hoaxes can build a negative definition of hoaxing by distinguishing a hoax from genr es it is of ten co nflated with: satire, burlesque, parody, fraud, tall tale, and in the case of scientific m edia hoaxes specifically, science fiction. 2. A BRIEF NAT URAL H ISTOR Y OF HOA XING The word \"hoax\" is an industrial-age addition to the English language, accord ing to the second edition of the Oxford English Dictio nary; it first appeared in 1808, just a decade or so before the scientific hoaxes in questio n began to 8 appear.1 But the roots of the word can be traced back about two hundred years earlier to the phras e \"hocus pocus,\" apocryphally considered a parody of hoc est corpus , which a Catholic priest would int one during the Euchar ist as the ho st underwent transubstantiation. Since this project is in large part a def initional argum ent, however, we should no t accep t this definition im plicitly. In this section, I undertake a brief survey of fa mous rhetorical exchanges that have been record ed historically as hoaxes. By accepting and analyzing th is folk class ificatio n to see how it dem arcates hoa xes from closely-related genres, I will arriv e at the f ollowing lis t of hoax features that m ust be accounted for by my new rhetorical definition. These features , unique to hoaxing, are as follows: Treatm ent of particular societal tension(s) Resistan ce to closure Parasitism on other genres Display of genius of hoaxer Construction of agonistic relatio nship between author and reader Argum entation at the stasis of existence Efface ment of textuality 1 The first hoax m entioned in the OE D was the Great S tock E xchange Hoax of 1814, where a m an dressed as a British soldie r land ed in Dover and traveled to L ondon announcing the defeat of Napoleon. It took a few days to get word that in fact Napoleon had defeated Blucher, and in the m eanti me, the news of \"victory\" caused a boom in the London stock exchange. As it turned out, the \"soldier\" was in the em ploy of two Me mbers of Parliam ent and a financial adviser, who all p rofited f rom the spike in stock prices by selling their shares. Because of this m ercenary angle, the whol e matter is m ore a fraud than a hoax, as will be a rgued shortly, s ince th e reve lation of the trick was the last thing th e perpetrators wanted. 9 Destabilization of reality Construction of insider/outsider dynam ic Division of audience accordi ng to differing world-views Dependence on news m edia These featu res will all em erge during the follo wing histo rical an alysis, beginning with the first recorded m edia hoa x, by Jonathan Swift, and the ways in which it c larifies the d ifference s between hoaxing and satire. 2.1 Sw ift's hoax satires Alexander Boese's M published hoax on his tim eline is a fake al manac by Isaac Bickerstaff in 1709. Bickerstaff, better known to us as J onathan Swift, pr edicted the death of fa mous as trologer John Partridge and backed up that hoax w ith a fake obituary for Partridge printed on the day he was supposed to have died. Swift supposedly concocted his almanac to embarrass Partridge publicly, and indeed, Partridg e stopped publishing his own astrological alm anacs for a peri od of six years after (Boese Predic ). Contrasting the t's later inven tions Gullive r's T ravels and A Modest P roposal helps distinguish hoaxes from satire. All th ree wo rks were published wide ly and anonym ously (the first Irish edition of A Modest P roposal was signed \"Dr. Swift,\" but the English editions were not). All three w ere design ed to publicly hum iliate a person or group of people. But the la tter two were satir es; they cou ld not have been taken seriously past a few 10 sentences' reading, the one espousing cannibalism , and the other introducing talking horses. The hoax alm anac, on the other hand, was m eant to be believed by readers and was believed, as Partridge him self reported ly learn ed after a local priest knocked on his door the day of Sw ift's phony obituary to consult on funeral arrangem ents (Boese Predictions ). Two groups were m eant to be em barrassed by the alm anac: Partridge and other as trolog ers on the one hand, and the gullib le readers who believed in astrology on the other. The readers, by believing the almanac, becam e unwitting targets o f Swift's two-pronged attack. This central difference between Swif t's satires and his hoax, hinging as it does on the role of the reader, points out th at distinguishing a hoax from a satire is almost impossible at the level of the physical text, because a hoax shares m any textua l trad itional clas sification as a com edic genre tha t offers its read ers cr iticism of elite clas ses and stan dard m ores, catha rsis for potentially explosive social tensions, a nd a satisfying sense of closure. Griffin claim s that, in rea lity, satire is more com plicated, deco nstruc ting the \"safe\" critical distance it offers its readers even as it constructs it ( 35, 38). Four textual hallm arks of satire, according to G riffin's Post-Structural redefinition, apply to hoaxes as well: con troversia l top ics, resistance to c losure, paras itism on other genres, and display of genius. First, hoaxes and satires are both st rategies designed to redress pow er imbalances between co nflicting cu ltural factions (37-38): conservatism vs. liberalism , elite vs. m iddle class, or in the case of Swift's hoax, science vs. 11 astrology. Second, although sati res are responses to entr enched cultural program s and values, the sa tire itse lf is r esistan ce, a guerilla ta ctic of exp osure an d explosion, not a m ethod of achieving clos ure. Closure is superim posed on the satire by readers with counter-establishm ent agendas. Thus, a satire like A Modest Proposal is not really a proposal or soluti on at all. Rather, it perform s the cruelty of the establishment (British la ndowners in Ireland) without offering any strategies for redressing the grievances of the Irish (95) ; tho se strategies must be brought to the reading experience by Iri sh refor mers and other readers who subscrib e to anti-es tablishm ent ideologies. Simila rly, hoax es also ref use to tie controversial issues up neatly for th eir readers. For those readers who \"fall for it,\" the las t stroke of a hoax like Swif t's al manac is to em barrass them by revealing itself to be a fake. Once the hoax has thus embarrassed its read ers, it is done. It offers no cl osure, no antidote or resolution to their discom fort. It does not tell them how to stop believing in astrol ogy or what to believe in instead. Third, Griffin points out that a satire like Gulliver's Travels has a parasitic relationship with the textual ge nres it im itates (3), popular travel narratives in this instan ce.2 A satire m akes fun of a genre or a person by exaggerating the contours of its target's conventions or character . The reader of the original genre 2 Most of the m edia hoaxes in the ei ghteenth controversial Crusoe . This p redilection for trav el ad ventures likely fed the desire of readers to consum e everything foreign duri ng an era of im perialistic exploration and expansion by the English and other W estern European nations. Kaufer and Carley have added the sugges tion that texts like Crusoe and G ulliver's Travels fed a hunger for escapism created by the oppressive work schedules and landscapes of the Industrial Revolution in England (71). 12 recognizes both the correspondences between the target genre and the satire, and the departures; the gaps provoke the la ughter, a reaction to lack, desire, difference. This sam e dynam ic certainly holds for a hoax like Swift's alm anac, which targe ted and im itated pe rhaps the m ost widely-r ead genre of the tim e (Boese Predictions; Hall 342). Finally, satire is design ed to display the gen ius of the sa tirist (Grif fin 71) . So is a hoax, which is one reason why revela tion is so crucial to the hoax's ef fect on the reader. Nothing in Swift's text reve aled it to be a hoax; rum or later outed Swift as the author of both the alm anac and the obituary. Undoubtedly, the reputation as a wit that this hoax and hi s other satires built for Swift must have motivated him powerfully, for he endured censure and even im prisonm ent for his indir ect c riticism s. However, what is inte resting for this pro ject is th e fact tha t a huge part of the action of Swift's hoax\u2014t he revelation\u2014occurred outside the text, which is where we m ust look in orde r to distinguish hoaxes from satires. To tease ap art th e rhe torical effects of these two genres, it will be he lpful to apply the approach of Kaufer and Carl ey and consider not just the texts of satires and hoaxes, but their status as events that instan tiate communicative communitie s\u2014communities com prised medium , a topic/issue, and groups indi rectly influenced by the comm unicative event. From this perspective im portant disjunctions be tween satire and hoaxing appear. Most importantly, a hoax is distinguished from a satire by its singling out its readers for criticism \u2014not just Parliam ent or Irish landholders or an as trologer. Unlike a satire, which constructs aut hor and audience as united in an act of indirect social 13 criticism , a hoax constructs an agonist ic relationship between readership and author. The whole point of a hoax, in reve aling its a rtifice, is to em barras s its audience in to adm itting the in consis tency or poor foundation of their assu mptions about what holds true in the world\u2014 m uch like the crux of i nstructive embarrassment or elenchus that was the goal of So crates's dialectic m ethod.3 Hoaxes can of course have educative re sults, but their re fusal to offer their embarrassed readers clo sure by telling them what they can do to alleviate th eir embarrassment lim its further com parison with S ocrates's m ethod. A second distinction between a satire and a hoax is that they are argum ents at different s tases. Stas is theo ry is a Classical forensic urtroom ) argum ents, ad apted by Jeanne Secor to the ana of scientif ic, civic, a nd lite rary discours e. The Ancient Rom an legal system recognized levels or stases of inquiry into a case that are reminiscent of the \" Who, what, when, whe re, why, how\" guidelines of journalistic presentation. \"W hat happened, if anything ?\" provokes argum ent at the stasis of existence. \"W hat sort of thing wa s this happening? \" takes the argum ent to the stasis of definition. \"W hat are the causes of this happening? \" addresses the stasis of cause. \"Was this a worthy or an unwor thy action?\" promotes the argum ent to the stasis of evaluation. And \" What shoul d be done about this situation?\" brings the argum ent finally to the stasis of action (F ahnest ock \"Stases\" 428-429). A purely text-based, arhetorical view of sa tires and hoaxes m ight rank them both as evaluative argum ents. But only a satire is principally an evaluative argum ent, 3 See Chapter Four for a fuller explo ration of the S ocratic diale ctic in Twain's hoaxing practices. 14 designed to call into discussion the goodness or badness of a person, style, genre, or policy; a hoax, on the other hand, is an argum ent at the stasis of existence, playing on the question of whether so me happening\u2014or, actually, a reliable witness to that happening\u2014holds true in the world inhabited by the hoax's readers. In other words, what Swift's r eaders were worried about initially was the question of John Partridge's m ortalit y, not his astrological m ethodology. Certain ly, after Swif t's reader was e mbarrassed f or falling f or the tr ick, a sort of evaluation could be inferred from that em barrassm ent: \"Believ ing something just becaus e it claim s to be astro logy is stup id.\" But that is an indirect rhetorical m ove of the hoax; the direct move is always to call reality and its construction into question. By contrast , \"satire proper,\" according to Griffin, \"rarely offers itself as 'objective' or doc umentary...Alerted by its generic signals, we are not likely to m istake a satire for fact, not likely to overlook its avowedly 'rhetorical' nature\"(132). And inde ed, Swift's satire A Modest Proposal alerts its readers early on that it is not to be taken seriously: I shall now therefore humbly propose m y own thoughts, w hich I hope will no t be liable to the least ob jection. I have been assured by a very knowing Am erican of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a m ost delicious, nourishing, a nd wholesom e food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I m ake no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricass ee or a ragou t. 15 The awful shock of Swift's cannibalist ic proposal steers its reader away from taking it se rious ly; inste ad, the reade r makes the her angry revulsion the \"cann ibalistic\" beh avior of the Irish landlords. A hoax like Swift's alm anac works very differently. It crucially counts on at least a large percentage of its readership indeed \"overlook[ ing] its avowedly 'rhetori cal' nature\" and taking it seriously as the true report of Pa rtridge's d emise (G riffin 132); if th ey do not, they do not put stock in astrology and thereby prove imm une t o Swift's attack later when his astrology is revealed to be bogus. The locus of the effect of a hoax is always in th e reader , not in the physical text. A r eader who believes a hoax like Swift's almanac, or Locke' s reports of m oon bison, actu ally inhabits a different world\u2014constructed by her ne w beliefs about what is pos sible in that world\u2014from the world of a reader w ho \"sees through\" the hoax and reads it from a skeptic's perspective. Hoaxes build different episte mological worlds for different readers. A New-Critical approach to classifying hoa xes according to their textu al features cannot account for this f act. The whole raison d 'etre of the hoax is to embarrass its readership for their m isapprehension of the \"real\" world. 2.2 Parody Eighteenth-century Enlightenm ent m edia were also fertile ground for parodies, like Pope's Rape of the Lock . Is a hoax just another form of parody, since, as po inted ou t abo ve, a ho ax must mimic whatever text it purports to be a true exam ple of\u2014whether a travel na rrative, almanac, or science report? I will argu e that th ese genres also d iffer, this time on grounds of m imesis. A hoax destabilizes reality for readers, ca lls into question th e ways in which th ey 16 verify that the world they create for them selves through their beliefs is the \"real\" one. Therefore, anything in a hoax's styl e tha t calls atte ntion to its tex tuality\u2014 like hyperbole or punning, for example\u2014is at least an initial hindrance to its rhetorical purpose of m essing with readers ' realities. Attention-getting textuality, on the other hand, is the hallm ark of par ody and burlesque. Fo r these genres to achieve the ir critical effects, the reader need s to recog nize th em as texts mimicking other texts \u2014eithe r a whole genr e of writing or a pa rticular author' s style. Pope's Rape of the Lock was only funny to readers already fed up to the gills with th e bad epic p oetry writte n in the pre vious centu ry: they were familiar with the various rhetorical features P ope em ployed to puff up an inconsequential topic (the snipping of a lock of hair), such as th e Invocation to the Muse and deus ex machina . Pope's exa ggerated m imicry of these f eatures c onstitu ted th e bite of his poem (\"Alexander\"). Edgar Allan Po e's burlesques a century later, such as \"How to Write Article,\" \"A Predicam ent,\" or \"Loss of on th e hallm arks of the gothic \"Blackwood\" fiction. Consider the opening sentences of Poe's burlesque \"A Predicament\": It was a quiet and still afternoon when I strolled forth in the goodly city of Edina. The confusion and bustle in the stree ts were terr ible. Me n were talking. W omen were scream ing. Children were choking. P igs were whistling. Carts they rattled. Bulls they bellowed. Cows they lowed. Horses they neighed. Cats they caterw auled. Dogs they danced. Danced! Could it then be possible? Danced! A las, thought I, m y dancing days are over! Thus it is in the m ind of genius and im aginative 17 contem plation, especially of a geni us doom ed to the everlasting, an eternal, and continual, and, as one might say, the\u2014continued\u2014yes, the continued and continuous, bitter, hara ssing, disturbing, and if I m ay be allowed the expression, the very dist urbing influence of the serene, and god-like, and heavenly, and exalting, a nd elevated, and purifying effect of what m ay be rightly ter med the m ost enviable, the m ost truly enviable\u2014 nay! the m ost benignly b eautif ul, th e most delic iously ethereal, and as it were, the most pretty (if I m ay use so bold an expressi on) thing (pardon me, gentle reade r!) in the world\u2014 but I am always led a way by m y feelings. (\"A Predicament,\" 328) Com pare this hyperbolic catalogue of tropes typical of the sensational fiction Poe him self wrote fo r Blackwood's Edinburgh Review to the opening of his self-described m edia hoax \"Hans Phaall\": By late accounts from Rotterdam , that city seem s to be in a high state of philosophical excitem ent. In deed, phenom ena have there occurred of a nature so com pletely unexpect ed\u2014so entirely novel\u2014so utterly at variance with preconceived opinion s\u2014as to leave no doubt on m y mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a fer ment, all reason and astronom y together by the ears. (\"Hans Phaall,\" 512-518) Certainly both the burlesque and the hoa x open with an excited and exaggerated tone. But the burlesque draws attenti on to its artifice immediately with its ludicrously repetitive hyperbole. \"H ans Phaall,\" on the othe r hand, even though it is far and away the coyest of Poe's hoaxe s, doe s attem pt to salvage its guise as a 18 news story with im personal third person narration, scien ce journalism jargon like ena,\" and an implicit argum ent th at the story is true, as it will soon have \"a ll Europe...in an uproar.\" It is th is argument for the truthfulnes s of the m aterial presented tha t marks a prim ary difference between hoaxes and parodies/burlesques. The focus on textuality and/or style in burlesque a nd parody serves to shift the reader's atten tion away from the tru th-status of the e vents repor ted in the s tory; f or exam ple, believing there actually was a drow ning baby, a heroic diver, or a tortuous affair is irrelevant to appreciati ng Poe's \"The Assignation.\" The story is parodying the Byronic pose and Byron him self (Benton 193). By contrast, what is at stake in a hoax like \"Hans Phaall\" or Swif t's alm anac, what is salie nt to the audience an d what they must decid e upon, is no t prim arily who is being pillo ried in the story, but wheth er the events portray ed in the story really happened or not. So what comparison with parody and burle sque reveals about the hoax is that a hoax re sists textua l definition by ef facing (at least initially) its own tex tuality and authorship. 2.3 Nineteenth-century fraud, tall tale s, and science fiction in America The differences in m edia hoaxing in the hundred years between Swift's and Defoe's hoaxes and the scientific hoa xes that catalyzed this p roject are striking. N ot only are the eighteenth cen tury hoaxes few and far betw een, but they are also published in pam phlet form and refl ect the concerns of the English at the tim e with trave l and f oreign rela ry American news m edia, on the other hand, reflect the concerns of a new republic 19 that is finally getting up a good head of steam , literally as well as figuratively; thus, industry and technology, politics, and the scientific wonders being discovered on a daily basis on the new contin ent all loom large in hoax es of this era. Antebellum hoaxes, in further contra st to Enlightenm ent media hoa xes, also had at their disposal well-developed prin t media, including the im portant advents of the literary m onthly and the penny daily. These advances partially account for the pro liferation of ho axing in the decad es before the Civil W ar, as will be discussed shortly. But before we turn to the cultural kairos that fostered the explosion of antebellum hoaxes, it pays to distinguish hoaxing from a final crop of si milar g enres th at sprang up at this tim e in response to sim ilar stim uli: th e fraud, the tall tale, and science fiction. Warwick W adling ton in The Conf erican Litera ture pinpoints the mid-nineteenth- century as the heyday of the c on m an in Am erica. Certainly som e of the sam e dyna mics th at favored hoaxing favored fraud: a population boom that forced Am ericans to start doing business with strangers, whether they liked it or not; a westward-racing frontier that exposed new jaw- dropping astonishm ents every day and that law enforcem ent could scarcely keep up with; an d, com petition for reso urces am ong imm igrant groups and socio - econom ic classes. W hy are the frauds these con m en (and wom en) perpetrated not hoaxes, then, if they are responses to similar tensions and they both involve the duping of large numbers of pe ople? Steven Mailloux, during his analysis of the trope of conning in Huckleberry Finn , explains exactly how he believes a fraud goes beyond a hoax: 20 For a con to work, the m ark m ust be convinced by the con m an's visual and verbal rhetoric. Actual tr uth becom es irrelevant; what counts is successful persuasion. But the confiden ce m an is not intere sted in sim ply perform ing tricks for the fun of it. He plays his gam e for a reason, seeking to turn rhetorical exch anges into econom ic ones, to transform impassioned rhetoric into cold cash. The conf idence m an thus attem pts not only to convince, to affect belief, but also to modify ac tions for his own benefit. (Mailloux 62) These m ercenary concerns of fraud ar e prob ably the easiest fractu re to identify between hoax and fraud. Hoaxer s are after their readers' assum ptions; frauds are after their cash. Certainly, hoaxers are interest ed in a pay-off, too, in the subsc ription r ates th at com e with pub licity and notoriety. But hoaxers m ust reveal their hoaxes to emba rrass their readers. Frauds avoid revelation and hope that the assum ptions you m ade about real ity that encouraged you to give the m money will rem ain in place so they c an do it ag ain. A rebuttal to this argum ent about hoa x and fraud m ight bring up the first hoax m entioned in the O ED. The Gr eat Stock Exchange Hoax of 1814, while not a media hoax, was all about m oney. A m an dressed as a British soldier landed in Dover and traveled to L ondon announcing the defeat of Napoleon. It took a few days to ge t word that in fact Napoleon had defeated Bl ucher, and in the m eanti me, the news of \"victory\" caused a boom in the London stock excha nge. As it turned out, the \"soldier\" was in the em ploy of two MPs and a financial adviser, who all profited from the spike in stock pr ices by selling their shares. 21 The revela tion of the trick was the last thing its perpetrators wanted, and so it seem s this was a clear-cut case of fraud, rather than hoax, but the fact remains that contem porary comm entary labeled it a hoax. W hat is to be done with this h istorical assessment, then ? If we declare th ese contem poraries inadequa te rhetor icians, and relab el the Great Stock Exchange Hoax a fraud instead, we risk steppin g off the folk f oundations of this definition al project and rendering it circular\u2014defining a hoax as wh atever we wish it to be to suit ou r purposes regardless of the hi storical data. In fact, th e historical judgm ent rem inds us that m oney and belief are not alwa ys segregated commodities. Th e media hoaxes exa mined in this projec t were also about m oney as th eir autho rs made a living selling them to newspapers a nd m agazines. And the m ost fam ous American h oaxer of all, P.T. Barnum , made piles of m oney by m aking people want to see f or them selves if the Feejee Merm aid were the \"real thing\" or not. The best s olution to this his torical dilemm a is to a cknowledge tw o important differences between the goal of my project and the goals and judgm ents of the 1814 British media. Firs t, my goal is to define a rheto rical genre, while the purpose of the 1814 reporters was to pass j udgm ent on a public crisis. Beginning with the sense of shock and reality-inve rsion apparent in commentary about the Great Stock Exchange Hoax, I am continuing on to refine that sense into a m odel of how a hoax works rhetorically. That very developm ent m ay be have been mirrored by the ontology of hoaxing and fr aud in the nineteenth century, thus highlighting a second difference between the Great Stock Exchange Hoax and our mid-ninetee nth-cen tury scien tific media hoaxes. The two phenom ena are 22 substantially separated from each oth er by time, space, econo my, and m edium . It is probable that as hoaxing proliferated after the 1830s in Am erican newspapers, especially, and as both British and Am erican econom ies e xpanded to the poin t where people were forced to trust their m oney to strangers in shops and banks, hoaxing and fraud becam e more distinct from each other as people accum ulated experience with both form s of dec eption. After all, these two differe nt labels persist in the language today for a reason. In the end, the best litm us test for distinguishing hoaxing as a rheto rical genre from fraud is the p resence of an indirect m essage. All of the m edia hoaxe s in this project mounted an indirect critic ism of the way the American public was assim ilating scientif ic knowledge. The Great Stock Exchan ge Hoax was not de signed to send a message, but to m ake a quick fortune for its perpetrators. The boundaries between hoaxes and the tall tales popular on the m id- nineteenth century frontier are even tr ickier to nail down than the boundaries between hoaxes and fraud, if that is possible. Tall tales are the oral forerunners of hoaxes. This inheritance will be exam ined in greater depth in Chapters T hree and Four on the W estern hoaxers, but for now we can note that both tall tales and hoaxes play on the existence or witne ss of a rem arkable phenom enon and that audience judgm ents about the verity of this phenom enon can serve to separate knowledgeable insiders in a community from i mpressionable outsiders. This dynam ic holds when tall tales are told by a conspiratorial group of locals to a tourist in order to dem onstrate his/her out sider status, as in Chapter 34 of Mar k Twain's Roughing It , where frontiersm en fool a \"city -slicker\" lawyer into arguin g 23 a fake property-rights case about a lands lide that m oved one ranch on top of another. A crucia l distinc tion b etween tall ta les and hoaxes lies once again outside the physical text in the m edium of transm ission. Tall tales are an oral genre, whereas hoaxes rely on the relative distan ce and anonym ity of print to fool their readers. Also, fooling people is a relatively uncomm on function of the prototypical tall tale. O rmond Seavey in his analysis of Richard Adams Locke's \"Moon Hoax\" says that usually \"both the d eadpan teller of the [t all] tale and his impassive listener [are] conspirato rs agains t reality \" (Lock e Moon Hoax xxiii). The \"conspiracy\" aspect of this d escription of the ta ll tale im plies it is a jo int activ ity between teller and hearer d esigned to entertain and distract both of the m from daily worries. Whether o r not the even ts of the tall ta le ac tually h appened is beside the p oint in an archetypical tall tale lik e the \"Pecos B ill\" tall tales popular in the late r ninete enth c entury wher e Bill breaks tornados like bucking broncs. A comparison of one of Mark Twain's tall ta les with one of his hoaxes illustrates the differing emphasis on truth-value. The auth enticity of the talkative old -timer and the lead-burping frog in \"The Celebrated Jum ping Frog of Calaveras County\" is not what is rem arkable about the story; th e hum or of the situation is. On the other hand, the central claim of Twain's news hoax \"The Petrified Man,\" that a hum an being was found petrified outside Virginia City, is a scientific claim whose truth- value m ust be assayed. Twain also claim s to have had in m ind with \"The Petrif ied Man\" the very \"unconspir atorial\" aims of hum iliating the loca l medical exam iner and sha ming his readers, to boot , for their na\u00efve fa scination with all 24 things fossilized (Clem ens \"Mem oranda\" 859). This is not a conspiratorial group of insiders putting on an outsider but ra ther a single jou rnalist m ultiplying a practical joke through the m echanics of print into a hoa x that targets his whole community. These comparisons rev eal th at while a hoax and a tall ta le both call reality and its construction in to question, the tall tale is an oral genre em phasizing conspiracy while a hoax operates at the expense of its readership. Finally, a hoax is not science fiction. The plausibility of this distinctio n may see m odd at first glance, since th e media hoaxes under consideration take scientific and technological t opics at the very mom ent in the history of Am erican litera ture when the first science fiction stories were being deve loped. Edgar Allan Poe, in fact, is still con sidered a pion eer of science fiction as well as a hoaxer (Franklin Fu ture 93, 99). Science fiction, like th e scientific m edia hoax, attests to the ripple ef fect in lite rary communities of the increas ing soc ial power of science in antebellum Am erica. The function of science fiction is to dram atize both the best and w orst case scenarios of allowi ng science to dictat e social policy. Because of this functio n, sc ience fiction critic Bruce Franklin claims that the genre helps popularize scientif ic ideas, i.e. inculcate th em as m oral and social values in la y cultu re (F uture 96). However, since sc ience fiction by definition does not lay claim to being a true witness of the present o r future state of science, it differs sig nificantl y from hoaxes, which do initially claim to be repor ts of the real state of affairs in the world. This di fference is nearly invisible in the physical text, as a com parison between the langua ge of Poe's scien ce hoaxes with the language of science fiction stories writt en by his near-contem porary, Fitz-Jam es 25 O'Brien, will reveal in C hapter Two. Poe and O'Brien wrote stories on the sam e topics; however, Poe's were published in news m edia, while O'Brien's are published in literary m agazines, and so O'Brien's stories ne ver created a public stir over their truth-value. This powerful effec t of different expectations about different ty pes of media will he lp drive our analys is of a hoax's changing interaction with its read ership over tim e and space in th e following chapters. 3. KAIROS As is observable from the history of hoaxi ng above, the hoax is a relatively recent rhetorical innovation, dating from the eighteenth century. The hoax, then, is an industrial ge nre, and this label is m ore than a m atter of tem poral coincid ence. To achiev e its on r eaders, A merican scientific m edia hoaxing had to wait on certain structures of m aterial and social cu lture that finally snapped into a lignm ent in the 1830s. Hoaxes could only occur in the kairos , or rhetorical opportunity, created when writers felt the need to interfere in the process of scientific truth becom ing public truth in A merica. Principal am ong these structural elem ents that opened up the kairos were these two tensions, both intensified by the Am erican Industrial Revol ution: the social tension between the cultu res of science and lette rs played out in the m edia; and, the tension between popular and specialized sectors of the Am erican reading public. 3.1 Science and art Poe, Richard Ada ms Locke, and the other m edia hoaxers at the heart of this project represent the mere crest of a wave of scientific hoaxes inundating nineteenth-century Am erica\u2014such as Maelzel's Merm aid. All these hoaxes reflected the intense and very public activity of science and technology in American culture. The Industrial Revoluti on in Jacksonian Am erica both fed (and was fed by) a rapid expansion in \"pure\" a nd applied scie nce, espec ially in th e engineering fields and in the natural sc iences of botany and geology. T he natural wonders of the Am erican continent, con tinually being brought before the public eye by expeditions like the United States Exploring Expedition in 1838, provided a seem ingly lim itless b ody of data for measurem ent, cataloguing, clas sification, and publication. In addition, publicly visi ble and useful tec hnological innovations in the f irst third of the n ineteenth ce ntury, like the railroad, street-paving, and gas lighting, created a clam or for m ore rese arch and developm ent of labor-saving inventions. The \"em barrassm ent of ri ches\" of natural specim ens data\u2014 coupled with incessan t nagging from citi zens, business, an d the governm ent to make scientific research pay off for the public\u2014placed a huge burden on American s cientists. S cientists, a t the b eginning of the century, were e ither amateur landowners and clergy who had tim e to dabble in whatever s cientif ic fields suited their f ancy or scien tists in the em ploy of universities like Harvard or Yale, whose tim e was divided between te aching natural philosophy and general science and keeping up with their personal researches on th e side. The pressure of the data and the public eventu ally becam e too m uch for scientists, an d so they began in the 1820s to speci alize and professi onalize in order to organize the workload facing Am erican science. The professionalization of American science 27 also had a political agenda\u2014to m ount a patr iotic, Jackson ian effort to c atch up to the older and better-develope d Euro pean scienc es (Bru ce ence\" coalesced\u2014actually a cong lomeration of specialized societies in biology, geology, physics, chem istry, botany, and even phrenology and \"m agnetism \" (mesmerism)\u2014whose workings rem oved serious scientific activity from the lay public ar ena. Dabblers and am ateurs dropped out, unable to meet the exp ectations of the ne w scie ntific so cieties. These societies began to publish speci alized journ als for circulation am ong their m embership. Only a few \"general\" s cience journals re mained to comm unicate the real business of science to the lay reade r, signal among them Yale scien tist Benjam in Sillim an's Am erican Journal of . But these journals, too, often e mployed jargon and assum ed a level of educa tion not universally found in the lay readership. At the same tim e this withdrawal was going on in s cientific cu lture, a similar m echanism was at work in the cu lture of American literature. Incre ased efficiency of both human and m achine labor in Am erica created a p ublishin g boom in the 1820s and 1830s as printing sudd enly becam e faster and cheaper. The Koenig steam press, invented in 1823, probably represents the m ost significant advance in this departm ent, along with the Fourdrinier process of paper m aking, developed in 1799, and th e cylinder press, which the London Times bega n using to increase their producti on in 1814. All these innovations had a striking effect on American publishi ng. In 1825, about 100 m agazines were published nationwide. In the next 25 y ears, that num ber would increase 600% 28 (Mott Magazines: 1741-1850 342). Book publishi ng, too, went through a growth spurt, especially toward the middle of the cen tury, accord ing to Frank Luther Mott's account in A History of American Magazines: 1850-1865 . In the years between 1850 and 1862, the num ber of books printed in the United States increased by 400% (Mott Magazines: 1850-1865 157). This, espec ially the boo m, was the f irst m ajor surge in tr uly \"Am erican\" texts, not ju st Am erican reprints of European texts. Universities and magazine publishers in particular, began to see a need for a cr itical appa ratus and community to organiz e the barra ge of texts and cull a \"quality \" Am erican literature from it. Acc ordingly, a series of university-funded literary m agazines such as the Putnam Monthly and the Atlantic Monthly started to coalesce into a literary co mmunity that was un abashedl y Brahm inistic in its m embership requirem ents and in the tone of its rhetor ic for outsiders (Mott Magazines: 1850- 1865 498). Edgar Allan Poe was a ctually clos e to the vanguard in this trad ition. He abhorred \"puffery,\" the jingois tic te ndency he noticed am ong literary \"critics\" in the 1830s to claim that anything wr itten by an Am erican author was good simply by virtue of its provena nce (Mott Magazines: 1741-1850 405). As editor of journals such as the Broadway Journal and the Southern Literary Messenger , Poe became fam ous for \"broad-axe\" criticism \u2014reviews that m ercilessly catalogued the flaws of Am erican books and called for standards of criticism that would distinguish a genre of American letters from the \"rabble\" (Mabbott 33). In this way, the publishing industry in Am erica, the writers it paid (off and on and poorly), and the m agazine editors who relie d on this industry for content to fill 29 their pages\u2014these factions began to form their own co mmunity just as specialized and perhaps even m ore ope nly anti-populist than the prof essional scien tific co mmunities. And then the trouble started. As a na rrative convenience, we m ay dat e it from the publica tion of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology in 1830-1833 and his 1841 lecture tour in the United States (Mott Magazines: 1741-1850 446.). Lyell' s Principle s suggested a new chronology for geologic history, argued against catastrophic events like Noah's Flood as m ajor geologic processes, and argued for Hutton's view that the earth was m uch older than traditional estim ates based on genealogical calculations from the Bible. Lyell created an up roar, no t just betwee n clergy an d scientists, but be tween and within scien tific an d lite terize th e Princip les controversy as a m ere m atter of science versus religion is to overlook the foundation of American public thought in the textual autho rities of the Bibl e and the W ord of preachers, writers, politicians, and philosophers. Lyell essentia lly suggested that Tr uth was not to be sought in the W ord, but in the W orld, th rough the seem ingly an ti-textual activities of observation and calculation. Men and wom en of letters reacted st rongly but variously to this basic claim . Some, including notably Me lville and Hawthorne, sa w little less than the death of the hum an soul in scientis ts' m ethods. Others, like E merson, transform ed an initial resi stance to scientific m ethodol ogy into a nearly rapturous embrace\u2014cataly zed by a life-alterin g after noon in the natu ral history collections in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris\u2014of science as a truth-seeking epistemology on 30 a par with the W ord and the im agination (B rown 60). Scientists, for their part, perhaps sen sing an opportunity in the fr acas to expand their political p ower and garner m ore funding for their research, bo rrowed the trope of \"progress\" from a rapidly industrializing society they had helped create. They used it to argue that the way they saw things was sim ply th e way things were, and soon A mericans would be forced to s ee them that sam e way. There was no escaping eith er Natu re or Progress. In the d ebate, each s ide had help. S cience h ad spectacle in its corne r. Past the m ind's-eye of the public paraded vi sions of Louis Agassiz's gorgeous books full of color-plates of turtle specim ens, P.T. B arnum 's natural wonders in his American Museum , and public exhibitions such as the \"hydro-oxygen\" microscope on a tour of New York muse ums during 1835. In addition to these tanta lizing m aterial s cientists cou ld also lay c laim to a myriad of technological innovations that their researches authorized, if not actually created. However, these innovations partook in a fierce industrialization of both city and countryside that left m any Am ericans overworked, worn out, and nervous about what m achines m ight do to them . Public literary repres entative s like Melville and Hawthorne had this f ear on their s ide when they went public with their c riticism s of scientific m ethods and m otives. T he legacy of the British Rom antics, who had mounted their own rebellion against an industrialization that started nearly a hundred years before the Am erican Industr ial Revolution, rem ained strong in the pages of novels, daily newspapers, and se rmons delivered from Transcendentalist pulpits in the Northe astern states. The \"machine in the garden,\" as Leo Marx has 31 termed the presence of techno logy in antebe llum Am erica, was a terrifying a s well as a fas cinating pro spect to its v iewers. These tensions m ight be the birth-pangs in A merica of what C.P. Snow deem ed the \"two cultures controversy\" almost a hundred years later in 1959. Snow com plained that his physicist friends did not read literature, and his literary friends had not even the m ost basic wo rking knowledge of physical principles. Snow saw a palp able threat in this l ack of inter-disciplinary communication. Fresh from WW II, Snow feared that sc ientists unchecked by m oral philosophy could wreak havoc on the world again, and he felt it was literary scholars' responsibility, as m uch as scientists' responsib ility, to keep sc ience grounded in an ethos of hum anism (Snow 30). On the ot her hand, he credited science with an objectivity that hum anists needed in order to av oid paro chial infighting and arrest what was beginning to s eem like a slide of liter ary studies in to irrelevanc e in a n incre asingly scientif ic world. Snow's an alysis was synchronic, not diachronic. He did not consider the contributions of history to the dilemma his science and literary friends faced. B ut in the struggles between scientists and literary figures in antebe llum America n over who deserved the right to write tru th for the American p eople, we can see the n ascent shap e of this debate. David Kaufer and Kathleen Carley argue that the boundaries between professional communities ossify if they specialize and rem ove them selves from public oversight, exacerbating the problem of inter-dis ciplinary rivalry. Increasing the of boun daries, like the in terch ange Snow advocated among his friends, reduces confrontatio n over differences of values and 32 epistem ology between professions (Kaufer a nd Carley 303). Nothing of this sort of rapprochem ent transpired in the battle following Lyell's P rinciples in the 1830s. Instead, public literary intellectuals used scien tific media hoaxes to m ount an attack against both scientists and the public w ho perhaps unwitting ly supported scientists' cam paign to ground Am erica's soci al policy in scientific values. The hoaxes were a wrench in the gears of th e popularization of id eas lik e Lyell's . Exploiting the public's neophytic faith in the truth and beauty of science, the hoaxes\u2014through their d ual mechanism of decep tion and rev elation\u2014were ab le to transf orm those assumptions into an embarrassed self-aw areness. The hoaxes drew read ers into adm itting the f oolishness of their read iness to be lieve anything that c ame stam ped with the im prim atur of \"scien ce.\" Ind irectly, th e hoaxes also th scien tists whose work they m imicked; the hoaxes im plied by counterfeit that the scien tists' publicizing of their work\u2014if not the work itself\u2014 was a sham . 3.2 Popular and specializ ed reading culture This critiqu e by public literary fig ures of the mounting s ocial power of science would not have been as effective if the hoaxers were not also able to exploit their readers' appeti tes for and trust in the popular media. The withdrawal of both scientific a nd literary discussion into specia lized journals and professional societies left the lay public hungry for news of what was going on behind these closed doors and covers (Lee 3; S hapin 1001).4 A uniquely Jacksonian social 4 The term \"elite\" is of ten used to ref er to th e jour nals and soc ieties forming during this perio d around a d iscourse that gradually b ecam e very difficult to follow for the readers of popular pe riodicals and the at tendees of lyceum 33 dynam ic of distrust in tensified this desire for knowledge and c ontrol: a fear of elite, undemocratic repositories of pow er hidden behind the rapidly bloating federal governm ent, a fe ar that m anifested itself in the persec ution of the Masons and the disbanding of the S econd National Bank (Brown, 138). Into this tense rhetorical vacuum stepped the genre of the popular science article, pacifying the p ublic appetite fo r the most sensa tional of the cur rent scien tific discoveries and techno logic al invention s with bo ld headlin es an d lots of engravings. The penny dailies sported m any specim ens of this new genre, and publications dedicated solely to the edification of th e popular or general science reader sprang up, including the American Journal of Science (1818) and later the Scientif ic Am erican (1845). These journals a nd papers printed renowned natura list Louis Agassiz's late st discoveries abo ut glaciation on the ir front page s but were equally likely to showc ase interviews with f amous phreno logists and mesmerists and accounts of hay ng into the clouds (Mott Magazines: 1741-1850 446-447). Catering to an audience hungry for scientific w onders and technological labor -and-health-saving gadgets, these ready media platform s created the perfect s tage fo r the scien tific ho axing of Poe, Locke, Twain, and De Quille. lectures. However, as Roger Cooter a nd Steven Pum frey ha ve pointed out, the use of the te rm elite im plies a highe r level of politica l as well as cultura l powe r, and scien ce's \"relation with dom inant cultu re is frequently problem atic\" (252). In this s tudy I will prefer the te rm \"specialized\" to refer to the increas ingly esoteric science journals prolifera ting in Antebellum Americ a, and \"professional\" to refer to the s cientific socie ties, which beca me allied with unive rsity departm ents in the second half of the century. 34 Public desires constitute a powerfu l force driving both the form and function of communication be tween scientis ts and lay read ing communities. In Counter-Statem ent Kenneth Burke claim s that any rheto rical form both create s and satisfies desire for the reader, a de sire\u2014in the case of the \"gee whiz\" popular science articles of the 1830s \u2014for identification with or control over the often alien social force of science and tec hnology. Steven Ka tz adopts Burke's definition of rhetorical desire to argue that this d esire f or identification h as led in this cen tury to scien tific discover ies bei ng portrayed as epic quests, and scientists as heroes (Katz 384). Dorot hy Nelkin in Selling Science finds this dynami c operating even as early as 1890s, as popular science articles portrayed science as a \"mystical\" knowledge open only to nearly su perhum an scientist initiates (78). Extending these observ ations a few decades earlier to th e public hu nger in the 1830s for the quickly-distancing discourse of science, we c ould argue that the brand-new popular science ge nre was sim ply reinforcing a Burkean loop of desire already present in th e reading culture. The public desired canals and railroads and medicines to m ake their lives easier, and this desire drove scientis ts in the form of a constan t social p ressure; however, scie ntists' discover ies and inventions also sparked desires within the public for \"better, faster, m ore\" of e verything. The popular science article also repres ented an important transference of trust to the popular m edia, a shift that paved the way fo r the hoaxes. Newspapers proliferated in the Jacksoni an era as the population in th e States expanded to the point where it was im possible to w itness directly what was happening in one's own community, m uch less in Virginia or New Ham pshire. Readers cam e to rely 35 on the news and the m ail as vicarious witn esses to i mportant social or political happenings. The political re porting during this tim e, in particular, reflects an awareness o n the part of newspapers that they were perform ing an experience of virtu al witness for their read ers; verb atim reports of pr oceedin gs of Congress take up pages and pages of newspapers and pa rty-published m onthlies such as The American Review: A Whig Journal . If readers wanted the inform ation they needed to vote appropr iately and to make decisions that af fected the ir families, they had to sacrif ice eyewitness a nd personal credib ility and to put their trust instead in the institution of the newspaper and the for ms of its anonym ous articles. Miles Orvell argu es tha t this co ercion of trus t was reinf orced by a mechanic al model of s ocial econo my becom ing increas ingly cu rrent in Am erica with industrialization. In The Real Thing , Orvell details the fasc ination of Jacksonian Americans with facsim iles produced by machines and argues that facsim ile becam e an i ncreasingly powerful trope fo understanding social and comm ercial relationsh ips. Stereotyping becam e a co mmon way to deal with unknown social groups, as Am ericans adapted the m odel of machine replication to their social relationsh ips. They becam e more and m ore apt to judg e what they had not experienced as a carbon copy of their previ ous experience (Orvell xv; Seltzer 5). A further consequence of this copying m echanism in the rapidly expanding social economy of antebellum America was that transactions with institutions were gradually substituted for transaction s with acquaintan ces\u2014like familiar lo cal shopkeep ers or bank ers (Orve ll xvii). Trus t in people had to be shifted to tr ust in corpo rations and rules of operation. This shift, forced as it was 36 by the m aterial conditions of a rapidly-e xpanding urbanized environm ent, created a deep unease in the pu blic conscio usness. Th is unease was perform ed in th e protests m entioned above against the Masons, Rosicrucians, and the national bank; however, an industriali zed co rporate econ omy was a fait ac compli . Even if they wished to, Am ericans could no t shri nk their society dow n, take the m achines out of it, put things back to the way they were. The scientif ic m edia hoaxers took sh ameless advantage of this coerced trust. They identified an d replicated in journalistic form their readers' desires for science, technology, and m echanical facs imile. By giving readers what they wanted and then pu lling the rug out from under them , so to speak, the hoaxers confirm ed their readers' fear s that they were being dupe d. In fact, the defining feature of a hoax is the mom ent the read er realizes she has been duped (Berkove 89; Bryant 16). In this mom ent the hoax reveals its devices, which am ount to the reade r's ow n assum ptions that the hoax ha s exploited to a chieve its h umiliating effect. This revelation can com e either within the read ing e xperience or in its immediate through sly details revealing that the petr ified corpse was thumbing his nose at the reader; Poe revealed his \"Balloon-H oax\" of 1844 within the reading context, by getting drunk and standing on the steps of the Sun trum peting his forgery to potential su bscribers. In either even t the revelation crucially depended on the reader's trust in the new spapers' vicarious witn ess of the \"re al world.\" Am erican society had gotten too com plex for readers to be able to ve rify for them selves everything they needed to know in order to function in it. The hoaxes constitute 37 both a sharp criticism by lite rary in tellectuals of this sta te of affairs and a voicing of a deep public uneasiness with it. 4. R ELEVANCE OF HO AXES TO C URRE NT SCHOLARL Y CO NCE RNS Because hoaxes operate at th e nexus of scientific and lite rary epistem ologies, becaus e they adopt the rh etoric of popular m edia to criticize the specialized rhetorics of gr oups viewed as politically threatening, studying them necessita tes multiple c ritical appro aches. I w ill use a bricolage of techniques found within the disciplines of rhetoric of science, Am erican historical reading criticism , and linguistic text pragm atics to answer these basi c questions: how did hoaxers fool their readers, and to what ends? In return, th e hoaxes contribute to the illum ination of an issue that co ncerns all these schoo ls of textua l critic ism: the negotiation of social reality betw een writers and readers through the m ass media, in order to satisf y as m any of th e public's (potentially com peting) desires and expectations as possible (Eberl y 20; Kaufer and Carley 11, 267). 4.1 The rhetoric of science and its populariz ation Overall, hoaxes offer ke y opportunities to scholars of historical scientific rhetoric in three areas: first, hoa xes are an inte rvention in the f ormation of \"ethnoscien ce\" or pervasive lay attitudes to ward scien ce in Antebellum America; we can use the resistance hoaxes represen t to the process of popularization to structure that process in m ore detail. Second, the scientific m edia hoax is an understudied, m achine-age genre of sc ience writing, and the considerable docum entation of its innovation and developm ent by different literary figures over a 30-year period will enable a valuable ca se-study history that will utilize both 38 synchronic and diachronic m ethods of rhetor ical analysis. Th ird, since the hoaxes ape the genre of the popular science artic le as it evolved from the 1830s to the 1860s, we c an use the hoax to m ap out the key features of this genre; further, since genres index communities, we can exam ine through the hoaxes the public reaction to science in this key pe riod when science was gaining enough recognition to influence ethics and politics in Am erica. 4.11 Science popularization in ni neteenth-cen tury America Recent discussions of popularizati on have focused on refram ing the discip line at its m ost foundationa l level, as king if there really is any such thing as popularization, and if there is, wh at m ethods of the propagation of scien tific knowledge in Genesis and Develop ment of a Scientif ic Fact (1935) marks the functional beginning of the study of science populari zation. Fleck argued for a feedback loop of support and authorization between esoteric scien tific co mmunities and \"exoteric\" public s that rev ised traditional as sumptions that scientific popularization was a one-way street from the lab to the lay public. Roger Cooter and Stephen Pumfrey have r ecently argued that key s tudies in the developm ent of popularization studies have forced revisions of even Fleck's two- way m odel: chief am ong them are Michel Callon and John Law's extension of Bruno Latour's study of laboratory ecol ogies, which shows the enrolm ent of private and governm ent agencies to be a th ird factor in the su ccess of scientific research; in addition, stu dies of lay artisan com munities lik e Adrian Desm ond's study of nineteenth-century British craftsm en have reve aled that communities of 39 non-specialists have consis tently created their own scientific knowledge from praxis and through revision of the claim s of \"specialized\" science to fit their own agendas (Cooter 242,250). These com plications to the binary science/public models of popularizatio n have cast doubt on the very definition of th e field of study. Is there really any such phenom enon as \"popular ization,\" or is that sim ply a convenient reduction of the enor mous, co mplicated work of m aking s cience to a more m anageable dyn amic that ru ns from lab to s treet? There is n o sim ple solution to this problem , but Cooter and Pumfrey call for more historical studies of the m aking of publi c scientific knowle dge to help put the study of science popularization into proper context (Cooter 237). Cooter and Pum frey's call has been answered by scholars w orking on the twentie th ce ntury and n ineteenth- century Britain. Most of these studies have found that science is popularized by bei ng sold as technology or paraded as spectacle. Dorothy Nelkin's study of pre ss coverage of science since World W ar I in Selling Science found that the rhetoric of scien ce journalism , from the birth of the first science writing s yndicate in 1924, has pushed sc ience in term s of the \"- est\": the biggest, strangest, newest, or oldest (1). Jeanne Fahnestock and Greg Myers have both inquired specifically into the adjusting of scie ntific claim s to public desire. In \"Accomm odating Rhetor ical found k to forensic argum ents about specific experim ents when writing for each other, but when writin g for the public, th ey make epideictic argum ents, fitting their discoveries to lay values and goals\u2014which can inclu de the \"gee whiz\" mode of science appreciation and the 40 value of \"more for less,\" or what scie nce can do for the publ ic in term s of technology and m edicine to im prove the overall quality of public life. Greg Myers's study W riting Biology corroborates Fahnestock's results. Myers compared texts two biologists wrote for di sciplinary journ als with the v ersions they wrote for m ore general journals; ove rall, he found that the popular articles focused on the natural object of the invest igation from a \"wonders of the world\" perspec tive, while th e expert journal articles focused more on the experim ent, its conditions, and m ethodology. This shif t from limited experim ental claims to bolder, va lue-lad en cla ims in science popularization has be en docum ented well before the 20th century. In his landm ark study of the Philosophical T ransactions of the Royal S ociety of London beginning in the 17th centu ry, Charles Bazerm an found that co ntribu tors cast the ir scientif ic work as revea ling the sp ectac le of God' s creation f or a \"novelty-hungry\" readers (Shaping 133). Steven Shapin in \"Pump and Circum Boyle's ental rhetoric, found that Boyle coped with audi ence expectations in an ingenious way. He included detailed engravings of all of hi s apparatus so th at the lay reader or an experim enter in som e field other than ch emistry c ould \"v ining equi pment and methods while reading. Studies sim ilar to these have helped structure the \"wonder-business,\" as Mark Twain deem ed it, of bringing scienc e new s to the public\u2014especially in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and twentieth centuries (Clem ens \"Mem oranda\" 859). The m ethods developed in thes e stu dies have recently b een f ruitfully ap plied to 41 nineteenth-century British science populari zation. analyzed discours chem ists Joseph Priestley and Sir Hum phrey Davy utilized to public ly enlist chem istry as an institu tion preserv ing m iddle-class values fro m the Enlightenm ent to the early nineteenth century. Jam es Secord conducted a case study in the populariza tion of evolution by tracing the public lif e of a single Vict orian text, the anonym ously-published Vestiges of the Natur al His tory of Creation (1844), through diaries, news clippings, and m emoirs. Greg My ers's study of the popularization of therm odynam ics considers the joint construction of popular Victorian topoi, or public com monplaces, by lay and scien tific co mmunities. In accommodating therm odynam ics to a lay audience, physicists actually adopted a dom inant topos in Victo rian cultu this attem pt to accomm odate their findings to Victorian values , the physicists, whether know ingly or not, contributed to popular culture two new topoi for understanding and plo tting the trajectory of social relationships into th e troubling future: conservation of energy and entropy. These his toriograph ical techniqu es\u2014analyzing archiv ed reader and recuperating key topoi that acco mmodated scientific principles to lay values\u2014need to be applied to ante bellum Am erica (Cooter 237n; Shapin Science 1001). Just as the industrial revol ution in England was a pivotal period for the rhetoric of science, as lay people began to talk and write about science and technology as m ajor figures in their social landscape for the first tim e in history\u2014 so with the m id-nineteenth century in America. The scientif ic m edia hoax es identified for study in this project constitute an inter vention in the p rocess of 42 science popularization during this tim e. Hoaxe rs like Poe and Twain exploited reader assumptions about science and scie nce news to f ool their re aders in to believing the hoaxes were true witnesses to scientific reality. Then, by r evealing the hoaxes, either textually or contextu ally, the authors exposed the unconscious expectations the public had about science as vehicle to the Truth and im plied that those expectations we re unwarranted. Poe and Twain could only acco mplish this effect by successfully identifying and re-perform ing in their hoaxes their r eaders' expectations about science and science writing. These comm on expectations read ers held, like the topoi Myers identified in his therm odynam ics study, for med the units of exchange that science writers and readers traded in popular science articles, and in the science hoaxes. Identifying these expect ations, suggesting their origins, and showing how they m ight have in teracted with each other in the hoax-read ing process are m ajor goals of this project and its principal cont ribution to the study of popularization. In the hoaxes we witness a unique gam e in m eta- popularization, as Poe and the other hoaxers strove to m ake the public aware of their being conditioned to accept scientific truth over the truths of faith , reason, and the im agination. And even though the particular crisis between science and art tha t trigg ered these hoaxes in an tebellu m Americ a is pas t, hoaxing is still alive and well as a stra tegy of interven tion in the pr ocess of either scientific or hum anistic epistemol ogies. The Epilogue to Chapter Five of this dissertation will extend findings from the historical section of the study to account for the controv ersy surround ing Alan Sokal's recen t hoax in Social Text . 43 4.12 Scientific genres Scholars of scien tific genres are interes ted in how the genres are developed and codified over tim e and in how that p rocess indexes the changing values and g oals bo th of scien tists an d their read ers (C. Miller 152-153). Writing these kinds of histories of genres p resents special p roblem s of data co llection and methodology that have recen tly elicited i nnov ative solu an m odels of knowledge dissem ination over tim e in their st udy of print culture to argue that the developm ent of scientif ic journals f acilitated the flow of knowledge between disciplines starting in the eighteenth century (254, 267) . Carol Berkenkotter and Thom as Huckin used read-aloud protocols of scientists reading research reports, coupled with textual surveys of 350 artic les from 12 scientific journals over a period of 45 years, to show that the scie ntific article is still changing to ref lect reader preferences in the late twentieth century (Berkenkotter and Huckin 33-35). By contrast, Carolyn R. Mille r focused her dissertation on a self -destructing genre. She analyzed th e Environmenta l Impact Statem ent over tim e in concert with enviro nmental leg islation to dem onstrate that the E. I.S. f ailed to address competing interests in its governm ental r eadership (Miller 164). These studies all combine di verse textual and contextual appro aches to write histo ries of the feedback loop between genre form ation and reader goals and values. A lingering problem in scientific genre research, in spite of these advances in methodology, is a tendency to read the success of certain m ovements in science backwards into the conditions of production of their rhetoric. In \"Moving Beyond 44 the Mom ent,\" Danette Paul, Davida Ch arney, and Aim ee Kendall argue that a narrow focus on the production of scien tific texts often exaggerates their importance for their co mmunities of receptio n. Instead, the authors argue , scholars of rhetoric of science should com bine their analysis of the rhetoric of a text with an alyses of its imm ediate recep tion, and its chan ging reception over time. Only in th is way can researchers avoid applying post hoc judgm ents, based on the even tual success or failure of the theor ies the author espoused, to the success or failure of th e author's strategies for adapt ing hi s/her claims to r eader s' values and interests. With my approach to the nascent ge nre of scientific hoaxing, I hope to answer the challenge in \"Moving Beyond the Mom ent,\" first by taking as m y prim ary object of study the immediate reception of the scientific m edia hoaxes, and second, by conducting a diach ronic study of hoaxes by four different authors living in dif ferent com munities within th e United States ov er a roughly 30-year period. The imm ediate reception of the hoaxes is accessib le via the contemporary media, private diaries and m emoirs of readers, and comm entary by the hoaxers them selves. Each hoax er modified the genre of the hoax for his own purposes and to fit the cultural milieu in which he wrote, and a diachronic and geographic survey of all of these hoaxes will pr ovide a deta iled his tory, sensitive to tim e and place, of the developm ent of a unique and unstu died scien tific genre. In addition, since, as D wight Atkinson ar gues in his study of rhetoric of the research article, key values and contemporary issues refere nced in a scien tific text p to \"insider persp ectiv es, and soci al practices or ideologies\" of a given 45 readership, the hoaxes can provide a suggestiv e index to the role science played in the lives of lay readers from 1835 to 1880. This study of hoaxing m akes a final nove l contribution to the history of scientific genres, and that is a rhetorical analysis of the antebellum popular science article. Since hoaxing is a m eta-genre, it can serve as a useful tool for historical genre reconstruction. Like pa rodies and burlesques, hoaxes m ust mimic another gen re for their effect\u2014scien ce news ar ticles, in th is case. In the case of the successful hoaxes, hoaxes that fooled thousands of readers, we know that they succeeded in iden tifyin g and re-perform ing the salien t features of th e science news article. If im itation is the sin cerest form of fla ttery\u2014or perhaps the insinceres t, in the case of hoaxing\u2014it is also an excellent heu ristic for reconstructing the rhetorical form of the antebellum popular science article. Much as John Swales has done for the acad emic article, this project hopes to do for the nascent Am erican popular science ar ticle, positioned crucially as it was at the juncture of a social cris is betw een specialized and popular communities of scienc e and litera ture in th e mid-nineteenth century. 4.2 Reading science in nine teenth-century America Reader-o riented critics of nineteenth century A merican literature currently find them selves in a difficult double bind, according to scholar s of historical reading su ch as Jam es Machor and Jane Tom pkins. On the one hand, situated, cognitively-focused readings\u2014like thos e conducted by Roland Barthes, Wolfgang Iser, and reader-response critics like St anley F ish and Jona than Culler\u2014produce compelling accounts of individual processes of interpretatio n but still take the text 46 as their \"prim ary unit of m eaning,\" thus sacrificing a cultural perspective that would reveal the text as a \"force exerted upon the world\" (Tom pkins 225). On the other hand, New Historical studies of reading in the nineteenth century yield rich cultural contextuali zation, but as a practioner of this m ethodology, Jam es Machor is concerned that this broadening of focus of ten sacrif ices the ability to account for how individual historical readers actua lly read (Machor x). Empirical studies of reading are one wa y out of this He isenb ergian sort of inability to keep both pr ocess and r eading in focus at the sa me time. Read-a loud or think-aloud protocols, interviews, a nd surveys help capture m oments in the cognitive act of individ ual in terpretation. By studying multip le read ers, these studies can average findings across the gr oup in order to discern comm on reading strategies. Both Berkenkotter and Huckin, and Charles Bazerm an, have interviewed eminent scientists in their of fices while th ey read ex perim ental articles in order to discover generalities in these expert readers ' pattern of skimm ing/reading the articles. A sim ilar read-aloud study c onducted by Davida Charney compared evolutionary biologists' reactions to aty pical cla ims made in an article by Stephen Jay Gould and Ri chard Lewontin with the reac tions of biology graduate students; Charney used th e differences in the responses of the two groups to draw conclusions about ne ophyte reading practices versus expert reading practices in the field of biology. These empirical stud ies yield lim ited but suggestive claim s about cont extually-bound acts of reading. However, these m ethods cannot help scholars studying nineteenth-century readers and read ing practices. The abse nce in tim e and space of th e orig inal 47 readers and contexts of reading have le d reading scholars eith er to an alyze the reactions of a reconstructed \"ideal reader\" (usually coex tensive with the reac tions of the scholar), or to ela borate the reading context a nd culture through archival and historical research. Hoaxes present a unique opportunity to move beyond this double-bind of reade r-oriented histo rical critic ism. They are successful rhetorical experim ents in identifying and re-perform ing common read er expectations. In other words, authors of successful m edia hoaxes m anage d to guess correctly at le ast som e of the expectations th eir readers h ad about news \u2014expectatio ns about the reality it reported, expectations about th e content, style, and form at of news itself. The hoaxers exploited these expectations to produce texts that readers bought as the \"real thing\"; then, th ey reve aled their hoaxes public ly to embarrass r eaders for adhering so blindly to thos e expectations. In their guessing gam e, the authors had the imm ense advantage of living and read ing among the people they w ere trying to fool. However, in m any ca ses, th e ho axers, their readers/v ictims, and contem porary historians of the hoaxing events have left us a pa per tra il of reade r responses that encode certain \"sticking point s\" or recurring topi cs in debates over the tru th-value of the hoaxes. These topoi in turn enable reconstruction of the crucial reader expectations about scie nce and science news that the hoaxers exploited to achieve their desired goals . These recovered expectations can provide a w ay of explaining the m any sim ilar interpr etations of the same tex t\u2014 \"sim ilarity\" in this case defi ned as a function of \"being fooled.\" The filter should enable lim ited claim s about the culture of reading at the tim e of the hoaxes while 48 simultaneously providing a fra mework flexible enough to m odel i ndividual experiences of the hoaxes at different tim es and places . The next section is dedicated to reviewing the historical jus tification for an exp ectation-based m odel of reading and detailing the m ethods for recuperating reader expectations from historical docum ents and m odeling their in teraction in reader decisions about the truth-value of hoaxes. W hile this new herm eneutic does not preten d to f ully account for cultural context or for individua l process, it does provide an extension of rhetorical m ethods for s ituating reader-orien ted criticism in a specific historical mom ent. In doing so, it offe rs a way out of the double- bind of context or process that has dogged reader-ori ented cr iticism of nineteenth cen tury texts. This study of hoaxing will make one f inal contrib ution to o ur understanding of nineteenth century rhetorical and literary practice in A merica, by raising th e prof ile of a neglec ted A merican writer of the pe riod: Dan De Quille (William Wright). Dan De Quille was a m iner on the Com stock Lode be fore he becam e a s uccessful jo urnalist for the Territo rial Enterprise in Virg inia City, where he worked Mark Twain. Most of De Quille's hoaxes were writte n during his tenure with the Enterprise , all of whose records for the years before 1875 burned in the great fire of that year. Lawrence Berkove at the University of Illinois, and Richard Dwyer and Richar d Lingenfelter at the University of Nevada, Reno, have collected De Quille's tall tales and published them along with severa l scho larly articles on his journalistic and histor ical writings. However, very few other scholars have worked on De Quille, and no one has yet taken his hoaxing seriously as part of the im pact of scien ce on the A merican W est. De 49 Quille riva ls or su rpass es Poe as a hoaxe r, an d any cons ideration of scien tific media hoaxing in the nineteenth century must reckon with De Quille or risk under-repres enting a rem arkable strategic m ove in the literary reaction to science. De Quille's scienc e hoaxes and his hist orical texts, like The Big Bonanza , played a powerf ul role in the cr eation of the id ea of the West\u2014especially the co nception of the W est as a natural and scientific waste-and-w onderland; therefore, his cultural influence beckons exam ination. 5. P ROJECT METHO DOLOG Y My decision to focus on reading expectations is not an innovation. Reader-oriented criticism ge nerally acknowledges that \"r eading is not ac J onathan Culler ( 116). Readers bring preconceptions with them when they start to read a text, pr econceptions based on th eir education, their personalities , their spe ech comm unities, a nd oth er rces. Wolfgang Iser and Stanley F ish have arg ued that m eaning-creation in read ing arises from an interaction between th e tex t and these preconceptions, which Fish calls \"interpretive conventions\" and Iser calls \"codes\" (Fish Is T here a Text 16; Iser 106, 118). In a rev iew of the critical h istory of interpretive conv entions, Steven Mailloux argues that they are not, as Fish and Iser ha ve claim ed, projections of real readers' preconceptions but instead are sophisticated cri tical conventions sustain ed by a comm unity of literary critics who share a certain m ethodology for approaching texts (Mailloux 29). These hi gh-level conventions do not translate well tury since the 50 hoaxes' readers were n ot part of reader -respons e critical co mmunities. Instead, the hoaxes' success depended on uncritical, unreflexive reading. W hat is needed to analyze the hoaxes is a set of expectati ons arising from that culture of reading, from readers' habitual contact w ith popular science articles and with \"ethnoscience,\" pervasive lay opinions a bout science in an tebellum culture. Reconstructing reader exp ectations is a difficult project, b ut a critical understand ing of hoaxing cannot be for med without attempting it. Because expectations are critical abstraction s, I need to address Mailloux 's criticism s of herm eneutic idealism recepti idea lism holds that the interpretive process can be characterized through the interpretive conventions that drive it, a characterizati on that could be take n to fit the proposed methodology in this project. Mailloux believe s this approach falls into either one or both of two traps: \"the infinite regress of conven of co ntext\" (Mailloux 10). I will attem pt to avoid the first of thes e traps by limiting both context and conventions. My an alysis of the reading culture of the hoaxes focuses narrowly on genre expectati ons and ethnoscientific expectations. In addition, although the num ber of interpre tive gam es that could be played with expectations even in th is selected arena may be infinite, I will constrain my focus to gam es concerning the truth-value of the hoaxes. I expect that certain reader expecta tions will em erge as being m ore cen tral to and powerf ul in these particula r epistem Mail loux's second charge against herm eneutic idealism is more com plicated to han dle: 51 When her meneutic idealists attem pt to describ e the system of interpretive conventions th at determine m eaning, eith er they describe this system as independent of rhetorical s ituations o r they do no t realize tha t the conventions them selves are the t opic of critical debate at specific historical mom ents. In e ither case, idealists m ake a m istake sim ilar to th at of realists by presupposing the possibi lity of m eaning outside specific historical of rhetor ical practices. (Mailloux 16) Talking abo ut reader ex pectations is posing a level of abstra ction ; there is no escaping this cr iticis m. However, it is jus tified in this case because hoaxes them selves are abstracting genres. They are meta-g enres that m anipulate salient features of other genres and readers' expectations abou t those featu res. To understand how these scientific m edia hoaxes achieved their effect with readers, we have to understand the expectati ons readers had about ethnoscience and science m edia. In order to constrain th e abs traction neces sary to th is project, however, I the hoaxes. Th recep tion of each hoax will be co nsidere d independently, as a hoax is not a text but an event bound to a particular readership, a particular kairos , and all generalization s about hoaxin g will be limited acco rdingly. Further, reconstructed as they are fro m the historical re sponses by readers, the reading expectatio ns consid ered in this project are not the sam e as anachronistic \"interpretive conventions\" le vied against the texts of the hoaxes by expert g roups of litera ry critics. W hile it is perhaps bold to claim a grass- roots 52 ethos for this project, its de sign is bottom -up, its focus specific, and its claim s historically contingent. 5.1 Rhetorical precedents for the r ecovery of reader expectations It is now necessary to develop a vo cabulary for talking about readers' expectations of genre and cultu re. A com bination of reader-orien ted, rh etorical, and New Historicist m ethodologies lay the groundwork for this project and help recuperate reader expectations from archived reader res ponses. A fter these expectations have been reconstructed, textual prag like from linguis tics, will help m odel the interaction of the expectations in decisions about the trut h or falsehood of hoaxes. To avoid the lim itations of previous anal yses of hoaxes that have restricted their inquiry to the rhetoric of the physical texts, I need m ethodologies that allow me to inspect th e reception of the h oaxes, whic h is where their effect truly lies. While physical texts always for m an im portant source of evidence for their historical impact, as D wight Atkinson argues in his study of the transactions of the Royal S ociety, current concep tions of textuality inform ed by reception, in cluding elem ents of readers' daily econom ic, social, and moral lives. Richard Altick argued in his sem inal study of the English comm on reader that we cannot understand the hi storical im pact of texts unless we understand these m unda ne details affecti ng reading behavior. Unless w e enrich our definition of textuality, we will rem ain unable to explain historical acts of reading. 53 In addition to the histori cal details of antebellum readers lives outlined in the sec tions trea ting the kairos of the hoaxes above, there is another crucial source of evidence for the recepti on of the hoaxes\u2014im mediate reader responses and the common assum ptions about read ing scienc e tha t they en code. W hen nineteenth- century read ers debated the truth of the science hoaxes, they focused on certain topoi or \"sticking poin ts\"\u2014like the chances of the newspapers actually being able to get the inf ormation so quickly, the re putation of the sc ientists n amed in th e article, o r the \"verisim ilar\" tone of the article. These topoi all index key expectations readers had about scien ce and science news. There are good preceden ts for the recov ery of these sorts of topoi in recent scholarship on the historical reception of science rhetoric and of American civic rhetoric. In Rhetorical Power Steven Maillou x retains so me of the assum ptions of the reader-response school\u2014nam ely Iser's and Fish's claim that the text is an event of interpr etation, not an object \u2014while defining a new eneutics\" that conn ects h istorical read ings of a text with the wid er cultu ral debates they participate in. Mailloux develops the three critical moves of rhetorical herm eneutics through an analysis of the critical history of Huc kleberry Finn. First, Mailloux brings th e rhetoric of race in th e novel into conversation with a particular sociocultural debate at the tim e of its publ ication\u2014the \"Negro issue\" and, in particular, the representati on of black people in the m instrel shows of the 1880s. Second, he discusses the critical history of the book from the 1880s to 1980 with respect to a particular cultural topos \u2014the \"bad boy\" or juvenile delinquent. Finally, Mailloux puts his own interpretation of the novel into play 54 with other critical pers pectives on the book, reader -response approaches in particular. W ith these three m oves, Mailloux hopes to m aintain the reader- response tradition 's em phasis on the cogniti ve process of reading while bringing that trad ition into contact with the culture of the text's prod uction. His definition of rhetoric, in fact, is a definition of cont act: \"the politica xii) Rosa Eberly has extended and revise d Mailloux's operational definition of rhetoric in her study of argum ents a bout censored texts in Citizen Critics . Eberly sets out the goals of her project as fo llows: \"the processes through which literary texts affect social practices can b e studied em pirically by an alyzing the contours of public debate as reflect ed in the rh etorical strateg ies of participants' discourses\" (Eberly 163). Like Mailloux, Eberly is interested in what happens when rhetoric encounters society\u2014in the fo rm of groups of citizens debating each of four censored texts. Eberly m easures this deba te through imm ediate reader response\u2014Op/Ed pieces, letters to the editor, reviews, comm entary in the m edia. She further structures th e process of receptio n by identifyin g key topoi or stances from which citizen critics comm only launched their argum ents about the controversial works, topics like obs cenity, aesthetics , and authority. Michael Schudson's T he Good Citizen is another m odel of a historical rhetorical study that reconstructs changi ng conceptions of citi zenship in Am erica from the colonial period to the present day. Schudson reads the topos of the \"good citizen\" through its historical perm utations in constitutional law , voting statutes, and political debate about vo ting. His study, like those reviewed above, 55 uses m ultiple histo rical sources in ergent cultura l topoi that are powerful organizers of discourse at those historical m oments. Similar m ethods for reconstruction of ke y concepts in the public discourse of science have recen tly been em ployed in New Historical approach es to the rhetor ic of scienc e. In addition to integra tion of therm odynam ic concepts into Victorian culture by G reg My ers discusse d earlier, Charles Bazerm an's recen t study of Edison's rhetoric and D wight Atkinson's longitudinal study of the rhetoric of the Royal Society also provide excellent m odels for this project. In The Languages of Edison's Light , Bazerm an considers a wealth of data the cu ltural histo ry \"techno to successful integ ration\" (339). Bazerm an studies a rhetorical m aze of patent records, newspaper articles about Edison's re search, industry prospectuses, and advertisem ents in ord er to tease out the strands of ar gumentation that are key in the arduous process of accomm odating a tech nology\u2014not just th e idea of its usefulness, but the idea of the technology as an avatar of public desire\u2014in the American mind. W rites Bazerm an of his m ethodology: By focusing attention on situated, sym bolic, discursive practices, the approach presented here m oves us closer to the kind of m icro- empirical study that is associated with ethnom ethodology, conversational analysis, and sociolinguis tics, a llowing us to lo cate and exa mine the exact sites of social production and reproduc tion in particular discursive mom ents. (344) 56 Dwight Atkinson also applies this clos e attention to langua ge in his study of the changing rhetoric of the Royal So ciety. Atkinson adapts Douglas Biber's register analysis m ethodology from applied linguistics to the project of illum inating changes in the rheto ric of the experimental repo rt ov er 400 years; he combines that em pirical approach with clo se New Historical analys is of the soc ial issues index ed in the articles to s ituate the reg ister ch anges in the article within the conc its wr iters and readers as in an ever-ch political ecology. Methodologi es like Atkinson's and Bazerm an's, and the civic rhetorical projects as well, count on bei ng able to \"read off\" key values of the reading culture from the archived text s under exam ination (Atkinson 59). These values are com pared with outside histor ical accounts of the cultures in question before any claim s are m ade about what those cultu res believed . This methodology will prove useful for \"reading o ff\" reader expectations abou t science and science media f rom the texts of the initial reac tions to the hoaxes in this study. 5.2 Pragmatic-linguistic models of reader expectations Increasing ly, rheto rical scholars of b oth civ ic an's the ch of pragm atic-linguistic m ethodologies that em phasize the social activities in which language is engaged. Scholars in pragm atics, the study of language in use, ha ve talked about discourse in term s of expectations and goals on the part of its participants for nearly a century. Mikhail Bakhtin, in the process of criticizing the asocial tende ncies of the Russia n 57 Form alists, introduced a theo ry that grounded discussions of literary m eaning in the comm unal values an d speech practices of the reading community. Joh n Searle and J.L. Austin both claim ed in their versions of s peech act th eory that m eaning in dialogue did not result from the actual linguistic form of the exchange, but from the inte raction of this m essage with the prec onception s and desire s of the participan ts. While the y were not strictly interested in lite rary tex ts, their work was quickly adapted to those ends by D econstru ctionists like Jacques Der rida. H. Paul Grice's work extended Searle 's and Austin's by bringing the pre- existing ex pecta tions of discours e par ticipants to th e very forefront of the interpretive process. G rice posited the Cooperativity Principle as a basic but powerful way of under standing hum an comm unication; it says, in effect, that participan ts in a discou rse should assum e that each is trying to h elp the other accom plish his/h er go als. This prin ciple breaks down into more specific guidelines, or maxims, which m ay be violat ed for certain effects. Maxim s govern both the activity of the speaker and the hearer: Maxim of Quality: Tell the truth Maxim of Quantity: Be as inform ative as expected. Maxim of Relevance: Make your cont ribution relevant to what has com e before. Maxim of M anner: Be brief, orderly, and clear. The m axims are usually adhered to in \"norm al\" communication, including textual com munication, but th ey can be departed from in significant ways. Flouting is consensual departure; violation is unila teral departur e. To take the 58 exam ple of the m axim of Quality (telli ng the truth ), a f louting of the m axim would be sarcasm , as in the following exchange: A: W hat did you think of the statistics lecture? B: Riveting. B does not think statistics is rive ting, and sh e lik ely acco mpanies her response with a particular, flat intonation to help clue A in to the fact that she is flouting Quality, and he should understand her response ironically. Compare this coordinated activity wi th lying, which is a violation of Quality. W hen B lies to A, she gives no indication that she is no t upholding Quality, and so A is deceived. The Gricean m axims and especially the notion of flou ting have proved powerful and suggestive as research tools. They help structure sp eech acts lik e sarcasm and irony as well as exp lain the e ffects of indirect s peech a cts. Severa l theories of discourse interpretation have been based upon them . One of these is Dan Sperber and Deirdre W ilson's Re levance Theory, which models the interpretive process as an interpretiv e game driven by Gricean expectations that may com e into ten sion with ea ch other an d therefore need to be ranked in som e sort of (provisional and sh ifting) order during the r eadin g process s o that the reader can produce m omentarily stable m eanings from the text while she reads. The basic engine of Sperber and W ilson's interpretive model is a tens ion between the constraints of interpretive effort a nd effect. In other words, the m eaning a reader chooses to favor in a particular read ing will be the one that sa tisfies the most of her expectations w ith the least am ount of effort . However, since Sperber and W ilson are not desi gning a reading theory per se, they m ake no provision for 59 a reader focusing on some textual e lements ove r oth ers; there is on ly one lev el, the \"s timulus,\" which the speak er/write r has m anifested already before the interpretive act begins. W ithin the stim ulus, there are no levels to the notion of relev ance, and levels are crucial because the reader's m ultiple textu al and extra- textual expectations interact and co mpete with each oth er in the readin g process ; all these m yriad expectations cannot be equally important to the reader. Given that the read ing experien ce fo r an individual can be driven by expectations based on the reader's dialec t community, gender, prior exposure to text typ es, critical community, or lac k of sleep the night before, a com plete list of expectations for any single act, m uch less the a cts of a rea ding community ove r time, are impossible. Jacqueline Henkel (lecture not es) t ells the story of her revelation that the m ovie Casablanca was all about back pain after she watched it while re cuperating fro m a thrown-out back. Scenes which she had once interpreted a s sign ificant in building toward Ilsa's clim actic decision to lea ve Rick for Victor, she now interpreted purely as wrenching exercises in standing up fro m piano benches and leaning over bars. He nkel used her experience as an exam ple of idiosyncr atic in terpretive expec tations that must be discounted in any serious theory of reading expectations, but her story raises the same question Mailloux raise s in Rhetor ical Po wer\u2014where to draw the line in a ny theory that tre ats reading as a constraint -satisfaction process. 5.3 Pragmatic models of readers' expectations of genre Some productive attempts to lim it research into pragm atic conventions have focused on particular conventions \u2014generic conventions being the m ost 60 popular. These studies focus on generic cues within texts that tr igger expectations based on readers' past experience w ith these genres. Rolf Zwaan has demonstrated that m erely redirecting r eaders' assum ptions about what genre a single text belongs to\u2014news or literature in his case\u2014triggers differing reading behaviors for that text.5 The m ost productive attem pt to combine rule-based pragm atic inte critic ism is Ellen uber and Ellen Spolsky's Bounds of Interpretation . Schauber and Spolsky identify three system s of conventions which constrain th e literary reading pr ocess: linguistic convention s, pragm atic convention s, and literary conventio ns. They focus on litera ry con ventions in the form of generic form ulas (specifically for the romance). In Schauber and Spolsky's m odel, reader exp ectations are term ed \"preference rules,\" which are active in any one reading of a text. A reader starts a novel with just the title and any preferen ce rules m entally associated with the genre of rom ance novels and with the aut hor's known style, if applicable. These preference rules include necessary conditions for membership in a g enre (listed in detail for rom ance nove ls), gradient necessary conditions which can still hold even though som e parts are left unsatisfied, and typicality conditions , the weakest, which can be overridden based on conflic ting information f rom the text be ing read. In addition to these preference ru les, the reader brings to the tex t \"conditions of significan ce\" which filter out as pects of the text unim portant to the reader, and which can interact with typicality conditions as the r eader chooses to 5 See Chapter Three for a fuller analysis of Zwaan's study. 61 emphasize (or to igno re) typ ical features of the text. Interp retations a re construc ted as f ollows: 1. Readers begin with a certain, wei ghted list of conditions; as these conditions are supported or disconf irmed during reading, the reader prefers some inte rpretive possibilities over others. 2. In cases of conflict between condi tions\u2014say, in \"A Modest Proposal\" when the reader realizes that the S incerity Co ndition (rou ghly, that the narrator m ust believe what s/he is saying) co mes into conf lict with the horrifying details of the proposal\u2014the reader reweights the conditions. In an iron ic reading of \"A Modest Proposal,\" the Sincerity Condition is weighted less heavily than it was at th e beginning of the reading. But, as Schauber and Spolsky point out, \" overriding is not canceling or suspending; tension is th e price p aid for whatev er resolu tion is achieved \" (34). The S incerity Condition does not di sappea r, it is ju st downgraded in significance to the reader\u2014and could be upgraded again later in light of more data. 3. In a case of a conf lict between two conditions tha t is ultim ately unresolvab le through re-weighting o f conditions , ambiguity results. Th e reader m ay hold two or more readings as equal. Schauber and Spolsky go through W uthering Heights with their con straint-satisfaction process to account for its generic ambiguity between a rom ance and a tragedy, and they go on to interpr et how this ambiguity is significant f or that junctu re in literary and social history in England. 62 As a m odel of reader expectations that cou ld potentially be applied to analyzing the effects of hoaxes on their readers, Schauber and Spolsky's m odel has m any desirable features. It adm its m ore types of expecta tions than just high- level critical conventions. Also, it can cope with th e differing strengths readers might assign to these ex pectations during the reading pr ocess. However, a m odel of reading that can cope with readers' decisions about truth while reading the hoaxes needs to detail more than just gene ric expectations, because conceptions of \"truth\" extend beyond genre to the world of the reader's prio r experience with science. U nfortunately, Schauber a nd Spolsky's m odel does not provide a mechanism for these differing expectati ons about genre and the \"world\" to interact with each other. I have res ources for recoveri ng th e reader exp ectations from historical docum ents, as outlined in the previous section. W hat I need now is a m ethod for holding these m ultiple expe ctations in view and m odeling their interaction a nd com petition with each othe r in the process of re ading a hoax . 5.4 Optimality Theory Over the last three years, I have been developing a m odel of reader expectations that m ay be applied m ore productively to explaini ng the effect of the hoaxes' rhetoric on th eir read ers. It is based on Optim ality Theory, a constra int- satisf action framework that m odels de cision processes ba sed on interacting constraints of various strengths. I fi rst applied the m odel to a project on re- reading in a Jorge Luis Borges sho rt story. In it I dem onstrated how specific competition s between expectations \u2014about the reliab ility of the narrator, for exam ple\u2014can drive a single reade r's re-reading s of a text. I will give the results 63 of that expe riment as exam ples of my adaptations of Optim ality Theory af ter a brief description of the theory, its origins and current uses, and how I have adapted it to model the r eading pro cess. Optim ality Theory (OT) is not ac tually a th eory. It is a m odel f or constraint satisfaction processes in gene ral (like workflow and decision problem s, some cognitive proces ses, and biolo gical pro cesses Theory from econom ics in to lingu istics in 1993, where it proved useful for handling co mplex phonological problem s previously inexplicable or oversim plified by genera tive grammar. To see how it works in phonology, consider T able 1: Table 1: Syllabification of \"onset\" /ans t/ FAITH ONS NOC -t * *!** <a>nst *! * The f irst co lumn lists a ll (or the most re alistic, in m ost cases) poss ible candidates for the phonological form of a wor d as speakers actually pronounce it\u2014in this case, the th ree m ost pr obable sylla bifications of the English word \"onset.\" A hyphen indicates the syllable break in the word. The bracketed <a> in the third candida te repres ents a dele ted vo wel (which is ac tually a fairly common phonological feature in colloquial Engl ish: think of the nasal \"N-n\" with a head shake in place of \"no, no\"). The top row lists all phonol ogical co nstraints applicab le to the problem in order, left-to-right, from strongest (inviolable) to w eakest (often violated in 64 practice). In this case, the constrain t FAIT H, which states that all parts of a word should be pronounced, is ranked higher th an both ONS, which says syllables should start with consonants, and NOCODA, which says syllables should not end in consonants. ONS and NOCODA are not ranked with respec t to each othe r because they never operate on the sam e part of the syllab le and therefore never compete with each other; th e vertical dotted li ne signifies this lack of competition. The ranking of the constraint s in th is tab leau c ould also b e notated in a linea form F AITH NOC brack eting with comm as signifies equality of rank and therefore lack of competition. This rank ing applie s to all Eng lish words and was dete rmined via analysis of copious sets of English syllabification data by phonologists. The aste risks in the matrix of the ta ble rep resent violati ons of particular constraints. The violations add up like penalty points again st a candid ate, with a violation of a stronger (leftw ard) constraint counting m ore than a violation of a weaker one. An \"!\" follows and indicates the fatal violation, the one that knocks the candidate out of the running for optim al form (violations are usually tallied up from right to left, weak est to strong est). Th e check m ark in the cand idate colum n indicates the optim al phonological form , the one that satisfies the greatest num ber of highest-ranked constraints. This is the f orm in which speake rs actua lly pronounce the word \"onset.\" In the exam ple in Tab le 1, \"an-s t\" is the optim al form . Whi le has m ore total viola tions than \"<a >nst,\" it nevertheless satisfies FAIT H, the highest ranked constraint. The runner-up, \"<a>ns t\", does not. The third for m, \"ans-t\", gets 65 knocked out of the running even earli er because it accrues m ore NOCODA violations than either of the other tw o forms due to a consonant cluster \"ns\" at the end of the f irst sy llable. How are phonological constraints deri ved in Optim ality Theory ? The constraints and their ranking were derived from looking at phonological paradigm s. Paradigm s are m icrocosm s of a language: th ey are data sets listing all differing form s currently in u se in the language for plural endings, syllable breaking patterns or whichever phonologi cal phenom enon is under investigation. Looking at these paradigm s, phonologist s make general claim s based on the patterns they see: \"This language never ha s closed syllables\"; \"in about half the forms here, consonant reduction occurs when the plural ending is added,\" etc. These generalities becom e constraints on the actual spoken for ms of words in the language because the form s that speakers actually use are the ones that satisfy the greatest number of thes e \"rules.\" The to tal set of phonological constraints, claim phonologists, is universal; only their ranki ng changes from language to language. In Minyanka, a Niger-C ongo language, there ar e never consonant clusters; this is an extrem ely high-ranked constraint. In English, on the other hand, that constraint is very low-ranked, as evidenced by five of the words in this sentence. Once phonologists determ ine which of these universal constraints are important for syllabification, plurals, and so on, in a particular langua ge, their ranking is determ ined by working backward from the paradigm s again. Exam ining the forms speakers actually use, the \"op timal\" for ms, allows you to deduce which of your constraints are the m ost dominant, which are m iddle-ranked (com ing into 66 play only to decide between two for ms that both satisfy a m ore dom inant constraint), and which are very weak ( only \"winning out\" and appearing in actual speech in th e absence of any com petition with stronger constraints ). Optim ality Theory (OT ) has worked spectacu larly well in phonolog y, perhaps because phonological ru les are a relatively circum scribed set, as there is a finite num ber of perturbations the hum an vocal tract can perf orm on sounds when they are combined with othe r sounds in words. OT is now being applied to syntax with a m ore lim ited degr ee of success, as th e universality of syntac tic ru les is still actively debated. For one com pilation of views, see Barbossa, et. al . Is The Best Good Enough? Optim ality and Competition in Syntax . A few studies have even applied OT to pragm atics, using Gri cean ru les for interaction, thou gh these innovations are recent and relatively specula tive. Bruce Hall's \"Grice, Discourse Representation, and Optim al Intonation\" is an exam ple of this new work. Using Optim ality Theory to help organiz e and m odel the inte raction of reader expectations is a productive addition to expect ation-based m odels of the reading process. OT's \"constraints\" ar e actually v ery sim ilar to Sc hauber & Spolsky's p reference rules; OT just adds th e benefits of a graphic m odel, which is easie r to inspect v isually and which allows both in teraction be twee n many different kinds of expecta tions and a greater degree of precision in the ranking and re-ranking of those expectations. 5.41 OT and reading an unreliable narrator As an example of how OT can help explain reading expectations at the level of genre, specifically, expectations about the reliab ility of the narrator of a 67 short story, consider W ayne Booth's \"relia ble narrato r\" rule. The re liable narrator rule can be seen as an expectation or c onstraint with two parts: one, that the narrator will provide the reader with all data relevant to understanding the progress of the story; two, th at th e narrato r's evalu ation of that data will b e truthful and helpful (Booth 67). These sound, in fact, a great deal like Grice's maxims of relevance, quality, and quant ity. As with Grice's m axims, Booth's principles are default expectations a nd m ay be violated in order to produce various effects in stories. Consider how an OT-type approach can be applied to the activity of re-readin g in \"The Garden of the Forking Paths\" by Jorge Luis Borges. This analysis refers to my own experience reading the story. The story is narrated by Yu Tsun, a Nazi spy. Here the constraints of my personal values interact with Booth's c onstraints on reliable narration; I cannot trust a Nazi spy. There is no textual reas on to think Tsun would lie to m e simply because h e is a Nazi sy mpathizer, but nevertheless, m y negative judgment abou t his political ethics infects hi s narrative ethics. While at the beginning of the story, I cannot locate Tsun's u nreliability specifi cally in his presentation of ir/relevant inform ation or in his m is/evaluation of th at inform ation (the two parts of Booth's \"Reliab le Narra tor\" con straint along with their n egativ e or \" unreliable \" valence s), my reading does reveal the exact disjunc t of my interpretive experience from Tsun's. Suspicious, I re-read everything he tells m e over his shoulder, so to speak. Tsun takes a desperate train ride in to the country, closely pursued by a British Insp ector, to f ind the one man w ho can help him communicate the loca tion 68 of a British airstrip to H itler' s forces in Be rlin. At the tra in stop he thin ks is h is, he asks some children on the p latform if he is at Ashgrove, and they tell him yes. After he gets down from the tr ain, th e following scene ensu es: A lam p lit the p latform, but the child ren's faces rem ained in a shadow. One of them asked m e: \"Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house? \" Without waiting for my a nswer, another said: \"The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossro ad.\" I threw them a coin (m y last), went down som e stone steps and st arted along a deserted road. (93) Children with shadowy faces who seem to know exactly what a com plete stranger is looking for\u2014this seem s danger ous to m e. W hy else would Tsun have mentioned it, unless it w ere relevant, unle ss it w ere going to com e back to haunt him later in the story? After all, I know my detective fiction. However, Tsun clearly evaluates the children as harm less and moves on without comm ent. In m y newfound distrust of Tsun, I re -evaluate the scene he has just presented m e and decide the children are a threat to Tsun, as depicted in Table 2. Table 2: Decision about Ts un's narration of children Relevant Info Reliable eval 9childr en a threa t to Tsu n * children not a threat *! My decision shows m e just what m y problem with Tsun as an unreliable narra tor is. Bef ore, the two crite ria, that a narrator m ust provide reliable access to relevant inform ation and should reliably gu ide my evaluation of that infor mation, were not ranked with respect to each ot her because they had not yet com peted 69 with each other in my reading experience. Now, however, th ey do com pete, an d my chosen interpr etation of the scene with the childr en reveals th at I rank relevance higher than evaluation in decidi ng whether or not to trust my narra tor; the solid vertical line between the constrai nts indicates this cr ucial ranking. If I believed Tsun's assessm ent that the children were irrelevant to his m ission in the long run, then I would have to admit he evaluated them reliably. But that would mean he took up m y attention with totally irrelevant charac ters at a pivotal junctu re in the story, and I cannot accept that in m y current nervou s state, wondering what Tsun's fate wi ll be at the very clim ax of the story. Tsun has viola ted the Gricean maxim of Rel evance, l eaving m e no clues th at wo uld help me infer an ironic m eaning from his irrele vant attention to the shadowy children; they thus loom in the background, unresolve d and unrelated to any other action in the story. So, I choose to believe, against Tsun, that the children are relevant, that Tsun has not evaluated their threat corre ctly, and I read on waiting for them to reappear from a dark alley at a crucial m oment. They do not. The story ends with no further reference to the children and no evidence of any effe ct they m ight have had on the outcom e. If I had not done this exer cise in exam ining th e interaction of my expectations abou t Tsun' s reliability, I would have rem ained unaware of a key elem ent of my experience of Borges's story-telling. The children are not the only detail in Borges's story that seem s to lead nowhere, that proves irre levant to anticipating and understanding Tsun's m ission. But the story is, in the end, about a maze , the \"Garden of the Forking Paths.\" The ir relev ancies in the narration I encountered are like wrong 70 turns I took in the m aze, leading to dead ends. These \"wrong turns\" create a powerful atmosphere of disorientation, fr ustration, and foreboding that could not be constructed another way. This exercise illustrates just one way in which an OT-type analysis can help explicate blocka ges or re-interpretat ions in th e readin g process and help the relative strengths of interpretive expectations to em erge at the sam e time. 5.42 Strengths and weaknesses of O T This in terpretive decisio n about the reli ability of a narrator is a v ery sm all move in the incredibly co mplex activity of reading. Taken together, all the reading exp ectations in play at an y moment of reading (pragm atic, textual, personal, sociolinguistic, gene ric, etc.) describe the read er's current set toward or \"filter\" on m eanings arising f rom the text. This is the m ost prom ising aspect of OT as applied to reading the hoaxes\u2014the potential to recover from the immediate reade r respo nse to th e hoaxes a r anked \"f ilter\" of expectatio ns that bo th struc tures the individual reading process and provide s a set of comm on reading expectations at the tim e. A few caveats are in ord er with resp ect to the ad aptation of OT to reading hoaxes. First, OT provides a descrip tive m odel of hoax reading rather than a prescriptive or predictive one. T he pur pose of the m odel is to describe as completely as possible all of the expecta tions readers held in common when they tried to decide about the truth-value of a hoax. The m odel is testable, of course, against the f inal decisions readers m ade. If the model f ails to locate the \"d eciding factors\" in their readin g process es, all of the interpr etive conf licts 71 apparen t in the arch ived responses, then it m ust be edited u ntil an exp lanatory descrip tion is achieved. But the m odel itse lf does not predict if a particular hoax will o r will not be succ essful. The reason for this is that the expec tations tha t form the engine of the model are exp ectations about science news, not hoaxes. As an indirect project, one c ould apply the m odel to a pa rticular hoax to see if it satisfied readers' top expectations of a good science news story, but this would be a shaky prediction excluding key and uncontro llable facto rs in a hoax 's success such as its serendipitous tim ing with other similar sto ries in the news or with th e political clim ate at the tim e of the hoax's publication. OT works with historical judgm ents to open up the process of hoaxing for close exa mination. The conclusions that can be drawn from it pe rtain to the top-ranked reader expectations of science and why hoaxers cho se to rid icule read ers for thes e priorities. A second caveat follow s from the hi storic ity of the project. In the reading of the Borges story, I h ad access to my own mom ent-by-mom ent interpretation s during the reading pro cess. Th e reader resp onses to the nineteen th-centu ry hoaxes, on the other hand, are m ostly post hoc evaluations of the hoaxes' truth or falsehood. So, while OT is capable of modeling the reading process online, as demonstrated above, th e interp retive deci sions modeled in this project will be after-the-fact evaluations, due to cons traints in the historical data. A third poin t abou t the m ismatch of OT and reading the hoaxes\u2014OT as it is used in phonology assum es the universality of its constraints. As we have seen from the levels involved in reading, howev er, few if any can be universal. Yet , 72 some readin g constrain ts are shared by reading communitie s with som e comm on reading exp communities.\" While it is tem pting to say that some reading ex pecta tions, e specia lly th e lower- level linguistic and pragm atic expectati ons, likely hold up in an even broader arena, between comm unities, that is a probl em for future applic ation s of OT to literary reading. The present project w ill focus quite speci fically on reader expectations of the genre of popular science news and of ethnoscience. 5.5 Summary of methodology A m ethodology com bining rhetorical techniques for reconstructing the expectations of historical readers with an OT-ty pe fram ework for m odeling th e interactions of those expecta tions will enable this projec t in s everal specif ic ways. First, it will help m e achieve m y goal of treating in a detailed and rigorous fashion the question of how exactly the author s of the hoaxes m anipulated reader expectations to fool their readers. It w ill help m e account for the rhetorical effect of the hoaxes in term s of readers tran sform ing (and being transform ed by) their expectations of science and scien ce news. Hope fully, m odeling these transf ormations will als o allow m e to make a princip led contr ibution to the discussion of scientific genres by detaili ng th e specific rheto rical m oves an author makes when engaging readers in a hoax. Most importantly, my m ethodology will help m e recuperate from the historical da ta of contem porary reader responses a set of core expectations that 19th century readers m ay have pu t into play as they re ad scientific media hoaxes. 73 6. S UMMARY OF CHAPTERS In th is ch apter I have ou tlined des iderata for a new rhetor ical definition of a hoax as a rhetorical ev ent, rath er than a text. I have established an exigence for studying n ineteenth-cen tury scientific m edia hoaxes because they speak directly to current historical and methodological problem s in rhetoric of science and reade r-oriented c riticism of ninetee nth-centu ry literatu re. h ave also de tailed the expectation-based m ethodology to be used in answering questions of how the hoaxes fooled their readers and what kind of rhetorica l activities th e hoax ers were engaging their readers in. In Chapter Two, \"Poe's Hoaxing and the Construction of Re aderships ,\" I will put m y methodology to the test in an alyzing contem porary reactions to the hoaxes of Poe and his media rival Richard Adams Locke. I develop a prelim inary \"filter\" of ranked expectati ons held by antebellu m science newsreaders in 1835. A careful exam ination of the rhetorical process by which a hoax creates a double readership\u2014dupes and savants , reveals that Poe used hoaxes not just to dem onstrate his superiority but also to m aterialize a community of like-m inded savan \"illusion\" scien ce in favor of an epistemology of imagination. In Chapter Three, \"Tw ain and the Soci al Mechanics of L aughter,\" close exam ination of reader responses to \"The Petrified Man\" (1862) and Twain's other non-scientific hoaxes leads to changes to the filter of reader e xpectations in order to reflect changes in newsreading cultu re since 1835. Twain's comm entary on his 74 hoaxes offers new insights into the ps ychology of hoax reading\u2014specifically the power of attention and of reader agenda s in constructing belief or doubt. Twain's scien tific ho axing em erges as a spec ial social mechanics en gineered to produce laughter as an affir mation of self-deter mination\u2014engineered, also, to dem onstrate Twain's co nsiderab le authority o ver hi s readers. These findings encourage revision of traditional ch aracterizations of scien ce as an antisocial, e in Twain's work. Chapter Fou r, \"The Hoa xes of Dan De Quille\u2014 Building an d Def ending the W est,\" constitute the f nsive rheto rical ass essment of the miner and writer Dan De Quille (W illiam Wright). De Quille's hoaxing is unique in that he em braces both science and the power of popular scienc e writing , including hoaxes, to literally build worlds , to construct the state of Nevada and the ide a of the W est. Critica l of Eastern commercial app ropriations of Western resourc es, De Quille enthusia stically championed self -made scientists and engineers as the new folk heroes of the W est. In Chapter Five, \"The Mechanics of Hoaxing,\" based on the hoaxers' preoccupation with m achines , I propose the hoax as a rhetorical m achine that transform s public assumptions about science into awareness that scientif ic truths are constructing a new reality for nineteen th-century Am ericans. Then, I suggest extensions of a rhetorical m ethod ba sed on reader expectations\u2014including empirical studies of differences in co mposition strategies between experts and novices, and historical studies of gender in reading. In the Epilogue I analyze the Sokal hoax as yet another m ove in the construction of a tense relationship 75 between Am erican arts and science s in the m edia that beg an with the ninete enth- century scientific m edia hoaxes. 76 Chapter Tw o: Poe's Hoaxing and the Construction of Readerships Edgar Allan Poe is the ideal figure with which to begin any study of scientific hoaxing in Am erica. Scientif ically educated bey ond m any of his peers and a pioneer in the developm ent of at l east two genres that foreground scientific epistem ologies\u2014science fiction and dete ctive fiction\u2014he embodi es the tensions between the arts and s ciences in the Jacks onian era. His ho axes were p ublic acts meant to call attention to these ten sions, as the y were written on scien ce-related topics and carefully crafted and presente d in popular news m edia for particular reading audiences. His later two hoaxes, \"T he Facts in the Case of M. Valdem ar\" (1845) and \"Von Ke mpelen and His Discovery\" (1849) dealt with the psychological sciences, what are now de emed \"pseudosciences\": m esmerism and alchem y. But whose s tructure encapsulated a striking argum ent a bout r eality, an argum ent Poe also m akes in Eureka : that we should \"put faith in dream s as the only realities\" (1). P oe asked with his technological hoaxes: What wa s truer, or m ore real\u2014that som ething actua lly exis ted and worked in the world, or tha t it could exist and work? Or, as 77 Poe him self stated the case in his def ense of his hoax \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdem ar\": \"if the story was not true ...it should have been\" (Ljungquist 204). Poe developed this argum ent about reality through hi s hoaxing practices and the peculiar relationships with reality and readership that hoaxing enjoins. H e and Richard Ada ms Loc ke, through the com petition of their moon hoaxes in the Eastern m edia in 1835, innovated the genr e of the scientific m edia hoax in America. B oth writers baite d their hooks with a cluster of rhetorical lures that mimicked the popular science reports their readers were accustom ed to encountering in alm ost every newspaper and m agazine. Poe, particularly, was explicit about what he thought his reader s expected from a science report; he discussed th ese reader expect ations several tim es in di fferent form ats dating from the overshadowing of his firs t hoax by Locke's hoax. By intuiting and then re- perform ing his readers' expectations about how science was read, Poe m anaged to hoax a good percentage of his readers in at least two of his four attem pts. He did this f or several purpos es: first, to demonstrate his creativ e authority over his reade rs eve n to the point of alter ing thei r realities ; secon d, to cr iticize those readers for their adm iration and f unding of professional scientists instead of professional artists; thirdly, to reveal the vulnerability of purely inductive, Baconian science and thereby lay th e groundwork for his own im aginative epistem ology, outlined in Eureka ; and fourth, to m aterialize a community of fellow geniu ses sym pathetic to Eurek a's epistem ology. Because o f his explicit attention to what m akes a ho ax work, Poe's hoaxing practices offer an ideal opportunity to test the m ethodol ogy laid out in the 78 previous chapter\u2014using cont emporary reader responses to elicit and structure a \"filter\" of reading expe ctations th at Po e's read ers m ight have held in common when com ing to his hoaxes. First, howev er, it is im portant to establish how Poe learn ed science and the convention s of wr iting it for a lay audience. After th at, we will exa mine the com petition betw een Poe's \"Hans edia and the various reactions to the hoaxes in order to glean readers' expectations of a \"true\" popular science report; as part of this p roject, we will also consider th e rhetoric of the popular sc ience article at the time as another source of conventions th at readers cam e to expect. Using7 Optim ality Theory, I will attem pt to m odel how these expe ctations in teracted and competed with each o ther in producing eith er belief or doubt in the m oon hoaxes. Then, I will extend the m ethod to e xamine the rest of Poe's hoaxes and, based on reader reactions to them, to m ake change s to the filter of antebellu m reader expectations for science news. After a discussion of the ways in which a rhetorical m ethodology solves problem s that have plagued Poe hoaxing scholarship\u2014particularly problem s with understanding his choice of hoaxing when constructing relationships with his public, I will con clude by co nnectin g Poe's hoaxing to his scientific epistem ology in Eureka and suggesting that both projects reveal Poe gesturing toward community. 1. O VERVIEW OF POE'S SCIENTIFIC AND RHETOR ICAL ACCULTURATION This sectio n considers how Poe cam e to know science as a cultu ral practice. According to Roland Barth es, who analyzed the \"structuration\" of a Poe hoax in depth, Poe internalized, through lear ning to read and write about science, 79 a \"cultural code ...the code of knowledge, or rath er of hum an knowledge, public opinion, of cultu re as tran smitted through b ooks, education, and in a m ore general, m ore diffuse wa y, through all social ity\" (Barthes 94 ). W e will return to Barthes's particular structuring of this notion of code after exam ining the m edia through which Poe acclim ated him self to sc ientific culture and its popular rhetoric. Certain ly, Poe's excellent prim ary edu cation played a crucial role in th e developm ent of his scientific rheto ric\u2014particula rly in terms of how to cope with an audience. Under the aegis of his foster father, John Allan, Poe was educated in excellent private schools both in England and Am erica. From the age of about seven to the age of 11, Poe studied Frenc h, Latin, history, and literature at the Manor House School in Stoke-Newington outside London (Quinn 71). When his family returned to the United States in 1820 after a business venture of Mr. Allan's fell through, P oe was enrolled in Joseph Clarke's private school in Richm ond. He stud ied more class ical langu ages here; from tuition b ills and letters from Clarke, we know Poe was reading Horace's O des and Cicero's De Officiis (and likely De Oratore ) in Latin, and H omer in Greek. By the age of 16, Poe was fluent in French, dexterous in Latin, and trium phant in speech competition s with his classm ates (Quinn 83- 84). W hile reading Cicero and copying and \"capping \" Latin verses likely am ounted to his o nly form al rhetorical training at this point, his studies undoubt edly acquainted him with the classical structure of argum ents and techniques for persuading audiences. The sciences, even natural philosophy or theology, were not part of a traditional prim ary 80 education at this tim e. They were m ore advanced stud ies reserv ed for the university. Poe entered the University of Virginia in 1826, and though he got him self kicked out for gam bling by Dece mber of that year, he nonetheless distinguished himself in his course of modern and cl assical languages (Qui nn 109). His library card revea ls that he ch ecked out m any hi story texts in addition to works by Voltaire and Byron. Although Poe was not enrolled in any rhetoric classes and left behind no evidence of having checked out or bought any rhetoric texts, he was active in a debating society at the uni versity, which ind icates th at his interest in argum entation, in engaging and persuadi ng an audience to his point of view, had not waned (Quinn 104). Susan Booker Welsh in her dissertation Edgar Allan Poe and the Rhetoric of Science argues that George Cam pbell's Philosophy of Rhetoric was the prim ary rhetoric text in Am erican colleges from 1800-1850, and that Poe m ust have read it. Although ther e is no direct evidence of this, W elsh cites as circ umstantia l evidence Poe's review of Leigh Hunt's Im agination and Fancy that is very Cam pbellian in tenor, overa ll, as it criticizes Hunt for his purely inductive model that excludes speculati on, which Poe believed was the duty of literary philosophers as public truth-m akers (Welsh 90, 111). W hatever his actual indebtedness to Ca mpbell m ight be, Poe openly em ployed many of the principles of faculty psychology in Poe's Dupin ta les and in his Philoso phy of Composition (Welsh 231). And, fa mously, Poe tout s the \"faculty\" of intuition and the imagination over syllog istic log ic in Eureka (17). Rather more crucial for the purposes of explaining Poe's hoaxing practi ces is the possible Ca mpbellian legacy 81 of a stochastic m odel of belief. Poe r ecognized that belief, for his readers, was not a m atter of positive dem onstration, but a m atter of likelihood. This m ay explain his repeated emphasis, in his rhetorical analysis of Locke's \"Moon- Hoax,\" on scientif ic detail as the most important factor in m aking a hoax seem probable, an d therefore accep table, to the reader. Although Poe's form al education ende d with his withdrawal from the University of Virginia, Poe still read widely , especia lly in scienc e, which monopolized his read ing and writin g atten tions even from this early period. He published A l Aaraaf , Tamerlane and Minor Poem s in 1829, and the first poem in the collection was the \"Sonnet\u2014To Science. \" Traditionally viewed as an early expression of Poe's antipathy toward c ontem porary Baconian inductive science, there is resident in the poem , however, an inkling of the fascination with science\u2014especially m athematics, astronom y, m echanics, cryptography, and psychology\u2014that would dictate Poe's choice of topics f or the re st of his writing career. In the sonnet P oe concludes that science has \"torn from me/The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree\" (Poe et\" 771 -72). W hile this im age amplifies the them e developed in th e rest of the poem of the dam age science has done to the arts, another m eaning lies very close to the su rface: Poe cannot leave science alone. It enthralls him , it disturbs his r est. One m ight antic ipate from this very early sentim ent what Poe ind eed goes on to a ttempt in Eureka \u2014a reconciliation between science and im agina tion, the two forces that lay claim to Poe's intelle ctual lif e. 82 Rather than continuing along th is vein, how ever, and winding up psychoanalyzing Poe's predilections for sc ience and technology, this project, due to its focus on conventions of readi ng popular science, requires instead an exam ination of the scientific clim ate in which Poe read an d wrote in the 1830s and 1840s. In Barthes 's words once m ore, we will now survey for antebellum American science \"the c ode of knowledge, or rather of hum an knowledge, public opinion, of cultu re as transm itted...in a m ore general, m ore diffuse way, through all so ciality.\" 1.1 Science in antebellum America In Chapter One we dis cussed the most general cultural forces affect ing scientific culture in the Jacksonian pe riod. Principal am ong these was a feedback loop of desire between professionalizing scientists and the lay public, driven by both an urgent desire for new technologies and an equally urgent need for funding and public support. W hen consid ering Poe' s scientific accu lturation, ho wever, we must focus m ore closely on th e lac unae that were developing between professional and lay reader s and between professional scien tific and artis tic communitie s. As Judith Yaross Lee put th e situation in her cas e stu dy of the \"Fossil Feud\" between paleontologists Ed ward Drinker Cope and Othniel Marsh later in the century, \"the role of the lay public in nineteenth-century science shifted from partic ipant to spectator\" (Lee \"Fossil\" 3). The public was co nstantly hungry for news of what was going on be hind closed study doors and on distant expeditions. Poe's hoaxes addressed the l ack of public sc ientific inf ormation and the widening divide between the professi onal conditions of scientists and artists, 83 and they did this by exploiting \"bridging\" institutions that w ere already trying to redress these im balances: specifically, technology\u2014especially as commodified in advertisem ents in the popular press, \"scien tific\" spectacles like those in Barnum 's American Museum , mesmerism and othe r \"pseudosciences,\" and scientific treatis es and articles written for general audiences . The popular m edia did its best to satisfy its readers' desires for science. Newspapers were filled with bom bastic announcem ents of scientific trium phs: \"The Annihilation of Space!\" gush ed the 4 June 1844 Ne w York Herald over Morse's invention of the telegraph. Si gnificantly, the papers were also packed with adver tisem ents trumpeting the late st in pills, galvanic rings, lam ps, and even hydraulics that, for installm ents of mere pennies, could revolutionize the subscriber's lifestyle. Via the technology m arket, sc ience was sold, and thus reconciled, to the lay pu blic as a commodity. This m ercenary connection between science, publics, and art m ade spectacle as much a part of science duri ng this period as research was. Swiss naturalist L ouis Agassiz at tracted much of his funding through his im pressive colle ction s of exotic stuf fed species of anim als from all ov er the world , and he was not the only scien tist to walk wide-e yed prospective investors down aisles of stuffed peacocks and to rtoises (Miller \"Pol itical\" 102). It is little wonder, then , that P.T. Barnum 's collection of freaks of nature in his Am erican Museum in Boston could flourish during the m iddle of th e century and, yet, still be counted \"scien tific\" by a distin guished natural sc ientist like Spencer Baird, him self a veteran peacock-stuffer (Betts 357). Clearly, not only technology, but also 84 experim ental science, w ere fully on th e Am erican m arket in the 1830s and 1840s and were nsidered entertai nment as well as a comm odity. This conflation of science and spectacl e also created a space for play in the public sector for what are now consider ed pseudosciences, but what were then becom ing known as \"social sciences\": m agnetism (mesmerism ) and phrenology in particular. The public life of m esmerism is of the greatest in terest to us, since Poe used it as the topic of his hoax, \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdem ar.\" A more detailed discussion of Poe's education in this field app ears in the an alysis of that ho ax in section five of this ch apter. However, a few co mments are pertinent here. One important observation, given our anachronistic perspective, was that mesmerism was one of the best-reputed of the \"pseudosciences\" because the hypnotic trance was a real phenom enon and m esmerists' claim s about the m yriad effects of the body's m agnetic fields were unfalsifiable at that tim e in m edical history; also, m esmerism ha d no serious competitors in term s of explanato ry theories of the subconscious. Consequently, the American Journal of Science , Benjam in Sillim an's well-r espected Yale general rnal regular ly featured articles on m esmerism along with m ore standard reports of discoveries in chem istry, geology, and physics. Mesm erism , like medicine during this tim e, was a sc ience w ith m any la y practitioners. Therefore, it helped create a sens e of c ontinuity between Am erican public life and the increasingly rarified comm unities of science. In add ition to this lia ison m esmerism built betwee n the more elite sc ientif ic comm unities an d the lay public, it forged a second connecti on between Am erican science and daily 85 American life. Pseudosciences like m esmerism earned a great deal of their credib ility v ia their hu manitarian aim s. Their practitioners preach ed them as efficacious for the im provem ent of hum an relatio ns and livin g condition s, matters of real con cern to antebellum Am erican s confronted daily with the social problem s of slavery and of industrializa tion, with its attending abuse of wom en and imm igrants. Allying itself with the other budding \"soc ial sciences\" of psychology, fe minism, and sociology, m esmerism ai med at social reform (Stoehr 27). It applied scientific principles to the prediction of behavior; it of fered an illusion of some kind o f control ov er th e bewildering arr ay of motivations and styles of personal interac tion that were com ing into contact (and conf lict) with each other d uring th e population exp losion of the Jacksonian era. W ith this innate appeal of social con trol working to its advantag e, mesmerism and \"other equally delicious ism[s ],\" as Poe deem ed them while lam pooning their proliferation in Eureka (44), constitu ted a serious a ttempt at reconciling the e nces with the the average working Am erican. Acknowledgi ng the bridging f unction of practices like m esmerism is vital to understanding Poe's hoaxing. Ever a lover of the liminal, Poe recognized the power of the \"ism s\" to tap into the sym pathies of his readers; thu s, he cho se mesmerism and alchemy as engines ideally suited to driving hom e the effect of his last two hoaxes, \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdem ar,\" and \"Von Kem pelen and His Discovery.\" Poe also availed him self of the last \"bridge\" to appear between popular and elite scientif ic cultu re\u2014the rapidly in creasing num ber of pages in the literary 86 weeklies and m onthlies (and, beginning in 1835, the penny press) devoted to science and technology news. The innovati on of the penny press m erits deeper discussion in the following section with respect to Locke's \"Moon Hoax,\" but Poe's other period ical s cience reading can be surveyed briefly here. Poe clearly read Sillim an's Journ al, but he a lso dem onstrated f amiliarity with th e scien ce news in the Hom e Journal and Evert Duykinck's Literary World , both magazines meant for the general reader (Poe \"Von Kempelen\" 608 ). Special \"general knowledge\" m agazines had even developed during Poe's lifetim e for instructional use in the h ome. The Fam ily Mag azine , founded in 1833, published articles on the geology of earthquakes and volcanoes ne xt to poetry for the fam ily to read together. Editors clearly recognized that th e public thirst for science in the m edia could not lo nger be satisf ied by the rapidly sp ecializing s cientif ic com munities, and so a popular genre of \"science wri ting\" gradually developed, with som e papers and m agazines actually beginning to retain a science writer on staff. According to Carolyn D. Hay's study of the founding of the National Association of Science W riters, antebellum newspapers covered a range of scien tific top ics mirrored e, exploration, aviation...,\" with technology receiv ing by far the m ost press (Hay 5 ,9). Scientists them selves realized the popular press was stepping in where they had stepped out, and som e were tr oubled b y the resu lting m isinform ation of the public. Joseph Henry com plained to a friend, \"In this country, our newspapers are filled with the puffs of quackery and every man who can burn phosphorous in 87 oxygen and exhibit a few experi ments to a class of young la dies is called a m an of science\" (Bruce 72). But even if they fe lt som e responsibility for the \"quackery\" running rampant in the papers, few scientis ts were willing to write for the public on a regular basis (Bruce 118). It required tim e they sim ply did not feel they had. A few scientists perha ps even enjoyed tread ing the f ine line tha t separa ted scien tific fact from fantasy in th e public gaz e. It is a p ersistent rumor, f or instance, that French astronom er Jean-N icolas Nicollet helped Richard Ada ms Locke craft the details of his \"Moon Ho ax\" in 1835. After the Civil War, Dr. William Osler, Professo r of Medicine at John s Hopkins, en tertained him self by sending hoax m edical reports, usually sexu al in tenor, to prestigious m edical journals through his alter ego Dr. Egert on Yorrick Davis (Boese). Though hoaxes by scientists in this c entury are r are, the Sokal Hoax, which will be tre ated in the last chapter of this dissert ation, is a notable exception. This br ief survey of the scien tific life of America in the Jacksonian pe riod leaves us with the sens e that even if Poe had r estricted his scientif ic curiosity as a reade r entirely to the popular pres s and the cou rt of \"public opinion\" as Barthes would term it\u2014Lyceum science lectures, advertisem ents and news about mesmerism and other scientific wonde rs, and the daily innovations in transportation and com munication\u2014he would have had an im pressive scientific education. However, Poe further so ught out and eagerly dev oured th e writings of European scientists in Am erican reprin t. Especially interesting, both for the purposes of considering his hoaxes and for appreciating the bread th of Poe's scientific curiosity, are Po e's readings of the work s of astronom er Sir John 88 Herschel and chem ist Sir Hum phrey Davy, the journals of the balloonist Monck Mason, the m athematics of Pierre Lapl ace, and the travel narratives and cosm ology of Alexander Hum boldt. Poe al so consulted older works by Kepler, Newton, and Bacon in writing Eureka . And, he arm ed himself with the natural philosophy of the Germ an and English Romantic schools, including Kant and Byron and, most powerfully, the rhetoric of Coleridge in the Biographia Literaria , which figured centrally in Poe's Philosophy of Com positio n and the Rationale of Verse (Hoffm an 86-87). From these last works he inherited the war between science and art that he would struggle to m ediate throughout his literary career, beginning with \"A Sonnet\u2014To Science, \" intensifying in the writing of his hoaxes, and culm inating in Eureka . The influences of these scientific and technological authors and others will be exa mined more close ly as ea ch of Poe's hoaxes is co nsidered in turn. But even a sam pling im press es the reader with the res ources available to som eone like Poe, who had a good education, a sm all amount of m oney, and wished to learn about science in the 1830s and 1840s. However, neit her m oney, nor breeding, nor education guaranteed a working knowledge of the m ost basi c of scientific principles, or so lam ented an essay by C. L. Barritt in the 22 February 1845 edition of the Poe-edited Broadway Journal entitled \" Why Are Not the Sc iences Better Understood?\" Barritt compla ins in his essay that th e cultured \"young gentlem en\" of the day did not even know \"why t hey are warm er in a woolen blanket than in a cotton one of equal weight...or why a white ha t is cooler than a b lack on e\" (115 ). He lays some of the blam e for this r egrettable state of scie ntific ignorance on the 89 American prim ary education system ; howev er, Barritt m ore squarely indicts the characters of these gentlem en, na mely their laziness and fondness for the opera, fashion, and the rom ance novel over a little serious reading that would be \"of more credit of the person, than being able to correct a false step at a cotillion\" (116).6 Poe had certainly had an uppe r-class acculturation th rough John Allan's family. But whether because of that upbri nging or in spite of it\u2014since after he lost the post John Allan got for him at W est Point, he had almost nothing further to do with the Allan s\u2014Poe seemed to take his own science education very seriously. As evidenced by his reading and, in his early writing, by the copious scientific details of observation and na vigation weighing down even such an un- scien tific story as \"MS Found in a Bo ttle,\" P oe was co mmitted to the weird hybridizatio n required in the writin g of sc ience between text on the one hand, and the an ti-textuality of imm ediate sen sory perception and m easurem ent on the other. Indeed, if \"MS Found in a Bottle\" does not in fact begin autobiographically, it could have, as Poe would say: Of m y country and of my fam ily I have little to say. Il l usage and length of years have driven m e from the one, and estranged m e from the other. 6 The negativ e implicatio ns of Barritt's cr iticism are c lear: Barritt doe s not mention educating the w orking classes or wom en about science. W ith a few notable exceptions, like astronom er Mari a Mitchell, wom en were not publicly recognized in the m edia as participants in science (Bois). W hile upper class laym en were not participants either, exact ly, they were at least educated to be spectators by the general science journa ls and other popular m edia. W omen and the working classe s were written into the sto ry of Am erican science in the decades bef ore the Civ il War only as patien ts and subjec ts. T he advent of the penny press in 1835, which aim ed below the uppe r class belt, altere d this situation slightly by assum ing wom en, laborers, and imm igrants as readers of its sensational s cientif ic articles. 90 Hereditary wealth afforded m e an education of no common order, and a contem plative turn of m ind enabled me to methodize the stores which early study very diligently garnered up.\u2014Beyond all things, the study of the Germ an m oralists gave m e great delight; not from any ill-advised admiration of their eloquent m adness, but from the ease with which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their falsities...Indeed, a strong relish for physical philosophy has, I fear, tinctured m y mind with a very common error of this age\u2014I mean the habit of referring occurrences, even the least sus ceptible of such reference, to the principles of that science. (Poe \"MS\" 148) The story goes on to relate a horrible sea adventur e both very supernatural and unscien tific. But Poe rem ained co mmitted throughout h is writings to finding that place where \"physical philosop hy\" broke d own and i magination to ok over, and m arking that spot with words that pa rtook of the traditions of both science and art. Poe was certainly not unique for hi s tim e in his ded ication to bo th the ar ts and the sciences: Em erson's study of natura l history has been detailed in depth by Lee Rust Brown; Taylor Stoehr has doc umented Hawthorne's fascination with nascent social sciences like phrenology; and Melville's preoccupations with industrial and m arine science and technol ogy are m anifest in stories like Moby Dick and \"T he Paradise of Bachelors and th e Tartaru s of Maids.\" However, Poe was unique in taking the failure envelope\u2014t he lin e at which the stress between art and science becam e too m uch, where words failed to describ e experien ce, experience f ailed to adh ere to sc ientific principle, and wor ds and s cience and 91 experience all failed to reliab ly yield wh at was true\u2014as the guiding arc for his thinking and writing life. Neither was Poe content to wrestle with these fractures alone. Through the hoax he coerced h is readers in to experi encing those problem s in a unique way. Poe lashed out at his read ers through his hoaxes for cr eating a society h e wanted to succeed in and could not, a society th at m ade m oney its end-all-be-all and valued \"dull realities,\" as he expre ssed it in \"Sonnet\u2014To Science,\" over what could be (H offman 185). It galled Poe that he could barely m ake ends m eet, that publishers and booksellers rout inely abused writers like him while scientists (from his perspective) raked in governm ent and private funding for their technological and m edical inventions (Dinius 2). To those readers he m anaged to dupe with his hoaxes, then , Poe communicated for at leas t a few m oments the discom fort he felt living in the \"reality \" of an America comm itted to what scien ce could do and buy, not the poss ibilities science afforded th e im agination for apprehending the true core of the world. This is a powerf ul motivation, ind eed, for choosing the hoax as a means of criticizing the ascendancy of professionalized B aconian s cience in America. For a m edium for this comm unication, Po e naturally gravitated toward the penny press\u2014a place where science ne ws was not only read by a greater percentage of the population than any other journal (judging from subscription rates ), but where scien ce was also sold on a daily basis, in tonics, divining rods, and furnaces. The penny press was the paper crossroads where all the paths that Poe followed cam e together: professiona l and lay, educated and uneducated, 92 scien tific an d supernatu ral, analy tic and poetic, public and private. There was not a better m edium for a scientific hoax. 2. T HE CONTEST BETWEEN \"HANS PHAA LL\" AND LOCK E'S \"MOON EXPECTATI ONS Poe's first attem pt at a hoax is a con fusing one to begin with, because it is uncertain if Poe even meant \"Hans Phaall\u2014 A Tale\" to be taken as a news report of a journey to the moon when it cam e out in the June 1835 edition of the Southern Literary Messenger , which he was then editing for owner Thom as H. White. Later, Poe would claim that it was both a \"hoax\" and a \" jeu d'esprit ,\" both that it was m eant to fool its reader s, and that it coul d not have, given its \"tone of m ere banter\" (Poe \"Note to ' Hans Phaall' \" 69). The sto ry concerns a burgher of Rotterdam , one Hans Phaall, w ho constructs a ball oon and sails to the moon in order to escape creditors. Along the wa y, Phaall pioneers an air compressor to help him breath e in space a nd ex perim ents with the reac tions of a cat to the vacuum betwe en the earth and the m oon. The moon itse lf is ap parently inhabited by dwarf-like people, or so re ports a letter f lown back to Rotte rdam from the moon in the sam e balloon four years later. Poe clearly intended to continue the tale, elabora ting on the moon inhabitants, but Locke's \"Moon Hoax\" stole his thunder, as will be seen shortly . While much of the language of \"Hans Phaall\" is little shor t of goofy, in keeping with its or iginal subtitle, \"A Tale,\" the opening of Poe's first attem hoax sounds newsy enough: By late acco unts from Rotterdam that ci ty seem s to be in a singularly hig h state of philosophical excitem ent. In deed phenom ena have there occurred of a nature so com pletely unexpected, so entirely novel, so utterly at 93 variance with pre-conceived opinions, as to leave no doubt on m y mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all Physics in a fer ment, all Dyna mics and Astronomy together by th e ears. (Poe \"Han s Phaall--a Ta le\" 565) As will be a pparent whe n we exam ine the f orm of science r eports at this time more carefully, this opening actually conform s rem arkably well to reader expectations of true science discoveries. Ho wever, at least four thing s in addition to the title o f the story were alre ady working against Poe if he expected Phaall to be taken seriously as an aer onaut. The tone of \"together by t he ear s\" is off, and Poe has given his byline to the sto ry, a practice more typic al of litera ry tha n news writing at th is jun cture in the h istory of America n journa lism. In additio n, Poe's literary reputation am ong Southern readers at this point was sh aped largely by the award-winning \"MS Found in a Bottle,\" a hor rifying and obviously fanciful tale of a phantom voyage, published in the Baltimore Visiter in 1833. Finally, the editorial introduction to this issue of the SLM by Edward V. Sparkhawk claim s that \"Hans P haall\" \"will add m uch to [Poe 's] reputation as an imaginative write r\" even as he notes out of the other side of his quill th at in the days of frequent and well-publicized experiments in balloon av iation, \"a journey to the m oon m ay not be considered a m atter of m ere moonshine\" (Thom as 160). As m ight be expected af ter this cav iling introduction, there was no serious debate over the truth of \"Hans Phaall. \" Dwight Thom as and David Jackson in The Poe Lo g list nine notices of the story, an d all of them focus on the hum or of the piece, not its pos sibility. The Charleston Daily Courier praised \"the 94 minuteness of detail, which properly belongs to truth\" in the story but went on to deem it \"one of the m ost exquisite speci mens of blended humor and science that we have ever perused\" (161-162). Poe mentions two reviews in a letter to Thom as W hite that focus on the opening as the weakness of th e piece [Poe Letters 65]. Indeed, as the story unfolds, it sounded very little like a news story. As Phaall's strange m akeshift balloon desce nds from the sky over Rotterdam , Poe fram es the Dutch resp onse in a m anner that contrasts sharply with both the relatively matter-of-fact langua ge of the first paragraph of the story and with the parade of scientific m inutiae about P haall's balloon a few colum ns later: What could it be? In th e nam e of a ll the vrows and devils in Rotterdam , what could it possibly portend? No one knew \u2014no one could im agine\u2014 no one, not even the burgom aster M ynheer Superbus Von Underduk, had the slightest clue by which to unravel the m ystery: so, as nothing m ore reasonab le could be done, every one to a m an replaced his p ipe carefully in the left corner of his mouth, and, cocking up his right eye towards the phenom enon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly\u2014 then \"Hans Phaall\u2014A Tale\" 565) Strange language indeed for a news re port. Poe acknowledged his critics' negative reaction to the \"tone of m ere banter \" in the ta le; he believ ed, in f act, tha t the hum orous tone of \"Hans Phaall\" was the principal reason it did not fly as a hoax (Poe Literati: Richard Adam s Locke 160). Accordingly, he tuned the language of his future hoaxes to a m ore news y resonance. However, in spite of its 95 initial fizzling, \"Hans Phaall's\" public care er was just beginning. It got a kick start from another fantastical m oon story that appeared jus t two m onths late r in the brand new penny daily the New York Sun . Before the second m oon hoax is consid ered, a digression is in order to explain the place of the Sun in the reading life of antebellum New York. Founded in 1833 by Benjam in Day, the Sun was the harbinger of what would be term ed the \"penny press\"; it was a single sheet folded to four pages and sold for a penny, containing, in addition to the usual copious advertisem ents, news item s appealing especially to the working class and new i mmigrants, its target demographic (Fedler 68). The Sun contained notices of all th e sorts of things that still m ake up the bulk of conversations at coffee s hops and street corners: fires, accidents, the daily police blotter, spect acles and scientif ic wonders on display at local museum s, and even humorous recitals of domestic disputes and other \"hum an interest\" sto ries. Thes e quotidian topics actually constituted a radical departure from the reading m aterial New Yorkers p reviously had at their dispo sal. The literary weeklies, which cost six cents in stead of a penny, w ere alm ost all owned by political organizations that filled th eir pages with political news and party propaganda. The penny paper's low price and gossipy m aterial aligned it with the Jacksonian dem ocratic spir it in general and with the working class and immigrants in par ticular. New York Herald edito r James Gordon Bennett trum peted in the pages of his penny daily: \"I feel m yself in this land to b e engaged in a great caus e--the cause of truth, public faith, and science against falsehood, fraud, and ignorance\" (N elkin 85). He had some ju stification for his 96 claim to being the paper of \"public f aith\" becaus e of the sheer num ber of people who read the penny dailies. Frank L uther Mott argues in Amer ican Journalism : A History that the 1830s saw m ore Am erican news readers than ever with an influx of imm igrants who took their voting righ ts se riously and read the papers f or politica l information; with pub lic educatio n squashing illiteracy to 9% or less and creating an ever-g rowin g percentag e of wom en readers ;7 and, with advancem ents in the m aterial conditions of reading as sim ple as be tter lighting in hom es and streets (303). So, the penny press ha d a broad-based low er-and-m iddle class audience who were in terested in info rmation both for entertainm ent and for political use. The New York Sun had on staff a science write r, one of the few at the time, na med Richard Adam s Locke. Benjam in Day had hired him to cover the trail of the infa mous cult leader Matthias the Prophet. Locke's skillful handling of the bizarre m etaphysical and religious elem ents of the story put the S un ahead of its rival penny dailies, Bennett's Herald and the New York Transcript , in subscriptions. So, after that Locke wa s em ployed to cover topics of general interest in th e sciences a nd philosop hy especia lly for the Sun (Locke Moon Hoax xxxi). 7 Sandra Harding claim s the industria l revolution had the opposite effect on the woman reader\u2014that it kept her out of all serious centers of policy-m aking because the industrial econom y construc ted her as less p roductive of m arket goods, and therefore less valuable. C onsequently, her education was not a priority. However, Mott and Harding ar e not n ecessarily arg uing incom mensurate points; it is feasible that wom en could be educated well enough to read the penny dailies but m ight still b e excluded f rom the elite litera ry and On 21 August 1835, a blurb appear ed on page two of the Sun claim ing that Sir John Herschel, who was known to most news read ers to be engaged in observations in South Africa with his new telescope, had m ade som e remarkable discoveries. There was nothing further for four days, and then, on the front page of the 25 August Sun , after an ed itorial note advising reade rs tha t the f ollowin g story was reprinted from the Edinburgh Journal of Science , minus most of the \"more abstruse and m athem atical parts\" of the discovery, the story commenced: In this unusual addition to our Journal, we have the happiness of making known to the British public, a nd then ce to the whole civilized world, recen t discoveries in Astronomy which will build an i mperishable monum ent to the age in which w e live, and confer upon the present generation o f the hum an race a prou d distinction through all future tim e. It has been poetica lly said, tha t the stars of h eaven are the hereditary regalia of man, as the intellectual s overeign of the anim al creation. H e may now fold the Zodiack around him with a loftier consciousness of his mental suprem acy. (Locke Moon Hoax 7) After som e prelim inary reflections on the wonders of astronomy, the story went on to detail how the lens for He rschel's telescope was ground, how it was transported to South Africa and the obser vatory assem bled, how the problem of insufficient lighting was overcom e, etc., to an alm ost overwhelm ingly technical degree. The next day the Sun ran the colum ns reveali ng w hat readers had been waiting for: the m oon bison, m an-bats, m oon poppies, and m oon beavers that Herschel had glim psed t hrough his telescope. The paper sold 19,360 copies, the 98 largest circulation of any paper ever in Am erica (Locke Moon Hoax vii). The series went on for a we ek, and the reac tion of the com peting m edia was alm ost perfectly divided. Of th e major New York newspapers surveyed by Orm ond Seavey in his 1975 ed ition of Locke's stor y, six cam e out in supp ort of th e Herschel report, three stayed on the fence, and five criti cized it, although m ost of the negative responses were indirect or ir onic, perhaps hedging strategies just in case a confirm ation from Herschel cam e through. Two of the critical papers, the Journal of Comm erce and the Herald , suggested that the w hole thing was a hoax; the Journal of Commerce even conn ected Richard Adam s Locke's nam e with th e story, on the strength of a \"confession\" by Locke to a Commerce reporter in a pub. Jam es Gordon Bennett attacked Locke's character in a Herald editorial, intim ating aristocratic di ssolution involving a cham bermaid. Locke's only public response to any aspect of the brouhaha was to take the moral high ground in a defense of his good nam e (Locke Moon Hoax xvi). Bennett and the other editors then proceeded with a more indirect tone for the duration of the two-week m edia debate following the appearance of the st ory. A rum or cropped up that scientists from Yale had taken a train up to New York to consult with Locke about the story but had to return unsatisfied; the rumor, though repeated of ten in histories of the hoax, rem ains unsubstantiated (Locke Moon Hoax xiii). Whatever people m ay have finally de cided about the \"Moon Hoax,\" it was the first m ajor hoax of its kind (Roggenkam p), and it fooled a good percentage of New Yorkers at first\u2014educated people like clergy and scientists as well\u2014 accord ing to Locke's co ntem porary Benson Lossing in his History of New York 99 City (Moss 87). Another contem porary, Britis h writer Ha rriet Mar tineau, said she encountered on her 1835 visit to the Northeas tern states an atm osphere of al most complete credulity surrounding the hoax, w ith very few exceptions. She defended American readers, however, by claim ing that the \"Moon Hoax\" would have gone even f urther in Europe, since she deem ed the quality of scienc e education in American com paratively high (22-23). People either believed o r suspected Locke's story; parodies imm ediately flourished in the Herald and elsew here, but nothing was certain except for the Sun's subscription figures. Locke's unwitt ing accom plice in the hoax, Sir John Herschel, did not find out about the hoax unt il four m onths later, and his reaction evinced an appreciation of the hum an imagination that even Poe would have approved: Herschel claim ed in a letter to the American captain who brought him a clipp ing of the hoax that it was a \"perpe tual rem inder how trivia l are the discoveries which all our boasted science has yet revealed or is [likely?] to reveal for ages to com e in comparison of wh at exists unknown and unsuspected am ong the realities of nature\" (1). Locke h imself claimed ex po st facto that he had me ant his story as a satire of the fa mous astr onom er Thom as K. Dick's bizarre with m oon-beings through geom etric shapes; howev er, in view of how the report was taken, Locke felt it was an \"abortive satir e... and in either case I am the best self-hoaxed m an in the whole community\" (Locke Celebrated \"Moon Story\" 30). 100 Edgar Allan Poe, on the other hand, m ade up his m ind al most imm ediately about the hoax. In a letter to editor John Kennedy date d less than two weeks after the \"Moon Hoax\" finished its run in the Sun , Poe accused Locke of plagiarism : Have you seen the \"Discoveries in the Moon\"? Do you not think it altogether suggested by Hans Phaall ? It is very singu lar, \u2014 but when I first purposed writing a Tale c oncerning the Moon, the idea of Telescopic discoveries suggested itself to m e \u2014 but I afterwards abandoned it. I had however spoken of it freely, & fro m many little incid ents & apparently trivial rem arks in thos e Discoveries I am convinced tha t the idea was stolen from myself. (Poe Letters , vol. 1, 74) Apparently Poe pursued these charge s pub licly in the papers but not legally, and he was not th e only one who saw a sim ilarity between the two m oon stories; the New York Transcript printed them togethe r and speculated they were by the sam e person (Locke Moon H oax 69). Po e even tually had to relinquish his literary vendetta against Locke as it pr oved unproductive (P oe Literati: Richard Adams Locke 162). H owever, in the process of protesting both the sim ilarities and the differences between the two hoaxes, Poe revealed a great deal about the construction of \"Hans Phaall\" and the a ssum ptions that he m ade about popular science reading habits w hile fum ing ove r the \"Moon Hoax.\" These assumptions should concern us because they were tested on real readers, a nd at least som e of them rang true. In other words, we know that P oe and Locke correctly guessed a percen tage o f their readers' expectations because the \"Moon Hoax,\" in p articular, worked. It was in toto a success ful experim ent in prod ucing a certain reader 101 response via a series of certain rhetorical m oves. It is these expected rhetorical moves that this project aim s to recollect and use as the bas is for analysis of Poe's future hoaxing practices. 3. C OLLECTING READER EXPECTATIONS It is im possible to d etermine precise ly how read ers in th e 1830s and 1840s read popular science reports. No judgm ents m ade from our perspective are accurate o r com prehensive, and contem porary opinions are biased b y their imbrication in the r eading cultur e. As Jam es Machor describes the d ifficulty, \"...the im possibility o f full and unm ediated access to historical readers ineluctably limits efforts ture' readi ng as a his torical act\" (xx ii). This is precis ely the prob lem that ha s dogged historical reading research ers, as discus sed in the m ethods section of Chapter One. To briefly recap the double bind of historical rh etorical an alysis, m any New Historical assessments of reading in the nineteenth century have provided rich hi storical deta il an d context that still, however, fall short of describing how reader s read at the tim e, (Machor x). On the other hand, m odern Reader Response a pproaches to nineteenth century texts can produce anachronistic readings that communicate li ttle besides the idiosyncratic reactions of a single twentie th or twenty -first-cen tury read er. Although it is certainly not of the Reader Response sc hool, Roland Barthes's influential reading of P oe's hoax \"The F acts in the Case of M. Valdem ar\" is a good case study in the m ethodol ogical pitfalls of a re ading that ignores the origin al pub lication con text of the text. 102 Barthes's study begins by claim ing hist ory is u nnecessary f or the reading of \"M. Valdem ar,\" but he cannot avoid i nvoking it to explain how the story taps into a roilin g nine teenth-centu ry craze over mesmerism (Barthes 86). When it comes to interpreting the cultural codes the story supposedly carries, Barthes eschews the publication history of \"M. Vald emar\"\u2014includin g the cru cial fact that it was originally read not as science f iction, as Barthes r eads it, but as news. That basic assumption about the truth-value of the piece radi cally alters the interpretation of all cod es in \" M. Vald emar,\" but Barthes does not acknowledge this dynam ic in his reading. The present project is an attem pt to find a corrective to this sort o f Heisenbergian paradox of losing either the context or process of a reading event by focusing too closely on the other term . In order to balance the term s, this projec t will trea t the hoaxes as case studies in the successf ul identif ication and re - perform ance of expectations that read ers of popular science in the 1830s and 1840s m ight have had. The recuperation of these expectations\u2014in essence a set of default beliefs readers m ay have held in co mmon when approaching science news\u2014will provide a portrait of science news r eading in the nineteenth century that takes in to accoun t the histo rical cont ext of that reading while still providing a framework for describing an i ndividual reading of a text. These read ing expectations natu rally range over a broad field, from expectations about particular authors' writing styles to expectations completely beyond the pale of study\u2014like a personal pr edisposition to disb elieve anything anyone says because of a recent b etrayal by a friend. For the purpo ses of this 103 study, I will focus on recuperating only expe ctations concerning the genre of the popular science report and \"ethnoscience\" or lay beliefs about science\u2014what Barthes term s the \"code\" of science. Further, s ince this is an experim ent in this type of reader-oriented criticism , there is no protocol for reconstr ucting reader expectati ons. In this case, some will be collected from Poe's a nd Locke's own words about the literary contest between their hoaxes. In addi tion, som e reader expectations are discernable in the com ments in the c ontem porary papers about both hoaxes. Finally, a small sam ple of popular science reports of the tim e will be exam ined for sim ilarities in f orm, style, and co ntent, and th ose sim ilarities will be tr eated as conventional expectations that antebellu m newsreaders developed from repeated readings in this genre. 3.1 Wrangling over the \"Moon Hoax\" Poe attacked the \"Mo on Hoax\" repeatedly in the years between its publication and his final burying of the ha tchet in his 1846 portrait of L ocke for his Literati of New Yor k City installm ents in Godey's Lady's Book \"The Un parall eled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall\" in Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque in 1840, he attached a \"Note\" to it comparing the two hoaxes and criticizing Lo cke's for its factual shortcom ings. This essay was repeated in essence in one of Poe's freelance letters for the Colum bia Spy in 1845 and again in the Literati portrait of Locke in 1846. Poe's list of the errors in Locke's hoax is lengthy, and most of his complaints are easy to verify on a close exam ination of the text. Poe's list of 104 errata inclu des these facts: th at creature s seen on other planet s would all appear upside down\u2014if in fact you could see any m ore than the tops of their heads\u2014and that Lock e had m ade sever al simple m ultiplica tion er rors in r eporting the magnification power of Herschel's telescop e and the relativ e sizes of th e earth and moon. That Poe was able to catch all of these errors is a testam ent to his wide reading and acum en in astronom y and physics. In fact, both he and Locke benefited from the 1834 Am erican reprin t of Herschel's T reatise on Astronom y in preparing their hoaxes (Poe Literati: Richard Adam s Locke 159; Locke Moon Hoax xxv). However, as Poe points out in his essay, Locke's scientific gaffes did not seem to have m uch effect on his r eadership, who suffered from the \"gross ignorance which is so generally prev alent upon subjects of an astronom ical nature\" (Poe \"Note\" 70). Overall, P oe the success of Locke's hoax to the followin g factors, as summarized in Table 3. 105 Table 3: Po e's characteri stics of a successful hoax* Content of Hoax Novelty: \"first in the field\" t hus findi ng re aders unprepared to analy ze the merits of the discovery because of lack of previous experience with it. Sensation: The \"rich...fancy \" of the amazing man-bats, moon- beavers, etc. Detail: Its \"execution of details\"; the minute observations about the construction and dimensions of the te lescope and the labors of Herschel and his assistants to solve methodologic al problem s. (Mabbott 5 from a foreign countr y\"; by this Poe seems to im ply not only the strategy of making the hoax hard to confir m, but also the nam e-dropping of t he fam ous foreign scientists Plausibility: \"Analogical truth\" and \"pl ausibilit y,\" which Poe believes e performed to perfection in his \"Hans Phaall.\" Presentatio n of Hoax in its Medium Medium: The reputation o f its medium. The Sun was not yet known for printing hoaxes. Presentation : The \"consummat e tact with which the deception was brought f orth\"; Poe was undoubtedl y recalling the blurb on page two of the 21 August 1835 Sun forecasting the discovery and the judicious periods of suspense be tween the parts of the report. Style of Argumentation in Hoax Internal Coherenc e: cons istency of the accuracy Verisi militu de: \"The exquisite than one critic of Locke's hoax re marked on hi s elegant style, appropriate to such an aweso me discovery , and the realistic sound of the research diaries \"tr anscribed\" by the Edinburg h Journal of Science and belon ging to Herschel's chief assist ant, Andrew Grant. Poe's criteria are internally cons istent becau se each point is independently verifiable upon exam ination of both texts. However, are his criteria externa lly valid as accurate observ ations of the readi ng culture at that tim e? Before m oving * Most of th e criteria co me from the version of the essay appearing in the Colum bia Spy . The Foreign, Presen tation, Veris imilitude, an d Plausibility criteria are added in the version of the essay incorpor ated into Poe's Liter ati sketch of Locke. 106 on to collect further reader exp ectations, a brief com parison of the three overarching categories of expectations\u2014scientif ic content, scientific style, and the penny press medium \u2014against pub lic concep tions of them at the tim e will help determ ine if Poe's observations of reader habits have an y externa l validity. This analytical move com paring Poe's claim s to the cu lture com es from Steven Mailloux's m ethodology in Rhetorical Power and helps keep Poe's reading in check culturally (Mailloux 57). Regarding the novelty of the scie ntific content of the hoaxes\u2014 astronom y\u2014Poe claim s that the general reading public was woefully under- inform ed. This com plaint anticipates C. L. Barritt's cri ticism in his 1845 Broadway Journal article concerning physics. In 1835 all eyes were trained on the night sky watching f or Halley's com et, and som e believed it would sm ash into the earth; in general, people were ignora nt of what shooting stars and comets even were, according to an article on th at subject in the July 183 5 Am erican Journal of Science . The well-edu cated m embers of th e upper class and business class had access to H erschel's Treatise on Astronom y and Scottish astronom er Thom as Dick's popular works. Al manacs were popular in the first quarter of the nineteenth century am ong the m iddle and agricultural classes, and m ost general weeklies and m onthlies carried articl es on astronom y (Locke Moon Hoax xxviii- xxix). The urban working class and im migrant class, however, would have received m ost of their astronom ical acculturatio n through rum or and the penny press. This educational inequity notwithstanding, even Thom as Dick, as mentioned above, thought the m oon was inha bited. No one had seen enough of it 107 to know differently. Locke's hoax stepped into a kairos , a rhetorical opportunity, afforded by the excited desire to know more about the m oon on the one hand, and the scantiness of hard info rmation about it am ong all cl asses of readers, on the other. Benson Lossing wrote in 1884 of the sad state of astronom ical understanding that Locke e xploited with his hoax: \"Locke had...engaged in preparing the ' Moon Hoax' ....for the purpo se of testing the extent of public credulity. It was a successf ul experim ent\" (Moss 87). So, the observation Poe m akes about th e scientific ignorance of Locke's readers seem s valid. His observations a bout the power of foreign nam e-dropping in the ho ax, the sens ational na ture o f the discov eries, and th e weight of scien tific detail ar e more dif ficult to ver ify cultur ally. It is hardly worth belaboring nam e- dropping as a key elem ent of Locke' s hoax since it is still a powerful ethos - oriented device in current popular rhetoric of a ll kinds, from celebrity endorsem ents to society colum ns. In term s of sensa tional elem gradua ted races of intelligen t beings, one needs look no further than P.T. Barnum 's Feejee Merm aid and the other \"artifacts\" in his Am erican Museu m to appreciate the ap petite in Jacksonian America for the spectacu lar. Barnum himself was only exploiting a te nden cy in Am erica a t that time to believ e in natural wond ers, a \"predispos ition to accept the m echanically probable or the organ ically possib le...[that] was a p eculiarly patriotic p America\" (Harris 73 ). There were legi timate reasons for Am ericans to put their faith in the seem ingly fantas tic. The Am erican subcontin ent was being active ly 108 explored by expeditions like Lewis and Clark's and the W ilkes Expedition (the United States Explorin g Expeditio n). These adventure rs return ed with an astounding bounty of natural specim ens along with Native Am erican cultural artifacts. T he first bison and gila mons ters ap peared just as outlandis to New Yorkers as Barnum 's Feejee m ermaid (cobbled together from a mumm ified monkey and a fish). In a way the f eeling of m any Am ericans toward new scien tific discoveries w as like Poe 's toward his f lying m achines : an optim istic focus beyond what was to what could be. Barnum thus capita lized on a nearly inexhaustible supply of cheerful, patrioti c credulity on the part of Am ericans who were as agape on th eir new hom e continen t as child ren in a candy store. To illustrate this good-natu red na\u00efvete, cultu ral scholar Jonathan Elm er discusses th e sign in Barn um's Am erican Museu m that pointed \"To th e Egress.\" W hen patrons, curious to see a fem ale \"egre,\" would pass through the door, they would find them selves out in the a lley with no way b ack into the m useum but to pay the f ee again. Elmer claim s that being duped provided no s mall amount of pl easure for those whose egos were not caught up in being righ t all th e tim e and that Americans, in general, loved to be f ooled. \"W hat Barnum [sold], by m eans of his objects, [was] interpretation\" (Elm er 184). It was th e experience of perceiving and decid ing that Am ericans en joyed, the freed om they felt in the Jacks onian era to m ake the reality th ey wanted to liv e in. W hen Poe sniped that Locke's readership valued sensation over hard f act, he fe igned disdain for their com fort with am biguous truth-values. However, as already evidenced by his tendency to argue for the value of his stories on the basi s of their plau sibility and po tentia lity, 109 not their factuality, P oe clearly shared some of Locke's read ers' love of suspended m eanings and m ultiple p ossible rea lities. In term s of the \"weigh t of scientif ic deta il\" cr iterion th at Poe f elt was crucial for a successful scientific hoax, his high valuation of it was corroborated to som e extent by the r hetoric the Sun used to introdu ce Locke's sto ry. It issued the followin g caveat: We are necessarily com pelled to om it the m ore ab struse and m athem atical parts of the extracts how ever im portant they m ay be as a demonstration of those which we have marked for pub lications; but even the latter cannot fail to exc ite more ardent curio sity and af ford more sublim e gratif icatio n than could be created and supplied by a ny thing short of a direct revelation from heaven (Locke Moon Hoax ix). Here was th e dual im plication that the Sun 's readers would not understand the m ath, but they would nonetheless be im pressed by it. It w as precisely because the typical reader of the hoax could not understand the scien ce that it was so valuable in providing a ha rd veneer beneath w hich s/ he could not penetrate to check th e facts. Poe p rided him self on bei ng able to do just this , but he repeatedly claim ed himself to be in the m inority. He constructed \"Hans Phaall\" with m ore atten tion to its m echanics than did Locke, perhap s in an attem pt to im press a m ore scien tifically cultured set of reader s. W e will retu rn to this poss ibility in the discussion of Eureka and Poe's r elationship to his re adership in the f inal section of this chapter. Notwithstanding, it app ears probable that P oe was in tune with 110 the expectations of his readers when he cham pioned scientific detail as a capital method of pulling form ulas over their eyes. The next category of expectations, c oncerning the m edium of the hoaxes, is crucially important for any study of hoaxing, because it is obvious that \"Hans Phaall\" was read differently published in Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque than it was as originally published in the Southern L iterary Messenger ; and, Locke's story is read very differently when published as The Gregg Press's edition of The Moon Hoax in 1975 or even as Th e Celebrated Moon Story in 1852 than it was read as orig inally published in the Sun . Despite Bennett's protestation that the penny press stood fo r \"the cause of truth, public faith, and science against falsehood, fraud, and ignor ance,\" its readers kne w it to publish the opposite on occasion (Nelkin 85). However, on balance, the Sun did publish perhaps a greater percen tage of factu al inform ation than false, so it seems unlikely that any sto ry in th e Sun would have been judged fals e out of hand until the facts were in. The \"Discoveries in the Moon,\" as Poe pointed out in the Presentation criterion above, was certainly presented by the Sun exactly as any other important discovery just received f rom abroad would have been. This could not have but helped to co ntribu te to its a ppearance as a factual report. Current research in to th e effects of presentation and m edium on readers validates Po e's claim s about their power. Rolf Zwaan has dem onstrated recently that the s ame tex t will b e interpr eted differently by two groups of readers if one group believes that the text com es from a newspa per and the other group believes it cam e from a short story co llection. The two groups of readers em ploy different 111 cognitive processes during reading and read for different purposes. W hen readers believed they were reading a short story, Zwaan's subjects took longer to read the text and had better m emory for surface features, i.e. exact wording and phrasin g of the text. However, these readers were less lik ely to pay attention to situationa l aspects of the story, meaning thos e aspect s that connected the story to the real world of the reader's experience\u2014the \"who, what, when, where, and why.\" Subjects who read the story as a news arti cle, on the other ha nd, read much m ore quickly than the literary readers b ut had poor recall for exact phras ing. They exhibited b etter recall f or situational in formation than the literary readers, evincing more in tegration of the elem ents of the story with the world of their experience. Zwaan's findings suggest th at hoaxes m ust be exam ined through the lens of reader expectations about medium . When read in a news context, \"Hans Phaall\" play s with issues of reality an d wo rld-vie w construction; thus, it is a hoax. However, when read in Poe's Collected Tales and Poem s, the story is science fiction, and truth-value qu estions are not part of the reading experience. Recent research in cogn itive psycho logy supports these separate fields o f for fiction and non-fiction m edia. Leda Cosm ides and John Tooby at the University of California at Santa Ba rbara have studied \"decoupling,\" or the ability to su spend a m eaning or res trict its scope so that it does not apply to the whole epistemological field of the reader \u2014which \"truth\" does, in Cos mides and Tooby's m odel. In fiction reading interpre tations arising from the reading process are \"tagged\" with a scop e operator that prevents them from changing the world- view of the reader until further inform ation is gathered, or, indeed, perhaps ever. 112 While news articles would potentially be read as comm unicating \"tru th,\" and therefore their m eanings would be applie d globally in the readers' wor ld-view, fictional interpretations w ould be \"decoupled\" and thei r truth-values held in suspension (Zunshine 219). Th is distin ction will b e useful for separating the reading activities of the majority of read ers who read Poe's hoaxes as news fro m those of the few readers who read the st ory as fiction, purely for entertainm ent. Not only are these observations of Poe's about Locke's successf ul rhetorical strateg ies backed up by recent research, but even m ore significantly, they were also noted and discussed by contem porary commentators on the hoax. These criticism s are worth consid ering before turning to a m ore detailed exam ination of how well the sty le of Locke's h oax m atched the s tyle of science news article s in gener al at the tim e. 3.2 Reactin g to the \"Moon Hoax\" As already discussed, the papers in Ne w York City took up the topic of the Moon Hoax with relish in the two w eeks after it was printed in the S un. The papers that professed confidence in the story as it was presented pointed to the following features as hallm arks of the re port's authenticity: Sir John H erschel's name and reputation and th e attendant \"m arks of tr ansatlantic origin,\" th e its \"v ersimilitude,\" its probab ility, and its novelty in the field of astronom y. Those pa pers that expressed suspicion of the Sun's report pointed to factua l erro rs prim arily, since an absolute discrediting of 113 the story was not possible without Sir John Herschel's testimony.8 Significantly, the New York Sunday News , one of the few papers at the o utset to express grave doubts about the truth of the story, seem ed to defer its judg ments for fear of offending Herschel: \"A fter all, howeve r, our doubts and incredulity m ay be a wrong to the learned astronom er, and th e circum stances of this wonderful discovery may be correct. Le t us do him justice, and al low him to tell h is story in his own way\" (Locke Moon Hoax 62). It would seem , then, from the point of view of this paper and the others that were waiting for a decisive word from Herschel, that ethos, or personal credibility, wa s a stronger factor than logos , or the facts of the story, in constituting thei r judgm ents about Locke's report. A fe w papers, interestingly, chose to downplay the issue of authenticity in favor of praising Locke's story for its entertainm ent value. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, \"W hether true or false, the a rticle is written with con summate ab ility, and possesses intense intere st\" (Locke Moon Hoax 62). And the Sun , which had stuck by the veracity of Locke's story fr om its f irst ins tallment on 25 August to Benjam in Day's last editorial on the subj ect on 16 September, claim ed in that final piece that Locke's report, if even tually proven to b e nothing more than rumors from Scotland, still had a \"useful effect in diverting the public m ind, for a 8 Ormond Se avey has also collected a fe w responses from publ ic figures in New York City, via letters or diaries, a nd as with the papers, m any comm entators who suspected the hoax did so on the grounds of its faulty science. Contem porary Michael Floy com plained in his diary, \"The author of these wonders says that an enorm ous lens of 30 feet diam eter wa s constructed...but he should have said a lens of 100 feet diam eter, as it is shown by writers on optics that such a diam eter would be required to ascertain if [sic ] any inhabitants in the Moon. W hy not make a good lie at once?\" (Locke Moon Hoax xiii) 114 while, from that bitter apple of discor d, the abolition of sl avery\"(Locke Moon Hoax xxii).9 Many New Yorkers, then, seem ed surprising ly content to keep the issue of truth suspended, and to preserve the ess ence of the hoax, what Poe would find so appealing about it: its ability to put reality in play, in tension. 3.21 Parody In the heat of the public debate over the hoax, J. Gordon Bennett's Herald mounted a different sort of critique of Locke's story, one that is extrem ely useful for our purposes of identifying reader e xpectations\u2014a parody. On 2 Septem ber 1835, the Herald printed \"A BET TER ST ORY.\u2014MOST WONDE RFUL AND ASTOUNDING R.F.L, A a hoax, m ust foreground what is salient to th e reader to achieve its effect. If a reader d id no t notice a particular feature in the original, the parody cannot achieve a com ic effect by mimicking it. So, the parody of Locke's story is a good barom eter of what people 9 The connections between contem porary theo ries of race and Locke's \"Moon-Hoax\" is intriguing but beyond the scope of this chapter. It is ironic that Day claim s the hoax is a \"diversion,\" because in fact th e hoax is deep ly racist: the more advanced Locke's moon-beings becom e, the lighter their skin. This motif ties in with theories of the day, lik e Samuel Morton's (cham pioned by no less a personage than fa naturalist Louis Agassiz), that justified slavery through \"scien tific\" proof of inferi or brain capacity on the pa rt of Blacks and Native Americans. By this reas oning, these groups were not ev en hum an, and so slavery was no diffe rent and no morally worse than owning livestock. Stephen Jay Gould replicated Morton's study and found no signifi cant differences in brain capacity. His results and discussion of the relati onship of ideology to science can be found in his article \"Am erican Po lygeny and Craniom etry before Separa Infe rior Spec ies,\" a chap ter in edito r San dra Harding 's The Racial Econom y of Science . 115 paid attention to in the story. This pa rody mocks five particular features of Locke's tale, as diagramm ed in Table 4. Table 4: Salient features of \"Moon Hoax\" parodied by Herald Hoax\" Feature's \"double\" in Herald Parody Credentials/authorit y of foreign scientists In the title: \" ...BY CHELL, Phrases like \" stellar diade ms\" and \" more numerous than the sparks which escape fro m a blacks mith's forge\" astronom s use of real-life analogies to make s ense of immense astronom ical distances and figures \"Latitude and longit ude can be determ ined, in less time than an alderman could swallow a basin of turtle soup....\" the \"weight of scientific detail\" \"Hers chell then tasted the water of said ocean, by means of a ver y long hy drostatic t ube, attached to the telescope. It has a very curious taste. He found it was co mposed of the following mixture, viz: 2 parts of le monade, 1 part printer's i nk, 1-2 parts m int julep, 1- 2 parts flower of brimstone. There was also a slight tincture of blue vitriol\" (Lock e Moon Hoax 65). The Herald 's parody thus corroborates at least three m ajor judgm ents of Poe's what was salient ience news: authority, precision, and \"verisim ilar\" jargon. Readers would ha ve immediately rec ognized the bom bastic metaphors and real-lif e analogies as char acteristic features of science news article s. W e turn nex t to these expectations, which read ers of Locke's hoax would have developed quasi-unconsciously through their reading of science news. 116 3.3 Science w riting in America, 1830-1845 To validate Poe's observations about how closely Locke's rhetoric mimicked the style of a \"real\" scien ce report, we need to co Poe's, with contem porary popular scien ce writing. Specifically, we need to consider what m ight have been salient to readers of science news in the 1830s and 1840s. Antebellum news readers knew what to expect from science writing not because th ey were educated to view it in a certain way, but because th ey read it and developed assum ptions based on their repe ated experien ces with it. It is well- docum ented that readers em ploy schem ata (structured assumptions about speech and reading activities) to save cog nitive effort (Kints ch 9 4, 111). T he more assum ptions that can be m ade about a text based on past experience with texts like it, the grea ter the p rocessing capacity that can be dedi cated to rem embering new information in th e tex t and eva luating it app ropria tely. Ge nre is probably the usual arena for exploring these assum ptions , since a gen re is itself a sort of schem a or pattern of rhetorical m oves th at has been codified in m edium , format, style, and content over the course of repeated inter actions between au thor and reader through a certain textual m edium . As discussed in C hapter One, just this sort of feedback loop operated in the developm ent of the research article, accord ing to Charles Bazerm an's study of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society . 117 3.4 Generic cues in antebellum science new s Since genre is such a powerful operato r in the reading exp erience, it is reasonab le to expect that the orig inal readers of Locke's Mo on Hoax and \"Hans Phaall\" came to the se texts with def inite expectations of what they were going to read, based on their past experiences with popular science articles in newspapers and m agazines. To try to discern what some of these expectations m ight have been, I exam ined a small sam ple of 11 contemporary newspapers and literary magazines for two purposes: first, sim ply to count how m any and what kinds of science articles appeared in them , and sec ond, to exam ine those articles for shared cues that m ight have becom e codifi ed as genre expectations by readers through experience. The eleven newspapers and m agazines s elected are lis ted in Table 6 below. They were chosen either becau se Poe specifically m entioned having read science in th em, or because Frank Luther Mo tt listed them as exam ples of general science m agazines in A History of Am erican Magazines: 1741-1850 . The one slightly ano malous journal in th is survey is th e Am erican Journal of Science (AJS ), whic h was certa inly conside red a ge neral science journal, and was read more widely than the tec hnical journ als of the sc ientif ic societie s. However, th e AJS was not likely to have been read by th e working-class target dem ographic of the penny dailies due to cons traints of m oney, tim e, and e ducation. It is included here to represent th e gen eral science readi ng m aterial availab le to the five percen t of Am ericans with a co llege educatio n at th is time, like Poe h imself (Lagem ann). 118 For each newspaper or m agazine, I se lected a sam ple issu e during th e range of years of Poe's writing career, rough ly 1830 to 185 0. W henever possib le, an issue was selected from 1835, the year of the contest of Poe's and Locke's hoaxes, just to sam ple the kinds of topi cs readers were seeing in the media that year. This was not always possible as m any journals, like the Scientific Am erican (est. 1845), did not begin publis hing until after that year ; and, som e years of som e older newspapers are m issing from the m icrofilm series co llected by th e American Antiquarian S ociety. Within each issue selected, all of the articles and advertisem ents concerning issues of science and tec hnology were categorized and counted to provide a snapshot of popular or general sc ience reading in A ntebellum America. The precis e catego rization of the articles is not as im portant for our purposes as an overall feel for the range of genres dealing with scie nce and technology that was available to readers. I found thr ee m ajor types of science writing: Major Types technology articles short, popular science blurbs and item s longer articles treating \"pure\" scienc e either as experim ental report or educational piece The definitional difference between sc ience and technology is largely a product-driven one: if the article treated an invention, m edicine, or m achine, it was counted as technologica l. If it treated principl es of science (including \"pseudosciences\" like m esmerism) or the hi story of the sciences, I counted it 119 scien tific. W ithin thes e three categories, seve ral sub -categ ories were d iscern able. First, there were nine shorter popular scie nce and technology subtypes: Shorter Popular Science/Technology Subtypes meta-commentary : articles sp ecifically trea ting the sta te of science and/or technology in America blurb/factoid: short (100 word s or fewer) item s announcing a new scientific or technological discove ry or sim ply stating a \"gee whiz\" fact about science ad joke poem sensation/sp ectacle anno uncem ent educational item how-to: treats technological or practical procedures for the lay reader home experim ent: designed so th e reader cou ld observe a m ore abstra ct scientific principle at work Within the category of longer \"pure\" scie nce articles, th ree subtypes em erged: Longer \"Pure\" Science Subtypes experim ental reports observations reviews of science books. The results of the survey are presented in Tables 5 and 6. 120 Table 5: Antebellum media surveyed w ith num ber of science articles per issue Magazin e/Newspaper Total science articles Scientif ic Am erican 80 Family Magazine 60 American Journal of Science 28 NY Sun 15 New York Herald 14 American (Whig) Review 7 Albany Argus 5 North Am erican Review 2 New Yorker 1 Southern Literary Messenger 1 Broadway Journal 1 Table 6: Distribution of categories of science articles across m edia sam ple Major category Sub-categor y Totals for sub- categories Sub-categor y % of total science articles Major category % of total science articl es Meta 4 2.5% Poem 5 3.1% Pop.

The dom inance of th e Popular Technology catego ry is due to the prevalen ce of Ads, which accounted f or alm ost 29% of all scienc e articles, th e larg est \"m arket share\" of any of the sub- catego ries. The strong showing of Educa tional pieces (17. 9% total) is sligh tly misleading as thes e pieces were alm ost entirely confined to th ree of the 11 journa ls in the sam ple\u2014the Scie ntific Am erican , the ation Fam ily Mag azine \u2014and thus were not evenly distributed throughout the m edia, as were the Ads and the Blurb/Factoids, which showed a 16.5% m arket share. In these shorter pieces, science was m arketed to the reader as a vendor of goods and servic es\u2014technologies, in other words; or, as in the case o f the Blurb /Factoids, as \"gee whiz \" enter tainm ent. Th is sample f rom the m edia corroborates Robert Bruce' s study of antebellum science, The Launching of Modern A merican Science . In a review of th e letters and journa ls of American scientists of the era, Bruce found that they felt a constant pressure to produce technologies; m any felt they had to be tied to industry in order to get even the m ost basic funding for their rese arch (72). The predom inance of articles selling or advertising science here in part confirm s the anxieties of these scien tists. An exa mination of the rhetoric of the longer articles bears out these observations to som e extent , as science was figured as solving p roblems that faced average Am ericans, whether abstract ly or concretely via techn ologies. 122 While no two articles share ex actly the sa me rhetoric, there are som e striking recurring rh etorical features, summ arized in Tables 7-9 below with exam ples: Table 7: Typical opening of antebellum science articles Rhetorical F eature Examples (w ith features e mphasi zed) \"Mystery\" o pening emphasiz es sublim \"mystery,\" \"puzzle,\" \" awe-inspiring,\" \"amazing,\" et c. em ploys rhetorical questions to em phasi ze \"mystery\" aspect of phenom enon. often im plies that the phen omenon is a matter of al most universal attention and wonder . \"Every perso n of a reflecting m ind m ust have often asked him self the question , what are shooting stars?

Another way to view this rhetorical dynam ic is as a narrative of control, wher e som e unta mable natura l force becom es domesticated through Am erican scientif ic and technological methods. Charles Ba zerm an finds the pro blem/solutio n topos underlying the structure of the research article as earl y as 1800 in the Philos ophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London , so there is a po tential rh etorical inheritance here from the academ ic article to its pop ular kin (Bazerm an \"Reporting\" 183). The problem /solution topos also operates powerfully today in the resea rch report, in fact, argues John Swales in his close study of the rhetoric of research articles in Genre Analysis: Eng lish in Academ ic and Research Settings (118-119). However , Swal es al so not ices a spec ial link between the problem /solution topos and popularization. While speci alized, intra-disciplinary reports of scientific research usually exhibit m ore complex introductions keyed to the particular interests an d topoi of their disciplines, popularizat ions of those sam e findings often redu ce the se com plexities to a problem /solution m odel in th eir introdu ction s, sinc e this is a topos that appeals more genera lly to a lay readership interested in what scienc e can do for them (Swales 138,140) . Indeed, in this sm all sample of mid-nineteenth cen tury po pular scienc articles, even abs scien tific concepts te nd to be d iscussed in term s of a pay-off, whether physical or metaphysical. This is consistent with Jeanne Fahnestock's observations, in her study of the presen t-day accomm odation of science in popu lar m edia. She found that the emphasis in popularized accounts of scientific findings still rests on the 126 \"pay-off\" of those findings in term s of new knowledge, valuable technology, or an index to a course of social action (291). It bears noting that this problem /solution/\"pay-off\" pattern is eerily similar to th at of the adver tisem ents that pack the pages of all of thes e papers; a pro blem (health or otherwise) can be solved che aply by an a mazing scientif ic solution, at gre at benefit to the purchase r. Closer exam ination of this connection is required before we can determ ine if advertisem ents in the popular press f ormed a rhetorical precedent for the popular science article. But the sim ilarities are striking and suggestive. Narrowing our focus from the global stru cturing principles of the texts in the sam ple, a f ew im portant loca l patterns can b e disce rned. The f irst lies in th e rhetoric of the introductions or opening stat ements of these science articles. Even in the m ore staid Am erican Journal of Science articles, the opening rhetorical move is co nsisten tly mystery are repeated with uncanny consistency in all of the longer blurbs, educational pieces, and repor ts of discoveries. The only exceptions to this rule are found in a few of the AJS articles, which im itate the developin g Transactions -type experim ental reports of this time period in restricting their claim s to a specific hypothesis and its proof, a strategy that resists overgeneralization and sensationali sm (Bazer man \"Reporting\" 174,183). The purpose of these popular p ieces' inflated introductory rhetoric can surely be chalked up in great m easure to the s ame sort of im pulse m otivating the all-caps headlin es of the science advertisem ents they sh are the p ages with\u2014attra cting and exciting attention. In Selling Science Dorothy Nelkin char acterizes the science 127 journalism of this period as pushing for th e \"-es t\": the b iggest, coldest, s tranges t, etc. (1 ). However, this \"mystery\" rhetor ic possibly ties into other traditions and reader expectations. Jeanne Fahnest ock finds this sam e tendency in 20th centu ry popularizations, and she claim s that this pa ttern finds its way back to Aristotelian theory : \"In the Rhetoric , Aristo tle pointed ou t the perenn ial epideictic ap peal th at 'a thing is greater when it is hard er or rarer than other things' \" (Fahnestock \"Accommodating\" 280-281). One of the p illars of Fahnestock's theo ry about popularization is that it is essentially epideic tic, in contrast to the forensic rhetoric of the lab report, because popularizing scien tific findings requires \"the adjustm ent of new inform ation to an audience' s already held values and assum ptions\" (278- 279). A J acksonian readership, convin ced that Am erica was the \"-est\" of everything, would certainly have valued epid eictic rhetoric touting the originality and novelty of its scientists' ideas. Interestingly, there is a second im plication of the \"m ystery\" opening that corroborates this resonan ce between popular science re porting and epideictic rhetor ic, and that is the f requent m ove these p ieces m ake to estab lish th eir top ics as matters of general or, indeed, univer sal concern. Everyone wonders about this, the articles imply, just as the advertisem ents do; everyone has worried about this, everyone needs an answ er to this question. Th is move is very sim ilar to one John Swales has identif ied in the ductions to a rticles : ar guing f or centrality. One of the first m oves research scientists often m ake in their public argum ents is to claim that the topic they are working on is of param ount importance to the m ajority of their field (Swales 144). In light of the epideictic 128 functions of appeals to mystery, uniqueness, and centrality, it would appear that arguing for centrality or univers al concern is an epideict ic move to es tablish the scien tist's work solidly within the goals and values of the reading c ommunity. The \"wonder\" openings of the popular science pieces in th e sam ple could function in a sim ilar f ashion with their read erships. The last loc al-level rhe torica l feature visib le in the sam ple is the use of detail to co nvince the readers of the ap tness of the au thor's solutio n to th e acknowledged gap or lack. The AJS artic les ar e the m ost detailed, like ly due to their greater length and techni cality. However, all of the popular science reports, including the blurbs/factoids, give details of functions, principl es, and o perations as part of their strategy to persuade th e read er that their claim s are true and valuable. Poe, of course, practically obs essed over this attention to \"analogical detail\" and \"veris imilitude\" in his hoaxes, believing th ese qualities to be th e hallm ark of scientific writing. His \"Ball oon-Hoax,\" in particular, barely stays afloat with its heavy balla st of technical engineering details about Mason's Atlantic-hurdling balloon. As discussed in Chapter One, both Bazerm an's and Shapin's work on the developm ent of the rese arch ar ticle indica tes th at the ar ticle evolved to p rovide a vicarious ex perien ce of the experiment for the reader. Rhetoric thus supplanted witness, cru cial for em pirical scien ce's verification and repr oducibility. By the nineteenth century, then, science had embarked on its grand pretense tha t scientific language was tran sparent, that what you read was what had happened; indeed, you r read ing and accep tance of the cl aims of the research article verified 129 them (Bazerm an Shaping 14). Of course, news reporting cu ltivated a sim ilar trus t in its readers, who could not them selves be in a ll the p laces the repor ters could be to witness all the d iscoveries, d isasters, and decisions that filled each day everywhere in Jackson ian Am erica. As discussed earlier, political papers even adopted a rhetoric of verbatim transcri ption o f political events that gave the semblance of a virtual experience of direct dem ocracy. All of this \"veris imilitude\" was lik ely aim ed at giving re aders the vic arious expe rience of governing, a highly desirabl e experience in a day wh en Am ericans were being cultured by Jackson to distrust anyone \u2014the Masons and the Second National Bank included\u2014who wished to separate them from the governance of their nation. Hoaxers like Poe and Locke could not have helped but take advantage of the blind trust that their readers had been taught, th rough reading science and reading the news, to put in \"ver isimilitude ,\" in the vicarious witness of the word. All of these rhetorical moves liste d above\u2014the problem /solution/pay-off structure, the \"m ystery\" opening, the de nse detail, also the nam e-dropping of cognoscenti\u2014since they appear fairly c onsistently throu ghout the different publications, could be consid ered expectations reader s would hold, unconsciously or consciously, when approaching an arti cle su ch as Locke's or Poe's hoax. In addition, as already m entioned with respec t to the m ore techni cal science reports, the reader could expect copious wo odblock engravings that illus trated inventions , principles of astronom y or physics, or bot anical or zoological specim ens. The pages of all of the papers and m agazines were rif e with them . Elizabeth Tebeaux argues in her study of Renai ssance technical m anuscrip ts that illus trations and text 130 layouts, which helped the re ader visualize topic stru cture, strengthened the percep tex t comm unicated the stru cture of reality. This effect of engravings could not help but be useful to the hoaxers, and in fact Po e includes engravings of the balloon Victoria and the workings of its propeller in his \"Balloon-H oax\" to augm ent tery\" Locke and Poe utiliz ed this s trategy to ca tch rea ders' attentions. Overall, the effect of these popular science reports was ve ry close to that of the papers' advertisem ents\u2014 sensation, mystery, uniqueness, a nd imm ediate practical benefit. 3.5 Summary of reader expectations of popular science new s As discussed in the Methods secti on in the last chapter, a \"reader expectation\" is a sort of cognitive constraint on the process of creating m eaning during the reading experience. In other words, the expectation functions as an assum ption that favors the accep tance of cer tain interpretations of a text over others in constructing a \"wor ld view,\" which is the sum total of all the b eliefs the reader holds about the world.10 That is why understanding hoaxing is crucial to 10 In general this belief or \" doxastic\" is coherent, disallowing contradictory beliefs about a single proposition. See Lehrer (1978) for a discussion of this sort of doxastic system s in epistem ology. However, discourse researchers like Lascarides and As her (1993) have found that discourse interpretatio n usually in volves th e acceptan ce of beliefs into the doxastic system that would be incom patible under a strict interpretation of th e logical form of those beliefs. For exam ple, we have no trouble accepting that penguins are bird s although they cannot fly, and flight count s as a defining feature of birds. Lascarides and Asher argue that \"defeasibl e\" beliefs, beliefs th at hold in general but that can be overridden by specific ex ceptions, allow m ore realistic m odeling of the cognitive process of discourse in terpretation and the update of belief system s that accom panies it. 131 understanding the dynam ic betw een science and literature in nineteenth century American social epistemology: hoaxing b ears on the construction (reconstruction, from our standpoint) of the world that read ers of that era thought they lived in. Those who believed L ocke's hoax inhabi ted a different epistem ic world than those who did not, a world where there were or could be m an-bats and m oon- bison. The words of Locke's story in the Sun were the only witness to the m oon's surface, just as for m any readers, words about Japan or th e West or politics in Washington D.C. would be their only contact with those parts of the world. It is this n ascent power of witness to construc t different rea lities for read ers that Po e was beginning to exploit when he wrote \"Han s Phaall\" an d spent so much tim e studying and worrying about the success of Locke's hoax. All of the expectations that a read er has for a certain genre of text\u2014 popular science writing, in this case\u2014inter act to form a filter on all the possible meanings arising from the reading of any ex emplar text from that genre. Only the meaning(s) that sa tisfies the grea test number of the reader's expectations will make it through the holes in the filter, will be allowed to change or \"update\" her world view. W alter K intsch 's wo rk on the c ognitiv e processes involved in comprehending text supports this kind of c onstraint-satisfaction m odel of reading. Kintsch's CI or Construc tion-Integra tion model of reading pre sented in Com prehension: A Paradigm of Cognition (1998), is an extension of the comprehension m odel he developed with Teun van Dijk in the 1980s. The CI model m aintains that all possible meanings of words and phrases are generated as a reader reads a sentence. Then, through a process of \"spreadi ng activation\" only 132 those m eanings reinforced by the read er's prior read ing experience and life experience are strengthened, where m eanings irrelevan t to th e reader's g oals and experiences are weakened and eventually die off (Kintsch 95). Kintsch 's connectionist m odel of the reading pro cess, while it provides support for a m odel of reading as an expectation-s atisfaction process, m ostly applies at a sub- conscious level and so cannot cope with high-level, conscious decisions about truth-value of a text. D ecisions about th e truth of a text ha ppen after the reader has a lready decided on the m eanings of wo rds and built a m ental m odel of the text in her head; deciding about truth is deci ding to what extent that m odel will interact with her m odel of the world. For that reason, the tr uth-value judgm ents modeled in this pro ject are strictly post hoc . It m ight be possible to m odel readers' m oment-by- moment evaluation of different aspects of the text during the reading experience, if we were conductin g a read-aloud prot ocol with live subjects. However, th e histo rical reader respo nses to the hoa xes that we have available to us do not cont ain those data. They are post hoc judgm ents on the truth-value of the hoaxes, and so this project can only m odel those judgm ents. Below is as com plete a s possible a list of thos e expecta tions that hav e been recup erated so far from the m edia contest over Poe's and Locke's hoaxes. Notice that the expectations all have the form of propositions; this is so that a possible interpre tation aris ing f rom the te xt (say, \"Herschel's telescope really works the way Locke says it does\") can be tested for agreem ent with a particu lar proposition and either agree with it or v iolate it. They, along with ad dition al 133 expectations recuperated through analysis of Twain's and De Quille's hoaxes, are also listed in the Glossary at the e nd of this dissertation for reference: Authority: The author or authority figure's previous reputation holds. Entertainm ent: Reading of popular scie nce articles is for entertainm ent, not truth, value. Foreign: Anything forei gn is good and probably true. Intern al Co herence : If a sto ry's claims are logica lly consisten t, it is probably true. Medium : The previous reputation of the m edium holds. Novelty: N ew discoveries are hi ghly valued and probably true. Plausibility: If it seem s like it could happen, it probably did. Popsci: Sto ries th at sou nd like tru e science re ports probab ly are. Sub- expecta within are as follows: Long: L onger popular science articles are often given in insta llments. Decoration: Popular science repo rts will often be decorated with bold headlines and woodcuts. Mystery: Popular science repor ts often have a \"m ystery\" opening signaled by words like \"wonders\" Ignorance: After the opening, po pular science reports generally indica te th at th e pub lic is ignorant of a particular principle/phenom enon. 134 Wisdom : After the lam ent for ignorance, popular science reports generally point out a wise person who knows better. Detail: Po pular s cience articles will of ten h ave a lot of technical detail, which is a good indicator of truth. Analogy: The details in a popular science article will often be explained with analogy to well-know n phenom ena. Use: Popular science artic les of ten finish with an evaluation of the benefit, physical or m etaphysical, of the scientific principle/phenom enon. Sensation : Sensation al elem ents in a story have a high literary and truth- value. Some expectations are clearly m ore powerful than others, because for all readers, certain assum ptions override othe rs. For exam ple, in the m edia debate over the \"Moon Hoax,\" the NY Sunday News deferred its own judgm ent about the illogica lity whene ver the astronom er could be reached for comment. Poe weighted som e of his own criteria for a successful hoax over others, a ra nking im possible to observe in the extraction of criteria given above. Howe ver, comments in all versions of his essay abou t the com petition of his hoax with Locke's ho ax indicate that Poe ranked four of the criteria (the Novelty, Sensation, Presentation, and Verisim ilitude cr iteria from Table 4) in orde r of the stren gth of their impact on readers: 135 The singular blunders to which I have referred being properly understood, we shall have all the better reason for wonder at the prodig ious success o f the hoax. N ot one person in ten discre dited it, and (strange st point of all!) the doubters were chiefly those who doubted without being able to say why \u2014 the ignorant, those uninform ed in astronom y, people who would not believe because the thing was so nove l, so entirely \"out of the usual way.\" A grave professor of m athem atics in a Virginian c ollege told me seriously that he had no doubt of the truth of the whole affair! The great effect wrought upon the public m ind is referable, first, to the novelty of the idea; secondly , to the fancy-exciting and reason -repressing character of the alleged discoveries; thirdly , to the consum mate tact with which th e deception was brought forth; fourthly , to the exquisite vraisemblance of the narratio n. (Poe Literati: Richard Adam s Locke 161 [e mphasis is mine]) Poe feels ov erall th at wh en it cam e to weighing the scientific inaccu racies of Locke's story against the novelty of moon-bison and m an-bats, people allowed them selves to be swaye d by the no vel and sen sation al. C ompetition s like th is between readerly exp ectations on ly em erge in th e face of a particular in terpretive question such as, \"Are the m oon-bison re al?\" So, the following is a graphic repres entation in Optim ality Theory of a possible \"f ilter\" that a re ader of the moon story would have had when faced with deciding on its truth -value. Th e reader in Table 10 ranks his/her expectations as P oe projects: 136 Table 10: G raph of decision about truth-value of Locke's m oon bison* Novelty Sensation Popsci. Plausibility Internal Coh. \u0016TRUE ******** * FALSE * * *! This table is sim ply another way of expressing Poe's argum ent. Poe claim ed readers who believed Locke's hoax ranked novelty, sensation, and \"veris imilitude\" (th e r esemblance to a real sc ience r eport) over no f ewer than nine math errors and one internal inconsistency (Locke equivocated on the focusing power of the teles cope). The solid ver tical lin e loc ates the competition \u2014between f irst im pressions and f actuality, esse ntially. The dotted lines deno te a lack of e vidence for com petition in this particular decision about the truth of the hoaxes: i.e., Novelty, Sensation and Popsci. (\"verisim ilitude\"), since they are separated by dotted lines, are equally r anked in this reader 's estim ation; thus, these expectations \"wor k together\" rath er than compete with each other as the reader reads. In the graph the nine factual errors in Locke's story are counted with nine asterisks representing eight violations of Plausibility and one of Internal Coherence. This, of course, assumes that the average read er recogn ized all nine * In general in this no tation, which is an inheritan ce from Optim ality Theory as d escrib ed in Methods, w here there is a com petition between two constraints (for exam ple, authority vs. l ogic) a solid line appears between them . Where there is no com petition, either becau se the constraints do not interact with each other o r because we do not hav e enough data to determ ine if they co mpete with each o ther, there is a dotted line be tween them. An asterisk indicates a violation of a particular expectation under a certai n interpretation, and an exclam ation mark indicates a fatal violat ion that ends the gam e and decides a winning interpretation, which is indicated by a check m ark. 137 errors, which was indeed the assum ption Poe w as making in the passage from his Liter ati essay just above. In spite of al l the faulty ev idence, Poe's projected reader believes Locke's story to be true sim ply because to consider it false would force the adm ission that som ething novel, sensational, and \"verisim ilar\" is not true; in this re ader's world-view, the cor relation betwe en spec tacular first impressions and truth cannot bear violat ion. The exclam ation point on the chart indica tes th at all vio lations at th is highest level of expectation are unacceptable (the conven tion is to m ark unaccep tability on th e very first violation th at renders the candid ate interp retation unacceptable, a nd this is usually the weakest or right- most violation on a given level, as exp ectation strength in creas es from right to left). Thus, the candid ate with m ore tota l violations ac tually wins in this case because of the very low value ass igned to scien tific accuracy by the read er. This accurately represen ts Poe's com plaint a bout L ocke's read ers' values. Now, a table of Poe's personal reading of the stor y would be alm ost exactly the reverse of the one above, with his preci ous \"analogical truth\" in th e form of plausibility and consistency ranked very firm ly over nove lty, s ensation, and es\" that coul d be expe ctations is potentia lly inf inite; as the text is \"always op en\" and pro duces new m eanings with each rea ding and with each reader. Som e of the gam es we could pl ay with Locke's hoax would bring other pairs of exp ectations into com petitio n with each other. As a lready m entioned, the New York Sunday News ranked Authority o ver Plaus ibility in its interpr etive game. Entertainm ent is a particu larly inte resting constrain t, because when it is in 138 operation as an expectation, it forecl oses on ga mes about truth-value. Entertainm ent would be the highest-ranked expectation for those readers who read Locke's story for pleasure, enjoying its co lorful im ages and turns of language, but who did not care if the details of the stor y we re re al or n ot. In terms of the discussion above about the psychologica l bases of reading fiction, these Entertainm ent readers would \"decou ple\" th e meanings arising from their reading of Locke's story from their world-view. So, E ntertainm rs are eng aged in a readin g gam e a great d eal m ore like fictio n read ing th an news reading. This issue will be addressed below in an exam ination of the reading of Poe's hoaxes as news compared to their later interpretation as science fiction. Another worthwhile observation about th ese reading expect ations is that they were employed both by Poe and Lock e and by the readers of the hoaxes, because writing hoaxes is itself a gam e in reading read ers and guess ing their expectations . For instance, Locke and his editors knew scientific detail was crucial for floating their hoax, but they did not wish to bog down the sensational elem ents of the sto ry in formulas, so they claim to have cu t out a lo t of the m ath for the general reader. This shows that in the ir writing stra tegy (which is also a game in reading their readers), Sensation was ranked over Detail. What we have collected now is a set of expectations\u2014som e of whi ch interact and com pete with each o ther, and som e of which foreclos e on others\u2014 that we can use as a filter throug h wh ich to view the rest of Poe's attem pts. These expecta tions which of the readers' va lues were at 139 stake in the writing and inte rpretation of the hoa xes, and the y may help explain the suc cess or f ailure of the hoax es with those readers. Once we have a clearer view of these questions, then we can fina lly turn to the question of what kind of game Poe was playing with his read ership in these hoaxes, and why. 4. T HE \"BALLOON -HOAX\" Poe's next attem pt at a hoax was on April 13, 1844, when an \"Extra\" to the regular Saturday ed ition of the New York Sun trum peted the f ollowing in \"magnificent capitals\": [Astounding News Express, via Norf olk!\u2014The Atlantic Crossed in Three Days! Signal Trium ph . Monck Mason's Flying Machine!--- Arrival at Sulliv an's Is land, near Charles ton, S.C., of Mr. Mason, Mr. Robert Holland, Mr. Henson, Mr. Harris on Ainsworth, and four others, in the Steering Balloon, \"Victoria,\" afte r a Passage of Seventy-five Hours from Land t o Land! Full Particulars of the Voyage!....] (Poe \"Balloon- Hoax\" 496) The orig inal article con tinues, \"The g reat problem is at length solved! The air, as well as the earth and the ocea n, has been subdued by science, and will becom e a common and c onvenient highway for mankind.\" Certainly, this opening must have sa tisfied readers' dem ands for novelty and sensation, as aeronautics were a hot topic in the popular scientific and technical articles of the late 1830s and early 18 40s. Britis h Balloonis t Monck Mason had recently published a m emoir of his crossing of th e English Channel in 140 a balloon, and there was high anticipati on that Mason would soon attem pt something longer. However, more significantly, Poe had wo rked harder on the rhetoric of his piece. Alm ost imm ediately app arent are several ways in which Poe has crafted the language of his new hoax to better m atch reader expectations: First, the ton e of the opening, with its exclam ation marks and use of adjectives like \"astounding,\" is com pletely in keeping with the Mystery in troductions of other science articles. The \"bantering\" tone of \"Hans Phaall\" is gone, replaced by a serious, if sensational, j ournalistic style. Also, no tice that Poe im mediately invokes the problem /solution paradigm curre nt in the popular science reporting of the day with the sentence \"The great problem is at length solved!\". The article goes on to im itate the I gnorance phase of the problem /solution topos by detailing past failure s in aeronautical experim ents. To s atisfy read er expectations about W isdom , Poe then name-drops the fam ed appellations of balloonist Monck Mason, whose diaries Poe c opies for large sections of his repor t (Franklin F uture 94), and of popular British hi storical rom ance writer Harrison Ainsworth. After that, the m echanical Deta ils of the ballo ons constru ction a re focused on to m inute extrem es, and a D ecorative woodcut of the wedge-spiral propeller of the balloon is included. The accou nt ends true to the read er's Use expectations with an overblown assessm ent of the im portance of the voyage and the speculation, \"W hat m agnificent events m ay ensue, it would be useless now to think of determ ining\" (P oe \"Balloon-Hoax\" 505). 141 Did readers respond better to this hoax that seem ingly conform ed better to their expectations of how a true science report should read? The short answer is yes, but co mplicating it is the fact that the only extant eye witness to the reac tion to the hoax is Poe him self, who undoubt edly exaggerates it in his 21 May 1844 letter f or the Colum bia Spy : The ' Balloon-Hoax' made a far m ore in tense sensation than anything of that character since the \"Moon-S tory\" of Locke. On the m orning (Saturday) of its announcem ent, th e whole square surrounding the \"Sun\" building was literally besieged, bloc ked up--ingress and egress being alike impossible, from a period soon after s unrise until about two o' clock P. M. (Mabbott 33) The Sun did indeed sell a record nu mber of copies of the Saturday ex tra contain ing the hoax, 50, 000 accord ing to the es timate in th e Philadelphia Saturday Courier (Thom as 461), and so Poe's jubilation is perhaps founded in reality. He admits that \"of cours e there was great discrepancy of opinion as regards the authenticity of the story; but I observed that the more intelligent believe d, while the rabble, for the m ost part, rejected th e whole with disdain\" (Mabbott 33). This is the sam e argum ent, curiously, that he made about Locke's hoax, but in this case he is using it to aggrandi ze his intelligence and the craftsm anship he inv ested in the scientific detail of this hoax. \"As fo r internal evidence of falsehood, there is, positiv ely, none --while the m ore generally accre dited fable of Locke would not bear even m omentary ex amination by the sc ientific. There is nothing put forth in the Balloon-Story which is not in keep ing with the known facts of a eronautic 142 experience--which m ight not really have occurred\" (Mabb ott 33 ). Poe claim s further that he listened in on people's discussions of the Extra, and the only quibbles he heard with th e story were on account of the reputation of the Sun , since it had published the \"Moon Hoax,\" a nd the difficulty of having gotten news from Charleston so quickl y. Indeed, the editors of the New York Am erican record this critic ism of the sto ry's plausi bility: \"The express, which has hardly outstripped the ordinary m ail, m ust also have brought along a woodcut of the balloon, as the Sun has the picture as well as the stor y\u2014one as good as the other\" (Thom as 458). These doubts on the part of readers correspond to the Medium and Plausibility expectations and, depending on their strength w ith particular readers, might well have had the effect Poe repor ts. T able 11 p resents the \"f ilter\" of expectations of readers like the edito rs of the New York Am erican who disbelieved the \"Balloon-Hoax\" on the basis of Medium and Plausibility. Table 11: D ecision about the truth-valu e of Poe's \"Balloon-Hoax\" by readers valuing plausibility and the re putation of the news m edium Medium Plausibility Popsci. TRUE * *! \u0016FALSE * For these re aders, the f atal v iolations were of Medium and Plausibility, equally ran ked over P opsci., or the story 's \"verisimilitud e\" in conf orming to reader expectations of a popul ar science article. Even though denying the truth of the article m eant negating the article's convincingly-constructed scientific rhetoric, the Sun 's tarnished reputation and read ers' background knowledge of the difficulty of getting m ail so quickly from Charleston sway readers' decisions. 143 The \"Balloon-Hoax\" did not have th e life of the \"Moon Hoax,\" however, and that is because Poe revealed him self as the perpetrator that afterno on. An acquaintance of Poe, Ne w York journalis t and \"free love\" ad vocate Tho mas Low Nichols, wrote in his aut obiography that Poe got dr unk on wine and stood on the steps of th e Sun building the very afternoon of the hoax's debut, shouting out to potential buyers of the Extr a that it was a fake (Falk 48 ). A corroborating bit of evidence is that the S un printed a retr action for the hoax two days af ter its publication, an adm ission that it had stubbor nly refused to stoop to in the case of the \"Moon Hoax\" (Falk 49). By this accou nt, Poe witnessed th e run-away success of his hoax and could not bear for its readers not to know that he was its creator. At most that ad mission cost hi m a day or two of entertainm ent, becaus e the m ails from Charleston alm ost certa inly would have arrived on Monday or Tuesday, sh utting the hoax down. Locke's h oax had be nefited f rom a m uch longer wind ow of play before Hers chel could b e reached for comment. Two dynam ics within the \"Balloon-Hoax\" event deserve special consideratio n. First, P oe used it as a s tage to construct h imself publicly as a notorious expert; secondly, as Poe constructed his pha ntom balloon, he also developed a textual m echanics that cam e to characterize his detective an d science fiction. 4.1 Professionalism, Expertise, and Hoaxing The im age of Poe gloating trium phantly over newsreaders gawking up at him with his hoax still open in their hands \u2014this is a pose worth investigating. For one of the m any rhetorical functions of a hoax is the public notoriety it 144 constructs for its creator. Poe's willingness to step into that role on the front steps of the Sun suggests that it m ay have been a powerfully motivating factor in encouraging him to continue attempts at hoaxing. Scrupulously hiding his identity as a hoaxer, as did Locke, was not f or Poe. Poe wished to b e public ly recognized as a writer whose sc ientific expertise enabled h im to beat scientists at their own gam e and to construct \"discove ries\" for the public that they could not tell from the real th ing. Because of th is motivating force, Po e's hoax ing is bound up with the history of professionalism a nd the construction of public expertise in America. As m entioned above, Poe grum bled about the difficulty of making a living as a professional author and editor wh ile scientists prospered. Although Poe chalks up this inequity to deficiencies in public tast e\u2014and so uses hoaxes to embarrass h is readers for these d eficiencies \u2014the truth is that a whole complex of historical and econom ic factors had m ade it possible for both Poe and the scien tists he resented to m ake their livi ngs as p rofessionals. W illiam Charvat, in his study of the profession of authorship in A merica, says the m ost common definition of professionalism is getting paid to do som ething. As a corrective to this tru ism, he notes that even before Jam es Fenim ore Cooper becam e the first financially successful author in Am erican history, writer s like Susanna Rowson and Joel Barlow could be counted profe ssionals even in the absence of econom ic success because they publicly claim ed the vocation of an au thor (28 ). Their ethos as professio nal writers, by this acco unt, qua lifies them as much as or more than their account ledgers. 145 The expansion of the pub lishing industry in the 1820s finally created an econom ic niche to m atch the rhetorical cl aim-staking of professional authors like Cooper. At the sam e time, as discussed in Chapter One, rapi d industrialization created sim ilar econom ic niches for scien tists and engineers as professionals. While the term \"professional\" m ight const itute their economic identity, the term \"expert\" described their social an d epis temological identity. These experts embodied the ways in which abstruse fi elds of study like electrom agnetics, physics, and chem istry were becom ing assi milated into the hum an social system ; they personified the taming of nature. As such, they served as oracles through which the lay public could interrogate the natural world. But this culture of expertise did no t develop without resistance. The mistrust of elitism that ch aracterized Jacksonian politic s derived in part from a deep public discomfort with second- hand access to crucial knowledge and a suspicion of private agendas on the part of the professionals who dispensed it. Theodore Porter, in Trust in Numbers , marks these facto rs as sign al for the developm ent of a culture of objectiv ity. Porter defi nes objectivity as \"techno logies of trust\" in place of persona l trus t. Measurem ents, standards, and rules, also enabled by an industrial urbanized econom y, allowed lay people to determ ine the extent of their assets a nd experiences for them selves without the questionable intervention of experts. In these ways, a culture of objectiv ity grew up and stood opposed to the cu lture of expertise (202-203). Poe's \"Balloon-Hoax\" fed directly off these tensions between objectivity and expertise in his culture and allowed him to construct him self as a notorious 146 (read, counter-cultural) public expert. By publicly revealing his hoax he demonstrated that the ob jective \"rules\" hi s readers had used to determ ine the truth of his science report f or them selves ha d let them down. His public hum iliation of them formed an im plicit argum ent that they could not trust th emselves to understand science, and they could not even trust scientists, si nce Poe had clearly bested them at their ow n gam e. Poe and his imaginative artistic co lleag ues alon e were qualified as experts in social truth. If readers wanted the truth, they would have to go through professional artists like him . By this chain of i mplications, Poe's hoax s truck agains t Baconian empiri cism and objectivity and for the culture of expertise, with him self at the center of it. In the next chap ters, we will see this function of hoaxing reasserting itself as a m otivation for the hoaxes of Mark Twain, Dan De Quille, nd Alan Sokal. 4.2 Textual mechanics Another striking ent of the \"Balloon-Hoax,\" a nd of \"Hans well, atte ntion to m echanics\u2014m echanics of the machines in the story, m echanics of the story itself. In both hoaxes mechanism fairly overw helm s the plot; one could argue the details about the balloons are the plot. W ith the \"Balloon-Hoax,\" however, the very rhetoric of Poe's hoaxing is becom ing m echanical. In 1836 he ha d laboriously detailed and exposed Maelzel's Chess-Play ing Autom aton as a fake; the gears and cogs in th e cabin et were m erely a front for a chess expert who, from his cram ped position, manipulated the autom aton's arm via levers to move the pieces. Poe was actually practicing his own brand of legerdem ain in this expos\u00e9, as he lifted m ost of it 147 direc tly from magician David Brewster (Pollin 14). W riting hoaxes seem s to be an extension of this engi neering r hetoric. W ith e ach n ew attem pt (includ ing Locke's), P oe tests the rhetorical impact of these \" jeux d'esprit \" on the reader, tweaks an appeal here, adjust s the tone the re. He even co mes to construc t his hoaxes by a m ethod of salvage by recyc ling, in the case of the Balloon-Hoax, whole parts of Monck Mason's Account of a Late Aeronautical Expedition from London to Weilberg as well as a contem porary science rep ort \"Rem arks on the pro pelled b y the Archim edean Screw, describ ed as the New Aerial Mach ine\" (Frank lin Futu re 94). Poe' s prose in these hoaxes builds flying machines. His hoaxes are flying m achines, after a fashion. Contemporary William Griggs apprais ed Locke's h oax as a m ere \"balloon \" that was m istaken f or a while f or a \"ce lestial lum inary\" (Locke answer these ch arges to the letter. In constructing the Victoria , Poe m akes his readers move with him , a step at a tim e, through the building and piloting of the balloon and thus m akes the m co-eng ineers in h is hoaxes. He re is the painstaking detail with which Poe d escribes the principle m eans of locomotion for the Victoria , the Archim edean screw: The screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube, eighteen inches in length, through which, upon a sem i-spiral in clined at fifteen degrees, pass a series of steel wire radii , two feet long, and thus projecting a foot on either s ide. These radii are conn ected at the outer extre mities by two bands of flattened wire \u2014 the whole in this m anner f orming the framework of the screw , which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut 148 into gores, and tightened so as to pr esent a tolerably uniform surface. At each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop. In the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve. From the end of the axis which is next the car, proceeds a shaft of steel, connecting the screw with th e pinion of a p iece of sprin g machinery fixed in th e car. By the operation of this spring , the screw is m ade to revo lve with g reat rapid ity, communicating a progressive m otion to the whole . (Poe, one-eighth of th e total am ount of technical description in the story. I have highlighted cer tain words in the passage that are rep eated, and b y focusing on them , we can appreciate som e of Poe's rhetor ical mechanic s. First, th e scr ew is constructed as a unit. Poe uses the word \"whole\" to alert the reader th at what they hav e read to that point com pletes th e construction of the screw proper. The second m ention of the \"whole\" at the end of the passage, refers to the balloon and tells th e reade r how the screw fits and functions as a part of th e balloon. In finer detail , the screw is constructed rhetorically a step at a ti me, with each com ponent fitting into the next until th e function of the entire sc rew in context is apparent. The words \"screw, \" \"radii,\" \"tub peated, and their repetitions are layered in with each other such that each piece of th e screw lead s the reader to the next piece in the assem bly. The screw is lite rally co nstruc ted an d put into play before the reader's eyes. Poe's readers are r eading an engineerin g schem atic. Recall, 149 too, that this story was accom panied by an engraving of the Archim edean screw, so at each stage in th e construction the reader could co mpare her m ental model of what she had constructed so far to the graphic. Poe's cas ting of the reader as co-en gineer is not insignificant. Not only does the reader m entally construct a balloon as she reads, she also constructs the hoax, becau se th e ballo on\u2014its l of verb \"comm unicate\" to describ e the en ergy transfer in the Victoria 's propeller. Both the balloon and the text are perform ing the sam e function\u2014implicating the reader in pulling the wool over her own eyes, as by the time she is done reading, sh e can see nothing but the ge ars, shafts, and pinions spinning in the text, cleverly hiding, wh ile also m echanically accom plishing, Poe's real agenda. Poe is practicing a mechanics of rhetoric with thes e hoaxes that will in Eureka , influence his v ery concep tion of how reality works. 5. \"T HE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M. VALDEM AR\" In the December 1845 edition of The Am erican Review: A Whig Journal , subscrib ers read \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdem ar\" by Edgar A. Poe, which began as follows: Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder, that the extraordinary case of M. Valdem ar has excited discussion. It would have been a m iracle had it not\u2014 especially under the circum stances. Through the desire of all parties con cerned to keep the affair from the public, at le ast for the present, or until we had farther opportunities for investigation\u2014through our endeavors to effect this\u2014a garbled or 150 exaggerated account m ade its way into society, and becam e the source of many unple asant m isrepresentations, and, very naturally, of a great deal of disbelief. It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts\u2014as far as I comprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these: [Poe, 1845 #30 561] Roland Barthes has done a close reading of the language P oe uses in this piece, and in the open ing, Barthes finds two \"codes\" operating (codes are complex constra ints on interp retations sim ilar to the \"filters\" of reading expectations we have been exam ining): the code of the enigm a, and the code of science (Barthes 87-89). The enigm a code, as Barthe s describ es it, is very similar to the requirem ents for the Mystery expecta tion. An enigma operates by lack\u2014 astonishm ent, wonder, ignorance. Barthe s points to the li nguistic cue of the definite article \"the\" introducing \"the ex traordinary case\" and \"the affair\"; the definite article registers a linguistic presupposition that th e case/affair exists in the world of Poe's readers and that they should be aware of it. \"The facts\" and \"the circum stances\" presuppose an enigm a or m isunderstanding that will now be cleared up. The noun phrase \"the facts\" also i nvokes the code of science, through which, acco rding to Barthes, sc ientists tr y to po sition their endeavors outside the realm of literatu re. Th e code of s cience is a concentrated attem pt by scien tists writing science to supplant sym bols\u2014and, indeed, all symbolic construction of 151 meaning where one thing stands for anot her\u2014w ith \"f acts\" which sim ply are an d communicate truth immediately. O f course , Barthes would probably be the first to agree that science has its own sym bols, but his point here is that Poe uses language in the opening of \"M. Valdem ar\" th e way that scientists use language in order to con vince h is readers to pu t thei r trus t in his eyewit ness account of the \"extr aordin ary case.\" T he enigm a code and the scien tific co de are in co mpetition with each other through out this story, inas much as enigm as disguise tru th behind symbols or clues, while science seeks to channel truth as ymbolically through facts, acco rding to Barth es. Poe's story continues past this en igmatic opening to detail a case of mesmeric suspended anim ation, in which the dying M. Valdem ar is hypnotized at the point of death. W hen he is taken out of th e trance state, months later, he immediately decom poses in his bed, having be en in fact dead the entire tim e. Poe discusses Valdem ar's medical condition prior to his death in great scientif ic deta il and lis ts the nam es of several im portant doctors attending the case but excises all but the first letters of their nam es: Dr . D____, Dr. L____, etc. This device is an interesting variant of the nam e-dropping that is characteristic of the W isdom and Authority expectations from popular sc ience writings. This elision possibly derives from eighteenth and nineteenth- century novels of social critique and expos\u00e9 such as Laurence Sterne's Sentim ental Journey . The design of the convention is to convince readers that this case is so sensatio nal and extraordinary that the famous people involved (doctors, in this case) wish th eir involvem ent in it to be kep t priva te in order to in sulate their public reputations. Poe refers to 152 Valdem ar him self as \"well-known\" as a tr anslator of various fa mous European works and provides a list of phony credentials. The Popsci. expectation is m et in this story because the language of Poe's account of the m esmerism itself m atches ve ry closely the m edical case studies at this tim e, particula rly m esmeric case studies which inclu de dialogu e with the mesmerized subject. It is likely th at Poe consulted several sources in giving Valdem ar an authentic rhetorical feel, particularly a reprint of the Rev. Gibson Smith's pamphlet \"Lectu res on Clairm ativeness, of Human Magnetism \" featuring the work of clairvoyant Andrew Jackson Davis (Carter 36). The story was believed widely and repr inted copiously in England, even in the London Tim es (Poe Lette rs Vol. 2 319). Elizabeth B. Barrett herself wrote to Poe exclaim ing that the story was \"throwi ng us all into 'm ost adm ired disorder,' and dreadful doubts as to whether 'it can be true,' as the children say of ghost stories.\" Poe's responses to the m esmerists who wrote to him asking for confirm ation of the account's truth are strangely cagey equivocations, rather than gloating denials. Poe wrote the follo wing to Arch Ram say in St onehaven, Scotland, in response to a query ab out \"M. Valdem ar's\" authenticity: \"Hoax\" is p recisely the word suited to M. Valdem ar's case. The story appeared originally in \"The Am erican Review\", a Monthly Magazine, published in this city. The London papers, comm encing with the \"Morning Post\" and the \"Popular Record of Science\", took up the them e. The article was g enerally cop ied in England and is now circulating 153 in France. S ome few persons believe it\u2014but I do not\u2014and don' t you. (Poe Lette rs Vol. 2 337) Poe curiously adopts the stance not of an author but of a bystander lacking the authority to pronounce definitively on the truth of the hoax when he writes, \"Som e few persons believe it \u2014but I do not\u2014and don't you.\" Whether Poe actually in tended \"M. Valdem ar\" as a hoax when he wrote it is unclear. He claim s he did not, in a letter to E vert Duyki nck in 1848. However, it is quite possible Poe was c ontinui ng his deliberate tinkering with the expectations of his reading public with this ta le. It certa inly seem s that way, given that he re-performed all of the Pops ci. reader expectations perform ed in the \"Balloon-H oax.\" In addition, Poe satis fies the S ensation an d Novelty expectations in spades b ecause th e effect of Valdem ar speaking from the dead and rotting away in front of the reader was very unusual for a st aid po litical jou rnal like the W hig Review . Also, as Barrett testifies, Po e chooses for this tale a topic just as brim ming with novelty as aviation\u2014m esmerism. As Barthes points out in one of the rare \"crossings\" of history into his analys is, 1845 was perhaps the height of the m adness and \"scientific illusion \" concern ing m esmerism (called m agnetism in Europe) (Barthes 89). This is one of the m any ways in which we are hampered in our readings of Poe's hoaxes. W hile to us hypnotism and m esmerism are the last things we would call hard science, the s ituation was m arkedly d ifferent in Poe's time, when pain less births and surgeries w ere allegedly being perfor med under hypnosis (Barthes 92). As mentioned earlier, articles on m esmerism appeared as late as 1840 in respected 154 scienc e jour nals like of Science . Poe's hoax was launched into a perfect opening, again, crea ted by intense public desire to know more of a scientif ic world that the la y reader had scant acces s to, a desire to which mesmerism was also responding as a la y-practiced \"scien tific\" profession. In spite of all this evidence for de liberate design, it is just as likely, however, that in \"M. Valdem ar\" Poe m ay have been experim enting with mesmerism in fiction along the vein of his detective stories, si nce he demystifies the enigm a of M. Valdem ar's case step- by-step m uch as he does with Dupin's mysteries. Poe m ay have inadvertently created a hoax through his publication of the story in a m agazine known for news re porting as well as fiction, through his adherence to a style of writing consistent with science w riting in general and medical case studies in pa rticular, through his preten se of nam e-dropping, and through his fortunate exploi tation of an issue at the forefront of public consciousness\u2014the validity of m esmerism. This second explanation accounts equally well for Poe's ambivalent reactions to readers' requests for verification. The telling clue in this dilemm a is Poe's reaction to readers' responses. Once Poe realized he had fool ed so me of \"M. Valdem ar's\" readers, h e decided to own the hoax and capitalize on its public ity. Th is reaction is a piec e to o ur puzzle of author intentionality in hoaxing, a piece that would not be availab le to us in a strictly text-based analys is of the genre. \"M. Valdem ar\" counts as a hoax because readers constructed it as such and Poe owned that construction. W hether he intended to m ake a hoa x when he wrote the story is irrelevant. Since the hoax is not a text, but tim e-and-space-bound ex chang e with read ers, Poe had m any 155 opportunities over the months of debate su rrounding the story to construct him self as a hoax er, and he ind eed did. Therefore, \"M. Valdemar\" coun ts as a hoax ide, \"M. Valdem ar\" still adhered to Popsci. expectations and appeared in a journal carrying news, so readers still had to decide on its truth-value. For the pur poses of our project, it is that interpretive d ecisio n that m akes \"M . Valdem ar\" worthwhile as a site to exam ine the interaction of reading expectations about science news. There is a fascinating dynam ic operating in \"M. Valdem ar\" that m ay hel p explain its com plex effect on readers and that can only be explained in term s of readerly expectations. Barthes attribut es the appeal of \"M. Valdemar\" to its \"undecidability,\" to the fact that Poe invokes several com peting codes simultaneously with his language in the tale\u2014as when he invokes the enigm a code and the scientific code, for example, with the phrase \"the facts\" but does not give the reader enough inform ation to \"chose which is 'true,'\" the m ystery story the scien tific repor t on m esmerism (Barthes 96). The story's adherence to Popsci. expectations invokes th e code of science. But the enigm a code, with its presupposition of m ystery, with its elided nam es and ej aculations of disbelief, constructs a puzzle instead of truth. W e have not witn essed the enigm a code in operation in popular science writing outsi de of the Mystery expectation for introductions; it is a code that perhaps be longs more properly to genres like folk tales, ghost stories, and my stical religious rhetoric. This conf usion of two \"f ilters\" of reading expec tations m ay explain why Poe reported receiv ing so m any questions abou t the truth o f the tale. His story, 156 strung stylistically betw een two g enres, disabled m any readers from making even a provisional decision for them selves about its truth-value. Through the invocation of two conflicting cod es or \"filters\" of reader expectations\u2014one applic able to repor ts of scientif ic fact, and the other em ployed in the reading/hearing of m ysteries and \"ghost stories\" in Elizabeth Barrett's words\u2014 Poe gave his readers a truly troubling reading experience. Poe was known for generic innovation. The craze over m esmerism in 1845 afforded him a chance to play with the curious blend of episte mologies it represented\u2014scientific and mystical\u2014in order to destabilize both read ers' perceptions of reality and of generic convention. 6. \"V ON KEMPELEN AND HIS DISCOVER Y\" Poe's last hoax, published just m onths before he died, was the m ost calculated and highly engineer ed of his hoaxing attem pts. The story purported to be a m ore personal follow-up to a series of o ther \"scientific\" repo rts already published in the Am erican m edia about an incredible discovery by Germ an alchem ist, Von Ke mpelen. A lengthy pr eamble discussed and disparaged m any of these other accounts, sayi ng of one that it had a very \"moon-hoax-y air\" (606). Then, still without announcing what ex actly the am azing discovery was, Poe claim ed that fa mous chem ist Sir Humphrey Davy had reported com ing very close to m aking the sam e discovery in his \"Diary\" ; an edito rial comment imm ediately interjected that, lacking \"the algebraic signs necessary, and as the 'Diary' is to be found at the Athenaeum Library, we om it here a sm all portion of Mr. Poe's manuscript.-ED\" (606). 157 Poe went on to link Von Ke mpelen w ith the Ma elzel family, the creato rs of the fa mous chess-playing autom aton wh ich magician David Brewster and then Poe him self debunked. Von Ke mpelen's s upposed reputation in the Am erican media as a m isanthrope was next raised a nd dism issed, and then, finally, nine long paragraphs into the acco unt, Poe reported Von Kem pelen's attem pts to keep his discovery secret and the subs equent raiding of his Brem en flat by police to reveal that he had changed a trunk full of lead into \"gold, in fact, absolutely pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable alloy! \"(610). The acco unt finished with th e news that the price of gold was plum meting in Europe and would soon do the same in America, as a result of Von Ke mpelen's discovery. Poe ostensibly wrote the hoax to take the shine off the gold rush of 1849, or so he claim ed in his letter to Ev ert A. Duykinck of 8 March 1849, where he attem pted unsuccessfully to convince Duykinck to publish \"Von Ke in his journ al the Lite rary W orld: Dear Sir, If you have looked over the Von Ke mpelen article which I left with your brother, you will have fully perceiv ed its d rift. I m ean it as a kind of \"exercise\", or experim ent, in the plausi ble or verisim ilar style. Of course, there is not one word of truth in it from beginning to end. I thought that such a sty le, applied to the gold -excitement, could not fail of effect. My sincere opinion is that nine person s out of te n (even among the best- informed) will believe the quiz (provided the de sign does not leak out before publication) and that thus, act ing as a sudden, although of course a 158 very tem porary, check to the gold-fever, it will create a stir to som e purpose. I had prepared the hoax for a Boston weekly called \"The Flag\"-- where it will be quite thrown away. The proprietor will give m e $15 for it on presentation to his agen t here; an d [page 2:] my object in referring the article to you is sim ply to see if you could not venture to take it for the \"World\". If so, I am willing to take for it $10 -- or, in f act, whatever yo u think you can afford. I believ e the quiz is the f irst deliber ate lite rary a ttempt of the kind on record. I n the story of Mrs Veal, we are perm itted, now & then, to perceive a tone of banter . In \"Robinson Crusoe\" the design was far m ore to please, o r excite, th an to deceive by verisim ilitude, in which particu lar merely, Sir Ed. Seawa rd's narrative is the more skilful book. In my \"Valdem ar Case\" (which was credited by m any) I had not the slightest idea that any person should credit it as any thing m ore than a \"Magazine- paper\" --but here th e whole strength is la id out in veris imilitude. I am very much obliged to you for your reprint of \"Ulalum e\". Truly Yours, Edgar A Poe. [page 3:] P.S. If you feel the least shy about the article, make no hesitation in retu rning it, of course:--f or I will ingly adm it that it is not a paper which every editor would like to \"take the responsibility' , of printing--although 159 merely as a contribution with a known name:--but if you decline the quiz, please do not let out the secret . Poe's references to Mrs. Veal an d Crus oe were to Daniel Defoe's literary adventure hoaxes, and \"Seaward's Narrativ e\" was a diary forged by Jane Porter published in London in 1831 (Poe Letters Vol. 2 434). Bernard Pollin tak es Poe's high ex pectations for his last hoax seriously based on th e succe ss of \"M. Vald emar\" (Pollin 13); however, th e claim that he could cure Am ericans of their gold fever m ight rather have been a ruse to entice Duykinck to publish the story. Daniel Hoffm an argues that Poe's hoaxing was never aim ed at \"show [ing] m en how to amend their ways,\" but rather in \"display[ ing] the f ollies of mankind--and th e personal su perior ity of the Artist- Genius to the gene rality of fools \" (192) . \"Von Kem pelen\" was s old to The Flag of Our Union in Boston af ter Duykinck turned it down, where it a ppeared on 14 April 1849. From the beginning, the story stumbl es over dropped nam es and bor rowed authority: After the very m inute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say nothing of the summ ary in Silliman's Journal , with th e deta iled statem ent jus t published by Lieutenant Maury, it w ill not be supposed, of course, that in offering a few hurried re marks in refe rence to Von Ke mpelen's discovery, I have any design to look at the subject from a scientific point of view (Poe \"Von Ke mpelen\" 605-606). Dom inique Arago was a renowned Fr ench physicist, head of the Observatoire de Paris at the tim e of Poe's ho ax; interestingly, Arago had been 160 one of the first European scientists to publicly denounce Locke's \"Moon Hoax\" in 1835 on John Herschel. Sillim an's Journal , a.k.a the American Journal of Science , has already been discussed in som e detail, and Lieutenant Maury was referre d to briefly; he was a Na vy engineer responsible for great im provem ents in Am erican navigation before the Civil W ar. Curiously, he was also at the helm of th e Southern Literary Messenger for a few years i n the 1840s after Poe had left the paper. Poe seem s bent on f ulfilling his reader s' Authority a nd W isdom expectations in this hoax, along with his usual obsession w ith detail. He lifts whole sections of che mist Sir Hum phrey Davy's m emoirs, and claim s reports of Von Ke mpelen's discovery and personality have already appeared in no fewer than three major papers of th e tim e, the Courier and Enquirer , the Hom e Journal , and Duykinck's Literary W orld. The details from Davy' s diary, which would ostensibly satisfy readers' Detail expectation, are in f act abstracted, fragm entary, and would likely have seem ed ne arly im penetrable and distracting to Poe's readers: But to return to the \"Diary\" of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet was not designed for the public eye.... At page 13, for example, near the middle, we read, in reference to hi s researches about the protoxide of azote ; \" In less than half a m inute th e respiration be ing continu ed, diminished gradually an d were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressu re on all the muscles.\" (60 7) 161 The story is chock full of these so rts of \"samplings\" of institutions, journals, or individu als Poe m ust have felt his reader would recognize and place confidence in. He sticks tight to the Foreign expectation by using Von Kempelen's nam e and nationality to tap into the superior reputation of Ger man science (Bruce 26). To conf orm to his readers' Sensa tion expectation, Poe winds his story up with the sensation al police ra id of Von Kem pelen's flat and the report of the plumm eting gold m arket in Europe. The sagging m arkets, in fact, appeal to the Use expectation by showing read ers the imm ediate pay-off (although negative) of Von Ke mpelen's discovery. Thus, on the surface, \"Von Kem pelen\" appears to m eet most of the expecta tions identif ied in this pr oject, with the exception of Popsci. sub- expectations Long (since no further news was prom ised), Decoration (decorative woodcuts) and Analogy (explanation of phe nomenon with reference to \"real-life\" experiences ); however, these expectations are s omewhat marginal compared to the high-ranked constraints of Sensati on, Medium, and Aut hority. All of these central expectations \"Von Kem pelen\" appare ntly satisfied. And The Fl ag of Our Union did report science news and political ne ws, so Poe's hoax had a fair chance at being bolstered by its readers' Medium expectati ons. W e would therefore expect the hoax to have been very successful with its readers. In fact, however, there is no re corded reaction to \"Von Kem pelen\" whatsoever, and while Poe biograph er Art hur H obson Quinn claim s that the hoax was one of the m ost \"successf ul attempts of Poe to im itate a sc ience repo rt\" (Quinn 596), other scholars seem to agree that \"Von Ke mpelen\" did not m ake 162 anything like the stir P oe had intended. There could be m any reasons for this, some of which m ay simply be due to poor recording: issues of the Flag of our Union for several years surrounding 1849 are m issing, and Poe does not discuss the story in his letters. He wrote fe w letters, anyway, between April and his death six m onths later in October, and they were m ostly frantic pleas for money and comfort. \"Von Ke mpelen\" was sim ply not a priority with him at that tim e. However, assum ing that we have all the reception data we need, and therefore that the public sim ply failed to fall for \"Von Kempelen,\" can the reader expectations we have collect ed help explain the failure of Poe's final, and m ost deliberately crafted, hoax? In fact, given the lack of reception inform ation, the common reader expectations we have collected throughout an exam ination of Poe's and Locke's hoaxes so far are the only chance we have to explain \"Von Kem pelen's \" failure. A few simple observations suggest them selves imm ediately. The Authority expectation s tates that th e prev ious reputation of the author holds, and Poe's readers would, by 1849, associate him with the \"Balloon-Hoax \" at least, if not also \"M. Valdem ar,\" \"Hans Phaall\" and the public debate over the \"Moon- Hoax.\" It did not help his chances for ending up on the right side of the Authority expectation that he m ade m ention in \"Von Kempelen\" not only of the Moon Hoax, but also the Maelzel expo s\u00e9, whic h, even if readers did not know he had forged it, w ould still str engthen th e tie be tween \"Poe\" and \" hoax\" in th eir minds. So, the Authority expectation would actua lly work against him in this hoax. 163 What, then, can be said for the in credible weight of foreign nam es and domestic so urces Poe used to keep \"Von Ke mplen\" balla sted in reality ? Bernard Pollin is of the opinion that Poe actu ally shot h imself in the f oot with his slavish attention to the W isdom and Fore ign e xpectations: \"...['Von Ke mpelen'] is, indeed, a ' tired' kind of hoax, which defeat s its purpose by presenting too m uch of the f amiliar from which readers c ould check on its authe nticity\" (Po llin 14) . Poe's overboard nam e-dropping m ight well ha ve m ade his story ring a bit off-key, as popular science reports usually sacrif iced extensive citation to keep up the excited pace of discovery. It appears Po e might have em ployed so m uch detail in this hoax\u2014with m uch of it fragm entary and random , violati ng expectations of Internal Coherence\u2014that he bogged down the sensational elem ent. Overall, Poe made a m isguided guess that his reader s would rank Foreign, W isdom, and Detail over Sensation. It is also po ssible that Poe's hoax violated Novelty and Plausibility to a small extent. W hile alchem y was certainly the fodder for popul ar fiction in the nineteenth century\u2014the Rosicrucian novel St. L eon by W illiam Godwin being th e stand-ou t example of this sub-genre (Pollin 19 )\u2014the \"pseu doscienc e\" sustain ed no discussion in popular science journals and w as probably counted too m edieval to have a hold on public faith. Poe's s eemingly unerring sense of what exploration, cryptography, and hypnotism \u2014seem s to have gone awry in this f inal hoax. 164 In conclusion, three important obse rvations can be made about the interaction of reader ex pectations in the hoax-reading exp erience as a result Kem pelen's \" failu re: Novelty and Plausibility m ay be consistently ranked above Popsci., contrary to Poe's ranking, which put s Popsci. or \"verisim ilitude\" over Plausibility. \"Von Kempelen's \" failure shows us that if alch emy is sim ply not a novel or plausible scie ntific topic, it will not m atter to the reader how close its presentation mimics a \"true\" science repor t. Th is ind icates a ranking of experience with the topic over trust in rhetorical form . Expectations are not met or violated in isolatio n, but in interac tion with other expectations. Poe ha d a g reat deal of detail in this story. But s ince Detail appears to com pete with Sensa tion in popular science reading, too much detail retards sensation. Ex pectations can fail by being over-m et just as well as by being under-m et, de pending upon their interactions with other expectations. Poe inte rpolated a gre at dea l of \"tangen tial\" information between the Popsci. elem ents. In m , the tone of \"Von Kempelen\" is ch atty and gossipy, m ore typical of one of Poe's Literati portraits than a news story.11 Interpolation of m aterial from ot her genres, as seen in the case o f 11 One of these tangen ts is a section th at mocks George Evele th, a medical student and regular corresponde nt of Poe, who t ried to steal som e of Poe 's glory after the pub lication of Eureka by claim ing to have already had and circulated some of the central id eas in it, accord ing to Berna rd Pollin (17 ). Poe rena mes Eveleth \"Kissam ...or is it Mr. Quizzem ....\" The passage reads in part, \"It seem s to me quite incredible that any m an of comm on understanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam says he did, a nd yet have subsequently acted so like 165 \"M. Valdem ar,\" can con fuse readers a nd m ake it dif ficult f or them to play decisive interpretive gam es. Po e's non-linear personal commentary in \"Von Ke mpelen\" m ay have obscured the Popsci. elem ents for his readers. When viewed from the perspective of common reading expectations, P oe's final hoax appears to have failed because, ironically, Poe tried too hard. In a concentrated attem pt to m imic all the features h e believ ed to drive a su ccessful hoax, he overloaded the stor y with fragmentary deta ils, citations, and c omments that blurred its structure and confused its readers. 7. S OLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS IN POE SCHOL ARSHI P In this project I have redefined hoa xing as a m eta-genre\u2014a gam e played between author and reader in a news m edium over readers' expectations about a particular genre, science news, in this case. This approach to Poe's hoaxing revise s prev ious work o n it in two important w ays: it ac counts f or the multiple generic classifications of Poe's hoaxes over the years, and it restrains the over- application of the term \"hoax\" that has plagued P oe scholarship since the 1960s. First, acknowledging that we must theorize read er ex pectations to understand hoaxing helps account for the confu sion over h ow to classify Poe's hoaxes since their original printings. For exam ple, we are now prepared to explain why \"M. Valdem ar\" is classified both as a hoax\u2014by Poe's a baby\u2014so like an owl\u2014as Mr. Kissam admits that he did. By-the-way, who is Mr. Kissam ? And is not the whole paragraph in the Courier and Enquirer a fabrication got up to 'm ake a talk'? It m ust be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoax-y air\" (606). The snide sim iles and chatty tone of this passage are very out-of-keeping even with the rela tively serious language of the first paragraph of the story, reproduced in the te xt above. This language had to have thrown a wrench in read ers' inte rpretive p rocess es. 166 contem poraries and by curren t science st udies scholars lik e Alexander Boese\u2014 and as a science fiction tale by critics like Roland Barthes a nd Bruce Franklin. The generic am biguity is not a strictly textual function but resides in shifting reader expectations about m edium and context. Changing the m edium of publication changes the criteria by which th e reader assesses the truth-value of th e story. When a reader encounters \"M. Valdem ar\" in a literary collection, it is m ost likely that she suspends judgm ents on truth-values altogether, sin ce those are not decisions pert inent to fiction reading. When the original readers of \"M. Valdem ar,\" however, encountered the story in The Am erican Review , which regularly carried political and science news, decisions about truth figu red cen trally in the ir interpre tation o f the text. Shifts in context have o ccurred as the society in which Poe's readers' live in has changed. George Kennedy describe s this tran sformation th rough the lens of the interpretation of classical rhetor ic texts throughout European history in Classical R hetoric and Its Chris tian a nd Secular T radition from Ancient to Modern T imes. Lette raturiz zazione is the process by which a rhetorical text comes to be read under literary, or \"decoupled\" genre expectations. Kennedy tracks the p rogress of Cicero's De O ratore and L onginus's O n the Sublim e from their Rom an reception as techn ical m anuals for the production of political discourse, to their nineteen th-century Bellet ristic em ployment as catalogues of tropes and rhetorical devices to be repr oduced in literary writings divorced fr om action in the public sphere. Many for ces can drive this shift in reading expectations, but prim ary am ong them is the outm oding of the text's original 167 arena of application\u2014 a dem ocratic assem bly, in the case of Cicero's and Longinus's texts (Kennedy 111-112). In the case of \"M. Valdem ar,\" to take one of Poe's hoaxes for com parison, removing it from its original news m edium and from a heated kairos of debate over m esmerism's scientific potential fo rces generic reevaluation. Readers are incapab le of taking m esmerism as serious ly ten years af ter the hoax's origin al publication, m uch less 150 years late r. \"M. Valdemar\" has undergone letturaturizzazione , has becom e science fictio n by default becaus e its topic is outm oded i n the m odern reading context and it now appears in literary m edia rather than news m edia; thus , it ha s lost its ability to a ffect readers' p erceptions of reality. Any analysis of Poe's hoaxes that ignores the reader's expectations about medium and context in a ssigning a te xt to a gen re will m iss this cruc ial point. It is ha rd to concre producin diach ronic read ings of the story. H owever, comparison of the hoax with a near-contem poraneous piece of science fiction m ay be helpf ul in illustratin g the tran sformations that a contex t can effect on argum ents about scientif ic reality. W riter Fitz-Jam es O'Bri en cam e to New York in 1852 a few years after Poe's death a nd published science fiction stories in literary m agazines like Harper's New Monthly and Atlantic Monthly until he died fighting for the Union in 1862. His stories were on topics rem arkably sim ilar to Poe's the exp erience of someone who f lies into the a tmosphere with the aid of a gyroscope, and \"The Bohe mian\" concerned the never called hoaxes, lik ely becau se they were never fram ed in a news context, which several of Poe's were. Even in the borderlin e cas e of \"Hans Phaall,\" which appeared not in a newspaper but in the S outhern Literary Messenger , our reconstructed reader expectations are st ill sufficient to distinguish Poe's hoax from O'Brien's science y\" app eared in Harper's Month ly Magazin e, which began publishing in 1850, the year after Poe's death. It is on a topic very c lose to \"Hans Phaall\" : in the story, a scientific dabbler m anages to fly high in to the atm ospher e with the aid of a gyroscope. Both stories are contained in literary monthlies, t hough because of its lack of competition, the Southern Literary Messenger was forced to carry a g reat deal m ore political and general news than Harper's was, so Poe's hoax had that advantage. However, com pare the openings of the two stories: \"How I Overcam e My Gravity\" I have all my life been dallying with science. I have coquetted with electricity, and had a serious flir tation with pneum atics. I have never discovered any rtheless I am continually experim entalizing. My cham bers are lik e the Hall of P hysics in a Univers ity. Air -pumps, pendulum s, prism s, galvanic batterie s, horse-shoe m agnets with big weights continually suspended to them : in short, all the par aphernalia of a modern m an of science are strew n here and there, or stowed away on shelves, m uch to the disgust of the m aid-servant, who on cleaning-day 169 longs to enter the sanctuary, yet dare not trust her broom a midst such brittle furniture. (O'Brien 779) \"Hans Phaall\u2014A Tale\" By late accounts from Rotterdam that city seem s to be in a singularly high state of philosophical ex citem ent. Indeed phenom ena have there occurred of a nature so com pletely unexpected, so en tirely novel, so utterly at variance with pre-concei ved opinions, as to leave no doubt on my m ind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all Physics in a ferment, all Dyna mics and Astronomy together by the ears. (Poe \"Hans Phaall--a Tale\" 565) It is dif ference betwe en rheto rics of thes e openings intuitiv ely. Poe's s eems much m ore serious and ne wsy than O' Brien's . The difference is actually attributable to the Mystery exp ectation. Poe is introducing an \"unexpected\" \"novel\" disc overy. O'Brien is rather humorously setting the stage for a personal account of misadventures in science. Readers would not be likely to confuse O' Brien's rhetoric for that of a science news report, espe cially as in its orig inal prin t con text it imm ediate ly followed an extraordinarily sappy love story entitled \"C ool Captain.\" At least \"Hans Phaall\" had the good fortune, for its hoaxing projec t, to s hare the pag e with a non -fiction piece\u2014a critical h istory of Englis h poetr y. This sim ple com parison of the rhetoric and imm ediate prin t context of O'Brien's scie nce fiction with Poe's hoax does not settle the issue of the confused class ification of Poe's hoaxes, but it 170 offers additional evid ence that reader expectations m ust be consulted when assigning texts to genres. The other m ajor contribution a r eader-expectation-based m ethodology makes to the conversation about Poe's hoaxi ng is to help salvage that activity as something special and s ignifican t as com pared to Poe's oth er fiction practices. Beginning in the 1960s, there was a strong tendency in Poe sc holarship to re - categorize most, if not all, of his tales as \"hoaxes.\" In the vanguard of this trend was Richard Benton's \"Is Poe's 'The A ssignation' G.R. Thompson's \"Is P oe's 'A Tale of the Ragged Mountains' a Hoax? \" and a slew of other analyses claim ing hoax stat us for \"The Mystery of Marie Rog\u00eat,\" \"The System of Dr. Ta rr and Prof. Fether ,\" \"T he Murders in Matthew, in her 1975 dissertati on \"Form s of the Hoax in the Tales of Edgar Allan Poe,\" finds that all of his tales are ho axes\u2014either external ho axes fooling readers or internal hoaxes giving Poe himself pr ovisional illusions of epistemological stability. Published a few years after that analysis, the essays in Dennis Eddings's 1983 collection The Naiad Voice: Essays on Poe's Satiric Hoaxing mark the height of this fashion of hoax-hunting. This tr end was ostens ibly well-m otiva ted, as P oe actua lly used the wo rd \"hoax\" in reference to his jeux d'esprit in the news media; in addition, his predilection for codes, cryptogram s, and other form s of \" mystification\" was legendary. Com plicating these re-analyses of Poe's tales, h owever, is the f act tha t in m ost of them , the sam e story was indisc riminately a ssigned to sever al related 171 genres. For exam ple, G.R. Thom pson refe rs to tales like a s \"hoaxlike parodies\" (454), and Benjam in Franklin Fisher variously categorizes of \"Tarr and Fether\" as \" hoaxing,\" \"self-parody,\" \"satiric,\" and \"burlesque\" all in a single page (136). Some of this generic confusion can be easily clarified through more rigorous atte ntion to the special effects of parody, satire, and burlesque on readers, as dem onstrated in Chapter One. However, in addition, viewing hoaxing as a special ga me in guessing and satisfying reader expectations provides a powerful tool fo r focusing the ap plica tion of the te rm \"hoax\" cor rectly and pr ecise ly in P oe critic ism. To illu strate this poin t we can revise from a rhetorical perspective two of the m ore recen t reclassifications of Poe's fiction as hoaxes. John Bryant, in his study of \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" in \"Poe's Ape of UnReason,\" determ ines that the story is in reality a hoax. Bryant cites the sociology of Johan Huizinga and Clifford Geertz in a definition of Poe's hoaxing practice as a \"satiric antiritu al\" that in its m ean-spiritednes s denies its re aders the comic closure of being able to laugh at them selves and thus to release the tension of the author's attack on them (Bryant 28). This analysis jib es with the pictu re of hoaxing we have been developing in m any ways. However, in illustrating the \"satiric antiritu al\" of Poe's hoaxin g, Brya does not choose one of the m edia hoaxes. Instead, he focuses on what is wide ly co nsidered to be the f irst detec tive story. Bryant claim s that \"Rue Morgue\" is a ho ax because Poe hides th e clues to the L'Esplanayes' deaths so well that the reader cannot figure them out and m ust defer to Dupin's genius and his elev enth-hour revelation of the clum p of 172 orangutan hair that clinches everything. Thus, hoaxing, in Bryant's analysis of \"Rue Morgue,\" is sim ply not play ing straight with the reader. While \"Rue Morgue\" an d the m edia hoaxes ind eed share a comm on theme of science\u2014the newly-developing field of forensic science, in the cas e of \"Rue Morgue\"\u2014s everal dissim ilaritie s between the r hetoric of the two practice s, and the conditions of their publication, suggest that Bryant's crying hoax over \"Rue Morgue\" is prem ature and threatens to e fface a rich and im portan t distinction in Poe's rh etorical practices. Poe was very aware of the rh etorical gam e he was playing with readers in h is detec tive tale s like \"R ue Morgue,\" and it was a gam e quite different from the one he played in his m edia hoaxes. He intended the secret machinery of his hoaxes to rem ain co ncealed for the duration of the readin g, for at least som e of his readers. By contrast , in his detective fiction, Poe ad mitted to having \"woven\" highly artificial myster ies that he would then set about \"unraveling\" before the reader's eye; th is becam e such a standard rhetorical procedure for him , in fact, that he grew weary of it and ope nly burlesqued him self doing it in \"Thou Art the Man!\" (Fusco 92). So, the first and m ost obvious response to Bryant's hypothesis about th e hoax status of \"Rue M orgue\" is Occam 's Razor: what d o we have to ga in by reclass ifying \"Rue Mo rgue\" as a hoax when Poe has already identified it as a special sort of rhetorical m ystery- making distinct from the parasitic m eta-rh etoric of the science hoax? Bryant would perhaps argue that acknowledging \"Rue Morgue\" as a hoax uniquely revea ls the \"satiric an tiritual\" Poe puts his read ership through to h is benefit and their sham e. But it is hard to see how a reader encount ering \"Rue Morgue\" in the 173 very literary Graham 's Magazin e in 1841 would experience that tale in the sam e way as Locke's \"Moon Hoax\" or Poe's \"Ballo on-Hoax\" in the New York Sun ; thus, the Medium expectation serves to cl assify \"Rue Morgue\" as literary fiction rathe r than news. Adm ittedly, th e opening o f \"Rue Morgue\" does u se a f ew words that would fit the Mystery expecta tions of science newsreaders, words like \"glories\" and \"enigm as.\" However , they do not describe a new discovery, but rather abs tract psycho logical concepts: The m ental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in them selves, but little sus ceptib le of analysis. We apprec iate them only in their effects. W e know of them , among other things, that they are always to the ir possessor, whe n inord inately the liv eliest enjoym ent. As the stron g man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his m uscles into action, so glories the a nalyst in tha t moral activity which disentang les. He derives pleasu re from even th e most trivial occupations bringing his talents into play. He is fond of enigmas , of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exh ibiting in his solutions o f each a deg ree of acumen which appear s to the ordinary apprehens ion prete rnatural (2) This opening is very non-news-like in its m using abstraction and its failure to lay c laim to the witness of a spect acular new scientific or technological phenom enon. Already the read er is alerte d that the inte rpretive de cisions they must m ake here will h ave little to d o with establishing the truth-value of the story to follow. The imm ediate failure o f \"Rue Mor gue\" to satisfy the c rucial read er 174 expectations of Popsci. and Medium about science news ensures that the story will no t be r ead as f act, but as f iction. How, then, can Poe targe t the readers of \"Rue Morg ue\" to em barras s them for their dim -wittedness, if they are no t prepared to m ake interpretive decisions that engage their assum ptions about reality ? The reader s of \"Rue Morgue \" are likely practicing \" willing su spension of disbelief ,\" to borrow C oleridge's original de scription in the Biographia Lite \"decoupling\" of m eaning from worl d-vie w that is th e hallm ark of fiction (6). Probably the m ost general attem pt to reclass ify Poe's fictio n Matthew's 1975 dissertation \"Form s of Hoax in the Tales of Edgar Allan Poe.\" As m entioned briefly above, Matthew claimed that all of Poe's fiction was hoaxing, either extern al hoaxes to dupe readers, or internal hoaxes to provide Poe him self with fant asies that p rovisionally stab ilized his erratic m ind. Matthew's definition of hoax fails at a high level, not at a m ore local level like Benton's and Bryant's. Her an alysis e lides the hoax's prim ary function of identifying and tr ansform ing reader expectation s; this cru cial m istake is what allows her to ove r-apply the term . Matthew ignores the fact that Poe's hoaxes transfor m reader expectations a bout genre and about the world. This transform ation is acco mplished th rough reve lation of \"th e truth, \" which runs counter to the argum ent of the hoax and t hus forces readers to reexamine their assum ptions. Either Poe's hoaxes reveal them selves du ring the reading process , for cannier readers, or P oe him self reveals them , for the less canny. No one stays in the dark, or it is not a hoax (\"hoax\" ag ain denotes not strict ly the text but the 175 whole gam e over truth between an author and a reader through a news m edium ). A hoax's very raison d 'etre is to un derm ine expectations. Where, then , is even the \"provisional\" stability that Matthew claim s that the \"internal\" ho axes like \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" prov ided for Poe? Hoaxes are in the bu siness of destabilizing reality, not stabiliz ing it. The preceding are th ree exam ples o f how atten tion to reader expe ctations about genre can help prevent over-applicati on of the term \"hoax\" to all of Poe's work. However, consideration of these problem s has in turn provided a crucial contribution to this project: a provi sional overall ranki ng of the reader expectations collected s o far. The fact that readers read Poe's hoaxes as hoaxes when they are in newspapers but as scienc e fiction or detective fiction when they are in lite rary collections indic ates that the expectations of Medium and Authority dominate other reader expect ations. These high level ex pectations of m edium and author determ ine the kind of interpretive ga me that will be played from there on in. If Medium and Authority support f actual news-reading, then gam es over truth will be play ed, utilizing the expectations a bout th e \"real world\" and the rhetoric of science news collected in this project. If Medium and Authority support a fiction reading game, then the Ente rtainment expe ctation k icks in, the gam e is \"decoupled\" from decisions about trut h, and other im portant literary sub- expectations under Entertainm ent apply, which are beyond the scope of this dissertation.12 Combining this new perspec tive on expectation-ranking with that 12 Interestingly, Zwaan found in his st udy of the effects of m edia that participants who believed th ey were reading fiction reported appreciating the language of the story. His finding jives well with the re actions of contem porary readers of Locke's hoax who ranked Ente rtainm ent highly in their interpr etive 176 garnered from consideration of the fa ilure of \"Von Ke mpelen\" and Poe's own overt ranking of reader expectations, I suggest the following provisional ranking of reader ex pectations f or anteb Again, ranking is from ri ght to left, lowest- ranked to highest-ranked. Double angle brackets \">>\" de note levels of rank, as w ould solid vertical lines in the tabular notation. Comm as, like the dotted lines in the tabular notation, indicate lack of evidence for competiti on, and therefore equa lity of strength, among expe ctations in a given level of rank. Starting at the lowe st level of rank, Foreign and Intern al Coh erence are relatively local expe ctations tha t seem to have the sam e strength as Po psci. (v erisim ilitude) ex pecta tions s o far. Clea rly m ore important than these expectations are N ovelty, Sensation, a nd Plausibility, in agreem ent with Poe's own estim ation. expectations about Medium \"trum ping\" any o ther exp ectations in the case of conflict b etween them . Only when these higher-level expectations have been satisf ied are lower- level ones allowed to play decisive roles in decisions about truth. The only disagreem ent so far with P oe's own rankings is my placem ent of Plausibility above Popsci.; Poe felt that readers valued \"verisim ilitude\" more than plausib ility in a science news articl e. The reception of \"Von Kempelen,\" however, illustrated the opposite case: a story whose rhetoric conform ed very decisions. While they did not care about the truth- value of the story, they reported enjoying its imaginat ive structure and language. 177 well to the schem a laid out in Popsci. still f ailed to con vince its re aders. I surm ised in the analysis of that tale that alchemy was not a novel or plausible enough topic to engage readers's belief, a nd so Plausibility of topic was ranked along with Novelty, higher th an Popsci. Although this is a provision al re-ranking of Poe's intuitions, in d efense of it, the plausib ility Poe criticized in the \"Moon- Hoax\" was som ewhat e xpert notion, Kempel en\" is a rough-grained notion based on general public opinion about the m odern a pplicability of alchem y, a very dusty medieval discipline. I believe this latter conception of Plausibility will be m ore widely useful in analyzing hoaxes. This provisional rank ing repres ents the filter the m ajority of Poe's re aders may have been (unconsciously) using when appro aching h is hoaxes. It is unlikely that all of the expectat ions would have figured in any single reade r's interpretation of one of Poe's hoaxes; re ader decisions, as we have seen, tend to focus on just a few com peting expectat ions, even if others are in play unconscious ly. The f ilter, then, syn thesizes the ranking inf ormation f rom the 17 or so extant individual r eading decisions about Poe's and Locke's hoaxes. It therefore represents in skeleton form pa rt of Poe's readers' world -view, their beliefs about science and science news\u2014the ideationa l place where Poe engaged them and built a public relationshi p with them through his ho axing. 178 8. P OE'S RELATIONSHIP TO SCIE NCE AND TO HIS READERSHIP : H OW THE HOA XES INTERACT WITH EUREKA Now that w e have examined the r ules for the gam e Poe was playing with his re adersh ip in his hoa xes, the m ore inte resting question s remain: W hat was he after? And why? These questions both com e into focus by examining his hoaxing practices against Eureka , Poe's fulles t statem ent of the relationship of the writer to r eality and to his/her reade rship. Eureka was published Valdem ar\" and \"Von Kem pelen.\" There is every evidence that Poe felt E ureka would be the crowning achievem ent of his literary car eer, from the excited letters he wrote friends and publishers about the book. It represented an astounding range of scientific and philosophical reading. John Li mon finds that the book's clearest debt is to the Germ an school of Naturphilo soph ie, specifically to Schelling and Hegel, whose works had been published in Eng lish in Am erica jus t a few years before the publication of Eureka (Limon 21). It is actually easy to put the point of Eureka briefly because it was an argum ent that the en tire universe w as constructed and sustained by two and only two opposing forces, gravitati on and electricity, called elsewhere attraction and repulsion, and Unity and difference (Poe Eureka 33,40-41). Poe anticipates deconstructive argum ent by claim ing the univer se is always in th e pro cess of its own undoing: \"My general p ropos ition, then, is this : --In the Original Unity o f the First Thing lies the Secondary Cause of All Things, with the Germ of their Inevitable A nnihiliation \" (5-6). In a slightly iron ic twist of fate, Poe was indebted to Richard Adam s Locke for th is idea. At the age of 18, Locke had written a 179 poem in six cantos about the cyclic destruc tion and rebirth of the universe, and at a Lyceum lecture he gave in Boston on m agnetism , he expounded a refined version of this th eory. Poe availed him self of the pam phlet and the co ncept fo r Eureka (Locke Moon Hoax xxxiii). Poe begins the body of argum ent in Eureka with what has been called a \"hoax,\" but what is really a bizarre re cap of \"Mellonta T auta,\" where a letter fallen from a balloon tim e-traveling from the year 2848 critici zes the nineteenth century for its sc ientific backwardne ss. The old syllog istic philosopher called Aries and surnamed Tottle,\" is ridicu led for its rig as the \"crawling\" shepherd'\" (8-9). The only way to truth, im plies Poe through the tinny voice of the letter- writer, is through the im agination: \"...you can understand how restrictions so absurd on their very face m ust have operated, in those days, to retard the progress of true S cience, which makes its most im portant advances, as all History will show, by seem ingly intuitive leaps . Thes e ancien t ideas confined investig ation to crawling ; and I need not suggest to you th at crawling, am ong varieties of locom otion, is a very cap ital thing of its kind ; but because th e snail is sure of foot, for t his reason must we clip the wings of the eagles? \" (9-10) The letter -writer go es on to co mplain tha t the Bacon ican schoo l of philosophy dem anded t hat every truth be de monstrated em pirically. Because true demonstration of anything is im possible due to the essentially individual and contingent nature of perception and belief, this unjust requirem ent stultified the 180 growth of science, and \"No m an dared utter a truth for w hich he felt him self indebted to his s oul alone\" (10). On the contrary, Poe says when he is done ventriloquizing, to understand a concept as awesom e and indem onstrable as the nature of the very universe, a different m ethodology must be developed. His new scie nce sounds in places a great deal like Dupin's intuitive ratio cination. Here, Poe describes it as a \"whirling on the heel\" on the top of a m ountain in order to take in the whole panoram a in one sublim e blur (6). Of course, the rest of his argum ent about how gravitation and electricity work in the universe smacks a great deal of both Aristo telian syllog ism in som e places and Baconian in duction in o thers. Altho ugh he claim s that it is im possible to prove anything \"axiom atically,\" he of ten works through syllogism s to build one part of his argum ent on another. And he seem s to have a com pulsive need to measure his ideas agains t the \"real w orld.\" But Poe is actu ally attem pting a great experim ent in a slightly different sy stem of r easoning he re\u2014analogy, through which truth is determ ined on the basi s of correspondence of unknown phenom ena to known phenom ena, like the radiation of light and heat (Welsh 170). Poe writes \"a perfect consistency can be nothing but an absolute truth\"(16), and as he does, he indentures him self to Francis W ayland's conception of analogical reasoning, as well as to H umboldt's C osmos, and to Laplace's nebular theory (W elsh 170, 185- 186). It has often been ventured, particularly by critics who have c hosen to view him as a Rom antic, that Poe hated scie nce. Certainly, a cursory reading of 181 \"Sonnet\u2014to Science\" and of his catty comm ents about B acon in Eureka and elsewhere lend credence to this no tion. Bu t a careful exam ination of Poe's hoaxes and Eureka show that P oe was fascinated with science. He just favored his own scienc e of imaginative leaps over what he viewed as the baby-stepping of Baconian induction. Further, he was not against all m odern induction, just the version he believed to be common currenc y in Am erica. His disdain for this plodding sample-collection with no inductive speculation is apparent in a letter for the Colum bia Spy where he reviews the W ilkes expedition.13 He calls it \"encum bered with 'm en of science.' Let som e Yankee open the way (as, assuredly, som e Yankee yet will), and let m en of science follow his footsteps, and geologize at their leisure\" (Mabbott 50). Again, Poe champions the adventurer with im agination over professional B aconian scientists.... and pedlers [sic] of m inute facts, for the most part in physical science; facts, all of which they re tailed at the sam e price upon the highway; their value depending, it was supposed, sim ply upon the fact of the ir fact , withou t ref erence to the licab ility o r inapplicability in the developm ent of those ultim ate and only legitim ate facts, called Law\" (Eureka 11). 13 The United States Exploring E xpedition, begun in 1834, comm anded by Captain Charles W ilkes. Along with Ya le geologist Jam es Dwight Dana, an illustrator an d ethnograp her attended the naval ex pedition to collect and record samples along the W est Coast of the Un ited States, the South Pacific, and Australia. 182 Poe's hoaxing dovetails neatly with this credo about the im agination. His hoaxes, as already pointed out, were desi gned to e mbarrass readers, but for what, and to what end? Daniel Hoffm an has already argued convincingly that Poe was not interested in helping any of his read ers learn m ore about science. W ith his hoaxes, Poe was engaged in a cam paign to embarras s people f or letting the r igid limits of modern sc ience blind them to th e truth they could ha ve apprehended if they had f reed up th eir m inds intuitiv ely. T hus, Poe po ints ou t his superio r scientific-imaginative genius in being able to connive rh etorical contraptions that will dupe th e read ing p ublic. The hoaxes, se en in this lig ht, becom e an indirect argum ent, an advertisem ent, al most, fo r the deduction. In the discussion of Poe's \"Balloon-Ho ax,\" the m echanistic nature of both the hoax and Poe's rhetoric was highlight ed. I argued there that the hoax was actually a sort of m achine or autom aton that took in reader expectations and transform ed them into an experience of sham e or e mbarrassm ent. Daniel Hoffm an ha s found the sam e mechanical aesthetic at work in Eureka . By boiling down the e ntire univ erse into two inexor able and com pletely ba lance d forces, Hoffm an argues that Poe shouts to his r eaders, \"The entire universe is a huge coherent contraption!\" (Hoffm an 281). Further, Hoffm an contends, Poe proves through Eureka , through the Philo sophy of Composition Pr inciple , and other wr itings that h e is essentially a \"m echanician of litera ture and his theories a program for the production of verbal contraptions\" (281) . The hoaxes are som e of these \"ve rbal contrap tions\": Poe care fully built th em, tinkered with them , watched 183 their progr ess in the w orld with th e worried and elated anxiety of an inventor. They are d esigned to transform readers. When they work, they suck readers in and then, af ter spitting them out, leave them to look over the gears and pistons and m arvel at the genius of the m an who was able to do this to them . This le ads u s to the qu estion of what kind of relationship Poe wanted with his read ership, becaus e hum iliation does not endear. Mos t analyses le ave the relationsh ip where we just did: trad itionally, Poe feels \"contempt\" for his reading audience (Matth ew 73). He is the in secure genius who uses his hoaxes to humiliate h is read ership so he can f eel superior. Poe's own b ehavior and writings admittedly s upport this easy dichoto my of \"hoaxers\" and \"hoaxees.\" In addition to his low opinion of the \"readily gullib le\" public express ed in his Literati note on Richard Adam s Locke, Poe else where m ocks the public as \" believers in every thing Odd ,\" whose \"Credulity:--let us call it Insanity at once,\" \"ignorant people\" (\"Fifty Sugge stions,\" 1303). And why else would he throw a monkey wrench in the potentially lucrativ e run on copies of his \"Balloon Hoax\" by announcing it was a hoax, unless he wanted more than money (and he wanted money!), unless he wanted the face-to-f ace experience of forcing a crowd of his reade rs to ad mit their gullibilit y and his creative authority. But this one-dim ensional view of Poe's com plex In an alterna tive view outlin ed in his Reading at the Social Lim it, Jonathan Elm er attributes Poe' s difficult rela tionsh ip with the public to an essen tial incom patibil ity in Am erican dem ocracy between individuality and social assim ilation. Elmer argues that, for a society that 184 cham pions the individual, it is ironic that both th e \"we\" of Am erican society and the \"I\" of the indiv idual cannot b e held in view at the sam e time because each implies the absence of the other. \"' I' becom e riven by m y participa tion in the social whole, and ' it' becomes riven by my exemption from it\"(30). This dynam ic is exa ctly reflected in th e tens ion be tween attr action and repulsion in Eu reka. As Poe points out in the preface, this ten sion in the universe is not prim arily a physical, but a spiritual, social , and poetic principle as we ll. In spiritual term s the philosopher's independent thought creates a difference that always pulls him /her agains t the gravitational force try ing to co alesce every thing in a prim ordial state of Unity. And even though Poe tries to reas sure the ardent individualist that it will no t really sting to lo se one's identity and ge t sucked in to the One, he does not seem to buy his own rhetoric: The utter impossibility of any one' s soul f eeling itself inferior to another; the intense, overwhelm ing di ssatisfaction and rebellion at th e thought; these...are, to my mind at least, a species of proof far surpassing what Man term s demonstration, that no one soul is inferior to another; tha t nothing is, or can be, superi or to one soul; that each soul is, in part, its ow n God--its ow n creator....(135) The spiritual princip le is fast becom ing a social principle here. For in true Heisenbergian form , the closer Poe gets to determ ining hi mself as an individual, the m ore isolated he feels from his co mmunity; conversely, the m ore he allows himself to be absorbed into the m ass of Am erican cultu re, the m ore anxiety and uncertainty he experiences about his personal identity. Karen Roggenkam p 185 claim s this anxiety exp lains Poe's cour ting of the penny pre ss, a jo urnalistic forum he considered beneath him . The fame and notorie ty Locke attra cted with his hoax m ade Poe want som e of it for hi mself. Yet, the closer h e got to identif ying with his rea ders, while tryi ng to guess their exp ectations, the m ore anxious he becam e that he was one of th em, that he, too, was a m ember of the mediocre \"m asses\" that he so longed to prove his superiority to. He commented somewhat ir onically on this d ilemma by way of discussing the social effect of satire in an unpublished draft of his Literati portrait of Laughton Osborn: ...thus in satirizing the pe ople we satirize only ours elves, and can never be in a condition to sym pathize with the satire. It is forgotten that no individual considers him self as one of the mass. Each person, in his own estim ate, is the pivot on which all the rest of the world spins round. He may abuse the people by wholesale, and with a clear conscience so far as regards any com punction for offendi ng any one fro m among the m ultitud e of which that people is com posed. Every one o f the crowd will cry \"en core!--g ive it to th em, the them right.\" [Poe, 1846 #58 inst antiation of Poe's ins ecurity abou t his social identity; they s how hi m both longing to be ab sorbed in a community of fellow think ers, while attem pting to dist ance and dichotom ize the \"m ultitude\" he feared he actually belonged to. A hoax, the process of reading a hoax, materializes a double readership\u2014the read ers who fall for it, and those who catch on and read it as a co-conspirator of the hoa xer rather than as his/her victim . As 186 mentioned before, those two sets of r eaders actually liv e in d ifferent world s formed by their beliefs. It is this sec ond world of readers that is often overlooked in assessm ents of Poe's hoaxing, an audi ence Poe invoked, created, in f act, with the clues he left in his hoaxes for th e acute observer: the goofy underlying meanings of his foreign nam es like Schnellpost , and the fact that \"Han s Phaall\" sets out in his balloon on Ap ril 1, and the use of the nam e \"Kissam \" as a reference to a sycophantic correspondent w hom Poe's friends would have recognized immediately. Kent L jungquist argues that this verbal play is deliberate and \"central to [ the] hoax, a for m that establishes two audiences: those deceived by the author' s ironic dissem bling and those cognizant of hi s satiric purpose\" (Ljungquist 204). Poe would have imm ediately recognized this p otential f or duality in th e mechanics of the hoax because he was al ready at hom e with doublings and double motions in his writing. His tales contai n many pairs of characters who twin each other, reflecting back to each oth er complementary (and often annihilatory) characteristics: M adelin e and Roderick Usher, Dupin and the Minister D, Dupin and the n arrator in Mu rders in the Rue Morgue (Guthrie 94). Eureka , in fact, is a double m otion, both poem and scientific treatise, and the universe in it is a constant double m otion of attraction a nd repulsion, Unity and difference. It is exactly this doubl e motion of attraction an d repulsion that Poe was engaging in with his reader ship: distancing him self from a readership \"too exclusively intent on the m aking of m oney\" to use the ir imaginatio ns or to support artists (Hoffm an 185), while draw ing to him those few to whom he 187 dedicated E ureka, those \"who love m e and whom I love, to those who feel rather than to thos e who think, to the d reamers and those who put faith in dream s as in the only realities\" (6) (Swirski 28). These people Poe deem ed worthy of communion; they could join him \"spinni ng on his heel\" on the summ it of Aetna and agree w ith h im that reality was not what actually happ ened but what cou ld happen. These \"few gif ted individuals, who kneel around the summ it, beholding, face to face, the m aster spirit who sta nds upon the pinnacle\" (\"Letter to B____\" 5), could becom e god- like writers of real ity for Am erican readers. Like the suffocating but strangely com pelling vi sion of communion be tween th e narra tor and Dupin in \"Murders in the Rue Mor gue,\" Poe's hoaxes, when defined as carefully engineered rhetor ical transactions with a double audience, reveal hi m not just yearning for community, but ac tually designing and building it. Accordingly , even h is most tradi tionally esoteric texts, like Eureka and The Poetic Principle , deserve re-exam ination not as uneven attempts at cr eating theo ry, but as complex exercises in creating publics, seeking communion. Such re-readings, although beyond the scope of the present pr oject, prom ise to provide a richer appreciation of Poe's rhetorical an d soci al behavior as a pioneer of Am erica n genres. 188 Chapter Three: M ark Twai n and the Social Mechanics of Laughter It seem s inevitab le that Twain would turn to hoaxing given his penchant for satire\u2014expressed as early as the age of 17 with his first published story, \"The Dandy Frightening the Squatter,\" for the hum or m agazine The Carpet Bag . That he would choose scientific media hoaxing for the m ode of his first published hoax, \"The Petrified Man,\" seem s an equally natural turn f or Twain. Science and technology were preoccupations of his writ ings and business dealings from his jaw-dropping adm iration of the World's Fair in New York in 1853 to his disastrous investm ent beginning in 1880 in the Paige autom atic typesetting machine, which Twain was certain w ould revolutionize the pr int busin ess. However, until now, T wain's f ascinati on with these topics, and with th e philosophy of m echanism , has m ostly be en treated as a bi ographical vehicle through which to psychoanalyze Twain in hi s final depressed year s as a w riter and bereaved husband and f ather. This has been the approach of scholars such as Lawrence Berkove, Tom Burna m, Pascal Covici, Sherw atte Twain's late-life determ inism , none of these authors look to T wain's hoaxing as a necessary com ponent of his philosophy of science. Connecting Twain's hoaxing 189 in \"The Petrified Man\" and the \"Empir e City Massacre\" with his philosophy of scienc e and cultur e in later works like A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court suggests a different conclusion. Inst ead of a mbivalence about the value of science in society, or fatalism about the increasing m echan ization of hum an culture, Tw ain's hoaxing prac tices point to a m ore complicated response to science and technology in Am erican culture . They reveal the double-edged sword of rhetoric as an instru ment of soci al control\u2014and laughter as a complex and constructive response to that rhetor ic, prom oting self-determ ination and independence. To build an argum ent about Twain' s hoaxing toward that conclusion, I f irst rical and sc ientif ic acc ultur ation, focusing especially o n his experience with the tall tale and how that rhe torical activ ity helped lay the groundwork for the developm ent of the m edia hoax. Next, I will consider in detail Twain 's first and m ajor scientific hoax, \"The Petrified Man\"\u2014 both its m otivations, as stated by Twain, a nd the reaction to it. I will u se reade r reactions an d Twain's charac terization of them to f urther modif y the f ilter of science-new sreading expectations developed in the last chapter to acco mmodate changes in kairos since Poe's tim e. Finally, I will com pare the results from the study of Twain's hoaxing against his scien tific thinking expressed in three of his later m ajor fiction works dealing with science and techno logy: 3,000 Years Among the Microbes , The Am erican Claim ant, and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court . Claim s that Twain had no so cial program with his hoaxing 190 will be reev aluated in light of these works, his early hoaxe s, and evidence of his deploying laughter as an attack against the power of science in Am erican politics. 1. R HETORIC AL ACC ULTU RATION 1.1 Formal education If Poe received from his schooling ev erything he would need in term s of rhetorical and scientific training to prep are him to write science hoaxes, Twain's education presents a different picture. In a letter to his brother Orion in 1865, Twain lam ents having little form al rhetori cal cultivation of hi s native talents: \"Though the Alm ighty did His part by m e--for the talent is a mighty engine when supplied with the steam of education --which I have not got, & so its pistons & cylinders & shafts m ove feebly & for a holiday show & are useless for any good purpose \" (Clemens Mark Twain' s Letters 323). Needless to say, in light of our investigation of the connection between Tw ain's rhetoric and his scientific and technological thinking, it is significant to find him thinking of rhetoric in mechanical term s at abo ut the sam e time he is com posing his first hoaxe s. Th e dram atic self-regret perform ed in this lett er, on the other hand, is misleading. Twain prided him self on his work-a-day background and practical self-education as a riverboat pilot, a m iner, and a writer. As a young boy, Twain attended a privat e school in Hannibal costing a quarter a week, and that only infreque ntly, whenever the fishing was no good, accord ing to his Autob iography (40). There, he learned spelling and m ath, recited poetry and prose selections, and was taught to explicate bible stories (41). He may even have been exp osed to some Latin and French on the da ys he deigned to 191 come to class (Hoffm an 15). The most vi vid pictures of what his classroom life might have been like do not com e from his autobiography but from his fiction\u2014 for exam ple, the school scenes in T om Sawyer \u2014and from his reports on schools for the Territorial Enterprise in Nevada. On a visit to Miss Clapp's private school in Carson City in 1864, Twain found that the schoolroom had not changed m uch since the days of his formal tutelage. Neither had the for m of student compositions, in which Twain claim ed to reco gnize these features of his own schoolboy writing: The cutting to the bone of the subject with the very first gash, without any prelim inary foolishness in the way of a gorgeous introductory; the inevitable and persevering tautolo gy; the brief, m onosyllabic sentences (beginning, as a very general thing, with the pronoun \"I\"); the penchant for presenting rigid, uncom promising f acts for the consid eration of the hearer, rather than ornam ental fancies; the depending for the success of the composition upon its general m erits, without tacking artificial aids to the end of it, in the shape of deductions or conclus ions, or clap -trap clim axes, albeit th eir absence so metimes imparts to th ese essays the sem blance of having com e to an end before they were finished--of arri ving at full spee d at a place an d going sud denly overb oard, as it were, leaving a sensation such as one feels when he stum bles without previous warning upon that infernal ' To Be Continued' in the m idst of a thrilling m agazine story. (Clemens MT of the Enterprise 136-7) 192 Twain's per ceptiv e diss ection of this genre of com positio n indica tes a facility for rhetorical an alysis that d oubtless served him well when he wrote in parasitic genres like satire s, parodies, and hoaxes. Cl early, T wain him self did not remain at th is childish level f or lon g in his own com position practices, as he was published by the age of 17. The classroom was not instrum ental in developing his rhetor ical skills. Rathe r, his newspaper appren ticeships, beg inning at th e age of 12, and his affinity with or al narrative and hum orous traditions account for the bulk of Twa in's rhetorical preparation for hoaxing. 1.2 Ne wspaper apprenticeships After the death of his father in 1857, Twain dropped out of school for good and was apprenticed to his brother Orion at the Hannibal Journal , which Orion edited. Twain's duties include d setting type, proofing sheets, and occasion ally com posing advertis ements an d news item s. Working at the pap er acquainted Twain with the actual m echanics of newspaper production as well as the role the paper's rhetoric played in its readers' lives. At a young age, he proved him self already aware of the news medium 's authority to startle people and rem ake their world. An early hoax-lik e joke was printed on the front page of the Journal in 1853: \"Terrib le Accid ent! 500 Men Killed and Miss ing!!\" read the headline. The story went on, \" We had set the above headline up, expecting (of course) to use it, but as the accident hasn' t happened yet, we' ll say (to be continued)\" (Lauber 46-47). It was durin g this tim e that Twain published his first satire in The Carpet Bag in 1852. Then, in 1853, tired of his brother ne ver having enough money to 193 pay him his wages, he left for St. Louis to work princi pally as a typesetter on the Evening News . He stayed only a few months before m oving on to New York City to see the W orld's Fair and to try his hand as a com positor for a printer. Here he em barked on a program of self -education through reading at the local printer's library in the evenings, or so he assured his m other, who undoubtedly feared for his m oral life in the big city. Som etime during this period, he read the satire of Laurence Sterne, Thom as Hood, a nd Ge orge W . Curtis. Twain also liked Oliver Gold smith's Citizens of the W orld, and Cervantes's Don Quixote . In a February, 1861, letter to his brother Orion, he alluded to readi ng Dickens. Other early read ing for which we have evidence includes Th omas Paine's Age of Reason , Volta ire, and W illiam Tappan Thompson's Major Jones' s Sketches of Travel (Emerson 8). Twain enjoyed trav el books in general and Herndon's Travels in the Am azon in pa rticular (Clem ens Autobiography 128). The influences o f these writers, especially the satirists, began to em erge in the pieces Twain wrote for the Spirit of the Tim es, a sporting m agazine that em phasized in the sty le of its articles the \"distinc tion between the f alse and the real and between the pretentious and the unsophisticated \"\u2014all ch aracteristic of oral humor genres like the tall tale and the pra ctical joke (Em erson 4). The satire and travel narra tives he read, whe n com bined with the f rontier hum or tradition and his experience with the m echanics and author ity of news m edia, m ade m edia hoaxing a natural next step for T wain. 194 1.3 Frontier humor: th e practical joke and the tall tale Probably the greatest influence on Twain's hoaxing practices was his experience with frontier hum or\u2014prefigured by his early readi ng of Spirit of the Times and actua lized b y his stin t as a riverbo at pilo t and his m igratio n to the territory of Nevada during the Civil War. This exposure m arks a m ajor difference between Poe's and Twain's hoaxing, but also a significan t comm on thread. Poe went through m uch of the sam e prepar ation for hoaxing as Twain did\u2014living in the North and South with different classes of Am ericans, reading travel narra tives, writing for newspapers. But Poe did not live in the W est, while Twain did f or nearly half his life (Missouri coun ted as the W est at tha t time). Twain s ituated h is hoaxes on the f rontier, since tha t was a lim inal epis temological r ealm f or his readers. Poe, living in the urbane east, had to situate his hoaxes on other border s of American experience\u2014Europe, space, life/death, m atter/energy. W hile frontier humor did not have the impact on Poe that it did on Twain, the idea of the frontier insinua ted itself into both of their h oaxes as th e line where hum an knowledge becam e insecure, and thus where a hoax was mo st effectiv e. It is sign ificant that hoaxing activity died do wn in New York and the East Coast at the sam e time it was working up a good head of st eam in the West\u2014also, that W estern hoaxes were about the W est, not Eu rope or Fiji or the m oon.14 Twain's hoaxing thus responded to two shifts in Am erican hum or, accord ing to W alter Blair and Hamlin Hill. It ch ampioned the little guy, the pio neer, over th e powerful and rich , 14 The one exception to this rule of which I am aware was an 1899 hoax by Denver news men about the Great Wall of China being dism antled. However, China, too, was a sort of American frontie r as it was the focus of foreign trade efforts after the Civil W ar (cf. the \" trade dollar\" controversy in Chapter Five). 195 and it was essentially regional, one reacti on of hum or to the national stresses of the Civil War (Blair 260). The frontier was the new locus of reality-m aking for Americans in m any significant ways, and it is appropriate th at Twain and other news writers on the frontier took advantage of that fact to dem onstrate authority over their readers and over the pow erful new culture of science. Frontier humor, also often called southw estern hum or, is exem plified best by the tall tale and the practica l joke. Pascal C ovici characterizes thes e form s as follows: \"I f there is an y one patte rn basic to the hum or of the Southwest it is precis ely this: a cha racter is pu shed by the author in to a situation in which he either exposes the pretensions of others or him self em erges as rid iculous because of his pretentious be havior\" (Covici 8).15 The satiric or c ritical gist of the tall tale and the practical joke initially appears incongruous with the historical notion of the frontier as a very serious zone of danger and wonder\u2014until the social dynam ics of pioneer life are m ore closel y considered. The frontier was indeed replete with elem ents beyond the control of the pioneers\u2014native peoples, lethal plants and anim als, ghastly weath er. In addition to contending with this environm ent, pioneers had to contend with each other for resources and respectability. The old hallm arks of clas s and caste did not a pply on the frontier. Other m ethods were developed to secure coveted status as a savvy insider and to ostracize ou tsiders. 15 The phrase \"author\" is s lightly m isleading becau se these form s were prim arily oral and were only recorded by authors, as Hooper recorded the Suggs stories, after they had been in circulation for decades. 196 The tall tale and p ractical joke em erged as rhetorical m echanis ms of control along the frontier, wh ich is, after all, \"a country without a history\" (Cox 98), the boundary at which hum an knowledge becom es unstable. Both rhetorical modes excited laughter which provided much-needed d etachm ent from\u2014and therefore a s ense of objective con trol over\u2014 the dangers of frontier life (Covici 7, 31). Neil Harris describes the psychologica l functiona lity of the tall ta le and th e practical joke as \"a way of reducing a hostile and threatening environm ent to human scale by m anipulating its elem ents and so dem onstra ting control over them \" (Harris 71). A good exam ple of this use of the tall tale in Twain's work is the story from Roughing It of Be mis and the buffalo hunt. The band of travelers that the na rrator joins gets stuck af ter cross ing the Platte River when their stageco ach breaks down. They decide to go on a buffalo hunt while they wait for rescue by the next stage, and in the pro cess, the p assenger Bem is gets cha sed by a buffalo and stuck up a tr ee until he c an be retr ieved by the other pass engers. To regain som e face, he tells an elabo rate s tory about the fero city of this particular buffalo and the am azing self-restrain t he de monstrated in not shooting it because if he had, he claim ed, his gun was so power ful it would have killed not only the buffalo but also several of the other pa ssengers in the hunt (61-66). Not only does his tale entertain the other passengers, but it is also an attem pt by Be mis to regain symbolic control ov er both the buffalo and the ensuing hum iliation. This illusion of control served a social function, too, with respect to outsiders on the frontier\u2014\"greenhorns\" or \"city slick ers.\" The telling of the tall tale or perform ing of the practical joke de monstrated, on the part of the insider, a 197 superior level of comfort with and cont rol over elem ents of the f rontie r\u2014wild als, storm outsiders Thus, rhetorical m odes pitted knowledgeable insiders against greenho rns and used m echanis ms of deception and rev elation to force the greenhorns to pub licly acknowledge their outsider st atus\u2014m uch like the revelatory and hum bling m echanism s of the hoax (Lee 142; Cox 15). A good exam ple of this aspect of the tall ta le is the Buncom be Trial in R oughing It . Buncom be, a city lawyer, com es out to a frontier town to try a case in which a house has been m oved on top of another house by an avalanche; the owner of the topm ost house is now laying claim to the land of the bottommost house-owner and wishes Buncom be to repr esent him . The tr ial ge ts more and m ore ridiculous, and m ore and m ore exasperating f or Buncom be, until it is r evealed th at the whole thing was an elaborate charade by the town folk to \"put one over\" on the city lawyer (241-247). A group of insiders cons truct an elaborate tale to consolidate their status and to publicly ostracize an out sider who pretends to have auth ority on the frontier. In th is way, the tall ta le and prac tical joke both served a leveling function. Pioneers bought enthusiastically into the Jacksonian ideal of the absolute equality of common Am ericans and its atten dant su spicion of any kind of aristo cracy or undem ocratic privilege. The worst charge that could be leveled against som eone was that of \"social im personation,\" pret ending to be an insider when you were not, pretending to belong to a higher clas s than som eone else (Cook 26-27). The tall ta le and practica l joke dem onstrated the superiority of the seasoned pioneer 198 over the m ore \"sophisticated\" Easterner, thus rendering old Eastern hierarchies and m ores \"bootless\" on the frontier. An interesting m icro-exam ple of thi s rheto ric is observable in a practical joke played on Mark T wain by Artem us Ward, reported by C.C. Goodwin in his memoir abo ut the salad days of the Territor ial Enterpr ise. Ward visite d Virgin ia City for several weeks in 1863 and went out drinking with the writers and editors for the paper. W ith at least three hu morists in the group\u2014Twain, W ard, and Dan De Quille\u2014there was no sm all am ount of grandstanding as ea ch tried to b etter the others with quips, stories, and jokes. W ard chose an interesting tactic to \"take the stuffing\" out of Twain's pretensions to literary superio rity when he played a practical joke on Twain in which he de fined the word \"sulphurets\" in three incre asingly incom prehensible ways while Goodwin, De Quille, and the others all nodded in mock com prehension. Twain got increasingly flustered at his inability to keep up with W ard's condescending nonsense until W ard finally m anaged to convince T wain via his dullness that he was drunk silly. T wain was livid when the joke was revealed (C ovici 146). The practical joke and the tall tale d iffer from each other in a few important ways, although Twain was a re gular practitioner of both, especially during his Western years. The tall tale is told to the outsid er, while the practical joke is performed upon the outsid er. The practical jo ke is usually m ore individual and circum stantially-bound than is the ta ll tale, which possesses a for mula which may be repeated in different circu mstances to a sim ilar effect. However, th e similar functions of these rhetorical forms with resp ect to f rontier epis temology 199 and sociology m ake them natural predecesso rs to the s cientific m edia hoax; in fact, Constance Rourke, in her fa mous study of modes of Am erican humor, m arks frontier humor as the imm ediate The hoax differs from frontier humor in im portant ways, which Twain exploited, and these will be discussed afte r consideration of hi s first hoax, \"The Petrified Man.\" Before we can acco unt for the rhetoric of th at hoax, ho wever, we need to consider how T wain acquired not only the \"insider\" knowledge of science necessary to pulling off a scien ce ho ax successf ully, but also the m otivation for doing it. 2. SCIENTIFIC ACCULTURATION The questions about the influence of science on Mark Twain's hoaxing amount to t hese: how did he get interest ed and educated in science? And, what kind of relationship with scie ntific culture he w as tryi ng It was inform al and trade-based, developed firs t through riverboat piloting and mining, and later through reading and investing in inventions. T wain did not have the same bone to pick with science and scie ntists that Poe did, since Twain did not have a competing epistem ology he wished to publish. Science im pacted Twain's practices a t the leve l of author ity. Scie ntists wer e com petitiv e authors in crea ting the W est for readers and in taking credit for that creation. During Twain's tenure in the W est, the United States launched myriad scientific expeditions, like Powell's Grand Canyon expeditions and ot her sorties of the United States Exploring E xpedition. The newspapers and publishing houses were full of their 200 reports, which effectively created these unknown regions for readers ex nihilo (Blair 228). Often the reports were ex aggerated. Twain m ust have sensed competition with his own exaggera ted stylin gs of the W est, because he set out to \"kill\" his readers' overblown opinion of the authority of paleontologists with \"The Petrif ied Man\" hoax. The ho ax was Twain's way o f cutting competing scien tific authors and their \"s tories\" down to size, while re-establishing his authority over his readership as the one writer who could deliver the authentic West . Scholars have gone back and forth on Twai n's scientific education. Certainly, science figured centrally in hi s reading. Albert Bigelow Paine quotes him in his Biography as saying \"I like history, bi ography, travels, curious facts and strang e happening s, and science\" (512). In his Autobiograp hy Twain describ es learning the b asic ten ets of evolution from one McFarlane, a well-read boarding-house laborer, several years before Darwin's Origin of Species was published (127). Throughout Twain's life, he evinced interest in other sciences than just biology: geology in particular \u2014due to his m ining experience\u2014as well as anthropology and astronom y. Post-1870 we have evidence of him reading Thom as H. Huxley's Evolution and Ethics , Darwin's Descent of Man , Bayne's Pith of Astronom y, and the writing s of physicis t and philoso pher Sir Oliver Lodge (Waggoner 362). Twain also showed some fascination with phrenology, palm istry, \"dream science,\" and telepat hy, although in later ye ars he dism issed almost all of these as bu nk (Ketterer 69; W aggoner 361). 201 Twain had al scientific educa tion, however, and this shortcom ing has sparked the debate over his \"insider \" status with res pect to s cience an d technology. The prevailing op inion until recently, accord ing to Jud ith Yaross Lee's reconstruction of th e debate, was established in 1937 by Hyatt Waggoner. Waggoner argued that T wain's lifelong readin g in the sciences and his technical experience as a printer, pilo t, miner, a nd inventor qualified him with a level of scientific expertise in spite of his lack of for mal education (Waggoner 359). Lee, however, takes issue w ith the W aggoner sc hool of reading Twain's scientific expertise. She points out that scientif ic kno wledge was becom ing increasingly specialized and academic in the 1 860s and that Twain's casual reading in scien tific bo oks written f or consum ption by a popular audience did not gain him entran ce into the scientif ic comm unity; she figures Twain for an outs ider, no t an insider, and backs up her argum ent b y com paring the hum or of educated scientific experts like W est Point engineer G eorge Derby (a.k.a. the m adcap astronom er \"John Phoenix\") with amat eurs like Twain: Writers with technical expertise tend to parody scientific discourse, play with scientif ic ideas, or exp eriment with science fiction. Their humor may debunk individual scient ists or projects, but le arning itself retains its positiv e value. By contras t, hum orists without technical b ackgrounds \u2014 that is, am ateurs\u2014 tend to rid icule s cience and the scientist as one. (Lee 29) Lee puts Twain in the latter catego ry, citing stories of his such as \"How the Anim als of the W oods Sent Out a Scie ntific Expedition, \" where scien tists ar e 202 figured as in sects who redraw the world's latitudes based on their finding a set of train tracks. Both scie nce and sc ientis ts are made to appear woef ully shor t- sighted and inadequate in this sketch (132). Part of the disagreem ent about Twain's scientific knowledge is due to Lee's fram ing of the de bate. She reads Waggoner as claim ing scientific expertise for Twain, while what W aggoner really wrote was this: \"A study of the Notebook, the Letters, the Autobiography, the official Biography, and several unpublished sketches, discloses a knowledge of science that, while not profound or in any s ense rigoro usly accu rate, was nevertheless ins pired by en thusias tic interest, an d was, for the av erage laym an of the day, comparatively comprehensive\" (359). This claim is a far cry f rom championing Twain as a lay scien tist. In fact, W aggoner is close to expr essing an observation which helps resolve the issue ientif ic expe rienc e: w hile Twain 's formal scientific training was indeed nonexistent, hi s technical knowledge was impressive. Even in the m id-nineteenth century, there was a distinction between scientific and techni cal practice. Scient ists and engineers re cognized a difference in each other's m ethods, which boiled down to the use of theory: scientists used it; engineers did not (Bruce 150-15 5). E ngineers em ployed (and still do to an extent) an instinctive, ha nds-on, \"tinkering\" approach to invention that used feedback from real wo rk environments to direct changes and im provem ents to technology. Engineers, m echanics, and i nventors were rarely college-educated, unlike m ost scien tists of the tim e. 203 Twain's ex perien ce of scien ce co uld in fact be better characterized as engineering knowledge. He gained exte nsive technical and m echanical know- how from his work as a printer's ap prenti ce and as a riverb oat pilo t. A fam ous passage in Life on the Mississippi describes Twain's reg retful transform ation from a neophyte worshipper of th e Mississippi to an expert pilot of the river. He claim s that he cam e to rese nt the fateful sunset during which he looked at the river and could no longer en joy its beau ty as he had in his youth because it was now a complicated, technical m ap of shoals, subm erged logs, and shallows (Marx 321). Thus, Twain evinced an awareness o f havi ng crossed from novice to expert status as a \"river technician.\" When Twai n headed West with h is brot her Orion to try his hand at m ining in 1861, he continued his technical self -education with expe rience in m ine engineering and m etallurgy. And in his later years, he turned to inventing, officially registering thr ee patents (a board gam e, a self-pasting scrapbook, and \"garm ent straps\"). Finally, his celebrat ed and costly ob session with the Paige typesetter, and his installation of the firs t private telephone in Am erica in his own home, are evidence of a lifelong enthusiasm for technological advancem ent. Overall, Twain's extensive knowledge of machines and their use is a practical knowledge, which is not as easy to doc ument historically as theoretical knowledge and education, but which noneth eless is a noteworthy accom plishm ent for an Am erican writer. Clarifying the confusion between scie ntific and techni cal knowledge in both Lee and W aggoner's critiques produces a vantage point from which both 204 scholars' assessm ents of Twain's expertise are corr ect. Waggoner is right in pointing to Twain's readings as unusually sc ientific for a lay man; Lee is right that Twain had no for mal scientific indoctrina tion. It is Twain's extensive technical knowledge, allied tradition ally with th e working class and the self-m ade Jacksonian m an, that explains both his fascination with science and technology (espec ially m achines) and his sa tiric, outsider stance to ward professional scien tists. At the tim e he wrote \"The Petrified Twain had alread y accum pressive am ount of this practical education\u2014everything but the inventing phase. He was also subject to ethn oscien tific influences from the m edia and the public discourse around hi m. Two m ajor influences am ong these are the Civil War and the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species . 2.1 The Civil War The Civil War did not have the ef fect that people often assum e it did\u2014 boosting scientific prestige, progress, a nd funding through weapons research. In fact, argues Robert V. Bruce in The Launching of Modern Am erican Science , the Civil W ar was a huge setback for scientific research. The w eapons that debuted in the war, like the Gatling gun, were pr evious inventions, and no innovative war technology was developed in the early 1860s (276). Instead, S outhern scientific resea rch wa s set back for decades with the d estruc tion of facilities and th e leveling of the econom y. Even Northern universities could not get their funding back up to norm al levels and begin to m ove forward with the organization of new 205 program s until the m id-1870s.16 Scientifically and tec hnologically speaking, then, the war was a bust. Twain was briefly involved in the war before deserting and heading w est with his brother. He saw no fighting, but he communicated his discom fort with his ro le as a soldier in the bur lesque \"A Priva te Histo ry of the Cam paign th at Failed,\" which includes the eerie portraya l of a soldier whom Twain and a few others in his unit shot in the dark; he turned out to be an unarm ed, non-uniform ed stranger m erely riding past their outpost (276-279). Twain's appreciation of the horrors that science and technology had wrought on m odern warfare during the Civil W ar are a lso manif estly ap parent in the \"Sand Belt\" ch apter A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court . Twain was not alone in his devel oping awareness of the dangers of technology when bent to the purposes of Am erican im perialism , which Twain strenuously opposed. H. Bruce Franklin docum ents the distribution of this funda mental unease throughout Twain's culture: As Twain wrote, Am erican cultu re was generating a contrad ictory vision of the relations between indust rial cap italism and m odern warfare, one that exalted weapon s technolog y as the path to peace and progress. American popular fiction was shap ing the cult of the superweapon\u2014an 16 The one exception was the field of medicine, which seem ed the least affected by the Civil W ar, and which was perhap s even advanced by the service of field doctors and by the abolition of sl avery. Darlene Clark Hine describes the tangible gains for blacks in the south due to the m edical schools established for blacks after the Civil W ar. In the 25 years follow ing the war, 115 black wom en were certified as physicians, and by 1890 th ere were 909 black m ale doctors (210- 211). 206 invincible product of Am erican inge nuity that would defeat all the backward and evil forces of the plant, thereby ending war and bringing about a global Pax Am ericana. (Franklin Traveling 166) Twain's con temporary and fellow exam iner of the im pact o f the m achine on Am erican society, Henry Adam s, rende red both the awe and terror of the situa tion in his \"The Virgin and th e Dynam o\" chapter of th e Education of Henry Adams. Adam s sees in the dynamo the destruction of everything pure and beautiful about civilization, as figured by the m edieval virgin. Adam s's imagery is more violent than, but akin to, the anni hilation of the m ysterious beauty of the Mississippi by Twain's technological knowle dge of it\u2014or, the cleaving of Huck Finn's idyllic raft by the bow of the st eamboat in Huckleberry Finn (Marx 330). Twain was obviously responding to a cult ural nervousness about technology and its easy adaptation to war, and he was res ponding to it as early as his desertion from the Marion Rangers. 2.2 Dar winism In addition to the f all-ou t from the Civil W ar, another power ful scientif ic trope pervaded Twain's culture, and that was Darwin's theory of evolution. An edito r for the Galaxy , which Twain wrote for, exclaim ed upon the \"universal drenching \" of litera ture and journa lism in Am erican with Darwinian id eas during the 1860s and 1870s (Russett 11). Although Twain was a fan of Darwin's later Descent of Man , there is no evid ence that Twain read the Origin , but m ost Americans did not. Instead, they relied on what they heard about it and what they read in the newspapers\u2014including sa tiric reports and cartoons. Am erican 207 Darwinism was, f or the most part, filtered th rough Lam arckianism , which str essed an elem ent of design in developm ent that made evolution more com patible with traditional Protes tant beliefs (Russett 10) . It wa s also filtered through a strong bias toward organicism and individualis m inherited from the Am erican Rom antics and Transcendentalists. Cynthia Ru ssett argues that \"rom antic philosophy appealed to a m ore congenial scientific concept, that of the organism , against a less cong enial on e, the machine\" (18). Thus, the idea of evolution as an organizing principle for all of life\u2014esp ecially when directed by a benevolen t God, as figured by Am erican Lam arckians\u2014seem ed a safe haven com pared to the inhum an m echanism s of a cloc kwork Enlightenm ent universe. However, evolution insinuated its own sort of m echanics into Am erican scien tific an d social th inking, the fierce la w of survival of the fittest. This was Huxley's nature, \"red in tooth and cl aw,\" laid out in his 1893 Evolution and Ethics , a favorite on Twain's bookshelf. Ru ssett d escribes the discom fort of American moral thinkers with the vanquishing of Newtonian m echanism by Darwinian evolution, which seemed lik e an \"iro n maiden presiding over endless panoram as of anguish and extinction\" (3). Within Twain's lifetim e, Am erican writer s were already d ramatizing the crue l results of capitalist appropriations of survival of the fittes t, or Social Da rwinism : Upton Sinclair's The Jungle (1906) is one of the most notab le ins tances of literary criticism of the inhum an aspects of Darwinism as social policy. American Darwinism , in short, sets up a pattern of e mbracing the elegant story evolution told about the developm ent of self-sufficient life, while 208 simultaneously shuddering at the cold am orality of a universe that was not designed but just happened at an astounding rate of attr ition. This pattern shows up clearly in Twain's thinki ng, whether he cam e to it him self, borrowed it from Darwin and Huxley, or sim ply used pa rts of it to reinforce h is own native cynicism about m an's inhum anity to man. As mentioned above, Twain was sympathetic to the broad idea of evol ution, as evidenced by his enthusiastic reporting of the conversations he had with his boarding-house philosopher friend McFarlane. His predisposition to belie ve in an evolutionary\u2014and atheistic\u2014 model of life developm ent, however, did no t insulate the scie ntists who adopted Darwin's th eory from his sha rp, sa tirical pen. Twain satirized paleontologists at least three tim es\u2014in \"How the Anim als of the W oods Sent Out a Scientific Expedition,\" \"The Petrified Man,\" and 3,000 Y ears Am ong the Microbes \u2014for jumping to evolutionary conclusions on the basis of scanty fossil data (W ilson 79). Twain celebrated the idea of biologica l determ inism , reinforced by his belief that people really behaved no differently th an an imals, and perhaps worse. But at mom ents, the determ inism of a Godl ess universe m otivated merely by competition for resources seem ed to knock the wind out of hi m. Contrary to many scholars' beliefs that Twain simply succu mbed to des pair in a m echanis tic universe, however, his hoaxing practi ces show Twain developing a coping strategy that asserts self-determ ination without necessarily buying into any established belief system\u2014inc luding evolution. His st rategy is laugh ter, which remains both the sim plest and the most com plex response to the rh etoric of social determ inism. The laughter also creates a bond between Twain and his readers, 209 reasserting his, rather than science's, au thority over th em as the ir chan nel to the truth in the West. An e xamination of Twain's only scientific media hoax, \"The City ics of self-determ ination and authority enter Twain's writings abo ut science. After studying \"The Petrified Man\" as a hoaxing event, I will use an OT- based approach to reconsider other, m ore traditional rhetorical an alyses of Twain's hoaxing. And finally, I will devel op a theory of Twain's use of laughter as a coun ter-m ove against th e rhetoric of social control, showing how this changes our percep tion o f his writing s about science in his later works. 3. \"T HE PETRIFIED MAN\" Twain hired on at the T erritorial Enterprise in the late sum mer of 1862 to fill in f or the loca l edito r, Dan De Quille (W illiam W right), who was visiting h is family in Iowa. The f irst extan t story Twain wrote for the Enterprise is a scien tific ho ax, \"The Pe trified Man, \" which wa s prin ted in the Ente rprise on 5 October 1862. However, due to a fire in 1875 that destroyed the Enterprise 's archives, the only rem aining copies of the story are twelve reprints in other area papers, beginning with the San Francisco Evening Bulletin on 15 October 1862. The hoax can be exam ined in its en tirety, sin ce it is rela tively brief . This is the tex t of the f irst rep rint of the h oax in the San Francisco Evening Bulle tin on 15 October 1862: A petrified m an was found som e time ago in the m ountains south of Gravelly Ford. Every lim b and fe ature of the stony m ummy as perfect, 210 not even excepting the left leg, wh ich has evidently been a wooden one during the lifetim e of the owner\u2014w hich lifetime, by the w ay, cam e to a close about a century ag o, in the opinion of a savan who has exam ined the defunct. T he body was in a sitting posture and leani ng against a huge mass of croppings; the attitude was pensive, the right thum b resting against the side of the nose; the left thum b partially supported the chin, the forefinger pressing the inner corner of the left eye and drawing it partly open; the right eye was closed and the fingers of the right hand spread apart. This strange freak of natu re created a profound sensation in the vicinity, and our inform ant states th at, by request, Justice Sewell or Sowell of Humboldt City at on ce proceed ed to the spo t and held an inquest on th e body. The verdict of the jury was that \"deceased cam e to his death from protracted exposure,\" etc. The pe ople of the neighborhood volunteered to bury the poor unfortunate, and were even anxious to do so; but it was discovered, when they attem pted to re move hi m, that the water which had dropped upon him for ages from the cr ag above, had coursed down his back and deposited a lim estone sedi ment under him which had glued him to the bed rock upon which he sat, as with a cem ent of ada mant, and Judge S. ref used to allow the charitable citizen s to bla st him from his position . The opinion expressed by his Honor that such a course woul d be little less than sacrilege, was e minently just and proper. Everybody goes to see the stone m an, as m any as 300 persons havi ng visited the hardened creature during the past five or six weeks. 211 Reader exp ectations can be recupe rated from this hoax by the same methods I applied to Poe's firs t hoaxing at tempt. Firs t, I w ill exam ine Twain's writings about the hoax, what he claim ed to have been trying to accom plish with it, and how he explain ed the constr uction of its rhetor ic. Those claim s will be compared to the contemporary reaction to the hoax in newspapers and m emoirs. Then, I will reconstru ct the popular scie nce article of 1865, since changes are bound to have accrued to th e genre since 1835, and this portrait will reveal the generic exp ectations n ewsreaders might ha ve had when coming to Twain's hoax. Finally, based on these collected expectations , I will m ake changes to th e filter of expectations as constructed so fa r to account for historical change. 3.1 Tw ain's analysis of \"The Petrified Man\" and \"Empire City Massa cre\" Twain wrote in detail a bout his m otivations and st rategy in constructing \"The Petrified Man,\" and the best summary is his own: Now, to show how really hard it is to foist a m oral or a truth upon an unsuspecting public through a burles que without entirely and absurdly missing one's m ark, I will here se t dow n two experiences of my own in this thing. In the fall of 1862, in Ne vada and California, the people got to running wild about extraordinary petrif actions and other natural m arvels. One could scarcely pick up a pape r without finding in it one or two glorified discoveries of this kind. The m ania was beco ming a little ridiculous. I was a brand-new local edito r in Virginia C ity, and I f ell called upon to destroy this growing evil: we all have our benignant, fatherly m oods at one tim e or another, I suppose . I cho se to k ill th e 212 petrifaction mania with a delicate, a very delic ate, sa tire. But maybe it was altogether too delicate, for no body ever p erceived the satire pa rt of it at all. I put m y scheme in the shape of the di scovery of a rem arkable petrified m an. I had had a tem porary falling out with Mr. Sewall, the ne w coroner and justice of the peace of Hum boldt, and I thought I m ight a s well touch him up at the sam e time and m ake him ridiculous, and thus combine pleasure with business. (C lemens \"Memoranda \" 858-859) [my emphasis] Twain m entions m any dynam ics here th at are significant for our study of hoaxing from the perspective of reader expectations. The key points, for our purposes, are as follows: 1. Twain was embarking on a project of social education or control by trying to \"foist a m oral\" on his readers. 2. He intended \"The Petrified Man\" to be a satire, not a hoax\u2014the principal difference here, both in Twain's thinking and as di scussed in Chapter One, being th at in a satire th e audien ce is \"in\" on th e joke, whereas in a ho ax the reader is a victim of the joke. Thus, he felt his satire f ailed because readers were duped by the story a nd m issed the satiric bent. 3. The dual butts of Tw ain's \"satire\" were the Virgin ia City m edical exam iner, Judge Sewall, whom Twain had an unspecified grudge against; and, a recent \"petrifaction m ania.\" This \"m ania\" was a sup posed slew of ar ticles in newspape rs from all over the country about the finding of fossils a nd petrified plants and even people. 213 Recent attempts to reco nstruct Twain's claim s by a surv ey of contem porary m edia have not yielded evidence of this \"m ania.\" However, it is well known that m uch of the Enter prise and of the other C alifornia and Nevada papers was dedicated to geologic and m ining news, since reader s were m contem porary one hoax and two hum orous stories about petrifaction. Judith Yaross Lee claim s the W est was a particularly fertile ground for humor about paleontol ogical finds: \"The goldrush in ro ck-collec ting and other f orms of am ateur geology and mineralogy, and descrip tions of fictitious fossils began to co nstitu te a subgenre\" (Lee 141). Catalysts for this \"excited interest\" m ay include reports from governm ent scientific expeditions like the W ilkes Expedition and the Owen Survey, whose fossil finds were being de bated as either supporting or refuting Darwin's theory of evolution. So, th ere was likely som e basis for Twain's exasperation . Twain recorded his perception s of r eaders ' reaction s to \" The Petrif ied Man.\" In th e \"Mem oranda\" article for the Galax y, he m akes strong claim s about the dissem ination of the hoax: As a satir e on the p etrifaction m ania, or any thing else, my Petrif ied Man was a disheartening failure; for everybody received him in innocent good faith, and I was stunned to see th e creature I had begotten to pull down the wonder-business with and br ing derision upon it, calm ly exalted to the grand chief place in the list of the g enuine m arvels our Nevada had produced. I was so disappointed at th e curious m iscarriage of my sche me 214 that at firs t I was angry and did not like to thin k about it; b ut by and by, when the ex changes beg an to com e in with the Petrif ied Ma n copied an d guilelessly glorified, I began to feel a soothing secret satisfaction; and as my gentleman's field of travel broa dened, and by the exchanges I saw that he stead ily and im placably penetrated territo ry after terri tory, State after State, and la nd af ter lan d, till he sw ept the g reat globe and c ulminated in sublim e and unim peached leg itimacy in the aug ust, \"Londo n Lancet, \" my cup was full, and I said I was glad I had done it. It think that for about eleven months, as nearly as I can rem ember, Mr. Sewall's d aily mail contained along in the neighborhood of half a bushel of newspapers hailing f rom m any clim es with the Pe trified Man in them , marked aroun d with a prominent belt of ink. I sent them to hi m. I did it for spite, not for fun. He used to shovel them into hi s back yard and curse. A nd every day during all those m onths the m iners, his constituents (for m iners never quit joking a person when they get started), would call on him and ask if he could tell th em where they could get hold of a paper with the Pe trified Man in it. He could have accommodated a co ntinen t with them . I hat ed Sewall in those days, and these things pacified m e and pleased m e. I could not have gotten more real com fort out of hi m without killing him . (Clem ens \"Mem oranda\" 859-860) In 1937 DeLancey Ferguson, in what was probably the first scholarly treatm ent of the hoax, did a survey of the London Lancet for t hree years fol lowing the publication of \"Petrified Man\" and found no m ention of it in the paper. 215 Likewise, Ferguson finds no m ention of it in the Eastern magazines he surveyed (Ferguson 193). Twain was probably exa ggerating the dissem ination of his hoax, although locally it created a stir, as we will s ee in the next section. What is really interes ting about this hoax, however , is Twain's claim that the piece was in fact a failed s atire. His analys is of the exp read ers, as he constructs them , and Twain is certainly a member of his own readership in this instance, being a pion eer and plac er miner in Nevada. Twain wrote first of all that he expected the inaccur acies of \"Pet rified Man\" to reveal it: to end the ' Petrifi ed Man' squib was a string of roaring ab surdities, alb eit they were told with an unfair prete nce of truth that even im posed upon m e to som e extent, and I was in som e danger of believing in my own fra ud. But I rea lly had no desire to deceive anybody, and no expectation of doing it. I depended on the way the petrified m an was sitting to explain to the public that he was a swindle. (Clem ens \"Mem oranda\" 859) Twain goes on to point out that locals were prov ided with further clues to the fake, such as the fact that ther e were no \"people of the neighborhood\" in Gravelly Ford, which was a five-day ri de into the wilderness and populated only by \"a few starving Indians, som e grasshoppe rs, and four or fi ve buzzards out of meat and too feeble to g et away\" (85 9). However, Twain contradicts his own cl aims of innocence so mewhat as h e admits the \"unfair pretence to truth\" he employed. Elsewhe re in the same ar ticle, 216 Twain once again confes ses that he worked at making the \"P etrified Man \" sound like an auth entic n ews article: \"So I told, in patient, belief-com pelling detail, all about the finding of a petrified m an at Gr avelly Ford\" (859). And when he wrote to his brother Orion on 21 October 1862, he made the im posture of his \"squib\" sound quite deliberate: (Between u s, now)--did you see that squ ib of m ine headed \"Petr ified M an?\" It is an unm itigate d lie, made from whole cloth. I go t it up to worry Sewall. Every day, I send him som e California paper containing it; m oreover, I am getting th ings so arranged th at he will soon begin to rec eive letters f rom all par ts of the country, pur porting to come from scientific m en, asking for further infor mation concerning the wonderful stone m an. If I had plenty of ti me, I would worry the life out of the poor cuss. (Clem ens Mark Twain' s Letters 242) There is no evidence th at Twain ev er \"arrang ed\" ared prov ide o utside supp ort for the hoax, which would not have been required if the sto ry wer e simply a sa tire that flopped. Further, Twain published a follow-up piece in the Enterp rise in Nove mber with the testim ony of individua ls who had been to see the \"stone mummy\" on display (Clem ens Early Tales and Sketches 157). So, there are several solid reasons to doubt Twain's pr otestations that he did not intend to create a ho ax. But his comm entary on what m akes the difference between a telling satire and a good hoax are instruc tive for our purposes of reconstructing reader expectations because Twain wa s savvy to what is now called th e 217 psychology of reading\u2014the cognitive proc ess through which readers approach a text and interpret it. W e will con sider each of his in sights through the lens of the reade r expec tations tha t they will af fect. sacre, \" he m akes clear why he thinks he \"accidentally\" created hoaxes instead of sa tires. \"The Petrif ied Ma n,\" as we have seen, was intended to satirize a popular-science m ania over fossils and petrifaction; \"The Empire City Massacr e\" was a horrif ying re port of a multiple m urder/suicide tha t, Twain, argues, was originally designed to criticize a sh ifty po licy of misreporting stock values by m ining com panies, som ething akin to the recent En ron scandal, which was prevalent in California and Neva da in the 1860s. In the hoax Twain claim s a man driven m ad by his losses on th e sto ck market kills h is entire family, cuts his own throat, and then rides into to wn and collapses in front of a saloon full of people, brandishing the scalp of one of his childre n. The hoax was apparently believ ed loc ally and res ulted in a media furor, once it came out that T wain had faked it. According to Dan De Quille, Twain's f ellow write r and roommate at th e time, Nevada news editors ca lled the story a \"cruel and idiotic hoax,\" and Calif ornia n ews edito rs threa tened n ever to reprint anoth er Enterpr ise item if J.T. Goodm an did not fire T wain. Twain lost a great deal of sleep until De Quille reassured him that the whole thing would blow over eventually, which it did (Wright Reporting 72). In his \"Memoranda\" for the Galaxy , Twain chalks up the phenom enon of his \"satires\" being read as hoaxes to th ree unanticipated factors: readers ' 218 extrem ely high valuation of sensation and novelty, the guiding principles by which his readers read scien ce news, a nd the stru cture o f that news read ing activity. All these observations are co rroborated by contemporary reports of reactions to his hoaxes a nd anticipate current findi ngs in reading psychology. These r eports will b e cited to ju stify modification of the ranked filter of science newsreading expectation s. A final adjustm ent to the ranking will com e through an exam ination of the public reputation of both the Enterprise and Twain him self, which com plicates th e assum ption m ade to this point that newsreader s expected truth. 3.11 High ranking of Sensation an d Novelty Twain comm ented extensively on the power of the \"wonde r-business\" of science to overwhelm readers' critical faculties. He claim ed that this phenom enon, equivalent to a high valuati on of the novelty and sensation, caused the \"m oral\" of his satires to be m issed. In th e \"Mem oranda\" he reflects, \"...we never read the dull explanatory surroundi ngs of m arvellously exciting things when we have no occasion to suppo se that som e irresponsib le scribbler is try ing to defraud us; we skip all that, and hasten to revel in the blood-curdling particulars and be happy\" (861). As to read ers overlooking of th e clues he left in his \"satires\" and readin g them as hoaxes, Twain cautions , \"One can deliver a satire with telling force through the insidious medium of a travesty, if he is careful not to over whelm the satire with th e extraneou s interes t of the trav esty, and s o bury it from the readers' sight and leav e him a joked and defrauded victim, when the honest intent was to add to either his knowledge or his wisdom \" (859). 219 Although it would be hasty to attribute a ny sort of \"honest intent\" to Twain's \"satires,\" he m akes it clear that the pow erful sensational and novel aspects of a petrified m an and a bloody m assacre leave vivi d images in readers' m inds that are difficult to replace with subtle argu ments about an over-reliance on Darwinian paleontology or pire City Massacre,\" Twain lam ents, \"To drop in with a poor little m oral at the fag-end of such a gorgeous m assacre, was to follow the expiring sun wi th a candle and hope to attract the world' s atte ntion to it\" dividend-cooking com panies a ppears only in the last si x sentences of the lengthy piece after som e relatively dry biog raphical details about the murderer. That \"expiring sun\" of novelty a nd sensation was Twain's lifelong whipping boy, according to Pascal Covici in Mark Twain's Hum or. In that study Covici explicates Twain 's \"use of the hoa x to ridicule the reader' s penchant for collecting thrills\" (150). He claim s that Twain consistently used forms like the hoax and the tall tale as deflating pins for the ballo on-like sensations of the \"wonder-business\" of popular science and any other m ania that grabbed readers' attention through the media. Covici argues that Twain felt Am erican's slavish love of sensation was blinding them to th e very real and unglam orous problem s of poverty, racial inequality, and exploitation of ethnic m inorities in the post-bellum era (150-151). This social function of the hoax will be discussed in the fina l section of this chap ter with respect to Twain's activism . 220 3.12 Process of reading Twain identified another m ajor cause fo r the failure of his \"satires. \" He claim ed the exposing details he buried in his \"satires\" did not surface into his readers' co nsciousnes s because his readers were read ing too fast and sim ply missed them. \"Ski mming\" as a strategy to optim ize expenditu re of time and effort durin g read ing is well-docu mented in recent stud ies of scientif ic readers. Charles Bazerm an found patterns in the way physicists skipped over parts of article s in their field to s elect the par ts that were most useful to the ir own research in \"Physicis ts Reading Physics.\" Davida Charney got sim ilar her read- aloud protocol study of biol ogists reading Stephen Ja y Gould's article \"The Spandrels of San Marco.\" Skimm ing has actually been treated as an OT-type constraint-satisfaction process by Bertrand Ge rvais, a rea der-orien ted critic. He describ es the proces s Twain witn essed as a con tinual tension betw een two competing constraints, progression and com prehension. Progression ex presses the desire of the reader to get through the m aterial as quickly as possible. Comprehension expresses the reader's d esire to und erstand the d etails of wh at s/he h as read. The reading activ ity proceeds as a negotiation between these two cons traints, with read ing genera lly proceeding as fast as will allow the re ader to glea n what s/he wishes to learn from the text (Gervais 857). Twain observed this progression/compr ehension dynam ic in the reading of his \"satires\" and attributed their \"failur e\" in large part to readers skimm ing. In the \"Mem oranda,\" while discuss ing a recen t \"agricu ltural\" satire he wrote that 221 was taken as the real thing, he theorizes , \"Shall I tell you the real reason why I have unin tentionally su cceeded in fooling so many people? It is becau se som e of them only r ead a little of the squ ib I wr ote and jum ped to the conclusion that it was serious, and the rest did not read it at all, but hear d of my agricultural venture at second-hand\" (858). In his discu ssion of \"Em pire Twain reports watching readers read the sto ry just as Po e spied on readers reacting to the \"Balloon-H oax.\" Twain describes sitti ng at breakfast and observing a couple of farmers reading his article in a spontaneous early read-aloud protocol experim ent. \"I saw th at the heed less son of a hay-m ow was skipping with all his m ight, in order to get to the bloody details as quick ly as p ossible; and so he was missing the guide-boards I had set up to warn him that the w hole thing was a fraud\" (861). Naturally, as we have witnessed w ith Poe's hoaxes, a hoaxer, unlike a satiris t, relie s on just this reading ha bit tw ice ov er: first, when s/he uses readers ' hasty judgm ents to secure their confiden ce in the hoax; and, later, when s/he encourages re-reading or sim ply conf esses the hoax in order to produce the gestalt that is the h allmark of the hoax exp erience. The nice fit of this hoax strategy with Twain's lam ent about readers' carelessne ss seem s further indication that he was crafting hoaxes when he wrote \"The Petrif ied Man\" and \"Empire City M assacre. \" His tears ov er his failed \"satires \" appear in creasingl y crocodilian. Half of Twain's observa tion about his readers' r styles f ailure of his \"sa tire\" to reade rs skimming too quickly to catch his \"guide- boards.\" N aturally, the other half of hi s observation has to do with what readers 222 were looking for in their headlong rush, wh at they were skim ming over the rest of the tex t in order to reach. This has to do with ind ustrial m odes of reading news. 3.13 Newsreading Twain also noticed that people con sistently skipped to ce rtain parts of his stories. As he pointed out with the \"Empire City Massa cre,\" his readers were skimm ing to find the \"bloody details\" and the \"blood-curdling particulars.\" In a recen t study of newsreaders, Berkenkotter and Huckin found that readers indeed do not read linearly but skim for inform ation: \"Because the text schem a is quite standardized, experienced r eaders know where to look for certain inform ation and can skip around quite ef ficiently\" (31). They cite Van Dijk 's (1986) empirical study of the topics of a news article in th e order they generally appear: first, the summary, which consists of headline a nd lead; then the news story, which proceeds with the m ain event, details of m ain event, background, consequences, comments, etc. Berk enkotter and Hu cken cl aim that repeated e xperience with th is form allows readers to treat it hypertextu ally, organizing thei r reading experience non-linearly in response to their desire to m aximize novelty, or new inform ation. The form of the m odern news article differs slightly, of course, from the Popsci. criteria that we ha ve observed in action. Th e modern a rticle lacks the degree of \"mystery\" in its opening that th e 1835 science news articles contained; the earlier articles also put background before the details of the m ain event in the form of failed attem pts at discovery or understanding in the past; finally, the commentary in th e early scien ce articles of ten contains speculat ions that m odern articles esch ew in the in teres t of preserving an o bjective s tance. However, as we 223 will see in this chap ter, the genre of the scien ce news article was cha nging in Twain's time to conform m ore closely to the pattern Van Dijk observed. If the for m of the ne ws article has changed over the last 150 years, however, th e principle of the reader learn ing the for m and then using it to adapt the reading experience to his/her goals rem ains the sam e. As discussed in Chapter Two, Rolf Zwaan has found that labeling the same text either a \"story\" or a \"news article\" for different sets of readers changes the way these groups read. His results s howed that readers who believ ed they were read ing news re ad for th e details\u2014the \"who-what-when-where-w hy\"\u2014and had better recall for these details, and worse recall for fine details of language and presentation, as compared to readers who thought they were reading a fiction story. Twain reco gnized th at this s tructured read ing activ ity was important f or perpetrating a hoax. H e noted that leav ing his revelato ry clues o r \"moral\" un til the end of t he article caused it to fail as a satire because \"th e reader, not knowing that it is th e key of the whole th ing and the only im portant paragraph in the article, tranq uilly tu rns u p his nose and leaves it unread\" (Clem ens \"Memoranda \" 858). Twain evinces awareness of a front-loa ded structure for news articles in his time. Since he had already had a sim ilar problem with readers m issing the \"fine print\" of the revela tory details of the \"Petrified Man,\" one would think he would have done som ething to foreground the re velatory details of \"Em pire City Massacre\" if he genuinely intended to m ake a satire rath er than a ho ax. Dan De Quille claim s in his m emoirs to have suggested th is to Twain during the composition of the story (W right Reporting 172). According to De Quille, Twain 224 was defensive in th e face of these suggestions, claim ing that the sm all inconsistencies he had sprinkled throughout the article\u2014like calling the murderer a \"bachelor\" even though he killed his wife and childr en, and m entioning a pine forest where locals should have know n there was desert \u2014were all \"plain enough,\" and he refused to foreground the \"m oral\" about dividend cooking that resided at the end of the st ory (171). It seem s clear th at Twain intended to exploit what we now understand as a fam iliarity w ith the news article form at in order to make \"Empire City Massacre\" seem like a \"real\" news story to his readers\u2014in order to write a hoax, not a satire. Since we have discussed Twain's farmers reading his \"Em pire City Massacre\" over breakf ast, we should how progression/com prehension and the f amiliar structu re of news rea ding m ight have in teracted to produ ce belief in the hoax. The news-reading strategy ope rates on a sim ilar level as progression and com prehension, sin ce it determ ines which parts of the text are adm itted to the interpretive process. Thus, we can ar gue for our news-reading strategy (News), Progression, and Sensation all driving th e reading process at the expense of Com prehension (of details), as depicted in Table 12. Table 12: S kimming guided by news-reading conventions Sensation Progression News Comprehension \u0016True * False * * *! The \"False\" judgm ent represents a reading that would have\u2014Twain believ ed\u2014le d the f armers to understanding Twain's satire about dividend 225 cooking rather than m issing the tell-tale cl ues and being hoaxed. In this fantasy case, the violation of Sensation would indica te that what is sensational is of low value to th e reader. Th e violation of Progression woul d mean the read er slowed down to understand the details of the st ory; and the violation of Ne ws would imply a strict linear reading. Sin ce none of these statem ents m atched the farmers' actual expectations (in Twain's view ), they result in a fatal violation. An interpretation of the sto ry as \"true,\" in spite of lack of com prehension of all of the text, wins out. T his table thus represents Twain belief about how progression/com prehension and new s skimm ing interacted to m ake his readers jump to the wrong conclusion while reading his hoaxes. 3.14 Mediu m Twain did not comm ent on the effe cts of m edium and reputation on the recep tion of the hoaxes, but they are cruc ial to this analysis becaus e of the previous im portance of readers' attitudes towards newspapers as dissem inators of truth. Basically, we have a conundrum . Readers knew that the Enterprise often printed tall tales and falsehoods. On the other hand, they relied on the E nterprise for real m ining news and true details of events and scandals in the Nevada Territory. What, then, were reader exp ectations of the medium when they cam e to read a sto ry like \"The Petrif ied Ma n\"? The Enterprise was \" the large st pap er in the W est of the g old and silv er rushes,\" according to Judith Yaross Lee (Lee 129) although the Great Fire of 1875 wiped out the newspaper's records, so circulation figures from that era are unavailable. It was the major pape r in Virginia City and was read by m iners, 226 businessm en, politicians, and their f amilies. It of ten courte d its wom en readers with item s specifically \"for the ladies.\" The local m iners relied on it for news of what was happening in other m ines on the Com stock lode and for new claim s and patents (Lee 129; Mott 298). Politics was also big news, as Nevada's legislature was m aking a bid for Stat ehood. Twain's brother Orion was the T erritorial Secretary, and Twain him self covered the legislative sessions from 1862-1864. However, the Enterprise was also known for havi ng rather young bachelor editors who enjoyed drinki ng their \"reporter's cobbler s\" and playing practical jokes on each other. Henr y Nash Smith sums the situa tion up in this fashion: \"Nevada journalism of the 1860' s was nonchalant and uninhibited, and a report of the m ost commonplace event was likely to veer into fantasy or hum orous diatribe\" (C lemens MT of the Enterprise 7). Hum orous stories, tall tales, and comic takes on local ne ws filled in the gaps in the \"rea l news\" in eve ry issue. Dan De Qui lle and Twain both used the paper to get in jabs at each other and at local politic ians whom they did not like, as in the case of Twain using \"The Petrified Man\" to get back at Judge Se wall for som e unrecorded offense. Twain was practically run out of town on a rail b ecause of a satirical article he wrote about the Carson City Sa nitary B all in 1864, which offended the powerful organizers (Clem ens M T of the Enterprise 27). Frank Luthe r Mott in the History of Am erican Journalism argues tha t the edito rs of the Ente rprise knew it was widely read and therefore used its su bstantia l subscrip tion as a platform to launch tall tales and hoaxes into the Eastern m edia through the practice of clippi ng (Mott 289). Certainly, fr om the evidence of the 227 eastward migration of De Quille's hoaxes, this claim seem s to be ju stified. How then, could readers of the Enterprise depend on its journali sm at all? Twain's De Quille, depe nded on his readers to use their common sense to distinguish wh at was real from what wa s fake; of course, he was always pleased when they could not manage to do so (Lee 142). Twain wrote many anonym ous pieces for the local colum ns of the Enterprise that mixed together fiction and fact, so it appears he also left the burden of proof on the reader m any tim es. Knowing all of this, T wain claim ed a final reason he felt his \"satires\" failed, and \"It is becau se, in som e instances , the reader is a person who never tries to deceive anybody himself, and therefore is not expecting any one to wantonly practise a deception upon him \" (Clem ens \"Memoranda\" 858). Again, he supports the basic ten dency of news readers toward s cred ulity when h e says in the \"Em pire City Massacre\" analysis quoted above, \"...we never re ad the dull explanatory surroundings of m arvellously exciting th ings when we have no occasion to suppose that som e irresponsible scribble r is trying to defraud us\" (Clem ens \"Mem oranda\" 861). Tw ain seem s to support De Quille's reading of read ers' tru st in the Enter prise. They needed the inform ation the paper provided, and so they trusted what they read unless signaled to do otherwise by hum orous commentary or insider knowledge as a local (e.g. that there were no \"neighbors\" around Gravelly Fo rd). The local readers were m iners, an d often the difference between them \"striking it rich\" or not cam e down to whether or not they acted swiftly on new 228 inform ation, whether they received it th rough rum or or in the pages of the Enterprise ; if they did n ot, som eone else staked the big claim first. Th ey were a group whose urgen t need for novel inform ation necessitated a level o f trust in Nevada journalism that m ight not otherwis e be warranted. In terestingly, David Perlm an finds this m ercenary urgency is st ill a m ajor contributor to in stances of hasty or inaccurate reporting of scienc e news in the United States (253). In add ition to a trus t in the Enterpr ise forced by an urgent need for new inform ation, there could be a m uch more basic reason that readers continued to believ e what they read, o ne that gets back to Twain's comm ents that \"we have no occasion to suspect\" so meone is hoaxing us. Grice 's maxim of Quality acts as a constra int on all spe ech activ ities, including the reading of newspapers. The maxim of Quality says to tell the truth, and to assum e others are too, unless you receive overt signals of flou ting of the m axim\u2014like an exaggerated, sarcastic tone of voice, eye-rolling, or the nam e \"Mark Tw ain\" at the head of an article. In addition to his insight into the psychol ogy of reading, Twain seem s to have tapped into a very basic operating principle of linguistic pragm atics\u2014tapped into it, and exploited it, in the case of \"The Petr ified Man\" and his other unsigned hoaxes. 3.15 Twain's reputation as an author (Authority) Another peripheral issue to Twain' s assessm ent of the reac tion to the\"Petrified Man\" hoax is his readers' expectations about hi s behavior as an author at th is juncture in his career. In fact his career was just gettin g started . \"Petrified Man\" is the first confirm ed piece of journalism that Twain wrote as a staff newspaper reporter. We know he wrote item s for the local colum n around 229 this tim e, many of them sarcas tic. Ho wever, his legislative reporting w as exact and trustwo rthy, if also occasionally crit ical and hum orous (Clem ens MT of the Enterprise 9). In February of 1863, just four m onths after the publication of \"Petrified Man,\" Twain began using the pseudonym he w ould use for the rest of his career. After that his readers had a heuristic for helping them decide if Authority, or the reputation of the author, would have a positive or negative valence in their decisions about the truth of ite ms in the Enterprise . Twain signed his serious political pieces Sam Clemens and hi s hum orous bits Mark T wain (Clemens MT of the Enterp rise 9). But plenty of his articles were unsigned, like \"Petrified Man,\" leaving the burden of deciding the values of both Medium and Authority on the reader. 3.16 Summary of Twain's portrait of his readers' expectations Twain, like Poe, seemed to think in term s of what readers expect or anticipate when he analyzed what went \"wr ong\" with his \"satires .\" Therefore, he makes the following significant contributi ons to our understanding of reader expectations of science journali sm as practiced in the W est: Novelty and Sensation, representi ng the \"wonder-business\" of popular science, are perceived by Twain as th e highest-ranked reader expectations, thereby m aking them salient targe ts for his sa tirical attacks. The needs of core readers\u2014m iners and scientific expeditionists like Cope\u2014for novel inform ation m ay corr oborate a ranking of Novelty above 230 Medium for m iners who knew the Enterprise lied but who could not afford to pass up any tip on a new prospect. In signed pieces by Mark Twain/Sam Cl emens, Authority (\"The reputation of the author holds\") develops a sc hizoid status, as each nam e is associated with a different sty le of reporting: hum orous/lying for Twain, and straigh t-shooting for Clem ens. Of course, many pieces, like \"The Petrified Man,\" were unsigned altogether. Grice's m axim of Quality m ay interact with M edium and Authority to actually encourage cred ulity, a s truth-telling is the default mode of hum an communication (if it were not, noth ing would ever get accom plished between people and lying would ha ve no stigm a attached to it). The com peting constraints of Progression and C omprehension govern the hoax-reading experience and m ay work in the hoaxer's favor due to readers' skimm ing habits. The com petition between progression/com prehension m ay for so me readers indicate a high ranking for Sensation and Novelty, but a low ranking or even a deactivation of Detail and Internal Coherence, due to skipping these background details to get to the \"juicy parts.\" A news-specific reading pattern m ay interact with the progression/com prehension dynam ic to facilitate hoaxing and frustrate satire. 231 Twain's observations will be tested agains t the reactions of ot her readers of hi s hoaxes. Then, the f ilter of science news readin g expecta tions will be modif ied to account for the observable innovations in Twain's scientific media hoaxing. 3.2 Contemporary reaction to \"The Petrified Man\" When Twain wrote in the \"Mem oranda\" that \"everyone was receiving [the petrified m an] in innocent and good faith,\" he was exaggerating. Even if they ignored the obvious nose-thum bing of the unf ortunate petrif actee, several of the papers who reprinted it did so tongue-in-cheek. In Early Tales and Sketches , Branch et. al . note that a m ajority of the 12 re prints were introduced straight- faced (158). Of the five reprin ts I was able to lo cate in the Berkeley periodicals library, th ree were in troduced iron ically: The San Francis co Evening Bulle tin introduces the story with this commentary: A WAS HOE JOKE. \u2014The Territorial Enterp rise has a joke of a \"petrified m an\" having been f ound on the plains, which the interior journals seem to be copying in good fa ith. Our authority gravely says:...\" The Sacram ento Bee on 16 Octob er 1862 p refaces the story, \"THAT PIECE OF PETRIFIED HUMANITY.\u2014T he Enterprise, published in Virginia City, has the following, probably a hoax, about the discovery of a petrified m an near Gravelly Ford, in Nevada Territory. It says....\" The San Francisco Alta California for 15 October 1862 quips the following: \"A PETRIFIED MAN IN NEVADA TER RITORY. -Th e Virgina City Enterprise gets off the following sell about the discovery of a petrified m an near Grav elly Fo rd, in Nevada Territory.\" 232 Twain's protestations of universal h oodwinking are obviously exaggerated. In addition to the overt criticism by the repr inting media, readers and ed itors m ost likely knew that the En terprise routinely published hum orous squibs and tall tales alongsid e legitim ate news item s. There is little doubt that San Franci sco's m edia encouraged an im age of the c ity as more savvy and cosm opolitan th an the upsta rt mining ca mps in th e Nevada te rritory. Th is attitud e is appa the San Fr ancisco Even ing Bulletin , whose editors distinguished them selves and their readers from the \"interior journals\" who were \"copying it [the joke] in good faith.\" I will consider their reading of the hoax and then their projection of how their read ers would read it. The edito rs clearly ran k highly the reputation of the m edium \u2014with a definite negative valence\u2014in their decisi on to discount Twain's tale. So Medium wins out over the Novelty and Sensati on of a petrified hu man being for these edito rs. It is saf e to a ssum e that they were n ot skimm ing the ar ticle, as the y picked up the exposing details of the m ummy's posture and recognized the story for a hoax. Inte rnal Coherence would therefore be highly-rank ed for edito rial readers, too, b ecause the impossi bility of a m an being petrified while thum bing his nose is what gives the story away. Some of the usual exp ectations do not enter into the ed itors' interpretive decision. F or exam ple, there are no fore ign authorities quote d, so Foreign is a moot point. These editors' comm entary gi ves no indication of how plausible they found the petrifaction of a m an, in general, so Plausibility m ay or m ay not have 233 enter ed into their inte rpretive pro cess. The ility c lues locals\u2014like the lack of \"neighbors\" at Gravelly Ford\u2014would not help editors who lived in San Francisco. By contrast, for the editors of the Auburn Placer Herald , Plausibility must have been sa tisfied, o r at le ast po werfully outranked by other expectations, since they reprinted the story as real news; the Placer Herald editors could have employed either of these rankings of Plausibility, since they make no comm ents when reprinting \"The Petrified Man.\"17 Finally, the option of the edito rs of the Evening Bulletin 's respec ting Twain's adherence to Popsci. criteria in the original story are im possible to judge because th at article is not extan t. Chances are go od that the b ody of the story was reproduced relatively accura tely in the Evening Bulletin ; this has been determ ined through comparison with the other reprints and Twain's own reprint of the story in Sketches New and Old (Clem ens Early Tales and Sketches 157). However, the original heading of the story and pe rhaps som e concluding comm entary would not have been reprinted by the Bulletin and are thus unavailable for analysis. So, the re construc tion o f the edito rs' rejection of \"The Petrif ied Man, \" based on their comm entary appears in Table 13: 17 The edito rs of the Placer Herald made no overt comm entary, but they did entitle th e article \"Petrified Men,\" which presupposes several findings and thus m ay indicate the editors found the discovery plausible because of prior experience with petrif actions. Of course, the sub stitution of \"Men\" f or \"Man\" could also be the result of a sloppy readi ng of the text or a typo, so any definite judgm ent on it would be hasty. 234 Table 13: D ecision of rival edit ors about \"The P etrified Man\" Medium Internal Coherence Novelty Sensation True * *! \u0016False * * Even though deciding that the \"Petrifi ed Man\" is a \"fal se\" science report requir es the editors to deny that n ovel and se nsation al scientif ic rep orts ar e usually true, they are m ore concerned with the r eputation of the Enterp rise and the internal con sisten cy of the sto ry. T he \"!\" by the violation for Interna l Coherence, indica ting that it is the f atal violat ion in the contes t between the two interpretations, is a little m isleading, fo r in fact, there is not enough data to determ ine which was the abso lute decid ing Petr ified a local-yokel \"interior journal.\" The verti cal dotted line between the expectations indicates th is indeterm inacy. The convention in Optim ality Theory is sim ply to indicate the \"fatal violation\" as far right as possible in a given level of rank, thus indicating the very first or weakest violation (*) that is enough to knock a candidate interpretation out of the running. Progression and Com prehension are harder to represent because they have to do with the allo cation of attention during the read ing process. The other expectations figure in post hoc judgments af ter read ing is com plete. W hile the continual activity and tension between Progression and Comprehension determ ine what gets ad mitted to the interp retive pro cess as d ata, and thus produce an indirect effect on decisions about truth-value, Pr ogress ion and Com prehension operate at a 235 different level than our othe r inte rpretive expectations.18 They vary continually with a read er's em otional and m ental s tates and thus are subj ect to f actors lik e impatience, excitability, and fatigue. As a result of the powerful but oscillating nature of Progression and Com prehension, a ll that can be dete rmined about them from these edito rs' rea dings is that dur ing the phase of their reading experience where they were scan ning the \"details of m ain events\" part of the text, Com prehension was temporarily ranked a bove Progression in a successf ul effort to sort ou t the tangled-up deta ils about the m ummy's posture. There are two m odels of reader in terpr etation inher ing in the Even ing Bulletin 's comm ents that are not v isible un less we focus on recuperatin g reader expectations from the textual ev idence. In add ition to th e editors' reading of the hoax, the B ulletin also presents a projected m odel of what the editors thought their readers expected, sim ilar to the one Twain presented in his analysis of why his \"satires\" failed, or to Poe's m odel of antebellum newsreader expectations in his analysis of the success of Locke's \"Moon Hoax\" versus \"Hans Phaall.\" Simply put, while the S an Francis co editor s believed their reade rs to s hare their parochial disdain for the shoddy journalism of the Enterprise , they feared along with Twain that thei r readers' excited desire to progress through all the pertinent points of the story (perha ps m otivated by a high-ranked value for Sensation and 18 Two exceptions to this observati on are perhaps Sensation and News, which m ay operate selectively during th e reading experience. A highly ranked expectation of sensation or titi llation m ay push pr ogression ahead of comprehension as readers excitedly scan the text for vivid adjectives and \"bloody particulars\"; sim ilarly, skimm ing ac cording to newsreading conventions m ay work with progression to reduce comp rehension of e mbedded details. 236 Novelty as well as a p reference fo r Progression over Comprehension) would cause them to read too quickly and m iss the exposing details. W e know this because the edito rs of the Evening B m ummy's postur e when they reprin ted \"The Petrified Man,\" so that readers who had been skimm ing would stop at the mark, go back, and reev aluate the p osition of the petr ified m an to see that he w as thum bing his nose at them . In short, the editors were educating th eir readers to read as the editors had read, to rank their expec tations the sa me. But the f act that the editors f elt the need to educate their r eaders in this f ashion indica tes that th e edito rs believed their readers read differe ntly and too quickly. The ed itors' model of their read ers' exp ectations is in Tab le 14: E ditors' projection of th eir read interpretive p rocess Sensation Progression Com prehension \u0016True *! False * In the edito rs' view, th eir warnin g sign would force the readers to s top their headlong rush and to re-read the details of Twai n's story carefully enough to comprehend the paradox of the petrified m an's posture.19 The only evidence at this po int that Sensa tion and Prog ression work together com es from Twain's report, detailed above, of watching his re aders rush th rough his sto ries because they are ben t on \"collecting thrills \" as Covici calls it, or \"has tening to rev el in all 19 There is an other cons equence of Comprehension losing this competition, and that is the deactivation of Intern al Consisten cy and Detail, or internal con sisten cy and the evid entiary we ight of detail, as working expectations, because a reader's ability to judge th e internal co nsiste ncy of a story is severely hampered by skimm ing and m issing the details which m ay or m ay not add up. 237 the b lood-curdling particulars\" as Twain himself described it. Dan De Quille seem ed to share Twain's assum ption, as he cautioned Twain to include m ore clues to the satire in th e story (which Twain suspic iously refused to do). So, Twain's observations about the wa y his readers read science news\u2014 that they expected sens ation and novelty, and that they skimm ed using their knowledge of news conventions\u2014seem to be corroborated by the editoria l commentary accom of \"Petrified M an.\" The edito rial comment also offered a n alternative read ing, as com pared to Twain's projected miner readers, to the relationsh ip between Medium and Novelty; that is, we have evidence now that for at l east one group of readers, the negative reputation of the Enterprise trum ped the desires to \"keep up with the tim es\" and take novel scien tific reports a t face value. No w, a portrait of how science news had changed since Poe's time will g ive us an id ea of what Twain's rea ders expecte d to find when they opening the pages of the Enterprise . 3.3 The American popular science genre in 1865 The \"Petrified Man\" ad heres to th e rhetorical form we have been studying in Poe's and Locke's h oaxes (the Popsci. criteria ) in several ways. First, the report p lays on reader s' actua l expe rienc e with f ossiliz ation and petr ifaction an d on reports o f these thing s in the m edia (N ovelty, Plausibility ); further, it purports to describe a petrified m an, which is a unique and suggestive discovery, especially in light of contem porary debates over th e age of the earth and the evo lution of humans on it (Sensation). The story al so in cludes pain staking de tail in the description of the wooden leg and the att itude of the various lim bs of the body 238 and includes technical jargon like \"lim estone sedim ent\" (Detail). There are certainly colorings to so me of the descrip tions, includ ing th e chim ing phrase \"s tony mummy\" and the iron y of \"ref used to allow the charitab le citizens to blast him from his position.\" But thes e ele ments are n ot out of keeping with the Enterp rise's usual style of reporting actual events and discoveries in the Nevada territory in a joking manner, as discussed above. We notice that the s tory is introd uced witho ut the typic al \"m ystery though the m ystery rhetoric is i nvoked later in the story with the phrase \"strange freak of nature.\" Is this an early instance of the \"who, what, when, where, why\" rheto ric of the news article g radually phasin g out the o lder, m ore elaborate style of the 1835 popul ar science article? It is of course im possible to determ ine this without a wi de study, but a sam ple of ei ght contem porary journals, a count of the type of articl es they contained, and a brie f rhetorical analysis of the style of those articles m ay help s uggest directions for future inquiry. For this sample, as with the 1835 sample , I tried to select newspapers local to the Nev ada/Calif ornia regio n or East ern papers which D e Quille and /or Twain were known to read. I have included the Am erican Journal of Science and the Scientif ic American again for com parison with their earlier m anifestations, to see what changes might have arisen the previous thirty years (an immediate observation is that both journals were publishing m ore science by volum e in 1865 than in 1835). A few categ ory labels have also changed. There were no m eta- commentary articles or poem s in the Popular Science category in this survey, and I have added an Alm anac sub-category unde r Popular Science to reflect frequent 239 weather, tid e, and astro nomical rep orts appearing in the daily papers m id-century. Under Popular Technology, I lum ped Educational and How-Two articles together since m ost Educational articles at th is tim e were about how to build or do something rather than g eneral histories. Tables 15 and 16 present the results of the survey. Table 15: 1865 m edia surveyed with nu mber of science ticles per issue Magazine/Ne wspaper Total Scienc e Artic les Am.

However, the totals by category yield a snapsho t of som e changes in science journalism since 1835. In 1865 Popular Technology was still by far the best-represented category in science news, and ads account for an even higher percentage of the total number of science articles included in each paper/journal. This could s imply be because pap ers were carrying m ore ads in general as cities expanded. There was a 1.5% increase in jokes a nd a 1.7% increase in announcem ents of spectacles or exhibitions since 1835, and both of these increases, while inconclusive, are consistent with the upsurge of Ba rnum and other m edicine-show type entertainm ents since the 1830s. Ther e was a m arked drop-off in general educational item s at the hard scien ce leve l (10 .8%), and this could re flect the increasing professionalization of science media, including a general journal like the AJS . This was accom panied by a decrease in blurb/factoid item s in the Popular Science category (11.6%). Toge ther, these results m ight reflect the pulling -out of scientific e ducation from the popular p ress into m ore specialized journals, professional associations, and university courses. A m ore extensive survey would of course have to be conducted to confirm these results.

Am. In short wha t we are seeing in this s mall sam ple is a greater conf ormation of science news to the rhetoric of regular news, with a structure very sim ilar to 244 that Van Dijk found in his survey of news articles, discussed above in section 3.13: sum mary, story (m ain event, deta ils of m ain event), then background, consequences, and comm entary. The pr oblem /solution schem a particular to scienc e new s is still in effect, but th e object now is not explaining wondrous and inexplicable forces of nature, but solv ing practical p roblems in health and industry. A more extensive com parison of news item s between 1835 and 1865 might well corroborate this finding a nd support both the solidif ication of American journalistic styl e and the industrialization of American popular science. Twain's \"P etrified Man,\" as leas t as it was reprin ted in the Even ing Bulletin , confor ms well to this new tem plate. The petrified man is introduced straightforwardly, with \"who, what, wh en, where\" foregrounded in the first sentence. The main even t is detailed next, and then the \"consequences/comm entary\" section is ente red into with th e words \"This strang e freak of nature has created a profound sens ation in our vicinity.\" \"Empire City Massacre\" is structured m uch the sam e way. The popular science article was undergoing a change in Twain's time to conform to an event-oriented journalistic style. These changes to the form at of the popular science article will enter into the ad justm ent of the filter of newsread ing expectations in the next section. Twain's considerable insight into the psychology of hi s readers offers us new perspectives on reader exp ectations in the 1860s. In addition, the reaction to \"Petr ified Man\" of fers evidence o f a m ulti-la yered news reade rship m ade up of groups of readers who each read the st ory differently to suit their differing 245 agendas. All of this new histo rical evid ence\u2014includ ing the chan ges to the popular science genre\u2014 can be acco mmodate d by our Optimality-based model of reading exp ectations. 4. A DJUSTI NG T HE FIL TER OF EXPECTATIO NS TO A CCOUNT FOR TWAIN 'S HOA XING After analyzing Poe's hoaxing, I developed the following working definition of a hoax\u2014that it was a rhetorical exchange in a news m edium between an autho r and a readersh ip that serv ed to sensitiz e readers to their co llusion in the redefinition of reality acco rding to ethnoscientific valu es. From the contem porary reaction to Poe's and Locke's hoax es, I reconstructed the following provisional ranking of expecta tions about Coh.} This notation represents three basi c levels of ranking. Medium and Authority were the strongest determ iners of decisions about truth-value for newsreaders , equally ranked because thes e expectations d id not compete with each o ther in the reaction data. Novelty, Sens ation, and P lausib ility represen t readers' f the conten t of sc ience news with the real world of their desires and experiences (we are dealing with a rough-gr ained Plausibility here, like reader judgm ents ab out alchem y as a p lausible field of scientif ic inno vation ); these expectations formed a m id-strengt h filter on truth-va lue judgm ents. The weakest constraints on truth-value deci sions when reading science news (or science hoaxes) were textual and generi c expectations: P opsci., Foreign, and Intern al Coh erence. 246 After analyzing the response to \"The Petrified Man\" and th e \"Em pire City Massacre,\" both in Twain's commentary and in the reprinting editors' introductions, im portant m odifications need to be m ade both to the definition of hoaxing and to the ranking of reader expe ctations to ref lect the e lapsed thir ty years in hoaxing practices. Twain offers us a va luable vantage point into hoaxing via his analysis of why his \"satires\" faile d and turned into m edia hoaxes. First and forem ost, his denial of deliberate inten tions to hoax his readers m akes us further revise our notions of aut hor intentionality in hoaxing. After Poe's cagey self-constructio n in the case \"M. Valdem ar\" we recognized that initial auth orial intentions inte ract with reader expectations of medium a nd reader responses over tim e in constructing a hoax. An author has m any opportunities dur ing a hoaxing exchange to claim responsibility for the hoax. In the case of Twain's de nials of having deliberately crafted a hoax, we saw that textual and c ontex tual evid ence can argue of innoc ence. The eviden ce in his letter to his brother of Twain's gleeful plotting to further the effects of the hoax on Sewall, coupled with his follow-up of the \"The Petr ified Man \" with further hoax m aterial both argue tha t Twain was engaged in more than m erely post hoc play with the unexpectedly credulous reaction to his \"satire.\" Furt her, Twain went on to write City Massa cre\" withou t corre cting hi s rhetorical \"failures\" in \"The Petrified Man.\" He also wrote, durin g this time and after, many succes sful satires that no one took for hoaxes. It seem s probable that Twain had intended to catch readers off-guard with \"The Petrified Ma n\" all along and hu miliate th em for their 247 na\u00efve trus t in paleon tologists and geologists. A satire, af ter all, as we s aw in th e first chapter, pits both author and reader t ogeth er agains t a socially superior target that needs a com euppance. A hoax, on the other hand, is \"the so rt of scientific humor that aim s directly at the audience' s ignorance\" and reveals it to them (Lee 141). \"The Petrified Man\" was called a hoax publicly by several of the reprinting edito rs, and Twain him self revealed it to be such in his letter to Orion and in th e \"Mem oranda\" article for the Galaxy in 1870. However, Twain's claim that he \"acci dentally\" produced a hoax is crucial to our study of author in tentionality in hoaxing b ecause it rev eals once more that a hoax is not a m onologic statem ent by an author but rather a rhetor ical interaction, residing only in the coordinated activity am ong author, m edium , and readership. Twain's point is that even if he did not intend a hoax, hi s audience's belief in his story crea ted a hoax anyway. W hile the au thor's in tention can direct readers' experience to a cer tain d egree, it s till does not co nstitu te the hoax. What Twain has tuned us into is the realizatio n that reader des ires and expectations are powerful determ iners of hoaxing events. The Enterprise 's core reade rs nee ded new inform ation more than the y needed to save f ace. This led them to place tru st in reports that the pa per's reputation clearly d id not warran t. This is not m erely a rep etition of the old saw, \"People believe what they want to,\" but an opportunity to witn ess ho w specific readerly ex pectations, especially Sensation and Novelty and Medium and Authority, can be ranked differently based on dif ferent reader desires. We saw, through Twain's perspective and the perspective of rival editors, how different groups of Enterprise readers m ight be 248 characterized by their different ranking of these expectations: m iners would rank Novelty over Medium ; most of the othe r core readers would sim ply suspend Medium in their judgm ents; and \"outside r\" readers like com peting editors and Eastern read ers would rank Medium over Novelty. Further, for all readers who ranked Novelty highest, Entertainment (r eading hoaxes purely as entertainm ent) would be deactivated because o f their need to decid e upon an d use the inform ation presented in the newspapers. Edito rs and Eastern readers were the only ones with the luxury to rank Entertainm ent highly and suspend truth- judgm ents about Twain's story. Twain's f inal con th e of hoaxing is the awar eness his comm entary raised psychological constraints with interpretive expecta tions in the reading process. Constraints like Progression and Com prehension do not directly participate in decisions a bout truth-value, but they do act as an early filter on the inf ormation that gets admitted to th e decis ion process. In addition, a hi gh-ranked desire for Sensa tion may both interact with atten tion-allocating exp also assis ents about truth \"The Petr ified Man\" and the commentary surrounding it, I propose a new, dual ranking of reader expecta tions. T he second tier represents the inte raction of Sensation with the new ps ychologic al Authorit Progression} Com prehension 249 We will analyze the f irst tier of expecta tions f irst, taking th em level by level in order to be clear about the cha nges they register between newsreading in Poe's era in New York City and news reading in Virginia City in 1865: 1. First level: Authority. The privilegi ng of Authority in this new ranking is not a change from Poe's era; howeve r, it refl ects a sli ghtly different dynam ic between author and reader. Twain's reputation was an excellent predictor of truth or falsehood for his r eaders since he was fairly consistent with signing \"Sam Clem ens\" only to of low truth-value. Of course, just because Authority was the highes t ranked does not deactivate the rest of the expectations. In the event that Authority did not decide the issue conclusively, readers resorted to the m id-strength expectations to help them decide about truth-value. 2. Second level: {Novelty, Sensation}. Th is mid-strength level reflects the instincts of both Twain and his com peting edito rs that the ir read ers attached hig h truth-v alue to what was new or am azing; it also reflects the needs of miners for a constant st ream of \"inside\" inform ation. The downgrading of Plausibility from this level to the lower lev el since Poe 's time reflects miners' emphasis on no velty as well as their tacit acceptance of a wide range of seem ingly bizarre phenom ena on the frontier. 3. Third level: {(Medium ), Plausibility, Popsci., Internal Coherence}. ternal m easurem ents of the sto ry agains t itself and against \"reality, \" in other words, the elem ents of 250 \"common sense\" readers had to use to m ake truth-value judgm ents in spite of conflicting or absent cues from the m edium and author\u2014provided they had not already been swept away by th e \"extran eous interest\" of the story, in Twain's words. The biggest ch ange since Poe's era is the downgrading and partial d eactivation of Medium . In th is rank ing, Med ium is presented in paren thesis to ref lect the Ente rprise's habitual m ixing of fact and fiction, which rendered its reputation an unreliable barom eter of truth for most readers; Medium rem ains provision ally in the ran king becaus e editors and m iners did have to we igh the tem pting new infor mation the paper published against its reputation for lying (Medium with a negative valence). The second tier of rankings expre sses the way in which news-reading strategies (News), the excitem ent of Sens ation , and th e desire to g et to the goo d stuff (Progression) often defeated Com prehension of textual details, thus actually facilitating the hoax's initial effect of credulity. For this reason, another of the \"morals\" that Twain embedded in his hoaxes, aside from \"don't believe paleontologists\" and \"don't get swept up in poor investing schem es,\" could be stated \"always read th e fine print.\" 5. A PPLYING THE ANALYSIS TO PROBLEMS IN TWAIN SCH OLARSHIP As with Poe, severa l have researched Twain's hoaxing and attem pted to define it and exam ine possi ble influences it m ay have had on other genres of his work. These analyses ge nerally break down into two categories: some extend an analysis of Twain's m edia hoaxes, like \"The Petrified in Twain's others the trope o f illusion a nd hum iliating revelation in the hoaxing activity to psychoanalyze Twain's relationship to scie nce and technology, especially in the final years of his career. My approach\u2014c larifying the relationships with science and readers that Twain constructs in the hoax es first, and then tracking the developm ent of these relationships through his later \"scientifi c\" fiction\u2014validates the rhetorical m ethods of som e of m y predecessors while revising their tendencies to read Twain's la te-life depression back onto hi s scien tific rhetoric. The scholar ly trad ition that re ads the hoax as an organizing trope of Twain's other fictions can be repres ented by Joan Belco urt Ross, Lawrence Berkove, and Pascal C ovici. Their projec t, overall, is ham pered by a loose definition of hoaxing th at fails to d istingu ish T wain's lite rary projects from his social projects. The necessity of cove ring the \"several h undred\" examples of hoaxes th at Joan Ross fi nds in the Twain oeuvre l eads her to create a vagu e definition of the prac tice that cann ot help but contrad ict itself when a pplied to mom ents as diverse as H uck playing a practic al joke on Jim in Huckleberry Finn and the identity switch a t the heart o f The Princ e and the Pauper . For exam ple, Ross initially defines a hoax by saying it provides its writer with hum an comforts\u2014like security and m oney (1), but two pages later she claim s that hoaxers risk \"sham e, hum iliation, and in ex treme cases, death\" by perpetrating their hoaxes (3). Lawrence Berkove attempts to avoid self-contradiction by constraining his definition of hoaxing. He iden tifies A Connecticu t Yank ee in King Arthur's 252 Court as a \"tragic hoax\" as opposed to a co medic hoax like \"Petrified Man.\" He writes, \"Readers expect the targ et of the hoax to be one or more of the characters in a work of fiction; it a lways com es as a shock, when they learn th at they are the author's real target\" (Berkove 89). The centr al problem with this definition is that once readers know they are readi ng a novel like A Connecticut Yankee and have therefore decoupled their in terpretation of it from thei r construction of the real world they live in, it is impossible f or the author to m ake them the \"targ et\"; theref ore, it is im possible to hoax them in the sam e way t hat Twain h oaxed his farmer-read ers or the ed itors who blithely re printed \"The Petrified Man\" as news. Reality as readers know it\u2014i. e., the reality in w hich th ey pick up their kids from school, go to church, or buy stock\u2014does not change to m atch the world of the science fiction novel they have just finish ed. The realities of those who believe media hoaxes, on the other hand, change until the hoax is revealed, and perhap s even after th at. Pascal Cov ici's conception of h oaxing is, of this school, the m ost congenial to the aim s of this project; he thinks of hoaxes in term s of reader expectations. He was the one who first pointed out that Twain was using hoaxes like \"The Petrified Man\" and concluded, \"The hoax is aim ed at the assumptions that m ake the rom antic appreciation of sensatio nalism possible\" (154 ), becaus atch those a ssumptions, at leas t initia lly, in order to achieve its hum bling effect. However, Covici's definition of hoaxing is still too b road. He wishes to 253 recuperate an excised secti on of Life on the Mississippi concerning a grisly balloon journey as a lost Tw ain hoax. W hen he points ou t that the s tory is alm ost certainly a parody of Poe's \"M.S. F ound in a Bottle\" and \"Hans Phaall,\" he is in fact correct. With its exaggerated desc riptions, like \"dead people in all possib le stages of greenness & m ildew , & all of them grinning & staring...& a lot of dried anim als of one sort & another\" (256), a nd its being m arked for inclusion in a hyperbolic m emoir, the tale is indeed a pa rody rather than a hoax; it cannot play with its rea ders' con ceptions of reality. Neith er can the other \"m issing hoax\" Covici wishes to include in the Tw ain hoax canon, the parodic opening of Twain's \"Double-Barreled Detective Story\" where Twain sets motionless wing\" (Clem 264). second case, C ovici argues that T wain's \"double-speak\" with scientific term inology like the word \"esophagus\" \"suggests the form al prerequisites of any hoax\" ( 144), and he is again right . Choosing (or creating) words that are read over and accepted w ithout com prehension or analysis by readers who just assum e the concept is ove r their heads\u2014th is is perhaps the m ost funda mental m ove toward building a m edia hoax. But the \"esophagus\" paragraph and the excised balloon chapter of \"R oughing It\" are both literary parodies, appear ing in liter ary contexts whe re they are disabled f rom altering readers ' expectations of reality. S o, Covici's criticism of Tw ain's hoaxing, while the m ost rhetorical and perceptive of the school we have just review ed, still conflates playing with literary co nventions and pl aying with epis temology. This m istake 254 obscures th e choice th at Twain made to address his readers' construction of reality with his hoaxes a nd his social critic ism, as we will see mom entarily . The second category of Twain hoax scholarship is the psychoanalytic category. The basic critical m ove made by the foundational sc holars in this school is to use Twain's disappointm ents with scientists and machines to argue that he, though initially gulled by a visi on of utopian progress through science, becam e disillusioned with science in his la ter years and feared it would be used by people m erely to des troy each oth er. The m ore rhetorical an gle of this v iew holds that Twain perform ed hoaxes to d ramatize to him self and to his readers his sense of betrayal by prom ises of technological utopias that delive red only dystopic self- annihilation. This approach to Twain's relationship to science tends to get the cart before the horse, reading Twain's bitter losses and disappointm ents with science and m edicine later in his life back onto his scientific rhetoric. The psychological school of Twain's scientific philosophy was opened by Hyatt W aggoner, who claim ed Twain came to the conclusion that self- determ ination was an illusion. \"Mark Twain lived the last fifteen years of his life a bitter pess imist and a philosoph ical m echanist...He ca me to think of m an as a machine buffeted by a n indifferent, if not hostile, m echanical un ivers e\" (357 ). This essential point has been repeated with small variations in studies of Twain's science by Tom Burnam, Ja mes Wilson, and Sherwood Cumm ings. Shelley Fisher Fishkin instead invokes \"am bivalence, \" the prevailing trope in criticism of the Am erican Rom antics' a ttitude s toward science, to label Twain's own scientific philosophy. She claim s that Twain's disappointm ents with science, 255 figured by the death of hi s brother Henry in a steam boat explosion and Twain's failed inves tment in the am toward sc ience 's intense prom ise for improvem ent of Am erican life on the one hand and its \"potential for dehum anization and de vastation\" on the other (179-180). Joan Belcourt Ross and Lawrence Berkove extended this m ode of criticism in the last phases of their more rhetorical analyses of Twain's hoaxing. Both of them take the hoax as the orga nizing principle of Twain's scientific cosm ology. Berkove figur es the \"Sand Belt\" chapter of A Connecticut Yankee , in which Hank Morgan ironically ends up barbequing 11,000 knights on his electric fences after working for years to \"rescue\" feudal England from its barbaric ignorance, as a dramatization of Twain's ow n belief that hum ans are m erely the \"butt of God's rather grim practical joke or 'hoax'\" (90). Ross's argum ents about the pow er of the hoax in Twain's personal philosophy are not centered specif ically on his view of science, but on his determ inist view of hum an nature in general, the \"propensity of all m en, everywhere, consciously or unconsciously, to be implicated in the creatio n and/or the sustaining of illusio n \" (5). Ross clai ms that Twain used laughter to try to shock his readers out of this state into fleeting m oments of self-realization, an interesting argum ent we will tu rn to in th e final section. The consensus of these scholars' readings of the hoa x in T wain's sc ientific and m oral ph ilosop hy is tha t the hoax becam e the or ganizing tro pe of his thought\u2014that Twain ca me to view human beings as gullib le victim s of a universa l hoax and that, excep t for the brief 256 respite offered by laughter, there was no way out of this grim cycle of illusion and disillusionment. These theories tell us less about Tw ain's views on science than they do about our o wn desires as scholars to reduce Twain's p ersonality, philo and reductio aspects of Twain's hoaxing. The hoax is an essentially social transaction, requiring for its dual effect of illusion/revelation all of the disparities in knowledge and im perfect tr ansfers of inform ation th at obtain between author, medium , and audience in a newsreading cultu re. As a social transaction, the hoax was a cons cious rh etorical choice of st ance fo r Twain, no t an inevitable s ide- effect of his \"m echanistic\" world view . Twain chose many other genres of interaction with his readers as well: satir e, novels, essays, editorials, travelogues, and lectures. Why not exam ine Twain's science through these rhetorical lenses instead ? Scholars are attracted to the idea of viewing Twain's personal philosophy through the hoax because it pres ents an appearance/reality d ichotom y as well as a rhetorical model for social c ontrol, and these issues definitely m irror fears that T wain harbored about the role of science in hum an society. However, these scholars have not yet succeeded in establishing any kind of necessary connection between Twain's use of the hoax and Twain's m oral or scientific philosophy. In fact, the one scientific m edia hoax Twain actually pulled off, \"The Petrified Man,\" when Twai n was young and optim istic. It does not discuss m achines or the m echanistic worl d view that these scholars believe was 257 Twain's las t resor t in his late r yea rs after he re jected the illusion of the scientif ic salvation of hum anity. The prom ising aspects of these approaches to Twain's philosophy of scienc e, the n, are rela tively restricted. In the final phases of Joan Belcourt Ross's argum ent, s he inquires into what sort of relationship Twain was attempting to build with his readersh ip via th e rhetoric of the hoax. That question will be the focus of the next and final section of this chapter. In establis hing th e significance of the hoax in Twain's scientific thought , we must work against the grain of Twain scholarship to this point. Inst ead of projecting Twain's m echanistic depression backward and reading it onto hi s scientific hoaxing behavior, we m ust work from his early hoaxing forward through his thinking, traveling along the threads of argum ents introduced by the hoa xes to see how they are developed in Twain's writing about science. 6. R ELATIONSHIP OF THE HOAX TO TWAI N'S SCIENTIF IC THI NKING We have already discussed early hoaxes, \"The Petrified Ma n,\" and \"Em pire City Mas in so me detail. Identifying the argum ents Twain makes about science here is relatively easy, as Twain's philosophy of science is simple and relatively undevel oped at this stage. \"The Petrified Man\" argues that both scientists and lay readers jum p to conclusions, that the desire to prove a theory (Darwinism ) or the desire for ti tillation m akes people overlook facts that would lead them to a different and more sobering conclusion if they took the tim e to conside r them . \"The Petrif ied M an\" also per forms two addition al arguments about science in culture: one , that scientists are com peting with journalists for the 258 author ity to crea te the West for readers; two, th at the media both exacerbates this problem by repr inting sensationa l scien ce ne ws willy-n illy, and provides a potential rem edy in the for m of gate-keep ing editors who exercis e their common sense. How ever, Twain's hoax dramatizes the extreme difficulty of using rheto ric to sens itize reade rs to their na \u00efve a ssum ptions. Nam ely, if they will not slow down long enough to read what h as been written, the best and most telling argum ent against th eir n a\u00efvet\u00e9 can turn easily into a confirm ation of it. A brief review of three of Twain's im portant la ter works concerning science, 3,000 Years Among the Microbes , Connecticut Yankee , and An American Claim ant, will revea l to what exten t these early f ibres of Twain's scien tific rhetor ic are taken up by an older and wiser T wain. 6.1 3,000 Years Among the Microbes This unfinished novel prom otes a fract al model of hum an soc iety through the inv estiga tion of one o f its m icroco sms: germ society. Twain's basic postulate is that every being is made up of a soci ety of sm aller beings who are not aware that th e \"un iverse \" they inhabit is r eally just a larger, m ore com plex organism that, in turn, belongs to a society of its own. The narrator is a cholera-germ who calls him self \"Huck,\" among other nam es, and he alone knows that all of his germ compatriots in all their leve ls and castes of society ar e merely cells in the body of a diseas ed tram p nam ed Blitzkow ski; Huck bears th is privileged a wareness because he was a hum an, and a scientist, b efore he was accidentally tu rned into a germ by an \"alchem ist.\" The im plication pervading Huck's stories about his lif e 259 among the germ s is that hum ans them selves are various types of germ s\u2014good and bad\u2014in a greater organism they call the universe. Twain's research into m icrobiology, manifest in this book, is im pressive for a write r in the e arly twentieth centu ry. His ecological sen sitivity is noteworthy, too, as he cons iders the ignorance of dis ease germ s as they wreck their \"environm ent.\" A yellow-fev er germ friend of Huck's com plains that the tiny m icroorganism s that infest the germ s themselves are n ot aware of the pain they are causing their hosts; if they knew, they would stop. Huck m uses at this, \"You notice that? He did not suspect that he, also, was engaged in gnawing, tortu ring, d efiling, rotting, and murder ing a fellow-creature\u2014he an d all th e swarm ing billions of his race. None of them suspects it\" (454). Huck go es on to make it clear that this statem ent applies to hum an ecology as well: It hints at the possibility that the procession of known and listed devourers and persecutors is not comple te. It suggests th e possibility, and substantially the certainty, that m an is him self a m icrobe, and his globe a blood-corpuscle drifting with its shin ing brethren of the Milky W ay down a vein of the Master and Make r of all things, Whose body, m ayhap,\u2014 glimpsed partwise from the earth by night, and receding and lost to view in the m easureless remotenesses of Space\u2014is what m en nam e the Universe (454). Huck persists with h is human scien tific activ ities even as a germ . He and some friends put together a scientific society on the ba sis of having \"excavated\" a calcified flea imbedded in one of Blitzkowski's ar teries. They gath er at the 260 \"fossil m ine\" and pick over the bones as human paleontologists would with a dinosaur. Here, it appears Twain intended a second satire of paleontologists who build m onsters out of a single bone chip, si milar to the m ocking portrait he crafted in \"How the Anim als of the W oods Sent Out a S cientific Expedition\"\u2014but he cut all 18 pages of it from the manuscript. He does not excise , however, a stinging satire of scientists for bei ng so absorbed in their m ethods that they m iss the truth. Huck explains to his scientist germ friends that he was once a hum an and that the organism they inhabit is part of a whole other and bigger universe. He is either scoffed at for a liar or lauded for his beautif ul \"poetry\" (487). Twain also satirizes the m ercenary turn of science as its shoulder inevitably bends to the wheel of capitalism in Am erica. Hu ck discovers a gold m ine in one of Blitzkowski's m olars\u2014actua lly, he imagines it is there and convinces all the other scientists that it is , too. But the m ore he considers working the m ine with them , the sm aller and sm aller a share of th e prof its he is willing to give his friends (551- 553). The m anuscript ends there, l eaving a perhaps unfair but powerful impression that Twain believ es the ultim ate goal of Am erican s cience is no t finding the truth but making a buck. This rather cynical ending leads Beverly Hum e to speculate that 3,000 Years Am ong the Microbes is an exercise f or Twain in exorcising his own get-rich-quick dem ons in the wake of the Paige typesetter disaster (80). 6.2 A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court This novel is probably the m ost discu ssed in the reconstruction of Twain's views of the role of science and technology in hum an so ciety. It is th e 261 cornerstone of psychoanalytic argum ents that Twain felt hoaxed by technology and by the universe\u2014particularly the fina l chapter, \"The Sand Belt.\" F or a book that is in general a hum orous satire on system s of prim ogeniture and aristocracy, which Twain found re sidually operative in Southern plantation culture, the straight-faced brutality of th e final chapter is a s hock. But it is also an indication that the \"im provem ents\" that have co me before\u2014Morgan's caste-leveling schools and factories, his capitalism , his intr oduction of Victorian hygiene and work ethic\u2014are in the end deadly im provem ents, or at the leas t, null im provem ents, as Morgan destroys any trace of them that history m ight have hoped to find. H. Bruce Franklin points out that th is sharp denunciation of the dystopic future of fered by sc ience is no t the o nly social criticism of science Twain worked into the \"Sa nd Belt\" chapter of Connecticut Yankee . Franklin argues that Twain, innovating the genre of tim e-travel ficti on with Morgan's trip back to feudal England, institu tes a new social tim e-scale, one based on technological advancem ent rather than chronology. It is a time-scale Twain senses underlying the m yth of progress in his own cu lture, and in Connecticut Yankee he reje cts its utopic teleology: Hank' s apocalyptic weapons resolv e the paradoxes of tim e travel by destroying everything that the nine teenth century has anac hronistically introduced into the dark ages. But th is resolution itself is paradoxical. The science and technology that mark progress, that distinguish forward from backward in tim e, becom e the m eans to annihilate a ll that hum anity has created. Thus they display their pot entia l to transform the f uture into 262 the prehum an prim eval past, that is, m indless oblivion. (Franklin Traveling 170) From this viewpoint Connecticut Y ankee is no t just a criticism of the d amaging power of technology bent to the hum an desi re to dom inate others. It is also a refutation of the entire social ep istemology resulting fro m equating scientific advancem ent with hum an development. 6.3 The American Claimant This novel is another round-about atta ck on aristocratic system s\u2014this time in the guise of a young earl's son who, to resolve a century-long dispute between the currently recogni zed Earl of Ross and an Am erican \"claim ant\" to that title, gives up his inheritance to co me to Am erica and live as a common American. Technology figures in this book in a positive and humorous light in comparison to m ost of Twain's later works. Colonel Selle rs, the Am erican claim ant, spends half his tim e writing le tters to the Earl of Ross in England pleading his claim to th e title; the other h alf of his tim e, he spends inventing. Both activities are pure com ic relief in Tw ain's novel. The inve ntion that Sellers is dead serious about\u2014a system for r eanim ating the dead for the purposes of soldiery and slave labor\u2014am ounts only to black com edy. However, the item s he tosses off in his spare tim e\u2014like a little tangle puzzle called \"Pigs in C lover\"\u2014 ironically make him loads of m oney, which he m erely squanders in the pursuit of his re-anim ation system . In addition to com edy, invention serves as a serious sym bol of the positive face of Ame rican dem ocracy in th e novel. The young Tracy (the Am erican nam e 263 the young British Ross adopts after all evidence of his true identity is destroyed in a hotel fire) visits a Mechanics Club debate in Virginia and is awed and pleased at the dem ocratic construction of knowledge he finds underway there. In his journal Tracy repro duces th e speech giv en by a Club m ember on the value of m echanics as citizen s, over and against co llege-educated scientis ts: It can no doubt be easily shown th at the colleges have contributed the in tellectual pa rt of this prog ress, and th at tha t part is vast; but tha t the material pro gress has been imm easurab ly vaster I think you will con cede. Now I have been looking over a list of inventors\u2014the creators of this amazing m aterial dev elopment\u2014and I find that they were not college-b red men...It is not overstatem ent to say th at the im agination-stunning m aterial developm ent of this century, the only century worth living in since tim e itself was in vented, is th e cre ation of men not college-bred. We think we see what these inventors have done; no, we see only th e visible vast frontage of their work; behind it is thei r far vaster work, and it is invisible to the careless glance. They have r econstru cted this n ation- -made it ove r, that m etaphorically speaking, have m ultiplied its num bers almost beyond the power of figures to express. (83) The speaker proceeds to a calculation of how the m achines that inven tors have created have m ultiplied m an-power. \"You look around you and you see a nation of sixty m illions\u2014apparen tly; but secr eted in their hands and brains, an d invisible to your eyes, is the true populat ion of this Republic, and it num bers forty 264 billions! It is the stup endous creation of those hum ble, unlettered, un-college- bred inventors\u2014all honor to their nam e\" (83). In light of Twain's background as a j ourneym an printer, riverboat pilot, and novice m iner, it is not surprising to find his young British protagonist celeb rating the advan tage of tradesm an over the college-educated. However, interestingly , Tracy als o enthus iastical ly records the speaker's praise of th e American m edia for its work exp osing th e schemes and illusions of the elite classes in A merica: \"F or its m ission...is to stand guard over a nation's liberties, not its humbugs and sham s\" (80). This e quation of the press with the revelation of \"sha ms\" perpetrated by powerful classes in Am erica is crucial for our discussion of Twain's soci al project of hoaxing. 6.4 Analysis In Twain's later works we find conf irmation and developm ent of nearly every strand of argum ent about science pres ent in \"The Petrified Man\" with some additional lines of argum ent added. Tw ain still believ es scientists are hurting them selves as m uch as the public when they m ake simple judgm ents about complicated system s motivated m ore by their commercial and political agendas then by an authentic hunger for truth. He still believes the media can help expose scientific and ot her social hum bugs; however, he stil l respects and fears the power of readers/h earers to ex tract uncontrollably m any interp retations f rom the sam e discours e, as uman universe in 3,00 0 Years A mong the Microbes . 265 To these lines of argum ent Twain has added others based on his life experience. They inclu de an enthu siasm for invention in the spirit of the self - made Jacksonian tradesm an\u2014evident both in Am erican Claimant and Connecticut Yankee \u2014counterbalanced by a very real horror of what Am erican inventions can do when put to the task of \"correcting\" the b ackward ways of less technolog ically dev eloped countries. This \"am bivalence\" is what has led psychoanalytic scholars to identify Tw ain's experience with s cience an d technology as the last straw in confirm ing his late-life depression. However, there is another, more rhetorical way to c onstruct Twain's relationship to science suggested by his own works. Twain's treatm ent of science in \"T he Mysterious Stranger\" m anuscripts, written in his dark later years, tells a s lightly different story about Twain's beliefs about the relationship between science and hum an society than has regularly been assum ed by scholar s. In this work L ittle Satan a rgues that h umanity da mns itse lf with its \"moral sense\" and sim ply uses the pro ducts of science to help (Wilson 81). It is hum an nature th at is to b lame for the inab ility of the hum an race to progress past the brutal dom inance of those who think and live differently. Science and technology sim ply aid that project both philosophically (i.e. with Morton's craniolog ical theories of th e inferiority of non- White races as discussed in Chapter 2) and physically (with the Gatlin g gun and other war m achines). Some of the sam e scholars who s ee Twai n as a bitter m echanist do acknowledge this turn in Twain's thinking. Waggoner writes that Twain \" used science to reinforce his thinking\" (367). And Ja mes Wilson concludes after reading the 266 \"Mysterious Stranger\" that Twain believe s the here is...m erely a handm aiden to his depraved nature, c reating a world even worse than the on e preced ing it\" (81). But at th is point, th is line of argu ment reaches a disconn ect for m ost Twain scholars, for they ge nerally evince a belief that Twain was not a social activ ist\u2014 a socia l satir ist, cer tainly, but so meone who dealt s eriously with contem porary social issues and tried to persuade Am ericans to adopt certain solution s. According to this view , wh en Twain said that science would not destroy hum an society but that human natu re would, he was certainly criticizing, but not constructively. Indeed, Twain's pessim istic view of human nature, his determ inism and m echanism , woul d not s eem to foster any kind of ideal of progress or im prove ment for the hum an lot. But reexam ining the question of what kind of relationship Twain was build ing with his readers through his hoaxes, coupled with a m ore careful analysis of Twain's social activism , leaves a very different impression. Twain did indeed ha ve a social agenda, \"to help a m an to see him self true\"(Ross 189). This turns out to be not m erely a static goal, but a constructiv e one, accomplished th rough the social m echanics of laughter. To arriv e at th is conclusion , we will return to Twain's ear ly ro ots in f rontier hum or and its social function, review the modifications he m ade to that m ode with his media hoaxes, and consider how this activ ity meshed with his socia l criticism in his la ter years. 267 7. T HE SOCIA L MECHAN ICS OF LAU GHTER Laughter is an extrem ely specializ ed reaction to an argum ent of difference, specifically, a difference betw een our assum ptions and a revelation of how things \"really\" are or how th ey are \"really\" being constructed f or us by others. Laughter, especially in A merica, is a response to juxtaposition of the reade r/viewer's assum ptions w ith a very different presentati on of reality\u2014a big man riding a bike that is much too s mall for hi m, a m an weari ng wom en's clothes, a baby talking with an adult's voice, a p ack of wolves chasing a m arching band instead of a herd of reindeer . In all of these cas es, we perceive a gap between our a priori assum ptions about the world and a surp rise revelation of how it is re ally working at this m oment (in irony, we find i t works exactly counter to our assum ptions). The perception of this gap triggers laughter as a response. For some of us, the laugh ter also exp resses a desire to close the gap, to adjust our assum ptions so as not to be caught off guard again. For others of us, the laughter is pure play, an appreciation of the im perfections and incom pleteness of our understanding, a good-natured sym pathy w ith the \"joke being on us.\" James Cox argues that, for Twain, laughter is the conversio n of pain into pleasure, and Twain's own writings seem to support this hypothesis (Cox 146). Twain argues in \"Down the Rhone\" that, just as an i ce-cube on your bare back cannot be told from a hot brand for a sec ond or so, so can the shock or recognition that you have m isperceived real ity as a result of som eone's perform ance of it feel like both pain and pleasure (Ross 9). At first there is just the shock, and the question of how you respond to it is a question of social co ntrol. If you feel you 268 were m ade, agains t your will, to misperceive reality by those who played on you r assum ptions to perp etrate an illu sion on you, then anger and fear m ay result. However, your laughter can convert the shoc k of the experience to a reassertion of self-determ ination. It dem onstrates a gap now between your self that was duped and your real, wiser self that can appreciate a good joke and will be harder to dupe the next tim e. Laughter creates distance between your old mode of perception and your new, enlightened self; a nger and fear do not. That is what we mean when we say that people took som ething \"personally.\" They were unable to create a distance between their n egative f ace (ho w they s ee them selves) and their positiv e face (how they think ot hers s ee them ) through laughter.20 Twain knew all about this dynam ic from his experience with frontie r humor. Briefly, let us recap the social f unctions of the tall tale that bear on our discussion of Twain's social m echanics of laughter: The tall tale dem onstrates contro l of unknown/frightening social and natura l envir onment The tall tale constructs a group of \"outsiders\" w ho fall for the tale, and sets th em apart from the \"insid er\" or \"insid ers\" w ho tell the ta le. The tall tale critic izes the unwarrante d (in the opinion of the insiders ) elite status the o utside rs enjoy and argu es tha t their estab lished trad itions a re useless on the frontier (cow boys vs. \"city slickers\") 20 For a discus sion of negative and po sitive face as they bear on politeness and other pragm atic aspects of hum an communication, see Brown, P. and Levinson, S.C. Politenes s: som e universals in lan guage usage. Studies in Interactional Sociolinguistics 4. Cam bridge : Cambridge University Press, 1987. 269 Telling a ta ll tale was a powerf ul way to r ebuild conf idence, solidif y insider status, and criticize out siders. Being a victim of a tall ta le lef t you with several options, the two prim ary ones be ing anger and laughter. Anger cem ented your outsider status, and then you were le ft to other m eans\u2014violence or the law\u2014to challenge the insiders and re-tak e control. Laughter, on the other hand, did not necessarily m ake you an insider, but it distanced you from the \"outsider\" values that the tall ta le cr iticized . This lau ghter m ay not have f elt at all pleasurable, despite Cox's argum ent, but it was a counter-m ove to regain self- contro l against the so cial con trol exerted by the telle r of the tall ta le. Th at so cial contro l cons isted of an a we-inspiring power to se t comm unity values and alloc ate community resources on the frontier. Insi ders \"got it, \" in more ways that one. Outsiders did not. Twain m ade several important change s to th is basic social m achinery when he en gineered his \"Petrified the Enterp rise. He was clea rly familiar with Poe 's hoaxes, as we saw above in the excised balloon chapter from Life on the Mississippi , and though he was born just a few m onths after the publication of Locke's \"Moon Hoax,\" he had undoubtedly heard of it b y the tim e he worked on the Enterprise . Perhaps he even r ead it; the first re-issue of the hoax , in an edition by W illiam Griggs, was published in New York in 1852 just a few m onths before Twain moved to New York Cit y. Twain knew that, in order to fly, hoaxes needed an \"unfair preten se at truth \" that th e ephem eral orality of the tall tale could not quite produce. This \"pretense\" entailed appearing in print, in a news m edium that people relied on exclusively for 270 knowledge of what wa s going on outside th eir sm all Western town. It also entailed the adoption of standard dialect and all the form al features encapsulated in readers' P opsci. expectations (Rourke 2:6), as opposed to th e vernacular dialect and narrative for m of the tall tale. The print m edia offered both anonym ity and distan ce tha t the te lling o f a tall tale c ould not; the se mechanism s were cru cial for slowing down any \"facts\" that m ight filt er, through conversatio n between readers, into the workings of the hoax and gri nd its gears to a halt. A hoax also presupposed a level of publicity th at the or al modality of the tall tale could no t possibly achieve, thus increasing and sp eeding the diffusion of the hoax through multiple readerships and aggrand izing the repu tation of its author (Kaufer 411, 416). In short, Twain knew a hoax worked its effect by pretending two things in one\u2014pretending to be a \"real\" new s story, thereby pretending that the events it reported had really happened. A tall tale simply preten ded that th e events it related we re real\u2014and som etimes it los t even tha t pretense with all its exaggerations for hum orous effect. A good tinkerer, Twain adapted the m echanics of the tall tale to suit his purposes. A tall tale produced an awaren ess of outsider status and perhaps a chance to reassert self-determ ination th rough the distancing function of laughter. A hoax, on the other hand, could create som ething m ore. While the victim of a tall tale could learn little other than that s/he did not fit in on the frontier, the victim of a hoax could learn a lo t more becaus e his/her assu mptions abo ut scien ce and the real world were the real targ et. This was Twain's design when he set out to \"kill the petrif actio n mania with a de licate, a very delic ate satire\" in the 271 \"Petrified Man,\" and when he set out to expose the divide nd-cooking m ining companies in the \"Em pire City Massacre. \" The hoax offe rs an opportunity to open readers' eyes to potentially dange rous assum ptions they m ake about a particular soci al institution. The hoax accom plishes this in the mom ent the reader perceives the gap, the lack, between what s/he has assum ed and what the state of the art re ally is. I t is a m oment of embarrassm ent, in the \"pregnant\" root sense of the word\u2014the mom ent when everyone else can see publicly what you know privately about yourself. If this m oment of em barrass ment is produced by an awareness of ignorance about a subject\u2014science or economics, for instance, an educativ e potential to the hoax experi ence emerges. The distanci ng effect of laughter, in addition to reasserting self-control, can al so exp ress a desire for self-education as insulation against further attem pts by othe rs to control you through illusions. This instru ctive mom ent of em barrass ment is very sim ilar to the m oment that Socrates 's dialectic partners cam e to r ealize the gap of inconsistency between beliefs they entertained sim ultaneously\u2014the elenchus. What is par ticula rly inte resting is that there is s ome eviden ce that Twain was f amiliar with the elenchus as a dialectic method. W hile there is no direct evidence th at he read Plato, he av idly enjoyed Voltaire, who channeled a great deal of Platonic dialectic in to French comm on-sense criticism . Voltaire and Twain, in fact, are considered together as founders of the Freethinkers movem ent, an atheist move ment beginning in the 18th century that now is usually labeled secula r humanism . Voltaire 's works contain d ialectic passag es sim ilar to Socratic 272 dialogues, w here a na\u00efve questioner is m ade by a m aster dialectician to adm it the inconsistency of his/her assum ptions. One of these passage s can be found in Candide where Mar tin and Candide debate the jaded critical a ttitude of Pococurante, and Martin brings Candide to elenchus by pointing out an inconsis tent belief he en tertains\u2014th at Pococuran te experiences pleasu re by never having pleasure (Voltaire 139). In 3,000 Years Am ong the Microbes , Twa in construc ts a very sim ilar dia lectic b etween Huck and a clergym an over the is sue of anim als having souls. The clergym an begins: \"What creatu been created.\" \"That is b road; has it a restricted sen se?\" \"Yes. The dictionary adds, ' especially a living being.'\" \"Is that what we comm only m ean when we use the word?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is it also what we always m ean when we use it without a qualifying adjec tive?\" \"Yes.\" ( 496) And the d ialectic con tinues until the cl ergym an forces Huck to see that he already believes all living be ings, germ s included, have souls because Huck does not distinguish \"life\" from \"an imation,\" or soul-possession. The question arises, then, if Tw ain was bringing his readers' understanding of the world to an elenchus , a null state of inte rnal contradiction, why was he doing it? What did he hope to accom plish with his readers by 273 enter ing into this dia lectic with them in \"The Petr ified Man\" ? Joan Belcourt Ross argues th at Twain wanted his readers to \"see them selves true,\" to rea lize th ey were all the victim s of hoaxes perpet rated not only by scientists, but by the church, by politicians, by Twain's favorite flogging-horse, Christ ian Science, etc. (Ross 189). Pascal Covici m akes the sam e point slightly differently: \"T hoax- as-sa tire becomes espec ially Twain' s works wh en it se rves to reveal the hidd en truth abou t the read er himself. Ourselves in part icular, not people in general, are stripped of pretensions and made to stand self -revealed by Twain's most effective hoaxes\" (159). This goal as expressed by Ross and Covici is essentially a n egative on e. It argues for a deconstructive laughter that tears down the \"wonder-business\" of popular science but builds no be lief structure in its place. This is the sort of laughter that follows a Poe hoax, as Poe had no vested interest in im proving the lives of the people he fooled with his hoaxes (R ourke 6:3). But Twain's hoaxes are not like Poe's. Twain states a social goal from the beginning of \"The Petrified Man,\" and that is to snap h is readers ' out of their googly-eyed fascination with paleontology while \"touching up\" the local coroner, to boot. If Twain was shaking up his reader s' perceptions o f reality, wh at did he want to put in place of th eir illu sions, if anything ? Constance Rourke in her study of Twai n's humor writes, \"It is a m istake to look for the social critic\u2014even manqu\u00e9 \u2014in Mark Twain. In a sense the whole American com ic trad ition had been that of social criticis m: had been instin ctive a nd incom plete, and be in Mark Twain\" (7:2). Rourke, 274 like Ross, sees Twain d econstru cting the edifices in which his reade rs put their trust bu t refusing to in culcate them with his ow n values, tell them what to believe now. In fact, however, Twain was very vocal about what he thought Am ericans should believe. W e have already seen his praise of worki ng m en ove r college boys in An Am erican Claim ant. He dedicated a book to exposing what he felt to be the frau dulent claim s of Mary Baker Eddy in Christian Science . And, he cham pioned dem ocracy against hereditary system s of power in Huckleberry Finn , An American Claim ant, and Connecticut Yankee . In Following the Equator , he decried both m issionaries and Am erican Im perialism , arguing for the fundam ental right to self-determ ination of all nations on earth. This last was the social arena in which Twain was m ost active. He was Vice Presid ent of the Anti-Im perialist league from 1901 until his death in 1910 and a vocal opponent of both the Sp anish- American and the Philipp ine-Am erican wars, especially the brutal use to whic h technology was put in them . His essay for the North Am erican Review in 1901, \"To the Person Sitting in Darkness,\" was a scathing review of \"the m issionary question\" in th e wake of the Boxer Rebellion in China. In it Twain denounces the use of Am erican technology to extend American dom inance over less industrialized nations under the guise of missionary a ctivity: Shall we? That is, shall we go on c onferring our Civilization upon the peoples that sit in darkness, or sh all we give those poor things a rest ? Shall we bang right ahead in our ol d-tim e, loud, pious way, and comm it the new cen tury to the g ame; or shall we sober u p and sit do wn and thin k 275 it over first? W ould it not be prudent to get our Civilizati on-tools together, and see how m uch stock is left on hand in the way of Glass Beads an d Theology, and Maxim Guns and Hy mn Books, and Trade-Gin and Torches of Progress and Enlightenm ent (patent adjustable ones, good to fire villages with, upon occasion ), and balance th e books, and arrive at the profit and loss, so that we m ay intelligently dec ide whether to continue th e business or sell out the property an d start a ne w Civiliza tion Schem e on the proceeds ? (2) The essay created such a m edia firestorm , according to J im Zwick, that one inent Massachu setts ed itor claim ed, \"Mark the m ost inf luential anti-im perialist and the m ost dread ed critic of the s acrosan ct person in the W hite House that the country contains.\" The backlash affected Twain significantly. What is today cons idered Twain's m ost powerful piece of anti-war literatu re, the \"W ar Prayer,\" a black satire of the glories of war reminiscent of Stephen Crane's \"War is Kind,\" was considered so incendiary by Twain's biographer, Albert Bigelow Paine, that he urged T wain to suppress it; it was only published posthum ously, during W orld W ar I. Certainly, this late-life political cause against the connection between American technology and Am erican im perialism cannot be read back onto Twain's early hoaxing, like \"The Petrified Man,\" but it reflects the reaching of a state of critical m ass of a concern that is p resent in that s eminal hoax, presen t throughout all of Twain's had one absolute be lief, consisten tly ev ident in his think ing, it was in the righ t of a hum an 276 being to decide his/her own destiny. Twain's hoaxes gave readers a chance, through the social m echanics of laught er, to stand apart from their old preconceptions and choose a new path. Lest we think of Twain as the cham pion of free-thinking, however, it is important to point out that Twain also recog nized th e powerful m echanics of control inherent in the hoax. If the reader wished to be an \"insider\" like the author, then the hoax could instigat e the kind of laughter that desired identification, an education in insider-hood, a distancing of the self from the old self-im age, and a realignm ent with the valu es of the author and his insider group. Warwick Wadlington finds ex actly this dynam ic active in Twain's satiric travel narrative In nocents Abroad . In The Confidence Gam e in Am erican Lite rature, Wadlington takes issue with Jam es Cox, who says that Twain hoped to use his readers' lau ghter to \"s et the reader free\" from her m isconceptions. Wadling ton finds instead that Twain wish ed to shatter h is readers' habitu al ep istem ologies and then reshap e as Twain saw them. \"The re ally pe rtinent test of sincerity in the book 's rhetorical system is wh ether or not a given Twain perform ance accom plishes the twofold end of relieving ex citab le feelings and achieving authority over the reader\" (195). T wain's hoaxes can be viewed as another rhetorical m eans to this end. Twain in his last years had a clear view of the social m echanics of laughter. In \"The Mysterious Stranger,\" he has Little Satan describe laughter as a technology\u2014a powerful social weapon: 277 ...for your race in its poverty, has unque stion ably one really effectiv e weapon\u2014laughter. Power, m persuasion, supplication, persecution\u2014these can lift at a co lossal hum bug\u2014push it a little\u2014weaken it a little, century by century; but only laughter can blow it to rags and atom s at a blast. Against the assa ult of laughter nothing can stand. You are always fussing and f ighting with your other weapons. Do you ever use that one? No; you leave it lying rust ing. As a race, do you ever use it at all? No, you lack sense and the courage (88). Twain m ay truly have wished for his readers to use this weapon to blast away the hoaxes being foisted on them by the Am erican technological and imperial ind ustries and \"see them selves true,\" reasse rt con trol ove r their own lives. Or, he m ay have wished to use th is laughter to break down his readers' value system s and replace them with his own\u2014with the value of self- determ ination param ount over all. By tim es, m aybe he used laughter tow ard both of those ends. But what is clear is that the social m echanics of the rh etoric he chose when he faced his readers in \"The Petrified Man\" were m ore than powerful enough to hit both of those targets. 278 Chapter Four: The Hoaxes of Dan De Quille\u2014Building and Defending the West Dan De Quille 's scientif ic media hoaxing was ultim ately a dif ferent project f rom theirs. Poe did not have W estern pioneer readers\u2014fi ercely independent m en and wom en who prided themselves on m aking up their ow n minds (som etimes independently of the facts), who were suspicious of outsider comm ercial interests, and who were in general igno rant of scien ce but intimately familiar with m ining technolog ies. And even though Twain and De Quille s hared th ese readers, Twain cou ld not relate to them at the level tha t De Quille did. De Quille adm ired his \"stub born old comstockers\" (\"Quille Drops\"). After all, he had been a m iner him self for several years before turning to journalism , and he stayed in Nevada for alm ost 30 years after Twain went back East. His empathy with h is reade rs permitted De Quille to simultaneously gull the m and immorta lize them as Am erica's n ew folk hero es through his hoaxes. His pride in the character of the Am erican prospector coupled with his love of science and technology m ade De Quille's hoaxing historically unique. E namored by th e trem endous potential of the hoax to construc t realities, Dan De Quille used the f our m ajor and severa l minor scientif ic 279 media hoaxes he wrote from 1865 to 1880 to create and defend his ideal West and Westerners from Eastern commercial appropriation. 1. R HETOR ICAL EDUCATIO N Dan De Quille is som ewhat of a myst erious character, only a fraction having been written about his life com pared with the volum es penned on his famous colleague on the Territo rial Enterp rise, Mark Twain . Richard Dwyer and Richard Lin genfelter have produced the most recent and extensive biog raphy of De Quille (1990), am plifying Lawrence Berko ve's excellent biograph y in his 1988 edition of De Quille's novella Dives and Lazarus . In both of these portraits, De Quille appears as a cluster of co ntradictions: a devoted and supportive father and husband, who nonetheless left his fam ily for nearly forty years to prospect and write in the W est; a reputedly geni al and non-confrontational friend, who wa s also known to pick fights in bars for practically no reas on; a dedicate d journalist, by all contemporary reports the workhor se of the Territorial Enterprise , who was fired at least twice from that paper fo r being too drunk to work for weeks at a stretch; and , a toleran t and nti-Ch inese statem ents in his la ter lif e. Dan De Quille was born William Wright on May 19, 1829, to a far ming family in Knox County, Ohio. When he was 18, the fa mily relocated to W est Liberty, Io wa, and shortly the reafter, W illiam 's father die d and lef t him largely responsible for his m other and eight younger siblings. A t the age of 24, he married Carolyn Coleman and had five children with her in four years, two of whom did not m ake it past infancy. 280 Little is known about Wr ight's early education other than evidence from his early letters that he was well-lette red. He supposedly subm itted stories to Eastern m agazines, though there is no evidence that these were published (Wright The Big Bonanz a viii). Fro m his letters we know that he read widely in world literature; som e of hi s favorites included Don Quixote , many of Dickens's novels, the Arabian Nights , Ben Jonson, Jonathan Swift, James Fenim ore Cooper, and Thom as Carlyle. He quoted freque ntly from Shakespeare and the Bible (Wright Dives and Lazarus 30). In 1857 W right left his fa mily for th e California/Nevada territories and gradually migrated to Virginia City in 1860, following rum ors of new gold and silver claim s. He would not return to Iowa, except for a few brief visits, for 36 years. He wrote his sister Lou reli giously; if he wrote his wife and young children, those letters are no longer extant. Finally, his health broken, he returned to Iowa to live with his daught er in West Liberty for the la st few years of his life. De Quille never m anaged to str ike it r ich as a p lacer miner and supplem ented his inco me writing for several territo rial newspapers of the \"Sagebrush School,\" including the G olden Era in San Francisco, the Engineering and Mining Journal , and, starting full-tim e in 1861, the Territorial Enterprise . It was about this tim e that he began to si gn his articles \"Dan De Quille.\" Unlike Twain he used his nom de plume (pun intended by De Quille ) exclus ively until h is death; m ost of his friends in the W est knew him only by this nam e. His colleague C. C. Goodwin punned on De Quille's ps eudonym in a sketch called \"Dan and 281 His Quills\" that also provides us with a sam pling of De Quille's journalistic repertoire: Across the table f rom us Dan De Quille is writing som e of his abom inable locals, and we have been studying his face. Of late he h as thrown away his pencils and proc ured old-fashioned quill pens....He writes o rdinary lo tu rkey quill; f or im portant af fairs, lik e runaways and dog fights, he takes a goose quill; for obituary notices he keeps the p lume of a raven; f or mining r eviews nothing will do but a swan's quill; his s cientific articles are f ashione d by the qu ill of an ow l; while for the dreadful legends which he strings together for Sunday's Enterprise nothing will a nswer but a f eather f rom the pinion o f an eagle or an albatross (2). The Com stock, the region around Virgin ia City com prising the Com stock Lode and the towns that sprang up on it, provided a wealth of rhetorical opportunities for Dan De Quille. Contrary to m any assumptions , Virginia City was not just a shantyto wn. Thanks to the large sse of citize ns who had \"struck it rich,\" the boom town of n early 30,000 citizens possessed a full-fledged theater that put on Shakespeare plays, several musical venues, a newspaper vaunted as the best in the territory, a h otel th at boa sted the first elevato r in the W est, and social societies who put on lectures and balls. Culturally and religiously, the Com stock was extrem ely diverse w ith Morm on, Catho lic, and protes tant Chris tian p ractices mixing and m atching with the traditions of Jews, the W ashoe and Piute Indians, 282 and the large Chinese population who im migrated to the area to work on the railroads an d in the m ines (W right Dives and Lazarus 31). Newspaper clipp ings pr eserved in the Dan De Quille a t the Bancroft Library [BANC P-G 246], reveal that De Quille was curious about all of these d ifferent rhet orics and histories.21 cultu re, tucking into his scrapbooks a few postcards with pictures from Indonesia; he also collected articles on m ythologies of severa l cultures, esp ecially Native Am erican cultures, and various religious and s upernatu ral item s. He also saved clippings on famous American authors, their pers onality traits, handwriting, and personal histor ies. A particu larly te lling clippi ng for our purposes is a m emoir of Poe clipped from the New York Tim es with m ention of both \"Hans Phaal\" and the \"Balloon-H oax\" (fldr. 42). These influences show up in both the topic and style of pieces De Quille wrote for the Enterpris e and the Golden Era . In his regular \"Quille Drops\" colum n he offered snapshots of the lif estyles of the m any cultures living on the Com stock; occasion ally, he ev en attem pted to portray the dialects of the local prospectors, both W hite and Black, and t hose of the W ashoe Indians and Chinese immigrants. Since these dialect experi ments were conducted both before and after his working acquaintance w ith Twain, it is hard to argu e a cause-an d-effect relationship between his dialect practic es and Twain's in Huckleberry Finn , etc. 21 All ref erences to th e De Quille pap ers in the bod y of the text are giv en parenthetically with the appropriate cont ainer numbers. The full citation of the papers is found in the Bibliography. 283 Certainly, Twain's transcrip tions are m ore regular a nd phonetically realistic. Working with Twain, however, affected De Quille's rhetoric in other ways. Twain and De Quille s hared a roo m and a desk while working on the Enterprise , and they often helped each other out with stories\u2014not just w ith topics, but also with argum ent structure and la nguage. In general the object w as hum or and sensation, as the local co lumns were either filled with gunfights or the detailed history of a passing haywagon, and either extrem e of interest had to be accomm odated by an attention -arresting sty le in order to keep the subs cription of the paper u p. De Quille rem inisced about trying to get Twain to m ultiply h is textua l hints for readers that the \"Empir e City Massacre\" was a sham , and Twain waving him off with an, \"It is all plain enough\" (W right Reporting 171). It seem s significant that De Quille, while he wrot e many hum orous articles, did not attem pt a hoax until after Twain wrote the \"Petri fied Man\" in 1862. And when he did, with the \"Silver Man\" f or the Golden Era in 1865, it was on a very sim ilar topic\u2014 a man found turned entire ly to silver in stead of stone. But where Twain left off scien tific ho axing after his one experim ent, De Quille went on to produce four major hoaxes and at least 12 other short, hum orous squibs, all concerned completely with science and technology. Th is predilection was in part due to De Quille 's well-dese rved r eputation as a seriou s, m writer. 2. S CIENTIFIC EDUCATION De Quille c laimed that Twain would have noth ing to do w ith reportin g science or geology at the Enterprise because he \"hated to have to do with figures, measurem ents, and so lid facts, such as were ca lled f or in m atters per taining to 284 mines and m achinery\" (W right Reporting 171). De Quille, on the other hand, could not get enough of the m. Hi s papers are interspersed with back-of-the- envelope calculations of shaft depths and m ine production rates, and with sketched m aps of the shafts of the Savage Mine and other big m ines in the area. Twain and De Quille did a bout equal tim e as placer miners. De Quille had no further form al scientific or technical education than did Twain. However, the difference between th e writers that Judith Yaross Lee notes in her article \"(Pseudo-) Scientific Hum or\"\u2014nam ely that Twain m akes fun of science like an amateur and De Quille, like an exper t\u2014may have com e down sim ply to a m atter of interest. De Quille was fascinated by all thin gs scientific, and esp ecially by mining. Most of his clippings are on geologic, m etallurgic, and m ining m atters. He als o kept up with news about clim ate and w eather, chem istry, physics, astronomy, and \"pseudoscientific\" news about ESP and ot her psychic phenom ena. His papers contain a bu lletin from the Society for Ps ychical Research calling for news about hallucinatio ns, thought-transference, crystal visio n, and auto matic writin g (ctn. 2). In add ition to keep ing up with g eneral sc ientif ic news, D e Quille als o wrote extensively and seriously on mining. Lawrence Berkove assesses De Quille's career as a techni cal writer as follows: \"His reputation und oubtedly played an important pa rt in e stablishing and m aintaining the Ente rprise as the dominant newspaper in m ining circles. Even much later in his li fe, his articles on mining were solicited and published by a variety of periodicals, including specialized m ining journals\" (16). These journals included the Mining Industry 285 and Trades man and the Engineering and Mining Journal , for whom De Quille wrote not only histories and reports of th e mines in the Com stock Lode, but also mining culture articles about \"dowsing,\" or mineral-divining, the \"Tricks of Miners\" (\"Divining\" 171; 618) . He was taken seriously by m ining engineers at all levels. His clippings contain several favo rable rev iews of a proposal he apparently drafted for an improved m ethod of constructing canals. His magnum opus , The Big Bona nza: An Authentic Account of the Discovery, History, and W orking of the W orld-Renowned Com stock Lode of Nevada , was published in 1876 to universal accolades not only in the territories but also on the East Coast, and it is still considered th e \"bible\" of Comstock m ining history. De Quille 's friend and co lleagu e, editor W ells Drury, attes ted to De Quille 's preoccupation with m ining journalism : ...his conscience never swerved from the firm conviction that the true calling of a first-class newspaper is to publish item s concerning prospects, locations, m ines and m ills, shafts, tunnels, drifts, ore developm ents, stopes, assays and bullion outputs. All other m atters to him appeared inconsequential and of no m aterial interes t. If there was a m urder, a sensational society episode or a polit ical contest, any of them were welcom e to space after h is mining notes were p rovided for. (211) Aside from his techn ical m ining re ports, De Quille also wrote popu lar scienc e new s in a t leas t thre e distin ct registers: a \"h igh s tyle\" form al technical manner, a \"wonders of the world\" style, an d a hum orous style. His high register 286 can be typ ified by th e following ex cerpt on assaying procedur es from The Big Bonanza : In tes ting ores f or silver, th e miners in the early days used acids....The heavy residuum was then washed from the horn into a matrass (a flask of annealed g lass, with a n arrow neck and a bro ad bottom ). Ni tric acid was then poured into the matrass until the m atter to be tes ted was covered, when the flas k was suspended over the flam e of the candle or la mp and boiled until the f umes escaping (which are f or a tim e red) cam e off white. (71) While the language is as sim ple as possible aside from the m ining jargon, and the argum entation is line ar an d logical, th e lack of clever comm entary o r word play is notable. It is this au thoritative s tyle that c emented De Quille 's reputation as a trustworthy scien ce writer, a rep utation that becam e crucial to th e recep tion of his hoaxes. De Quille's middle reg ister a \"m ystery\" o r \"wonders of the world\" rhetoric, as in this clipping from an ar ticle written for the San Francisco Chronicle on anim al magnetis m: Some rem arkable d iscoveries have been recently m ade by French physicians in regard to what they call the action of medicines at a distance.... How were all th ese mysterious effects produced, often without even external contact? How could mercury blister the flesh through its tubes of glass and cloth envelopes? How could a m edicine, placed unknown under a pers on's pillow, cause saliv ation, with the accom pany 287 symptoms? The substances were usually inclosed in paper, or in bottles, and m any of them are odorless and cold send forth no effluvium to affec t the patient' s nerves. The whole m atter is profoundly m ysterious. (ctn. 1, fldr. 50) De Quille 's hum orous regis ter was eas ily id entifiable, as in this jo b description f or the state m ineralogist of Nevada, published in the Enterprise : \"He is to discover earthquakes a nd provide suitable m eans fo r the exterm ination of the same; also, for book agents, ery sipelas, co rn doctors, al meningitis, and the Grecian bend\" (ctn. 1, fldr. 8). The im pact of De Quille 's many-layere d scientif ic writing on his hoaxin g is com plex. Clearly, if he often wrote humorous pieces, his readers knew him to be just as capable of spinning a yarn as giving them a \"true\" report of what was going on in the m ines or what new natura l marvel had been discovered in the Nevada territory. To make m atters wors e, it ap pears De Quille regularly m ixed modes in th e sam e artic le. C. Grant Loom is writes in h is extensiv e surv ey of De Quille journalism , \"With no distin ction be tween a true story or a fanciful one, he inserted th e real and the f alse item into his d aily pub lic offering\" (30). Twain and De Quille both practiced this \"p adding\" in their f rantic attem pts to fill their local columns by press tim e. However, ac cording to con temporary reports, this interm ittent reinf orcement served to cem reputa tion as a scientific \"savan t\" with reader Attes ted De Quille's riend C.C. Goodwin, \"...what he wrote, ever ybody believ ed im plicitly. This or that expert m ight m ake a report, and m en woul d say, 'He m ay have been m istaken.' 288 This or that owner of he avy shares m ight express his opinion, and m en would say: 'Maybe his interests prejudice him .' But everyone believed Dan\" (214). In addition to his techn ical repu tation, of course, De Quille's extens ive experience reading and writing technical rhetoric stood him in good stead when he began his hoaxing with \"The Silv er Man\" in 1865. Judith of rhetorical knowledg e: \"Dan De Quille knew enough scienc e to f ill his ta les with inc redible f acts as well as con vincing fantasies. In consequence, the stories conveyed an auth entic respect for scie ntific know ledge in general and a persuasive pride in his own explanation of the ' truth'\" (144). As we will see, De Quille's ho axes deliver a level of scientif ic \"ve risimilitude\" both in terms of language and knowledge that rivals or perhaps even surpasses Poe's. De Quille stuc k to what he knew f rom experien ce with his hoaxes\u2014m ines, chem icals, and m inerals. The p revalence of these top ics in the everyday lives of his readers, coupled with his stand-up re putation as a scien ce writer, m ade De Quille a f ormidable hoaxer. 3. D E QUILLE'S HO AXES \"A Silver Man\" was De Quille's first \"de liberate ta ll-tale cr eation \" (Loom is 29). G. Grant Loom is ref ers to these c reations as \"scien tific tall ta les\" rather than hoaxes, an important differen ce in term inology that we will return to in the Discu ssion sec tion of this chapter. However, Loom is has m ade a careful assay of De Quille 's scientific \"sells\" or \"quaints,\" as the au thor ref erred to them . He found, in addition to the four m ajor hoaxe s considered in this chapter, 12 other minor squibs having to do with fantas tic discoveries in geology, biology, or 289 paleontology, all com pletely m ade up, m ost appearing in the Territorial Enterprise between 1867 and 1878. A com plete list of these can be found in Loom is's article \"The Tall T ales of Dan De Quille.\" In addition to Loom is's 12, I have found a copy of one other hoax and m ention of th ree m ore\u2014the \"Highland Alliga tor\" hoax, which from f amous f ossil collecto r Edward Drinker Cope; a hoax rem embered by C. C. Goodwin having to do with the \"excess ive\" water in the Com stock m ines being an offshoot aquifer of Lake Tahoe; a hoax ells Drury a perpetual-m windm ill; and, a hoax about a scientist hatching a live bird from a genetically engineered egg. In this chap ter we will focus on De Qui lle's four most notoriou s hoaxes, along with Cope's letter the \"Mountain A lligator.\" 3.1 \"A Silver Man\" (1865) As I have d one in pa st chapte rs, I will us e De Quille 's first hoax to se t up the m ajor topics and issues concerned w ith his reading of reader exp ectations about science news. Then, we will consider his othe r major hoaxes and reader reactions to them before adjusting the f ilter of science reading expectations to reflect the m ilieu of De Quille's hoaxing. In som e ways \"Silver Man \" is no t the ideal ho ax to begin with because, as C. Grant Loom is attests in h is search for reprin ts in o ther pape rs after the pub lication date, \"the story seem s to ha ve passed without any particular notice\" (37), which is not the cas e with De Quille's later hoaxes. H owever, in this f irst h oax De Quille in trodu ces a ll the rhetor ical strategies he will con tinue to deve lop in his later hoaxes : ent for plausibility via analogy; and, skillful exploitation of the codependence of doubt and belief. He also uses a unique for m of refutatio in which he m onitors his readers' interpretive p rocess on-lin e, so to speak, and adjusts his argum ents to cater to what he believes to be their highest-ranked expectations. \"The W onder of the Age: A Silver Man\" appeared in two long colum ns on pages th ree and four of the 5 February 1865 edition of th e Golden Era , the San Francisco paper that f irst employed De Quille after his ar rival in th e territor ies. Two advertisem ents for the piece ap peared on page one: \"The Marvelous 'Silver Man' is described by D an De Quille in a nother colum n\"; and, \"Dan De Quille, the Sage Brush Hum orist of Silver Land, di scourses on a scien tific sub ject with the spirit of a true savan.\" While these announcements have a coy tone, they m ay, first of all, have gone unno ticed by readers, sa ndwiched as they were down in the lowest columns of the firs t page; secondly, they m ay not have prejudiced readers agains t the truth of De Quille 's arg ument, sinc e as a rgued earlier, he h ad been a contributor of m ining news to the Golden Era for five years at this point, and his readers knew that he wrote both serious a nd humorous scientific news. Therefore, reade rs wer e likely comm itted to ju dge f or them selves at this stag e, as De Quille himself expected them to (Lee 142). The entire story is too long to quot e here, but it conc erns a m an found turned entir ely to silve r\u2014all the wa y down to silver pyrite c rystals encr usting the cavities in his bones and between his ga rments\u2014down in the \"H ot Springs Lead\" deposit in a local m ine. De Quille begins with a n argum ent for the credibility of the finding in spite of its incred ible a ppear ance. He goes on to cite the in dividua ls 291 involved in the discovery, to give the history of the lead deposit and the m ine in which it was found, and to relate the detail s of the discovery itself. The article finishes firs t with a s tatem ent that m any witnesses have seen the \"S ilver Man\" (which, unfortunately, was de teriorating so rapidly from oxidation that it would not be viewable m uch longer), and with a lengthy analogy to two sim ilar findings, one in a Swedish m ine, and one by a French chem ist. Imm ediately, we recognize m any fa miliar features of the hoax: the \"hot topic\" of a m ineralized hum an being in the midst of daily fi nds of fossils and petrifactions; the plausib ility of the Lead\" depos it; the ethos leant by the witnesses and th e foreign scientists; and, the minute details of the minera lization process. However, De Quille us es some rhetor ical strateg ies we have not analyzed in pr evious hoax es. W e will consider each in rou ghly the order they are employed in the hoax. For each, we will answer the question of how th e cho ice of this strategy reflects De Quille 's mental model of his readers' expectations. 3.11 The \"Emperor's New Clothes\" ploy De Quille o pens the ho ax with a presupposition that th e silv er man exists and his read ers are already fa miliar w ith it: \"\"Dear Era:--Everybody, no doubt, has heard of the discovery of the wonderful \"Silver Man,\" found in a m ine between Es meralda and Owen' s River\" (3). The use of the definite article to introduce \"the discovery\" and \"the silver m an\" here, in contrast to the indefinite \"A Silver M an\" of the title, adds lin guist ic force to a presupposition of existence and publicity for the discovery. Later in the story, De Quille em ploys a similar 292 strategy of presupposition. \"All w ho have the least knowledge of palaeontology know that all those wonderful rem ains of fishes, anim als, etc., found in lim estone and other rocks, and about which so m uch is said and written, are not the creatures th emselves, but m erely th eir sh apes replaced by m ineral subs tances\"(4 ). De Quille, here, is cons tructing an audience of savants by using a \"anyone who disagrees with thes e facts is necessa rily ignorant\" line of argum ent. The pressu re on De Quille's readers of this str ategy is not imm ediately apparen t unless we re turn to th e self-sufficient J acksonian pioneer that p layed the foil to the d upe of many a ta ll tale in Twai n's an d De Quille 's era. Just as the tall tale depend ed for its s uccess on h apless outsiders try ing to m ake a show of familiarity with th eir bizarr e new e nvironm ent in th e West, De Quille is try ing to force his pioneer readers to acqu iesce to his argum ent by m aking the alternative to belief unpleasant\u2014looking to everyone else like an un-savvy outsi der. It is the \"Emperor's New Clothes\" strategy, where even though the emperor's senses tell him he is naked, he would rather risk nakedness then a public show of his stupidity. Sim ilarly, De Quille 's pioneers would rather risk jumping to the wrong conclusion than being labeled an outsider. Support for De Quille's attraction to th is strategy com es from Neil Harris's analysis of contem porary respons es hoaxes. Harris explain s, \"Men pridin g them selves on their r ationa list, scientif ic be nt, familiar with the operation of novel m achines, aware of the variety of nature, tended to accept as true anyth ing which s eemed to work--or seem ed lik ely to work\" (72 ). De Quille 's pioneers grew up in the sam e exciting era of industrial g enesis an d 293 possibility as Barnum 's viewers; m ost of them had lived in that technologically- charged E astern environ ment just a f ew year s prior to read ing De Quille's artic les. Accordingly, they m ay have felt the enorm ous social pres sure tha t came with the Jacksonian territo ry, th e pressu re to a ppear self-sufficient or risk seem ing un- American. Therefore, in situations where they knew themselves to be under- educated, D e Quille 's readers m ay have thou ght it b est to m ake a show of competency. De Quille seem ed to be c ounting on his readers' need to appear knowledgeable when he em ployed the \"Em peror's New Clothes\" rhetoric to coerce belief his hoax. 3.12 Refutatio With the pr esupposito ry strategy, De Quille sh ows hi mself sensitive to what he b elieves is h is readers ' desire to appear on top of the latest developm ents in sc ience (related to their Nove lty expectatio ns). With his unique refuta tio strategy, he m akes an argum ent that Plausi bility is even more im portant to his readers. Almost imm ediately in \"S uttal argum ent: Everybody, however, has not heard the full particulars of the discovery, and m any will hoot th e idea of any such discovery ever hav ing been m ade. They will at once say th at it is impossible for a hum an body to be changed to silver ore--Let them have their say! Although the story is almost too much for belief, yet I hope to be able to show, before fi nishing this account, that, startling as the assertion may appear, such a change in the substance of the hum an body is not only 294 possible, but that there is on record one well authenticated instance of a similar changing of a hum an body into a m ass of ore. (3) Here, De Quille constru cts readers w ho are not im pressed by the sensation and novelty of the silv er man but instead \"hoot\" at its \"impossibility.\" He models for him self a \"false\" in terpretive ju dgment they might have m ade in the face of the conflicting expectations of Novelty/S ensation and Plausibility. To try to correct this \"false\" im pression, De Quille reass ures h is readers he will indeed offer arguments through logic and real-wor ld analogy that w ill satisfy their high- ranked expectation of Plausibility. Thus, his refutatio is a m eta-rhe torical strategy, an attem pt to persuade by interven ing in the interpretive process\u2014just as his hoax is an attem pt to persuade thr ough intervention in the process of science popularziation. De Quille imm ediately proc eeds to m ake an interesting variation of the \"m ystery\" m ove fr om our antebellum hoaxes: We have had all kinds of astoni shing discoveries. Many things formerly cla ssed am ong the im possibilities a re now f amiliar, every -day possibilities. W e are now to acknowledge that it is not impossible for a human body to be changed\u2014through c ontact in a m ineral vein with solutions of certain salts, carbonic and hydrosulphuric gases, and the electrical cu rrents induced by the reaction of s aid solution s upon each other\u2014into a m ass of sulphuret of silver. (3) Instead of the traditional \"m ystery\" opening, this is an \"anti-m ystery\" argum ent about the pow er of science to demystify what has previously seem ed awesom e and supernatural. This rhetorical strategy is a m arked change from the 295 rhetoric of the 1830s w here science and m ystery cooperated. De Quille's appeal to scientific fact and ja rgon (P lausibility, Popsci., and Detail) are tim e-honored strategies. However, this tim e they are m eant to reassur e, not to over whelm , his readers as m iners were fa miliar with these compounds fr om the reactivity tests they routinely perform ed on ore to determ ine if it contained silver. It appea rs from this refutatio strategy that De Quille believe d himself to be dealing with a readersh ip that was less swayed by Novelty than by Plausibility. This conclusion is borne out by his next strategy, which is the estab lishment of multiple witnesses to the discovery. 3.13 Witness De Quille p rovides cop ious witness es to the silver m an, but these do n ot provide the sam e sort of ethos prov ided by De Quille 's atte ntion to h is reade rs' Foreign expectations in the article, i.e., the nam e-droppi ng of the foreign Swedish mine where a m an was found turned to c opper and the F rench geochem ist de Senarm ont. Instead, Kuhlm an and the m iners who discover the silver man in De Quille's sto ry, along w ith the \"scientific frien d\" of Kuhlm an's in Aurora, th e viewers of the silve r man, and De Quille h imself, who saw a button of silver produced from the silver m an\u2014these loca ls provide a vicarious experience of witness for the hoax's readers. Newsreaders counted on journalists to bear witness to things the readers them selves did not hav e access to, and thus to construct for them much of the world that spread beyond the realm of th eir senses. This was doubly true in De Quille 's m ilieu, whe re pionee rs did not have read ily available to them 296 independent sources for confirm ing or de nying the truth of what was printed in the newspapers. This coerced trust betw een reader and journalist helps explain some of the personal an imosity that is still dir ected toward hoaxers tod ay when their hoaxes are exposed. W hat is at stak e is not just the j ournalist lying; the world the reader has been livi ng in suddenly does not hold true. De Quille se emed to sense the importance of vicarious witne ss becaus e he anchored the truth of th e \"silver m an\" to the ex perien ces of character types his readers would trust\u2014local m iners, journalists, and scient ists. As in birdw atching, De Quille knew it took more that ju st his w itnes s of the silver m an to m ake it exis t for his read ers. 3.14 Analogy Throughout the \"Silver Man,\" but especi ally in the later sections, De Quille m akes argum ents for the p lausibility of the s ilver man by analo gy. He harps at som e length upon th e analogy of several Swedish m iners found turned to copper. (Odds are good he fabricated this analog, making th e \"Silver Man\" in actuality a sort of Russian nesting-d oll of hoax es.) He also mentions, as quoted above, the fossilization of fishes and ot her an imals, a process sim ilar to the mineralization of the silver m an whic h De Quille knew his readers w ould find familiar. He f inishes with an analogy to c rystallization pro cesses stud ied by M. de Senarm ont, an actual French chem ist. Argum ent by analogy was one of the original com ponents of Popsci. However, Analogy takes on addition al sign ifican ce given a n ew reading context: the conditions of lif e on the frontier. Anyone w ho ha s spent any tim e in the W est 297 knows (!) th at the m ajority of place nam es are analogies to f orms or places in th e homelands of the pioneers; thus, you have New Engl and, and Glasgow, Montana, and Paris, Texas. Geologic forms ar e also usually nam ed for what they resem ble\u2014cam els or wa gons or breasts.22 Naming by analogy is a way to reduce the com plexity and threat of a foreign e nvironm ent. By r elying on analogs as a central proo f in the \"Silver Man,\" De Quille counted on his read ers to use the same epistemological strategy when cons idering his hoax as they did in their everyday lives on the frontier\u2014and to use it to his advantage. 3.15 Codependence of Belief and Doubt De Quille m akes a m ove in \"Silv er Man\" th at seem s odd at f irst if we assum e that his first prior ity is to present a seam less hoax. H e acknowledges his readers' doubt by adm itting his own, albe it on minor points of the narrative. In describ ing the silver m an, De Quille writes, \"The body is supposed to be, and doubtless is, that of an Indian; but in its present changed state it is im possible to be cer tain o n that point\" (3). He r eintroduces the im possibility of proving the \"Silver Man\" a bonafide artifact at the end of the story: I might say much m ore in proof not only of the fact of a hum an body so changed having been found, but of the sim ple and natural causes which have operated to produce a change which at th e firs t glance appears so wonderful; however, as m any would not believe, even though I should 22 The obvious shortage of landform s named for m ale sex organs, in spite of the abundance of glaringly suggestive oppor tunities in the We st, raises a na\u00efve but still interesting connec tion between strange lands capes and gendered Others who m ust be feared and dom inated. 298 produce the body and m elt it up into but tons before their very eyes, I refrain. (4) De Quille's rheto ric of doubt and b elief here conflates th e two at every turn. First, he uses the word \"doub tless,\" which introduces his readers' \"doubt\" even as it implies they should be sure of what D e Quille reports. He argues twice for the im possibility of proving the silver m an ge nuine, but the som ewhat sarcastic reason he provides is that so me of his readers would doubt no m atter what ironclad proof he offered them . In this way , De Quille cleve rly con structs a believ ing readership on the \"Em peror's Ne w Clothes\" paradigm again, this tim e by providing a negative m odel for their in terpretive behavior : in paraphrase, \"Only ignorant readers m asquerading as sk eptics could still doubt this story.\" And no one wants to be in that crow d. B ecause there is no extant reader reaction to the \"Silver Man\" hoax, we cannot gauge the extent to which readers responded to De Quille's m anipulations of belief and dou bt in this h oax, but De Quille 's focus on these techniques testifies to his belief, as a m ember of his own readership, in their effectiveness. In addition to the \"Em peror's New Clothes\" gam e with belief and doubt, De Quille is making an argum ent about the fund amental codependence o f these interpretive modes, one which f inds re sonance across m id-nineteenth -centu ry argu es that P.T. Barnum 's hoaxes succeeded because Am ericans knew just enough science to m ake them insecure about how m uch they really knew: 299 American experience w ith scien ce and technology was crucial to the hoaxing attem pts, but this experien ce led not to less credulity but to more. A vital factor in the success of the hoaxes was national skepticism itself. Men accustom ed to exam ining th e truth o r validity of every perso n, idea, ob ject or ac t presented to th em\u2014as Am ericans prov erbially we re\u2014 ets or pseudoscientific ex planations, for detailed descriptions of fictiona l machinery, for any fant asy that was couched in the bland n eutrality of a technolog ical vocabulary . (72) In other words, doubt actually fostered belie f in the presence of sufficient social pressure to appear a m an or wom an of independent judgm ent. Harris argues this constant tension between doubt and belief , i.e. skepticism , provided an alm ost erotic th rill to the viewe rs of Barnu m's hoaxes\u2014an illic it dete rmination of one's own reality without the sanction of authorities or institutions. Harris points out, as we discussed in Chapter T wo with res pect to Poe' s and Locke's hoaxing, that \"the exposure of sham was the negative im age of the practical jok e, and both appealed to the same sensibility. Many deceivers were also exposers, since the two processes fe d public fascination for infor mation and detail\" (82). Edgar Allan Poe revealed Maelzel's Chess Autom aton to b e a fake but went on to write his own hoax (\"V on Ke mpelen and His Discovery\") about the f amily who had built the autom aton in Europe. Richard Ada ms Locke publicly exposed one of Barnum 's hoaxes in the Sun not long after concocting his own \"Moon Hoax.\" 300 The m otions of concealm ent and expos ure, and the m otions of belief and doubt, share the sam e epistem ological arc between the unknown and the judging mind, between the data of the senses and the evaluation of that data. On the receiving end, that arc could be desc ribed just as De Quille defined the responsibility of his r eaders, \"deciding for them selves.\" On the auth orial end, that arc is the s heer p leasure of using words to construc t realities for a public kept constantly at a distance by those word s from firsthand experience of those realities. T his was De Quille 's ga me, and he ref ined it o ver the n ext 35 years through the publication of th ree m ore major hoaxes. 3.2 \"Solar Armor\" (1874) On 2 July 1874 a story appeared in the Enterprise abo ut the untim ely death of a Nevada inventor. En titled \"Sad Fate of An Inventor,\" it described an invention gone horribly awry: A gentlem an who has just arrived from the borax fields of the desert regions surrounding the town of Colum bus, in the eastern part of this State, gives us the f ollowing account of the sad fate of Mr. Jonathan Newhouse, a m an of considerable i nventive genius. Mr. Newhouse had constructed what he called a \"solar arm or,\" an appa ratus intended to protect th e wearer from the fierce h eat of th e sun in crossing deserts and burning alkali plains. The arm or consis ted of a long, close-fitting jacket made of common sponge and a cap or hood of the sam e material; both jacket and hood being about an inch in thickness. Before starting across a desert this a rmor was to be satur ated with water. Under the r ight arm was 301 suspended a n India rubb er sack f illed with water and having a sm all gutta percha tube leading to the top of the hood. In order to keep the arm or moist, all that was necessary to be done by the traveler, as he progressed over the burning sands, was to press th e sack occasionally, when a sm all quantity of water would be forced up and thoroughly saturate the hood and the jacket below it. Thus, by the evapor ation of the m oisture in the armor, it was calculated m ight be produced almost any degree of cold. Mr. Newhouse went down to Death Valley, determined to try the experim ent of crossing that terrible place in his arm or. He started out in to the va lley one m orning from the cam p nearest its borders, telling the m en at the camp, as they laced his arm or on his b ack, that he would return in two days. The next day an Indian who could speak but a few wor ds of English came to the cam p in a great state of excitement. He made the m en understand that he warned them to follow him . At the distance of about twenty m iles out into the dese rt the Indian pointed to a hum an figure seated against a rock. Approaching they found it to be N ewhouse still in his arm or. He was dead and frozen s tiff. His beard was covered with frost and\u2014though the noonday sun poured dow n its fiercest rays\u2014in icicle over a foot in length hung from his no se. There he had perished m iserably, because h is arm or had worked but t oo well, an d because it was laced up behind where he could not reach th e fastenings. (ctn. 1, fldr. 120) This hoax has the full-f ledged form of a news article. It s tarts with a summary of the \"sad fate\" of th e inventor and then m oves to the de tails of the 302 story\u2014the who, what, when, wher e, why and how. It finishes with an analysis of how the death m ust have transpired. Ters e and to the point, it avoids a great deal of the rheto rical flights of the \"myste ry\" openings and \"benefits ankind\" conclusions that the 1835 hoaxes and scien ce articles exhibited. As evidenced by De Quille's science writings about d owsing and other \"m ysterious\" phenom ena, science now provided natural explanations for m any things that had theretofore seem ed supernatural or m ysterious. Th is may account for the stripping of the grandiose language from hoaxes written af ter 1865. However, science and nature also presented pioneers with m any experi ences and objects that were beyond the pale of the ir expe riences back East. De Quille tific i nquiry when presen ting a m an freezing to death in a roasting desert. De Quille includes m any scien tific details ab out th e solar a rmor that would satisfy readers Detail expectations as well as the ir Plausibility expectations, like the careful description of the pump apparatus. As Poe did with his balloon, De Quille w alks readers through th e workings of the pum p rhetor ically to actually create a working pum p in their im agination. He adds to these appeals the appeal of local eye witnesses in the f orms of prosp ectors, again, and an Ind ian. Readers' Novelty and Sensation requirem ents are cert ainly satisfied in the irony of death by freezing in Death Valley. The m ost interesting asp ect of this h oax, however, is its reprinting history. The story w as copied w idely, and we have many of these reprin ts tha nks to De Quille scrap booking them and m entioning spec ific reprin ting papers an d dates. 303 He wrote to his sister Lou W right on 23 August 1874, \"My story of the m an who was frozen to death by a solar arm or of hi s own invention was il lustrated in one of the Eastern pictorials. It was not well done , however. The artist m ade a horrible looking beast of poor Woodhouse. The Scientific Americ an thought enough of that sell to copy it, it being som ewhat in their line\" (3). The Scientific Am erican reprint De Quille refers to here was on 25 July 1874. The editors' introduction to the story, titled \"Sad Fate of a Nevada Inventor\" was rather coy: \"The coolest and most refreshing item we have read since the co mmencem ent of the heated term lately appea red in th e Virginia City (Nevada) Enterprise \" (51). However, the edito rs went on to repr int the story alm ost verbatim , and it appeared not on the first page, where jokes and anecdotes us ually appeared, but on page 51 alongside engravings of a new \"Apparatus for Transp lanting Trees \" as well as a tion of \"A New Alkaloid from Morphine\" a nd an innovative air-conditioning system used in the House of Commons in London. We know the story was also reprin ted in several New York papers, including the Sun , for w hich De Quille was a regul ar W estern correspondent. De Quille 's co lleague at the Enterp rise, C.C. Goodwin, rep orted that De Quille received a copy of the London Ti mes in the m ail with a copy of the \"Solar Armor\" story in it, including recomm enda tions by the editor that the British Arm y consider the arm or for equipping its sold iers in India and other hot clim ates (Goodwin 216). Goodwin claim ed that De Quille bracketed th e story with an elaborate picture of a m an thum bing hi s nose (rem iniscent of the posture of Twain's \"P etrified Man\" !) and m ailed th e paper back to the English science 304 writer. Delancey Ferguson discredits G oodwin's report because, acco rding to his research, the hoax never m ade it to the Tim es (193). However, Ferguson checked the Tim es for 1862, the year of Twain's hoax, an d not 1874, the year of the \"Solar Armor\" hoax. The story does indeed appear in the London Ti mes on 27 July 1874 under the title \"To o Successful\" with no editorial criticism . However, th is article m akes no m ention of using the solar arm or for British troops. The London Daily Telegraph for 3 August 1874 reprinted the story, and it is worthwhile cons idering their ed itor's com ments because they b ecome the catalyst for De Quille 's next in stallment of the hoax. The Daily Teleg raph editor prefaces the story with a brie f descrip tion of Virg inia City and the s calding desert to the east of it, which m akes \" men\u2014and even wagons, with their teams of from eight to sixteen m ules or oxen\u2014to sink overw helm ed with heat and thirst when an effort is m ade to c ross this dese rt in summer.\" This desc ription se ems to valida te Newhouse's ultim ately tragic quest for a \"solar arm or\" to com bat the heat. However, the Daily Telegraph finishes with th is evaluation: The m arvelous stories which com e from 'the p lains' are ap t to b e received with incredulity by our transatlantic ki nsmen who dwell upon the Eastern seaboard of the United States . We confess that, although the fate of Mr. Newhouse is relate d by the Western journal au grand serieux , we should requ ire som e addition al confirm ation before we unhesitating ly accept it. B ut every one who has iced a bottle of wine by wrapping a wet cloth round it and putting it in a draught, m ust have noticed how great is the co ld that evapor ation of moisture produces. For thes e reasons we are 305 disposed to accept the tale from Virginia City in the sam e fram e of mind which Herodotus, the Father of Hi story, usually assum ed when he repeated so me marvel that had reached him\u2014that is to s ay, we are neith er prepared to disbelieve it wholly nor to credit it without question. (ctn. 1, fldr. 120) The editor f or the Daily Telegr aph lets us g limpse the com petition between his expectations that leads to a suspension of judgm ent. First, he cites the \"m arvelous\" quality of the story in a negative light. His comm ents m ay reference a shift in attit ude about the Sensation exp ectation since 1835: nam ely, as the English have gained far more control over their environm ent through science and technology than have Am erican pioneers, Sensation m ight actually acquire a negative valence for the Eng lish popular scientific press, since sensational events resis t the control a nd logical consistency of a s cientific epistem ology. It is of course im possible to know the connotations of the editor's use of \" marvelous,\" bu t the latter suggestion deserves further inquiry. In addition to th e neg ative light of \"marvelo us,\" the editor c ites the dubious authority of newspapers from 'the plains' as a weak point of the story (Medium ). However, he goes on to count erbalance these negative points with the confor mity of the story to Popsci. expectations, \" au grand serieux .\" He adds to the positive colum n a supporting analogy of cooling by evaporati on (Plausibility). \"For these reasons,\" th e write r concludes, th e Daily Tele graph suspends its judgm ent. The editor's interpretive activit y can be represented graphically as in Table 20: 306 Table 20: E ditor's suspended j udgment or\" hoax Sensation (-) Medium (-) Popsci. Plausibility True * * False * * If the editor had m ade a judgm ent, we would have an indication of which expectations m attered more to him ; a check m ark would appear by \"True\" or \"False\" to indicate his decision. As it is, the suspension of judgm ent tells us that sensationalism, the reputation of the m edium, the conform ation of the a rticle to Popsci. conventions, and the plausibility of the topic are all equally ran ked in h is view; this lack of ranking is indicated by dotted lines. Accordingly, the violations add up to a tie, at two for each can didate in terpretation (\"true\" or \"fals r comm itted to believ ing the story, he would have to viola te his usual assum ption that sensationalism is untru stworthy (here, I am testing out the negative-valence Sensation, or Sensation [- ]); he would also have to violate his usual a ssumption that th e Ente rprise lied. On th e othe r hand , if he comm itted to believing the story false, he would have to violate th e demonstrated scien tific plausibility of cooling by evaporation, a nd he would have to violate his usual assum ption that if an article sounde d like a genuine science article, \" au grand serieux, \" that it ind eed was. Faced with th is stalem ate, the writer indicates that h e is waiting for m ore infor mation, whi ch might add the crucial violation or two that would shift the balance in favor of eith er a true or false interpretation. He m ight have had stronger feelings that would have swayed the ranking of expectations if the decision m attered m ore to him , if he had been a m iner or inventor in Nevada rather than an ed itor in E ngland. As David Kaufer and 307 Kathleen Carley point out in their study of the social dynam ics of print, m ajor factors in th e acceptan ce of printed claims include a d esire to engage with th e author thro ugh the tex t, and a sense of cognitiv e sim ilarity with the text an d author (300). The editor lack ed both of these dynam ics, and so his interpretation of the story would have been very diffe rent than if he lived in Nevada, felt similarity with the cha racters in the \"S olar Armor\" sto ry and with Dan De Quille, and felt he owed it to him self or som eone else to m ake a decision about the truth value of the story. De Quille u sed this editor's doubts as a springb oard to laun ch hoax, \"A Mystery Explained.\u2014The Se quel to the Strange Death of Jonathan Newhouse, the Inventor of th e Solar Ar mor.\" The sequel, a strategy perhaps suggested by Mark Twain's sequel to \"Petrified Man,\" appeared in the Enterprise on 30 August 1874. In it De Quille presents th e Daily Telegraph editor as a doubter: ...as the truth of our narration appear s to be called in question, if not directly at least im pliedly, by a paper which enjoys the largest circulation of any daily newspaper in the world, we feel that it is but right that we should m ake public som e further part iculars in regard to the strange affair\u2014particulars which th row a flood of light upon what, w e must adm it, did appear alm ost incredible in our account of the sad occurrence as published. It seem ed st range that so great a de gree of cold could be produced simply by the evaporation of water, but it now appears that it 308 was not water\u2014at least not water alone \u2014that was used by the unfortunate gentlem an. (ctn. 1, fldr. 120) De Quille continue s to f ocus his appeal on scientif ic plausib ility and internal con sisten cy her e (Plausib ility and Internal Coherence). Sensation and Novelty wear off quickly; a m onth after th e first installm ent of \"Sola r Arm or,\" their effects m ust have been greatly di minished if not vanished altogether. (Eye)W itness and Plausibility are w hat count no w, and De Quille prov ides these in spades. He claim s that David Baxter , the Coroner at Salt W ells, perfor med an inquest on the body of Jonathan Newhouse and goes on to list all of Newhouse's statistics, including p lace of birth. The tex t of the inqu est, inferred rather th an quoted, is a metonym De Quille uses to argue for the reality of the \"Solar Arm or\"; i.e., the co roner's r eport exis ts and is true, so by extension the \"Solar Ar mor\" must exis t. De Quille gy of textua l witne ss ev en further in his last two hoaxes. Next in the sequel, De Q uille produces more witnesses\u2014prospectors at the camp from which Newhouse began his fatefu l walk. These m en apparently found a satchel of Newhouse's that contained ch emicals that intensified the evaporation within his s olar arm or, thus freezing hi m to death. Sev eral of the witnesse s reported frostbite on their hands fr om handling the body. The Coroner supposedly tells De Quille that he is sending the chem icals on to the Academ y of Sciences at San Francis co (a genuine organization) for analysis. De Quille wraps up, however, with his signature perform ance of doubt. \" Whether or not he has done so we cannot say. For several weeks we have closely watched the reports of 309 the proceed ings of the learned body nam ed, but as yet have seen no m ention m ade of either the chem icals or the arm or.\" This article spawned a new flurry of re printing on the East Coast as papers responded both to the Daily Telegraph criticism and to De Quille's new insta llment. The New York Sun defended itself for having publishing the first installm ent in good faith by now reprinting the \"additional proof\" of the coroner's report on 17 Septem ber 1874 (ctn. 1, fl dr. 120). The Ne w York World took a slightly cagier approach. It started off, \"About t wo months a go the Virginia City Enterprise , of Nevada, a journal that so ingeni ously m ingles fact with fiction that its readers are never weary of exclaim ing, 'Well, I wonder!' related the incidents connected with the dem ise of Mr. Jonathan Newhouse....\" The World next juxtapos ed the Teleg raph's com plaints with De Quille 's rebuttals, end ing with an tongue-twisting list of at las t concluded, \"Let the Telegraph now fold it hands, murm ur 'Si non e vero ,' &c., and (ctn. 1, fldr. 120). Si non e vero, e ben trovato translates roughly, \"If it's not true, it's well done/work ed\" and is rem iniscent of Poe's claims that if his inventions di d not actually exist and work, it was not because they could not. The World thus seems to take De Quille's sequel as demonstrating a level of authority beyond wh ich it is fruitless to argue, w hether or not you believed the story. Overall, the second wave of debate about the \"S olar Arm or\" hoax focused positiv ely o n the testimony of the coroner an d the further s cientific ju stification 310 De Quille provided. T his reac tion confir med the efficacy of the witness and was ref ining through this hoax. Also, the editors of the reprinting papers focused on the fact of De Quille's sequel itse lf as author itative pr oof of the ver ity of the \"Solar Arm or,\" providing powerful reinforcem ent for De Quille to produce sequels to his other hoaxes, m ost notably the \"T raveling Stones\" hoax, whic h boasted a public 3.3 \"Traveling Stones\" (1867, 1876, 1879, was De Quille' s most famous and the longest-running, its installm ents spanni ng 25 years. T he story was about magnetic stones that w ould m ove from wherever they we re placed and cluster togethe r. It first appe ared in the En terprise on 26 October 1867 and was reprinted in his history of Nevada m ining, the Big Bonanza , in 1876. Here is the version that o riginally appea red in the Enter prise: A gentlem an from the southern part of Pahranagat, who passed through this city a day or two since on his way to Sacram ento, Ca l., showed us a half a dozen or so of very curious pebbles\u2014not curious in appearance, but rather curious in action. They were almost perfectly round, the m ajority of them nearly as large as a black walnut, and appeared to be of an irony nature. About the only rem arkable thing about these pebb les\u2014and it struck u s as rath er rem arkable\u2014was that w hen distributed about upon a floor, tab le or other level su rface, within two or three feet of each oth er, they im mediately began traveling toward a 311 common centre and there huddled up in a bunch like a lot of eggs in a nest. A single stone, rem oved to the di stance of three and a half feet, upon being released at once started off with wonderful and som ewhat com ical celerity to r ejoin its fellows; taken away f our or f ive feet it remained motionless. Mr. Hart, the gentlem an in whose p ossession w e saw these rolling stones, says they are found in a region of country that, although comparatively level, is nothing but bare rock. S cattered over this barre n region are little basins, f rom a few feet to a rod or two in diam eter, and it is in the bottom of these that th e rolling stones are found. They are from the size of a pea to five and six in ches in diam eter. The cause of these stones rolling together is doubtless to be found in the m aterial of which they are co mposed, which appears to be loadstone or m agnetic iron ore (3). In spite of the wink-and-nudge use of the word \"irony\" in the second sentence, De Quille ex pends som e effo rt in making the stones sound genuine. The best lie, as they say, is one tha t has a lot of the truth m ixed in, and De Quille got his inspiration for this hoax from actual geologic discoveries. Among the newspaper clippings in his papers at the Bancroft are an article on the \"seven wonders of Corea including a floating st one...\" and a \"hot stone glowing on top of a high hill\" (ctn. 2, f ldr. 98 ). He also clipp ed an ar ticle entitled \"A re Ston es Alive ?\" (ctn. 2, f ldr. 3). The hoax also contains m any familiar f eatures including a trustworthy local \"gentlem an,\" the mystery language of \"very curious\" (although th e opening of the piece is st ill straightforward \"who, what, when, 312 where, why\" rhetoric), and a scientific e xplanation of the stones' behavior due to their com position of \"loadstone or m agnetic iron ore.\" This hoax apparently w spect acula rly we ll. C ontemporary W ells Drury describes De Quille getting an offer of $10,000 for a \"few bushels\" of the stones from P.T. Barnum, on the condition that they could be m ade to perform under th e big top. De Quille also supposed ly received a request from a Germ an physics society to exam ine the stones (Drury 212-213). T hese requests are not extant in De Quille' s papers, but ne ither allegation is unlik ely, as we k now that De Quille's previous s tories were re printed in European pap ers, and tha t Barnu m was always on the hunt f or new attr actions to add to his show s. The rheto ric of this initial phas e of the hoax is relatively pedestrian, but its rhetorical h istory is fascinating, for De Quille, encouraged by the succes s of his sequel to the \"Solar Armor\" hoax, added tw o more insta llments to the \"Travelin g Stones\" hoax over 25 years. The next inst allment appe ared in the Enterprise 1879 (quoted from Dwyer and Lingenfelter): ...the story of the little traveling st ones seem ed to supply a want that had long been felt\u2014to fit exactly and fill a certain vacant nook in the m inds of men\u2014and t hey traveled through all the newspapers of the world. This we did not so much m ind, nor were we m uch wor ried by letters of inquiry at first, but it has now been som e years since we ceased to enjoy them . Firs t and last, we m ust have had bushels of letters asking about these stones. Letter after letter have we opened from foreign parts in the expectation of hearing something to ou r advantage \u2014that half a m illion ha d been lef t us 313 somewhere or that som ebody was anxious to pay us four bits a colum n for sketches about the m ountains and the m ines\u2014and have only found some other m an wanting to know all a bout those traveling stones. So it has gone on all these fifteen years. Our last is from Tiffin, Ohio, dated Nov. 3, and received yesterday. His na me is Haines, and h e wants to know all abou t those stones, could he obtain several and how ? Not long since we had a letter from a man in one of the New England States who infor med us that there wa s big m oney in the traveling stones. We were to send him a carload, when he would exhibit and sell them, dividing the spoils with us. W e have stood this thing about fifteen years, and it is becom ing a little m onotonous. We are now growing old, and we want peace. We desire to throw up the sponge and acknowledge the corn; therefore w e solem nly affir m that we never saw or heard of any such diabolical cobbles as th e traveling s tones of Pahranagat\u2014 th ough we still think there ought to be som ething of the kind som ewhere in the world. If this cand id confession s hall carry a pa ng to the heart of any true believer we shall be glad of it, as the true believers have panged it to us, right and left, quite long enough. (22) De Quille se ems to deriv e no little p leasure f rom the \"pang \" his rev elation is causing the Eastern businessm en and other believers in his hoax, although no evidence of these letters exists other th an Drury's testim ony t o Barnum , the \"m an in one of the New England states,\" offering to pay $10,000 for the stones. Interestingly, however, De Quille back s away from disavowing the stones' 314 existence altogether, hinting that he m ight have been pr escie nt rather than a flat- out liar. This hin t will tu rn into a strategy of hoax perpet uation in the final installm ent of the \"Traveling Stones\" hoa x. Notice also another innovation De Quille is making with the W itness expect ation . Instead of merely mention ing eyewitness es, as he did in the \"Silve r Man,\" hoax, De Quille is now citing textua l evidence, \"letters\" from othe r believers. The m ere mention of these texts serves to reify the e xisten ce of the trav eling stones in rea ders' im aginations. On 6 March 1892, a story called \"The Traveling Stones of Pahranagat\" appeared in the Salt L ake Daily Trib une as part of an article entitled \"Un desirab le Thrif tines s.\" In it the s tory, De Quille exp lained that he ha d written h is origin al \"Traveling Stones\" hoax with another object, in addition to teasi ng his readers, in mind; he had put it out as a \"feeler. \" He claim ed, \"My object was to s et the many prospectors then ranging the country to l ooking for such things.\" He went on to state he had confessed the hoax only out of exa speration with all the requests he received for the ston es. From there, the ar ticle took an inte resting tu rn: Shortly af ter I denied the existen ce of the traveling stones, I began to receive assurances that such ston es had really been found in central Nevada. A mong others who had found a nd ow ned such stones was Joseph E. Eckley, present S tate Printer of Ne vada. Mr. Eckley has several tim es told m e of his having owned a lot of su ch stones which he was a citizen of Austin, Lander county. He obtained them in Nye county on a hill that was filled and c overed with geodes. Most of these geodes contain crys tals of various co lors. These are not the trave ling kind. Those that appear to be 315 endued with life are little nodules of iron. They are found on the hill among the geodes, and it was only b y acci dent that Mr. Eckley discov ered their traveling propensities. He had the stones he found for som e months, and frequently exhibited them . This fi nally led to their being stolen, some one breaking open his cabinet and carry ing them off. M r. Eckley is a truthful m an. He now resides in Ca rson City, and doubtless would be able to give further particulars in re gard to the stones he discovered. Not satisf ied with this single app eal to eyewitn ess, De Quille went on to reprint a \"letter\" from another prospect or in Idaho who clai med to have found traveling stones in Humboldt County and o ffered to go get them so Nevada could present them at the nex t World's Fair. Hi s citation of textual au thorities to satisfy readers' desires for vicarious witness ha s at this stag e turned into f ull-blown forgery of these supporting texts. He is expanding on the \"Russian nesting doll\" strategy of em bedding hoaxes within hoaxes that he began by inserting the fake analogy of the Swedish \"copper m an\" in the \"Silver Man\" hoax. A m ore pressing question about this la st installm ent of the \"Traveling Stones\" hoax is the following: why would De Quille revi ve this hoax after having exposed it thirteen years before? His motivation is im possible to reconstruct, but his argum ents in the last installm ent of the hoax lead to som e suggestive conclusions that show him developing ot her stra tegies n ascent in th e \"Silve r Man\" hoax. In addition to the striking de velop ment of textual W itness, this tific de tail about geodes and iron nodules in order to le nd plausibility to the tale (Detail, 316 Popsci., Pla usibility ). De Quille is also d eveloping the codependenc e between belief and doubt in his hoaxing. By expos ing his hoax in 1879, he si multaneously corroborated the convictions of those who had originally disbelieved the story and underm ined the convictions of the original believers. His tactics of reviving the hoax in 1892 com plicate his relationship to these readers enorm ously. This tim e he claim s that he him self, once a doubter, has been m ade a believer by the appearan ce of \"testim onials \" to the stones' existence. His stated plan to \"flush out\" the real stones by public izing fake ones has worked; he has literally m ade the stones m aterialize with h is rhe toric. Now, De Quille's o riginal be lieving reade rs are vindicated, and it is the doub ters' turn to be asham ed of their lack of faith in De Quille. In \"The Force of Falsity ,\" the first essay in Um berto Eco's 1998 collection Serendipities: Language and Lunacy, Eco discusses hist orical situations very close to the one De Quille constructed w ith his \"feeler\" s tory about the traveling stones. Eco exam ines important forger ies and shows how they som etimes led, outside the intention and cont rol of their cr eators, to seren dipitous d iscoveries. For exam ple, a wishful underestimation of the earth's circum ference based on to W estward rou te to the Ea st Indie s, thus leadin g to the dis covery of the East Indies. Eco's argum ent extends be yond the m erely historical, however; in addition to showing how doc uments could change the course of history, he suggests that intuition and desire, in th e absence of e mpirical fact, are powerful heuristics of discovery. Eco' s examples tend to conflate deliberate forgeries with 317 self-delus ional th eories because h is focu s is re ally on how these docum ents were read and acted upon by others. De Quille's \"Traveling Stones\" hoax was a deliberate hoax, not a self-delusion, and his argum ent that his hoax turned up the \"real deal\" is equally a fabrication as far as we know. Prim arily the hoax served a function outside Eco's field of view\u2014the embarrassm ent of \"outsider\" Eastern and scientific entrepren eurs. But De Quille's \"feeler\" strategy, when viewed from the angle of Eco's of historical forg eries, forges hard-cas t authority f or De Quille as a lite ral creator of the W est and its scientif ic phenom ena. So, the 25-year attenua tion of the rhetor ical gam e with his readers irst, th at trut h is of ten judged sim ply as a function of persistence, and that readers' ongoing deba te over the verity of a story m erely serves to ce ment the authority of its write r as an oracle of natural reality. W ith the \"Traveling Stones\" s aga, De Quille deve loped strategies of testim ony t hat kept his readers ever on the edge of their judgm ent, all th e while cleverly increasing their reliance on him for \"inform ation and detail, \" as Neil Harris put the case for Barnum 's authority ove r his audien ce (82). As De Quille' s readers co nstruc ted their realities, however they chose to do so, they had to go through him and his words. He was a rhetorical m agician who m ade stones literally appear and disappear at whi m. It is perhaps telling th at eight years af ter his last installm ent, 318 stones that appeared to move on their own were reported at the Racetrack Playa in Death Valley, and they are called \"tra veling stones\" by m any to Fish\" (1876) The \"Eyeles s De ille's final m ajor hoax, not counting the sequ els to the \"Traveling Stones.\" It app eared as \"Mystery of the Savag e Sump\" on 19 February 1876: A most singular discovery was yest erday m ade in the Savage m ine. This is the finding of living fish in the water now flooding both the Savage and Hale and Norcross m ines. The fish found were five in num ber, and were yesterday afternoon hoisted up the in cline in the la rge iron hoistin g tank and dumped into the pum p tank at the bo ttom of the vertical shaf t. The fishes are eyeless, and are only about three or four inches in length. They are blood red in color. The tem perature of the water in which they are found is 128 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014almost scalding hot. When the fish were taken out of the hot water in which they were found, and placed in a bucket of cold water, for the purpose of being brought to the surface, th ey died alm ost instantly. T he cold water at once chilled their lif e blood. In appearance these subterran ean m embers of the finny tribe somewhat resem ble gold fish. They seem lively and sportive enough while in their native ho t water, no twithstanding the fact th at they have no 23 See www.d esertusa.com /who/ mar_ebag.htm l for one account and www.geosci.unc.edu/faculty/ glazner/dvflight/ dv.htm l for som e pictures of the stones. 319 eyes nor ev en the rud iments of eyes. The water by which the m ines are flooded broke in at a depth of 2,200 feet in a drift that was getting pushed to the north ward in the Savage. It rose in the mine\u2014also in the Hale and Norcross, the two m ines being connecte d\u2014to the height of 400 feet; that I, up to the 1,800 foot level. This would seem to prove that a great subterranean reservoir or lake has been tapped, and from this lake doubtless cam e the fish hoisted from the m ine last evening. Eyeless fishes are frequently f ound in the lakes of large caves, but we have never before heard of th eir existence in eith er surface or subterranean water the temperature o f which was so high as is the water in those m ines. The lower workings of the Savage m ine are far below the bed of the Carson river, below the bottom of the W ashoe lake\u2014below any water running or standing anywhere w ithin a d istance of ten m ils of the mine. (ctn. 1, fldr. 120) The fantasy of this hoax ties in with one of De Quille's \"quaints,\" cited by C.C. Goodwin, about a subterranean lake connecting all the W ashoe from Lake Tahoe (\"Dan De Quille\" 215). De Quille c onsistently worked and reworked ideas that attracted hi m over tim e, as evidenced with the \"Traveling Stones.\" He had clearly been intrigued by reports of unusual fish for quite som e time, because his clippings include an articl e about ten-headed fish supposedly found in China (ctn. 1). De Quille 's own \"f ish story\" ende d up being reprin ted ex ely attracting high-level scientif ic atten tion. De Quille pum ped the public en thusiasm 320 for the f ish with th ree a nd possibly four follow-ups. A New York paper, probably the Sun , reprinted the story verb atim (ctn. 1, fldr. 120). R eactions to the story by local pap ers, on the other hand, were split, and th e argum ent quickly derailed in to the issue of water in the m ines signaling the running-out of the Coms tock lode. The Grass Valley Union reprinted the story and refl ected, \"We regard those fish as evil om en, so to speak. A big cavern full of water will not probably contain much silver ore.\" The paper went on to carp that the San Francisco merchan ts were already refusing to take silver \"t rade dollars\" had be tter m end their ways before silver production fell off dram atica lly and silver becam e more dear than gold (ctn. 2, scrapbk. 2).24 The San Francisco Stock Report did not like the conclusions the Grass Valley Unio n drew from the fish s tory. Its writer grum bled that the Union was not alone in its na\u00efve assum ption-m aking about the \"canard\" printed by the Enterprise : That the story was a palpable \"yarn\" on its very f ace to all who understand the conditions of the great m ines on thei r lower levels does not in the least 24 \"Trade dollars\" were a controversia l minting of heavy silver dollars by the U.S. Mint in 1873 in order to should er the standard Mexican peso out of currency in the Far East. According to numismatic historia n Anthony Vigliotta, some of the \"trad e dollars\" trickled b ack to the States, which they were never meant to and, coupled with a drop in s ilver stock prices in 1876, created an unfortunate surplus of silver currency, especially on the W est Coast. This led to employers abusing their em ployees by pa ying them the undervalued trade dollars, which were refused by m any merchants as indicated in the Union's response to the \"Eyeless Fish\" hoax. Overall, silver and \"free silv er\" iss ues in th e West are complicated econom ic and political probl ems that cannot be done justice in a short spa ce. A m ore detailed tre atment wi ll follow below in a discussion of De Quille 's role in the f ree silver movement. 321 prevent its gaining credit am ong pe ople who do not understand those conditions, and as the obvious inferen ce is that where there are fish, eyeless o r otherwise, there m ust be water, th e story was calcu lated to injur e the mine. A jok e is a joke, bu t such a joke as th is becomes seriou s in its consequences in proportion as it is successf ul. (ctn. 2, scrapbk. 2) De Quille f ollowed up with at leas t three ins tallments, all of which appe ar to be f rom the Ente rprise. The first appeared the next day and show cased De Quille's famous performance of doubt: The local departm ent of the Enterprise of yesterday contained a very nice yarn about fish being found swimming in the water which is now flooding the lower levels of the Sa vage and Hale & Norcross m ines. It is a very Dandequillish story, which, being told on the authority of Col. F.F. Osbiston, Superintendent of the Savage m ine, m akes us believe it is perfectly true....In fact, the water tast es and sm ells a li ttle fishy, like the story, and if the f ish were a little th icker, it would be m erely one extensiv e chowder. However, De Quille went on to offer proofs aimed at his readers' expectations of plausib ility, through analogy once more (Plau sibility, Analog y): Strange as this story m ay appear to the unscientific, yet it is by no means so unnatural as it seem s for even the extrem e of cold does no t always destroy piscatorial life. W e have seen sm all fish frozen solid in cakes of ice for weeks and when thawed out gra dually they all cam e to lif e and swam about as lively as ever....An uncle of ours was mate of a New 322 Bedford whaler in the S ummer of 1848, on the coast of Greenland. One day they found a sm all whale frozen into the side of a huge iceberg. T hey cut him out, got a clove hitch about his tail, and lef t him in the water ov er night to thaw the frost out of him . In the m orning they found him alive and towing the ship to w indward at the rate of five knots an hour. In spite of the connotations of the \"wha le\" with respect to his story, De Quille finishes off his proof with an appeal to eyewitnes s\u2014his: Since writing the above, Mr. Jam es Orndorff, of the Delta S aloon, Virginia City, as shown us som e of those fish from the flooded Savage mine, their red color is evidently produced by the oxide of iron, found so plentiful in som e portions of the west wall of the Com stock. The flesh is very firm , fins and tail short and com pact, and the skin rough and corrugated. They have no scales, a nd look like a cross between a lobster and a sardine. They can be seen at the Delta saloon. (ctn. 2, scrapbk. 2) This item was coupled by an announcem ent of the exhibition of the fish, \"of a variety well enough known to naturalist s\" at the Delta saloon attended citizens\" (ctn. 2, sc rapbk. 5). De Q uille is working all his tricks in the se two sequels: refutatio, \"Em peror's New Clot hes\" appeal, analogy, witness, and the use of the sequel to perpetu ate the illus ion of reality f or the hoax, intensify the belief/doubt codependen ce, and thus cem ent his authority. Not content with his su ccess to tha t point, De Quille pro vided one an d possibly tw o more sequels to the \"Eye less Fish\" busines s. One included th e textual au thority of a fo rged \"letter\" from Maurice May of Franktown, Nevada, 323 claim ing tha t at W ashoe lake liv ed a little gray version of the red eyeless fish; Mr. May surm ised that in the j ourney through the subterranean water tunnels, the fish must have becom e blind. He also stated his intentions to sue the Com stock for stealing W ashoe Lake's water and fish (c tn. 2, scrapbk. 2). The last installm ent, continu ing in this tong ue-in- cheek vein, may not be De Quille 's bu t cer tainly sounds like it. It takes issu e with the Grass Valley Union 's alarm ist rhetoric and reassu res reader th at the only subterranean s ea-life they need fear is th e \"m ining shark.\" \"This is a terrible creature, w ith a stomach and thro at extended enough to swallow a city at a gu lp. This fish ha s grown very fat since the Com stock was discovered, and the only redeem ing thing in his character is the fact that he prefers his own species for food\" (ctn. 1, scrapbk. 120). The article turns into a comic allegory of the San Francis co and Eastern m ining interests scamm ing Nevadans. De Quille' s mature hoaxing ta ctics in the \"Eye less Fish\" ear ned not only a wide readers hip for the h oax but, more importantly, a request from Spencer Baird, curator of the Sm ithsonian Institution, fo r a specim en of the fish preserved in alcohol. T homas Donaldson, Baird's secretary, wrote to De Quille, \"If the statem ent in the slip enclosed be true, a very im portant discover y has been m ade.\" De Quille's satisf action with his skillf ul hoaxing is apparent in the comm ent he scribbled on the back of th e envelope of Donaldson's le tter: \"A Sold Pro fessor\u2014 The 'Eyeless Fish' 324 3.5 Minor hoaxes and scientific reaction De Quille wrote m any other hum orous scientific pieces. Loom is counts twelve other \"tall tales\" of scientific wonders, includ ing another fish story, an article en titled \"Ringin g Rocks an d Si nging Stones,\" and \"The Eucalyptus,\" reporting a new anim al of that nam e found in the W ashoe region. Many of these are br ief and f all short of the level of scientif ic plausib ility and tone \" au grand serieux \" tha t charac terized his f our major hoax es. De Quille was f ull of ideas f or more of these stories. His notebooks sket ch out ideas for \"A Natural Incubator-- At Steam boat Springs, hatche s all kinds of fowls from a humm ing bird to an Ostrich --I in terview the m an who has burn m arks and [ illegible]....\" De Quille attaches a news clipping to his note book about an \"ossified m an\" who slowly turned to bone. He notes, \"I find sim ilar man hidden in a hut awaiting death. He expects soon his h eart will turn to bone\u2014ki dneys, liver, one lung gon e. He is trying vegetable diet (or som e diet contai ning no lim e). Lime in everything. He tries to precipitate it, etc\" (box 3). We will never know if De Quille was going to develop these stories along a hum orous lin e or a m ore straight-faced line th at would have m ade the m good candidates for hoaxes. Naturally, it is po ssible that the reason his four m ost famous hoaxes succeeded where the minor ones failed is due as much or more to reader interes ts and agendas. The \"Eyeless Fish\" certainly h it a sore spot with readers fearful of a future linke d to th e fate of silve r in the West. The \"Solar Ar mor\" hoa x arrested reader attention with the conundrum of fr eezing to death in a desert. The \"Silver Man,\" however, attracted alm ost no atten tion. I treated it h ere simply because it 325 was the site where De Quille dev eloped th e strategies he would perf ect in th e successful hoaxes, and it is also the longest and most elaborate of his hoaxes. I have found evidence of at least four m ore \"serious\" hoaxes De Quille wrote, and one of them succeeded in attr acting national scientif ic atten tion. The underground lake hoax m entioned by Goodwi n appears to have been locally successful, but it is hard to track dow n without further identifi cation. W ells Drury claim ed success f or De Quille 's \"qu aint\" abou t a windm ill that stay ed in perpetua l motion by using loose sand it hauled up in windy periods as ballast to drive the mill in windless perio ds (213); the quaint was supposed endorsed by \"an engineering journal,\" in which a Bost on engineer figured out \"the exact horsepower\" the windm ill would g enerate, but no corrobo rating evidenc e for this anecdote is extant. \"An Astounding Di scovery.\u2014Extraordinary A dvance in Science\u2014A Savant Makes an Egg and Hatc hes Therefrom a Live Bird\" appeared in the 19 February 1876 Ente rprise and claim ed to be a reprint from the Church Union . This \"hoax,\" however, m ay have b een read as h umor rath er than as science news due to its outlandish subjec t (thus violating read ers' Plausibility expectations ) and a few off-key phrasings in the piece like \"his darling s cheme\" and \"The Professor was alm ost wild with delight\" ( violations of Popsci. expectations). De Quille's \"Mountain r \"Highland Alligator\" h oax, however, prom pted a letter from no less a personage than fam ed evolutionary paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. Cope addressed th e letter to \"W m. Blackheath \" care of the Ente rprise . 326 Sir\u2014 I see a no tice of your \"Mountain Allig ator\" in the Virgin ia City Enterprise. I do not know how true the statem ents are, & I write to inquire about the matter. Can you tell m e if the length is 7 feet long as stated? Also will you describe the color of the beast? As a natu ralist who has devoted more a ttention to the r eptiles th an any other m an in this country , I am very curious to g ive a scientific accoun t of your beast in the Magazine above nam ed [The American Naturalist ]. Can you find the skeleton & the skull & f eet you took from the skin? I can determ ine exactly what it is if you w ill send th em to m e. You m ay have thrown the m away, but I will value them \u2014even if dirty and broken, as I can clean & study them . Of course th e skull is most im portant. Can you send it? I would m uch like also to see the sk in. Will you give m e an account of th e locality from whence the specim en was obtained? I will be in Arizona in October.... Yours very truly, E.D. Cope De Quille annotated th e envelope, beneath the address, \"A Professor who was sold on the 'Highla nd Alligato r.'\" Th e letter is da ted 18 Septem ber, either 1880 or 1888. A search of the Territorial Enterprise for both of those ye ars up to that date rev ealed no sto ry about a \"Mount ain A lligator\" or \"Highland Alligator,\" but it could very well be that Cope w as looking at a paper a year or two older. 327 Cope m ay have shared m any of t he values o f Twain's m iner readers discussed in Chapter Three. Like the local m iner popul ation, Cope could not be too picky about which stories he believed if he wanted to b eat Othniel Marsh out as the pr emier na turalist of the late ninetee nth century. C ope does m itigate his request with \"I do not know if the statem ents are true,\" but his eagerness to get his hands on th e fossil in the second paragraph is alm ost cloying. An ad dition al dynam ic indexed by this letter and the letter from Spencer Baird's secretary bears importantly on our analysis of De Quille 's hoaxing. De Quille inscrib es on both of these letters the m ark of his trium ph over the East Coast \"professors.\" He has \"sold\" the u niversity m en on eyeless fish and m ountain alligators sim ply because the professo rs are outs iders and are ther efore not privy to th e local, contextual inform ation that would expose the hoaxes. The use of the word \"sold\" is not a ccidental. Nevada's silver resources were being bought by the government, first to finance the Civil W ar, and then to finance America's burgeoning foreign trade. This business was being transacted incre asingly to the detr iment of the local m iners and pro spector s. De Quille seem s to have had a strong sense th at his doughty local prospectors were constantly in danger of having their hard work bought out from under them cheaply by Eastern com mercial inte rests. This nationa l \"ya rd sale\" in cluded the begging, buying, or stealing of W estern na tural wonders like fossils and geodes by university collectors. Jealous and proud of the progress Nevada had m ade as a State and as a m onum ent to the p ioneering spirit, De Quille got a great deal of satisfaction out of Baird and Cope \"buying\" a Nevada hoax. That \"sale\" leveled 328 the playing field a little f or the pion eers against Eastern money and political power. De Quille once wrote to h is siste r that he believed Eastern ers were afraid of the W esterner's \"off hand and irrevere nt way of m entioning m en of note and standing\" (W right Dives 22). D e Quille believed h e and other N evadans possessed, by constructing their destinies on the say-so of no one but them selves , a weapon that was capable of neutraliz ing the old social institutions and hierarchies that they had m oved West to escap e but which had followed them anyway. These conclusions based on Cope's and Baird's letters will be addressed more f ully in the f inal section of this chapte r. 4. S UMMARY OF READING EXPECTATIO NS BASED ON DE QUILLE 'S HOAXES Dan De Quille utilized at least fo ur new strategies in his hoaxes: the \"Emperor's New Clothes\" refutatio, the codependence of belief/doubt through seque ls. Each of these strategies is funda mentally linked to r eader expectations. The \"Emperor's New Clothes\" strategy can be connected with Novelty, as it induces a strong desire to \"keep up with the Joneses\" and appear on top of new developm ents in science and technology. But it m ore properly belongs to a level of reader desires that is beyond expectations about ethnoscience and science news, the expectations to which we have restricted this study. \"Em peror's New Clothes\" appeals tap into a type of social com petition fostered by Jacksonian rhetoric about the self-m ade common Am erican\u2014the struggle to appear independently knowledgeable in all circum stances and thus self-sufficient. 329 Refutatio is De Quille' stra tegy inc reasing the ef fectiveness of his argum ent by constructing a m odel of his readers' in terpretations on -line and adjusting argum ents to play to their expectat of his argum ents towar d Plausibility show us that he believed his readers to rank Plausibility very highly. The skeptical dem ands by New York and English editors for further proof of De Quille's claim s, along with the requests by the Smithsonian and Cope for verification, s upport this plausib ility-focused model of scienc e rea ding as m ore gene ral than jus t De Quille 's personal co any scien ce newsreaders , especi ally Eastern an d European readers, were entering a phase where Novelty and Sensation were being either valued negativ ely o r simply dev alued b ecause of bad ex perien ces with trusting m edicine- show and Barnum esque scientific claim s. On the other hand, in the case of the \"Eyeless Fish\" causing near-panic among the N evada and California papers over the prospect of the m ines running out, we s ee the residue of the reading filters of Western m iners who still rank No velty h igher than Plaus ibility b ecause the ir ng quickly to new infor mation. De Quille 's appeal to loca l and textu al witness n ecessitates a n ew expectation, Witness. We saw the seeds of this practice in Twain's hoaxes, where he followed up the \"Petrified Man\" hoa x with a notice that hundreds of people had been to see it and ended his \"Em pire City Massacre\" with the murderer dropping dead in front of a saloon full of locals. Over and above the ethos of foreign experts (Foreign) that we saw as a regular feature of the New York hoaxes of the 1830s and 1840s, W itness requires local testim ony, which was the surest 330 way to verify truth in 1865 Nevada wher e there were very few papers, courts, law-enforcers, and other official social ar biters of truth. This new expectation can be sta ted thu sly: Witness: If trustworthy locals reportedly witnessed a phenom enon, it is probabl y real. De Quille's perform ance of the code pendence of belief and d oubt throug h his sequels is the area in which we have the m ost evidence for developm ent and evolution in his hoaxing. Its basic rh etorical success seem s to hinge on De Quille 's ability to p roject him self over time as a skeptical au thority weig hing his options just like the r eader. is pe rform ance increas ed the app earance of cognitive sim ilarity between the reader and writer, in Ka ufer and Carley's terminology, and thus increased the chances that the reader would be sympathetic to the hoaxer's claim s. However, it also made a funda mental, indirect argum ent for De Quille's authority, nam ely, \"Whichever way you m ake up your m ind, you're still counting on m e for your inform ation.\" After a consideration of Twai n's hoaxing, we determ ined the following f ilter of expectations f or a W estern rea dership p redominantly c omposed of Progression} >> Com prehension The top tie r, with Authority first, reflected the trum ping power of the dual journalistic reputations of \"Sam Clem ens\" and \"Mark Twain.\" For unsigned articles, however, the urgent need to expl oit ne w inf ormation (as well as a th irst for sensation on the sparsely-populated fr ontier) tended to win the day over the 331 more quotidian evidence provided by the te xt in the form of plausibility, confor mity to generic conventions, and inte rnal logical consiste ncy.

After considering De Quille's hoaxing, I have m ade the following adjustm the f >> Com prehension Authority is left in h ighest pos ition due to ev idence f rom reade rs that De Quille had a stand-up reputation as a journa list. De Quille him self seem ed to depend on this reputation as evidenced by his prac tice of interleav ing fact and fiction in his articles with no overt distinction between the two. The switching of the text-internal expectations with Novelty and Sensation indicates De Quille 's belief that his read ers actually read and paid a ttention to th e facts and the languag e of his articles. This observation is corroborated by De Quille's remonstrating with Twain Mass acre,\" by De Quille 's pr actice of monitor ing his reade rs' potential interpretations online a nd adjustin g his evide nce to sa tisfy their de mands f or 332 plausibility, and by the requests for fu rther evidence by Eastern and English reporters an d scien tists.

Ov erall, the chang es to th e filter ref lect De Quille 's proje ction of his se lf-made, p ioneer reade rs and his personal exp erience as o ne of them . 5. D ISCUSS ION: DE QUILLE 'S HOAX ES BU ILD AN D DEFEND HIS ID EAL WEST The questio ns rem aining about De Qu ille's hoaxing now are the sam e that we have answered for each hoaxer: Why did De Quille choose hoaxes to address his readers about science and technology ? What m essage was he trying to get across about those topics? W hat relations hip was he attem pting to construct with his readers through the hoaxes? The short answer is that De Quille's hoaxing was overall a constructive activity. Instead of having a particular axe to grind with the way science or technology were being im plemented in the West (after all, he was a miner and loved science), he instead con centr ated on using scien tific rhetoric to build the W est that he wanted to live in a nd that he wanted to project to th e Eas t. He playfully exploited the authority he had earned with his readers through legitim ate mining reporting to construct for them and for outsiders a W est full of wonders. If, in the process, he caught som e important Eastern scientists and businessm en in h is net, all the be tter f or his project of cham pioning the pioneer as a scrappy folk hero triumphing over the silk-vested Eastern fat cat. 333 This portrait of De Quille's hoaxing re vises two previous conceptions of it. C. Gran t Loom is's study of De Quille's hoaxes, the m ost extensive, class ifies them as \"s cientific tall tales \" since they a re all on top ics of science and technology. However, this purely topical approach unfortunately lum ps together two dif ferent registe rs of De Quille's scientif ic journalism as discus sed at the opening of this chapter: his hum orous \"t all tales,\" and his \"quain or tale like \"The Boss Rain-Maker\" (ctn. 1, fldr. 8), about a miner who m akes rain by shooting the clouds with buck-shot, is written in dialect and m akes no pretense to be anything ot her than a hum orous story on a quasi- scien tific topic. Th e \"Silver Man, \" hoa x, on the other hand, is written as a high- regis ter sc ience news artic le. De Quill e was clearly engag ing his readers in two different gam es with these two different rhetorics. Lawrence Berkove recognizes this rheto rical difference when he se parates out from De Quille's hum orous fiction the s pecial categ ory of his \"q uaints,\" in w hich his purpose was \"always the same: to gull unwary readers by his m atter-o f-fact style a nd copious use of speciously corroborative detail in to believing them true\" (Dives 21). The distinction is a cru cial on e to make, for if we obscure it we rob ourselves of an explanation for the re silienc e of De Quill e's repu tation as a trustworthy scientific writer in spite of his copious hoaxing. Hoaxing, as discussed w ith respe ct to the Authority expe ctations in Chapter Two, crea tes a condition of expert notoriety for the hoa xer; in m any instan ces, this effect provides powerful m otivation to hoaxers like P oe and Twain who wish to create an ethos of counter-cultural authority. But Poe and Twain's journalism was m ore 334 amenable to contam ination by the waggish reputations they developed through hoaxing. P oe wrote fiction and poetry an d essays on those sam e topics. Mark Twain, too, apart from a short stint as a congressional reporter at the start of his career (which he carefully m arked with his given na me in order to quarantine it from his developing reputati on as a wag) wro te fiction an d satire. They were yarn-spi nners. It was easi er for t heir read ers to reconcile thei r hoaxing with their overall literary endeavors. De Quille, on the other hand, evinced a rather sharp divide in his journalism between his t echnical writing on the one hand and his tall tales and ho axes on the other. The c ontem porary commentary shows De Quille' s readers cog nizant of th is Great Divide. W ells Drury, for exam ple, writes the following about the relation of De Quille's hoaxing to his technical writing: When the newspapers of the coast took Dan to task for his trifling, Dan only laughed and resolved never to do it again, but the next tim e that items were s carce he wa s tem pted an d fell from grace....These diversions, of course, were only occasion al and desultory. In his regular work Dan was a m odel of m ethod and accu racy. This m ade his hoaxes all th e more dangerous. (213-214) Because De Quille had two distin ct journalistic modes, his readers were able to bracket off his technical w riting and reputation from infection by the notoriety that hoaxing usually brings. Interestingly, however, that interpretive barrier was perm eable from the technical s ide, as Drury notes above: De Quille's reputation as a scientific expert continued to lend at least initial cred ibility to his hoaxes, written as th ey were to sou nd like se rious scienc e articles. Loc al readers 335 had access to enough ancillary ev idence to eventually s ort out De Quille's \"quaints\" from his technical p ieces. East Coast readers likely did not. W ith both reade rships, however, De Quille 's formidable te chnica l appea rs to have insula ted his journa listic ethos from notoriety. De Quille scholars have m ade another, m ore serio us, error in a pprasing his hoaxing. Much like the critics who cl aimed Twain had no social project, Lawrence Berkove argues that De Quille 's hoaxes had \"no ulterior purpos e beyond entertainm ent\" (20). As we have seen throughout this study, hoaxing is serious business, altering the very fabric of what readers consider real. The edito rs of the San Francisco Stock Report cut to the core o f the issue when they criticized the \"Eyeless Fish \" for starting a dangerous rum or about the future of silve r in th e West: \"A jo ke is a jok e, but such a joke as this becom es serious in its consequences in proportion as it is successful.\" A hoax becom es epistem ologically and politica lly se rious when m any people st art believing it. That De Quille was serious about people believing his hoaxes is evident in the copious sequels he wrote to the \"Traveling Stones\" and \"Solar Arm or\" hoaxes in particular. He persisted in defending his hoaxes for as long as thirty years. Why would De Quille work so tir elessly to sec ure belief in his hoaxes ? Most of the locals th at read h is pap er could verify within hours or days that D e Quille's \"qu aints\" were nonsense, ju st by as king the peop le referenced in them . Some answers to this conundrum becom e clearer when we consider De Quille's second readership, his East Coast reader s, along with his central social and politica l passions: s tate-buildi ng and the free s movem ent. 336 5.1 State-bu ilding and the prospector as folk h ero Lawrence Berkove jus tly describes De Quille as a m ajor Western writer who \"was shaped by the W est even as he helped c reate it\" (39 ). De Quille was invested in Nevada. After all, he c hose to spend nearly 40 years of his life in the te rritory /state when he had a wif e and three child ren ba ck East in I owa. His papers contain envelopes in which he co llected clippings pert aining to \"Nevada matters\" (ctn. 1, fldr. 39), and he followed and wrote on the poli tics of statehood. He owned a com plete copy of the l aws passed by the Nevada legislature during the 1863-1864 session, right before Nevada achieved statehood (ctn. 2). De Quille's hoaxes are not about events in E urope or on the m oon, as Poe's were. They are all about N evada locations, phenom ena, and people. De Quille was a cor respon dent f or Eas tern p apers and knew th ey clipped h is stories. He knew that hoaxes created new realities for readers, both W estern and Eastern. The hoaxes, along with De Quille's other st ories , served to create a larg er-th an- life legend of Nevada as a scientific wonderland and Nevadans as stout-hearted individualists who did not shy away from the most biza rre o f discoveries. As De Quille wrote of the m en who supposedly discovered the \"Silver Man,\" \"Had the finders been any other than California or W ashoe miners, there would have been a jolly stam pede and som e frantic clim bing\" to retreat from the terrifying sight (3). De Quille did not inse rt people in h is hoa xes, as Twain did, to m ock them. The prospecto rs, miners, inventors, an d doctors who staf f De Quille's hoaxes are America's n ew folk heroes\u2014ingen ious, fearless, and occasio nally trag ic, as in the case of Jonathan Newhouse and his solar arm or. 337 One m ight justly argue that th e self-revea ling charac ter of De Quille' s hoaxes would dam age the grand reputation he was try ing to c onstruc t for the W est and W esterners with an Eastern readerhip. In fact, the track record of revelation for De Quille's hoaxes is extrem ely interest ing, as he only revealed on e in prin t, the \"Traveling Stones\" hoax. His other hoaxes, m uch like Poe's and Twain's, contained clues and witnesses that local s could use to debunk the stories. The explicit revelation of the \"Traveling Stones, \" as we saw in the analys is of that hoax, was not so m uch a revelation as a dram atic p relude to De Quille's final installm ent in the hoax, his own conversion as a believer in the ex isten ce of the stones. Cleverly, he claim s to have be lieved from the beginning that they were always out there and that his story m erely goaded his readers on to find them . Revelation, therefore, w as actually a cons tructiv e strategy for De Quille, allowing him to capitalize on the codependence of be lief/doubt to assert his authority over the reader who could not independently test his \"quain ts.\" This read er was the Eastern read er, the m ain targe t of De Quille 's hoa xes. 5.2 Free silver and the defense of the West Nevada becam e a state in 1864, and De Quille lived there fo r nearly thirty years after that. Lawrence Berkove writes of his later years, \"He had outlived the bonanza tim es but was not content to silen tly carry to the grave his love of the pioneer and prospecto r ethic\" (35). Fo r this reason, Berkove claim s, De Quille wrote Dives and Lazaru s, his longest fiction w ork, which rem ained unpublished until n early a hundred years after his death. Through th e allegory o f a poor prospector who goes to heaven and a rich gold-trader who goes to hell, the book 338 contains som e heavy propaganda on an issue that engaged De Quille's passions\u2014 the f ree silv er m ovem ent. W hen viewed th rough the lens of this politic al issue, De Quille 's hoaxes app ear a s a means to sym bolica lly redress th e deb ts tha t he felt Eastern governm ental and com mercial in terests owed the Nevada prospector. The free s ilver m ovem ent was a reaction to Eas tern comm ercial appropriations of Western resources. Nevada was m ade a territory in 1861 by Lincoln so that its burgeoning silver yi elds would serve th e Union and not the Confederacy during the Civil W ar. The silver financed a great deal of the rest o f that war as well as foreign trade afterwor d, as footnoted abo ve with resp ect to th e \"trade dollar\" debate in the \"Eyeless Fi sh\" hoax. However, in spite of the boon the vast silver resources of Nevada had provided the nation, the U.S. stuck to the gold standard after the Civil W ar, a polic y that increasingly hurt Nevada during the series of depressions that wracke d the country from the 1870s until W orld War I. Silver languished at various unpredictable frac tions of the price of gold, making pa ying for debts and basic necess ities with silve r dolla rs near ly impossible. Proponents of \"free silver\" wanted the U.S . mint to allow the stam ping of as m any silver dollars as there was free silver in Nevada, at a constant rate of 16 silver do llars to one gold dollar. This would have helped m iners and small businessm en in the W est recover som ewhat from the depression. But the U.S. governm ent refused, and m iners be lieved it was becaus e big businessm en and bankers, who would suffer if the debts they held were easier to pay back, had undue influence with the governm ent (W right Dives 32-33). 339 In addition to the allegory of Dives and L azarus , De Quille wr ote vehem ently in favor of free silver. In hi s articles he polarized everyone into \"the millionaire s versus th e m asses, plutoc racy versus democracy, re morseless Shylocks versus the ' race of hardy frontiersm en,' evil versus good'\" (W right Dives 33). It was in this phase of his life that De Quille, who had be en m ulti- culturally educated and tole rant in his fiction and non-fiction to this point, suddenly wrote bitterly against Jews a nd the Chinese, whom he believed were conspiring with the gold-standard supporters against the m iners. This pass ionate def ense of the m iner again st the East Coast politica l and business interests dovetails with De Quille 's hoaxing practices. As m entioned with lling\" big Eas t Coast prof essors on s tories tha t his uneducated miner friends at the saloon would never take seriously for more than a day or two. The professors were outsiders, Neva dans were insiders, and the hoaxes dram atized that divide. The sam e dynam ic held in the \"Traveling Stones\" revelation o f 1879. De Quille claim ed he only revealed the hoax becaus e he was tired of being pestered by requests for the stones from P.T. Barnum, Germ an scientists, and Eastern businessmen. Perhaps his m otivation was rath er a symbolic victory over these pres tigious figures via public hu miliation. He rounds out his revelation by relating the annoya nce of being hustled by an Eastern businessm an to produce a \"carload\" of the st ones, after which he snipes, \"If this candid confession shall carry a pang to the heart of any true believer we shall be 340 glad of it, as the true believers have pa nged it to us, right and left, quite long enough\" (Dwyer 22). 5.3 Conclusion De Quille 's hoaxing is not an indir ect critic ism of the role of science in American lif e, as were Twain's an d Poe's. De Quille wa s a lay scie ntist and wrote as enthusiastically about the progress of science and technology in the W est as anyone. The target of his hoaxes was the East Coast comm ercial appropriation of what W estern m iners and pioneers br oke their backs for\u2014a problem that he also worked out in detail in his free silver journ alism and in Dives and Lazarus . The hoaxes were De Quille's private, and public, vendetta against the powerful Eastern interests victim izing De Quille's friends and neighbors. In the end th e legacy of De Quille's hoaxing m oves beyond the valian t but losing fight he waged against the East and the gold standard. His hoaxing practices utilize the foundational strategies developed by Poe and adapt them to a popular science rhetoric that dem onstrated through its m atter-of -fact language the contro l that Am erican science had extende d ove r natu re in the inte rvening thir ty years. In addition, De Qu ille's hoaxes clearly dem onstr ate their inheritance of Twain's con ception of the hoax as local po litica l activism . But De Quille is also an innovator. He develops rhetorical strategies of hoaxing\u2014like \"Em peror's els\u2014th at sp ecifically exploit the power of print to build real ity over tim e. His legacy is the idea of the West as a perpetu al frontier where the po ssible a nd impossible regularly change places through the translation of scie ntific rhetoric, as a lim inal realm that divulges its 341 mysteries only to those who go there a nd write about it. W ith his hoaxes De Quille\u2014 just as s ignificantly as other, more canonical W estern writers lik e Twain and Bret Harte\u2014conditioned his rea ders to be lieve tha t the West was a region of American experien ce where words, in fact, m ade the world. 342 Chapter Five: The Mechanics of Hoaxing In this pro ject I hav e treated scie ntific m edia hoaxes as historical rhetorical events\u2014exchanges on issues of science and/or technology between writers and their aud ience(s) th at play out over tim e through news m edia. This definition was deve loped as a rea ction to certain problem s with trad itional gene ric definition s of hoaxes, nam ely their inability to account for hoaxes ' stubborn tendency to expand the boundaries of their textuality. Functi ons like revelation, author intentionality, reader reception, and medium-dependence must be considered when analy zing th e success of a well-crafted scientific m edia hoax. When we view the hoax as not a text but an event, a pu blic exch ange during which Am ericans decid e what they b elieve to hold tru e in their world, the hoax's expansive textuality is transf ormed from a def inition al obstacle into a key instrum ent for shaping a portrait of science newsreading. This red efinition of a hoax has re quired a m ethodology of rhetorical analysis that can cope with the entire communicative loop of the hoax\u2014author, medium , audience m essage\u2014or the \"sym bolic action \" the hoax ena cts in its community, in the alternate term inology of Karlyn Kohrs Ca mpbell (49). The expectation-based m ethod chosen for this an alysis m eets these criteria because not 343 only does it m odel the inte raction/c ompetition of reader s' expecta tions during their decisions about the truth of a hoax, but it also m odels the guesses of the hoax writer as he strove to cam ouflage his project under the feat ures readers would expect of a \"real\" science news item .25 1. C ONSEQ UENCES OF A RHETO RICAL RE DEFI NITIO N OF HOA XING Before I m ove on to m y conclusions about hoaxing in nineteenth-century America, we should exam ine two key consequences of approaching hoaxing with a method that com bines rhetorical herm eneutics and pragm atic linguistics: first, authorial intention cannot be ignored, as it is cru cial feature of the hoax as a social project; and, second, the recep tion of hoa xes at different tim es and places ( kairoi ) in nine teenth-centu ry Am erica is re construc ted as evolving filters of common reader expectations. 25 Why didn't wom en write hoaxes? A purely statis tical answ er is that there were simply not m any wom en repor ters for popular m edia in the m id-1800s (if any) and no wom en popul ar science writers (to my knowl edge), so wom en simply lacked the opportunity for large-sc ale scientific m edia hoaxing. However, this is not a satisfactory explanation. A na\u00efve hypothesis m ight hold that hoaxing, with its ago nistic em phases on cr iticism and dominance, was gendered m ale rather than f emale at this tim e, though th is generalization begs for close scrutiny and corroborating research. As a potentia l counterpoint to this argum ent, wom en did read and publicly respond to hoaxes (cf. Elizabeth B. Browning's letter to Poe about \"M. V aldem of th e gendering of hoaxes keys off Blair and Hill's cla ssification of hoaxing as \"su bversive. \" In Sensation al Designs: The Cultura l Work of American Fiction , Jane Tom pkins has m ade an excellent argum ent that wom en writers pioneered their ow n highly effective \"subversive\" mode of soc ial criticism and subversive cultural work that fell within the bounds of respectable fem ininity in antebellum America\u2014the sentim ental novel. Chapter Five of Sensational Designs fram es the issues of gender and power associated with this lite ratur e through the len s of Harriet Be echer Stowe 's Uncle To m's Cabin . 344 1.1 The social projects and intentions of the h oaxers In spite of choosing a comm on rhetoric al mode through which to criticize the ro le of s cience in A merica, each author had a slightly diffe rent social project in m ind with his hoaxing. Poe's hoax ing was groundbreaking. He and Richard Adams Locke innovated the genre just as Poe innovated the Am erican genres of the short story, detective fiction, a nd science fiction. Poe's hoaxes took advantage of current \"fads\" in popular tec hnology and science, especially those of European provenance. He used these sexy topics as vehicles to launch an indirect assault on a read ing cultu re th at rewa rded Baconian scien tists for their technological productions but refused to s upport artists in their endeavors. He considered the revela tion of his hoaxes as a social trium ph for artists, reasserting their authority not only over the language of sc ience but also ove r the con struction of public truth. Sim ultaneously, P oe exploited the double audience that hoaxes construc t to materialize for him self a comm unity of like-m inded readers who shared his im aginative ientif ic ep inherited m ctices, especially the sensa tional topic (petrifaction) and the undercutting of the authority of paleontologists. W hile Poe's hoaxes played on the exotic m arginality of Europe or pseudoscientific phenom ena, Tw ain's hoaxes were rooted in the W est and dealt with loca l Western issue s. Both hoaxers thus exploited frontiers, lines where readers' knowled ge becam e fuzzy or uns table, but they did so for different purposes. P oe had a personal scientific ag enda to push. Twain was disturbed first 345 by scientists' cooption of the right to wr ite the West for Am ericans and later by the bending of technological progress in Am erica toward imperialistic ends. His hoaxes produced laughter that was an affi rmation of self-determ ination in the face of m any Am erican institutions\u2014science, organized re ligion, Victor ian morality , the m ilitary\u2014that wer e vying f or author ity over the in dividua l. However, Twain's hoaxes also served to re-establi sh his authority over his readers as the only tru stworthy au thor who was willing to u nmask other s' social ho axes and reveal the real W est, the real Am erica. De Quille's hoaxing was a celeb ration of the ability of the scientif ic imagination to create Am erican reality. He continued Twain's local practices, but his personal rhetoric of hoaxing was m ore co mplex th an eith er Twain's or Poe's. Manifesting a finely-tuned awareness of th e needs and expectations of his readers, De Quille a ctually ad justed his arg umentation within his h oax to an ticipate h is reade rs' interpre tations using a strategy of refutatio, and he em ployed sophisticated rhetorical m anipulations of his readers' ps ychological needs for witness and for insider status in ord er to secure belief in his hoaxes. His target was also slightly m ore focused th an Twain' s or Poe's. Instea d of railing against science or industry, hoaxes ta rgeted Eastern comm ercial interes ts, including the governm ent and universities, which were seeking to profit from the risk and labor of W estern pioneers. De Quill e exploited the insider/outsider dynam ic of hoaxing inherited from the tall tale in order to defend his ideal W est from Eastern appropriation. 346 In addition to these so cial pro jects, tw o of our authors had personal axes to grind with their hoaxes. Poe used \"Von Kem pelen\" to m ock George E veleth, an irritating groupie; Twain fa mously aim ed \"Petrified Man\" at Judge Sewall.26 Since the ho axes m ake public th ese very personal goals, it is im possible to avoid the issu e of author in tentionality in hoaxing, no m atter ho w vexed a question it may be. The easiest form ulation of the problem is this: I f an author intends a hoa x, but no one believes it, is it a hoax ? The answer is almost certainly no, and th e term \"failed hoax\" is probably the most felicitous for this situation. The m ore troubling form ulation of the author-inten tionality problem in hoaxing remains as follows: If an autho r did not intend his/her story to be taken for a serious witness of a real scientific even t, but it was receiv ed as such by a readership (no t just one or two people), was it a hoax? My gut reactio n, which I suspect is sh ared by many, is \"no.\" The folk use of \"hoax\" b ears negative connotati ons that felicitate its pa iring with verbs like \"perpetrate\" and \"foist,\" whic h require a villain as an agent. However, at le ast two complications to this cla im have emerged in the course of this study. One of these com plications was the reception of Poe's \"M. Valdem ar.\" There is no extant evid ence tha t Poe intended the story to be taken litera lly; however, on ce it becam e clear to him that he had secured the belief of readers from Europe and Am erica, he began referri ng to the story as a \"hoax\" to pum p up 26 De Quille o bviously de rived sa tisfaction f rom fooling sc ientists Baird and Cope, but his personal papers leave us no evidence of his use of the hoax to satisfy a personal vendetta 347 its celebrity. This se ems to indicate that author intentio nality is no t sim ply a problem for the fram ing of the hoax but also gets in terleaved with reader responses. Thus, \"M. Valdem ar\" is a hoax because Poe chose to own it as such once readers started believing it. A second author intention problem arose with T wain's hoaxing, where he claim ed that \"Petrified Man\" and \"Em pire City Massac re\" were not ho axes but satires, and he spen t a great deal of tim e justifying this claim by pointing to clues he had planted in the stories, which his readers h ad missed. While Twain's claim s are not consonant with his actions, w hich we re calculated to p erpetu ate and repe at these \"m isunderstandings,\" this scenario rais es the crucial role of reader reception in the ho axing event. If m any readers belie ve som ething to be tru e that is later revealed to be false, irrespective of author intentions, the word \"hoax\" can still be applied. Fo r exam ple, \"War of the Worlds \" is alm ost always referred to as a hoax in spite of the fact that the original broadcast contai ned announcem ents that it was fiction; the m assive public pa nic th at ensu ed has ensured its historical status as a hoax. What seems crucial is that in a hoaxing event, the fooled readers or listeners hold som eone perceived as the author accountable for their embarrassment or discom fort. In the case of \" War of the W orlds,\" angry responses from listeners forced Orson W elles to issue a pub lic apology for the \"misunderstanding,\" even though his broadcast had included disclaim ers. Therefore, this is the an swer to the intent ionality problem that I offer for now: If an audience publicly co nstructs itself as deliberately d eceiv ed by an author or 348 agency through a news m edium , the even t counts for historical purposes as a hoax, ir respectiv e of the stated inten tions of the author. This definition rules out a case where one or two readers with activ e imaginations or serious psychoses believ e a piece of scien ce fiction is a news rep ort. This de finition also corre ctly assigns cases like John Symm es's \"Sym zonia,\" in which the author genuinely believed in and lobbied for the report he issued of subterran ean passages leading to the earth 's core (Collins 63). This was not a hoax because even if a re adership believed the story, so did its author. There was no \"m alice and aforethought,\" no discrepancy between the knowledge states of the author and readership that could be publicly dem onstrated and decried. This def inition of author inten tionality ho axing actu ally m akes a striking argum ent for the function of read er response in constituting authorial agency\u2014and in levying the historical j udgm ent of \"hoax\" itself against these rhetorical exchanges. Reader judg ments fo rmed the core of this project. From readers' reactions to the hoaxes, I rec onstructed expectations associated with science and science news that repeatedly se rved as \"sticking poi nts\" in the debates over the tru th of the ho axes. Thes e exp ectatio ns were org anized acco rding to lative power in th inte rpretive proce ss into sets or \"f ilters\" of expectations that readerships held in common. By comparing these filt ers across tim e and between readerships, we can get so me perspective on how the reading of science news changed in Am erica from 1835 to 1880. 349 1.2 Reception figured as filters of reading expectations The m ethod of this project introduce s a cognitively-based form alism into the study of historical Am erican literature. T o justify the im position of the OT model on the hoaxes and thei r reception, two key questions must be answered: first, is the model necessa ry? Second, are there precedents dem onstrating the utility of decis ion-m aking rary discourses? Chapter On e included an extensiv e justification of the necessity of a constra int-sa tisfaction model lik e Optim ribing reade rs' decis ions ab out the truth-value of the hoa xes. To briefly r ecap that argum ent, contem porary comm entary on the Ho ax\" by Edgar Allan Poe singled out readers' pre-existing expect ations about science and sc ience news as the driving force behind the hoax's general acceptabi lity am ong New Yorkers. In addition to this evidence, other contem porary commentat ors reiterated Po e's attributio n of the effect of the hoax to reader assum ptions about authority, plausibility, novelty, \"veris imilitude,\" etc. According ly, I needed to find a way to talk about thes e reade r expe ctations and to explain the co mpetitions between them that f requently surfaced as readers debated the tru th of Locke's hoax and th e other hoax es in m y project. The m ost germ ane m odels were Ellen Schauber and Ellen S polsky's preference r ules f or rea ding genres , and Optim ality Theory, a f ramework f or modeling decisions m ade in the face of co mpeting values or constraints. The two models are by no m eans m utually ex clusiv e, but I chos e OT becau se of its gre ater precis ion in modeling multiple levels of different cons traints and be cause of its 350 visual inspectability. T he data in my project drove m y choice of m ethod, not the other way around. Beyond its necessity in this particu lar instance, is a cognitive m odel like OT useful for exam ining other rhetorical and literary problem s? Have sim ilar models bee n applied s uccessf ully in thes e are nas? The f inal sec tion of this chapter will list som e suggestions for productive applications of an OT-type model to other literary questions. But th ere are already good hist orical precedents for the application of cognitiv e models to prob lems of reading and composing, and m y methodology proves to be a natu ral extension of these successful approaches. Reading or writing a hoax involves pr ocessing inform ation from varied sources\u2014including the cultural envir reader feedback\u2014and m aking judgm ents and decisi ons based on that information. I have m ore than once compared ho axing to a gam e, callin igners. Cognitiv e models focusing on hum an adaptation to the envir onment, like Vera and Sim on's Situated Action (SA) and J.R. Anderson's Ad aptive Character of Thought (ACT-R) theory, excel in m odeling gam e-playing. These theories h ave successfully taught computers how to solve puzzles lik e the Tower of Hanoi and Building Sticks. They dem onstrate how hum an psychology m ight have used com plex inform ation from the en vironm ent along with feedback from com petitors to d evelop strategic faculties. Optim ality Th eory is closely re lated to these types of cognitive m odels 351 and to Ga me Theory. Because it can ha ndle com plex inform ation input, OT can model how hoax readers m ake judgm ents a bout the world when what they read competes with what they know. It also explains how hoax writers m ake strategic decisions based on their m ental m odels of what their readers expect. OT is also similar to co gnitiv e models that have yield ed valuable insigh ts into rhetorical processes. Am ong compos ition th eoris ts, Flo wer and Hayes (1981) were the first to propos e a cogn itive model of writing. Th ey reco rded writers talking to them selves while they composed and found th at the writers oscillated between planning what they were going to write, jotting it down, revising, and comparing the revisions to original plan s. Their behavior did not match th e traditional stage m odel of com position that claim ed that write rs first planned, then wrote, then evaluated in a linear fas hion withou t recursion to earlier stages. So, Flower and Hayes developed a mode l of writing with three modules\u2014 environm ent, m emory, and process\u2014that c ould be h ierarch ically and recursively embedded within each other, thus m irroring more accurately writers ' observable behavior. David Kaufer and Brian Butler devel oped a very sim ilar model to help explain the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Since transcript s of the debates rem ain, Kauf er and Butler were able to track strategic changes in both candidates' speeches as they adapted to each other's argu ments and to the resp onses of m odel is also modular, includi ng P lans, Tactics, Events, Presentation, and Strategy. Each of t he modules is responsible for a different inform ation source, and the m odules monitor each other for changes that 352 can be incorporated in future d iscourses to be tter fit them to the kairos at hand\u2014 in this particular case, th e cam paign trail of 1858. From this analysis, Kaufer and Butler were able to dem onstra te Lincoln's superiority in the de bates as a function of his superior ability to neutralize Douglas's attacks a nd to adapt his platfor m to audience v alues. Optim ality Theory exte nds these a nalyses in a very spec ific way by structuring the m eans by which writers represent to them selves their audiences ' values. If these m odels were to be a pplied to the problem of how the hoaxers composed the hoaxes, audience expectati ons about science news and ethnoscience would for m the engine of Flower and Ha yes's Mem ory module and of Kaufer and Butler's Tactics and Strategy modules\u2014t he parts of the writing process responsible for monitoring audience feedback. My use of OT does not equate to an argum ent that reading hoaxes is biologically-determ ined behavior or that all readers m ake the s ame types of choices about hoaxes. The m odel is descrip tive, not prescriptive. It is flexible enough, as I have d emonstrated, to acc ount for m any different individual approaches to the sam e hoaxes, and for readings of differ ent hoaxes over tim e. OT sim ply enables th ick descrip tion of the interpretive pro cess, allowing f or the impact of re aders' so cio-econom ic and ethnoscientific accu lturation, and provides as an output an argum ent about comm on reading priorities that can then be compared against the rh etorical aim s of the hoaxers. The result of the applica tion of this m ethod is an evolving portrait of reade r prio rities spannin g the ca reers of these th ree autho rs. Overall, fou r general 353 trends are visible upon inspection of Ta ble 21, which compares the filters of expectations gleaned from the contem porary reactions to each of the three author's hoaxes: Table 21: C omparison o f filters of reading expec tations f rom the proje ct Expectation s of s of Tw ain's Western n of Quille's new A few re minders about the structu re of th e filters are in o rder. The filters are linear lis ts of read er exp ectations in order, right to left, of increasing strength in determ ining decisions about the trut h of the hoaxes. No single reader's interpretation of a hoax is likely to use all of the expecta tions in the filter, as readers tend to focus on two or three co mpeting expectation s, at the m ost. The filter is an abstrac tion in corpora ting th e ranking information f rom many dif ferent reade rs' dec isions. The crucial leve ls of rank in the f ilter ar e indica ted by \">>\"; if there is more than one expecta tion in a le vel, th ey are brack eted together in order 354 to indicate their equ ality of strength and l ack of com petition with each o ther in the interpretive process. A few general trend s are visib le from comparing th e filters. The reputa tion o f the author (Authority ), whether positiv e or n egativ e, re mained a powerful determ iner of reliability. The reputation of the m edium (Medium ) becam e a weaker constraint in decisions about truth in W estern journalism, which was very new and still involved with folk pr actices of tall-tale telling and practical joking. The placing of Medium in parent hesis indicates its optionality. Som e reade rs, like rival editor s, used the negativ e rep utation of the Enterpr ise as an important factor in their decisions about potential hoax stories. Other readers, accustom ed to the unreliab ility of the Enterp rise, did not use Medium in their decis ions at all; th ey jus t used th eir own \"common sense\" an d the textu al, factual expectations like Plau sibility, Popsci., and Internal Coherence. Finally, inform ation junkies like m iners and colle ctors like Cope and Baird had to weigh their desire for a scoop agai nst the fishy reputation of the paper, so Medium would still be active for them at a m id-strength level. The reaction s to De Quille's hoaxes in the 1870s , particu larly those from the reprinting papers, reveal ed that novelty and sensation (N ovelty and S ensation) were not co nsidered as reliable ind icators of scientif ic truth as they we re a few decades earlier. E astern readers, especia lly, ten ded to evin ce susp icion without further proofs of plausibility. The histor y of Plausibility and other expectations concerned with factuality is particularly interesting. Po e's readers, especially in the case of \"Von Kem pelen\" seem ed to use plausibility as a benchm ark that Poe's 355 hoax on alchem y failed to m eet. Twain a nd his rival editors, however, seem ed to feel that their m iner readers' hunger for new infor mation caused them to Plausibility and other e xpect ations of factuality . Dan De Quille, perhaps as a side-effect of his readers' devaluation of Novelty and Sensation, restored the higher ranking of factuality and plausib ility in his ho axes. Their successful reprinting history seem s to corroborat e this judgm ent he made about his readers' expectations . A final observation is that for the Western hoaxes, the presence of eyewitnesses (W itness) in the sparsely-populated territories was important for read ers to feel they had b een prov ided with a vicarious ex perien ce of a real scientific phenom enon. A few other trends are not imm ediately apparent but still important. The popular science article (Popsci.) changed ove r tim e to conform more to the form at of a regular news article, front-loading the \"who, what, when, where, why\" and foregoing the \"m ystery\" opening. This developm ent goes hand-in-hand with the suspicion of sensation appearing in the r eader reaction s to th e postbellu m hoaxes. The popular science article also beg an to place background inform ation at the end of the story instead of at the beginning, thus favoring a journalistic ra ther than a strictly narra tive struc ture. The disappearance of Foreign from the expectations of the later Western news readers reflects Twain's and De Quille's ad justment in their hoaxing to a local epistem ology based on lay eyewitness. I introduced a second tier of exp ectations, reflecting newsreading psychology, beginning with Twain's hoa xing b ecause h is commentary and the editorial reactions to his hoaxes reference it as affecting the interpretive process of 356 hoax readers. This delaye d introduction does not im ply that Poe's readers never skimm ed to get to the good parts. Howe ver, the 1860s was the era in which the news artic le was se ttling into a m ore standardized form at, enabling readers to make use of skimm ing heuristics. Finally, the Medium is in parenthesis in both Twain's an d De Quille's con texts of read ing, reflecting eviden ce from the contem porary commentary that different readerships with different agendas treated the r eputation of the Ente rprise differently. Locals tended to deactivate it because they knew the paper was unreliab le; rival edito rs tended to give it a strong negative valence; Eastern editors tended to give it a weakly negative valence, as they were suspicious of \"S agebrush\" journalism but responded to the compelling scien tific to pics of the hoaxes. Not visib le in this tab le is the expectation Entertainm ent, which deactivat es all decision s about truth and leads to read ing with suspen ded belief , similar to f iction re ading . This of course was the stance of som e readers who enjoyed the play of the hoa xes. Many readers, however, judging from their strong reactions, took the hoaxes as quite serious games with their realities, gam es with consequences. The final an d major con sequence of a rhetorical redefinition of hoaxing must now be addressed. If a hoax is not a certain kind of text, wh at is it? Exactly what kind of \"rhetorical exchange\" is a hoax, and what \"symbolic action\" did it accom plish in its reading community ? Th ough these questions have been answered on a very loca l scale for each author, this pro ject\u2014 definition al as it is\u2014 begs for at least a lim ited historical generalization. A forty-five year span of reading and cultural developm ent in Am erican (1835 to 1880) in itially seem s too 357 much to comprehend with any one coherent , helpful statement. However, if we consider some sim ilarities in th e hoaxe rs' practices o ver th is tim e, a few productive patterns em erge. 2. S IMILARITIES AMONG POE'S, TWAIN 'S, AND DE QUILLE 'S HO AXING PRACTI CES An obvious common de nominator in the scientific m edia hoaxing of Poe, Twain, and De Quille is tha t they all see med to derive an a lmost gle eful enjoym ent from the hoax's capa city to cre ate scientif ic realities f or readers and thus to demonstra te cre ative au thority over tho se reader s. Poe's lette r to Evert Duykinck about \"Von umpets the \"quiz\" as the \"first deliberate literary attem pt of the kind on record\" and states that \"n ine p ersons ou t of ten\" will have their per ception of the Gold Rush alte red by the hoax (Poe 319). His eagerness for his reader s to recognize the genius behind the \"Balloon-Hoax\" reportedly led to a theatrical and public exposure of the hoax on the steps of the New York S un's publishing house (F alk 48). Twain seem ed no less pleased that his enem y Sewall, th e coroner who m he razzed with \"Petrified Man,\" was being plagued with requests for verification by r eaders: \"I could not have gotten m ore real enjoyment out of hi m without killing him ,\" Twain wrote (C lemens 860). And De Quille's comments on the backs of the letters sent him by professors inquiring after his zoological \"discoveri es\"\u2014 the 'Highland Alliga tor.'\"\u2014a re trium phant brags like no tches on a rifle barrel. In addition to the sheer pleasure of creation and establishing creative author ity ov er reade rs, all th ree wr iters seem ed to value the hoax's a bility to 358 indirectly implem ent program s of social control\u2014not just the dem onstration of authority ov er readers, but an actual attem pt to change readers' so cial behavior. Poe clearly had a so cial agenda with his hoaxes\u2014chastising readers for prom oting scien tists o ver ar tists and substitu ting is own im aginative sc ience f or professionalized Bacon ian science. Twai n wis hed to \"edu cate\" his readers to reject scientific and po litica l illus ion for a kind of self-dete rmination tha t refused to extend its elf imperialistic ally ove r other peoples. De Quille wished to m aintain his considerable control ove r the construc tion of the id ea of the W est and to defend that idea from Eastern commercial appropriation. A final and very telling sim ilarity in the hoaxers' p ractices is th eir absorption with m echanics. Two o f Poe' s four hoaxes construct m achines. Many of his writings, esp ecially \"Maelzel's Chess-Pl ayer\" and \"The Gold-Bug,\" perform a strong correspondence between th e construction of discourse and the engineering of m achinery. Twain's hoaxe s are not about machines, but m uch of his other \"scientific\" fi ction\u2014particularly A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court , An American Claim ant, and 3,000 Years Am ong the Microbes \u2014 are actually about technology and m echanics. In addition, his partnership in the Paige typesetter, his inventions, and hi s installation of te lephones and other gadgets in his own hom e are just a few instances of a well-docum ented lifelong fascination with m achines. These preoccupations with creation, authority, social control, and mechanics suggest that the rhetoric of the nineteenth century scientific m edia hoax m ay have operated by analogy to the m achines that surrounded and 359 fascinated Am ericans during this tim e. This conclusion receives corroboration from the hoax's conditions of production, from contemporary comm entary connecting textuality and m echanism , and from current historical analyses of machines and cultu re in nineteenth-century Am erica. 3. T HE HOAX AS A MACHI NE As we have already seen in com paring the hoa x to the tall tale, the ho ax contains elem ents that are strikingly industrial when compared to its oral predece ssors . The hoax relied on the machine-a ge ins titutio ns: the communicative distance of pr int technologies, a m ass distribution network, and an industrial mode of authorship that encouraged anonym ity as a m eans of effacing the individual and strengthening the per ception of the institutiona l. Exam ining the conditions of production of the first media hoaxes reveal that the hoax is indeed a m achine-age g enre. Mo st early hoaxes or m edia satir es in Britain, like Gullive r's Travels, Robinson Crusoe, or \"A Modest Propo sal,\" all date f rom a time after the Industrial Re volution. In fact, the Oxford English Dictiona ry, second edition, claim s the earliest the word \"hoax\" appears as either a noun or a verb in print is in 1796 in Grose's Diction ary; m ost other usag es are m id- nineteenth century. Miles Orvell argues in The Real Thing that two prim ary conditions of the Industrial R evolution made fa kery possible if not inevit able: first, m achines cheaply produced thousands of near-perf ect copies of goods, riveting the value of mechanis m and fascim ile deeply in the public consciousness; secondly, a boom ing industrial econom y replaced trans actions with trusted individuals with 360 repeated transactions with strangers, thus shifting public trust from personal ethos to gener al tem plates or schem ata for transactions, a focus on for m rather than content (Orvell xvii). Hoaxes were a sp ecial rhetorical m echanism for exploiting public trust in f orm and f acsim ile in order to dis play its in stability. As such, they were a ttractive to any w riter who w ished to d raw the c ritical pub lic eye to key \"cogs\" in the industrial work ings of Am erica like businesses, the governm ent, and professionalized science. Com paring discourses to m achines becam e a reflex in the thought of so me of Am erica's m ost prominent philosophers and writers. One of the m ost famous instances of this connection is discussed by Leo Marx in The Machine in the Garden . Ralph W aldo Em erson said by just looking at the workings of a steam - engine, he could read as though from a text the industrial progress the m achine was engaged to produce; through its ge ars and pistons, it both announced and interpreted itself as a messenger of pr ogress for the viewer (Marx 236). Henry Adams in the \"Dyna mo and the Virgin\" chapter of The Education of Henry Adams figures the social discourses of his era as an enormous, sublim e engine spinning almost out of contro l. And Mark Twain trea ts his com posing abilitie s as mechanical potential w hen he writes hi s brother Orion, \"...for the talent is a mighty engine when supplied with the steam of education \u2014which I have not got, & so its pis tons & cylinders & shaf ts move feebly & for a holiday show are useless for any good purpose\" (Clem ens 323) . It is clear that m echanism , especially the m echanics of the steam presses that prod uced texts, becam e obvious m etonym s for the production of discourse. 361 This m echanical m etonym y brought with it a fear of runaw ay effects that could outpace the intentions of the creator of the discourse or m achine. Em erson recorded these fears applied to technol ogy and imperialism in his \"Ode, Inscribed to W illiam H. Channing\" when he wrote, \"Things are in the saddle and ride mankind.\" Henry Adam s expressed very sim ilar fears in a letter in 1862: \"Man has m ounte d science, and is now run away with. I firm ly believe that before many centuries m ore, science will b e the m aster of m an\" (Adams Letters 290). These fears of snowballing effects, transf erred to rhetoric, becom e worries about mass production and the decline of quality in litera ture. Poe him self, in his \"broad-axe\" criticism , repeatedly conde mned the Am erican publishing industry for literally manufacturing \"a pseu do-publ ic-opinion by wholesale, \" aim ed at puffing Americ an liter ature f or strictly com mercial pur poses (Tho mas and Jackson 305). He argued this \"puffery \" was destroying the very literature it sought to \"elevate\" (Thom as and Jackson 514). These connection s between texts and m achines were more than jus t abstractions. They becam e ingrained at a very basic lev el of ontology, as readers came increasingly to as sociate read ing and writing with pr inting, and lite rature with pr inted texts. Rec ently, scholars have discovered even deeper influences between the rhetoric of science texts and the technologies that both produced and justified them. Elizabeth Tebeaux, in he r study of Renaissance technical m anuals, found that authors often established the ut ility of these m anuals by titling them with the nam es of contem porary technologi es that readers knew and trusted on a daily bas is. So, a treatis e on m ilitary maneuvers was called The Milita ry Garden , 362 and two healing m anuals were titled The Castle of Helth and The Myrour or Glasse of helth (Tebeaux 84). These m etaphors argued that the text was not just a text, but actually a technology or m echanis m for im proving the quality of life. Likewise, the nineteenth-century wr iters who com pared discourses to machines were not invoking an abstrac tion but were constructing a concrete metonym y to a very par ticula r sort of machinery f amiliar to their r eaders: \"gears - and-girders\" technology, in Cecilia Tichi's terminology. In Shifting Gears Tichi defines gears-and-girders technology as m achines that visibly transform energy, e.g. coal to steam , and that encourage their viewers to im agine them selves as co- engineers by laying the stru cture and workin gs of the mechanism bare to the novice eye, fostering a sort of \"Oh, so that's how it works,\" gestalt sim ilar fashion: it transform ed readers' assum ptions about science into an embarrassed awareness o f the instability of those assum ptions, and it did this prec isely by revealing the structure of those assumptions to the reader. Through this process, the hoax made its read ers co-engin eers; it im plica ted th em in construc ting th e problem (professionalized science taking ove r Am erican s ociety ) that drove th e hoax in the f irst place. The ability of the hoax to stand in fo r a so cial problem and transfer agency for that problem to its re ader/viewer m akes it a \"hybrid \" in Bruno Latour's theory of the relation of science to society as outlined in W e Have Never Been Modern . According to Latou r, all techn ologies , including popular science articles, instantiate the connectivity between Nature and Societ y, a dichotom y that the 363 project of modernity h as futilely tried to create and m aintain th rough analytical critic ism. Latour argu es that hyb rids are the central iron y of a modern world view, becau se the harder we try to se gregate the hum an and non-hum an elem ents of our world, the m ore connectivity we cr eate between th e two in the form of technologies to do our s cience, econom ic and political alliances to regulate our societies, and texts to cl arify our epistem ological pos itions (12). Technologies, econom ies, polities, and texts are all hybrid s. The popular science article is an archetypal hybrid, as it is a text writt en by hum ans that nevertheless conveys, supposedly transparently, a non-hum an or transcendent truth about the world. A scientific hoax, then, can be viewed as a sort of m eta-hybrid. It is a technology whose function is to call attention to th e hybridity of the scie ntific article; it accom plishes this function by forcing readers to confront their dep endence on science news, to acknowledge the ways in which hybrids (science news articles) are subs tituting them selves for social unders tanding of and judgm ent about the natural world. A m echanical m odel of hoaxing is therefore both imm anent from the contem porary cultu re of Poe, Twain, and De Quille and co rroborated b y recen t analyses of the relationships between m achines and people in the m odern era. As with any other m odel, it carries conseque nces for the ho axes s tudied in this projec t. Fir st, the idea of the hoax as a m achine im plies that the hoaxes we have exam ined were engineered with specific input and functions in m ind. Indeed, thi s is the case, as the h oaxers gau ged th eir readers ' exp ectations and then constructed \u2014via word choice, form at, and argum entation \u2014a mechanism that 364 satisfied these expectations and produced belief as an outcom e. By planting clues or by exposing their m achinations extratextu ally, the authors were able to use the machine of the hoax itself as a lesson. Readers were able to look back at the text/m achine and see exactly the proce sses by which their assum ptions were exploited to secure their belief. Expect ations were both the motivating principle for the construction of the hoax and its fuel. The notion of \"fuel\" surfaces anoth er point of fit between the rhetorical approach taken toward hoaxing in this pro ject and m echanics: bo th hav e to be in motion to work. Considered alone and inoperative, m achines and hoaxes are mere artifacts of axles, cogs, or words. They have to be in action to be them selves, since both m achines and hoaxes are the sum of their functions. This fact helps illustrate again why a hoax is no longer a hoax once it is removed by time or space from its origin al publication con text. Both a m achine like an old combine and a hoax lik e \"M. Valdem ar\" lose th eir significance when viewed in a state of inactivity and remove d from the contexts of th eir original operation\u2014say in a junkyard, or in a sc ience fiction anthology. Finally, the notion of a hoax as a m achine helps illum inate the experim ental \"tinkering\" that all authors ap peared to do with the ir hoaxing over tim e. Each writer learned from a certain hoaxing experience what had worked, and what did not, and after this an alysis adjusted his rhetoric to produce a more succes sful resu lt the next tim e. Poe recorded a great deal of th is process for us in his writings about Locke's \"Moon Hoax\" and \"Hans Phaall\"; certainly he produced a much m ore successful hoax the next tim e around with the \"Balloon- 365 Hoax.\" Twain provided us with a negative por trait of this tinkering proce ss, as he dram atized all of the reasons h is \"satires \" failed and ye t continued to persis t in those rheto rical practices that coerced be lief from readers. De Quille did no t leave overt commentary on his revising of his hoaxing pr actices, but as we have seen, he responded to the success of th e \"Solar Ar mor\" sequel by constructing numerous sequels for his rem aining hoaxes, thus solidifying his authority as an expert witne ss to the W est while making an im plicit argument for the tr uth of his hoaxes via their pers istence through tim e. Viewing th e scien tific media hoa x as a rhetorical and psychological machine fits well with th e evidence from this study and argues for a feedback loop of influence betw een salient tec hnologies in a reading culture and the structuring of rhetorical exchanges within that culture. If as Elizabe th Eisenstein and W alter Ong argue, print technology has a ffected (but not determ ined) readers' cognitive organization and function over th e last four hundred years, and if as Kathleen Welch argues, the internet has affected the design of books, docum ents, and argum ents in the classroom , it seem s reasonable to suggest that a salient technology like the gears-and-girder s-type m achine could catalyze the developm ent of a new rhetorical genre. Being tied to a particular type of technology keeps the hoax/m achine correspondence lim ited locally and temporally, so these claim s cannot be ge neralized to all times and places where hoaxing occ urs. I will argue shor tly, howev er, with respec t to the r ecent Sokal hoax, that the m echanic s of the scientif ic media hoax have evolved over the last century to mim ic infor mation technology instead of gears-and-girders technology. 366 4. E XTENSIONS OF PRO JECT METH ODOL OGY TO OTHE R DISCIPLI NARY PROBLEMS I developed a new m ethodology f or recuperating reader expectations during this project in order to account fo r the m any extratextual dim ensions of the historical reading of hoaxes. New Hi storicist and Rhetorical-Herm eneutical methods helped reconstruct the reader e xpectations from archival sources, and then Optimality Theory provided a basis for m odeling their interaction and competition in the inte rpretive process. Beca use of the potential inf initud e of expectations that readers can b ring to bear on th e rea ding p rocess, I restric ted the field of inquiry to cons ider only genre expectati ons and ethnoscientific expectations that contributed to decisions about the truth-value of the hoaxes. Required and validated by the very nature of the hoax\u2014which, as a parasitic genre, operates on reader assum ptions about other genres\u2014this new method \"bought\" us a way of analyzi ng the hoaxes that m oved be yond the habitual confusion of generic terminology in hoax criticis m (hoax/parody/satire/burlesque/science fic tion) and the tendency to use hoaxes to psychoanalyze their authors. The expect ation-based m ethod allowed us to bring with scien ce in nineteenth-cen tury erica into contact with the in terpretive pro cess as a sou rce of newsreading expectat ions. In addition, it helped us identify key cu ltural and generic expectations that encourag ed readers to believe in scientific m edia hoaxes, and it provided us with a langua ge to talk about why som e of these hoaxes accom plished their purpose better than others. Because reader expectations about science and science n ews were also the targ et of these ho axes' attack s, we were also prepared to discuss particu lar reader 367 expectations that authors identified thr ough their hoaxing projects as dangerous or in need of revision, and this helped en rich our understanding of these authors' social projects. Does this methodology, desi gned specifically for dea ling with the rhetoric of hoaxing, have extensions outside of this project? An expectation-based methodology is useful in any interpretive context where readers and writers m ust coordinate their activ ity based on guesses about each other's world-views, needs, and desires. In this secti on I will m ake three specific applications of the pro ject method to problem s in genre studies, historic al rhetorical analys is, and rhetoric of science. 4.1 Genre studies Aside from an obvious extension to the analysis of other parasitic genres, like parody and satire, there is a less obvi ous but still pressing problem in genre studies that m y method can help address. In the text-lingui stic end of genre studies, th ere is curren tly an active deba te about textual organization above senten ce the \"p aragra ph\" often co-occurs with but does not necessarily predict larger units of thought, researchers have becom e interested instead in the organizing notions of \"dis course mode\" and \"genre.\" C arlota S. Smith's new book, forthcom ing from Oxford , argues for the m ode as the next important unit of organization in text s, and she prov ides evid ence from gramm atical functions like as pect and topicalizat ion that help di stinguish between different m odes of disco urse like narrat ion and d escrip tion. Genre, acco rding to this school of thought, is a global organizing feature of discourse that reflects 368 readers' and writers' pu rposes in creati ng a ther than strictly pragm atic-lingui stics choices in constructing a discourse (Clark 62); a single genre can com bine any num ber of di scourse m odes to achieve its author's purposes. Monika Flu dernik in h er recen t article for Style sum s up just how complicated the problem of text typology ha s becom e over the last twenty years. Researchers have used parts of theori es presented by Seymour Chatm an, Robert Longacre, and Ja mes Kinneavy, among others, to posit m any different levels of textual org anization, som e cognitiv ely m otivated, so me psychologically motivated, som e textually m otivated. Fludernik's own typology recognizes a generic level she calls ge nres/text types and a lowe r tier she calls discourse modes; these term s correspond roughly to the ones em ployed by Carlota Sm ith. However, a m ajor dif ficulty with a ll of these sc hemata is th at, while the y make use of rhetorical research, like Longacre's and Kinneavy's, they tend to strip it of its rhetorical context. Judg ments about levels of text organization becom e reflection s of research ers' o wn academ ic read ings o f the texts a s trained experts. In put from real readers/listen ers would greatly enrich this project and potentially clear up the confus ing taxonom ies to som e degr ee. Just as Rolf Zwaan observed the differences in two groups of readers reading the sam e text under differing generic labels (news vs. fiction) , reader responses to certain discourse modes under different generic labels coul d help clarify the process by which readers reco gnize text ual organization. 369 From studying Twain's hoaxing, we rec ognized that reader expectations occur at m any levels, som e of which interact, and som e of whi ch operate independently. Progression and comprehens ion, for example, are con straints on reading at a stage before interpretiv e or evaluative processes even begin; they decide wha t information gets adm itted to the inte rpretive process. There a re many other levels of expectations, too. In \"Op timality Theory and Re-Reading 'The Garde n of the Forking Paths, '\" I ar gue for at least five levels of reading expectations or constraints: 1. Basic pragm atic expectations like 2. maxims operate here, as does J.L. Austin's theory of speech act recognition a nd coordination. 3. Generic exp ectations lik e the Popsci. criteria developed in this project. 4. Psychological m eta-constraints on the reading activity like progression vs. comprehension. 5. Sociolinguistic constraints like the ef fect of the g endering of the reader o n his/her interpretive process. Reader exp ectations s tratify into th ese different levels or arenas of play accord ing to persis tent patterns of in teraction an d com petitio n: som e expecta tions are cons tantly in con test with each othe r in cer tain inte rpretive de cisions while others are irrelevant to those decisions. Even when all levels are operative during reading, their stratification could provide helpful clue s to lev els of textua l organization. Reader-response or read -aloud protocol m ethods focused on 370 eliciting ex pecta tions c ould provide an independent m eans of distinguishing discours e mode from genre acco rding to wh ich expectations are in teracting when readers are reading a descri ptive paragraph, for exam ple, as opposed to when they are try ing to recon cile w hat they have read with the generi c purposes of the text as a whole. Since genre is constitu ted by expectations and conventions, th e method developed in this project prom ises a new leve l of insi ght into generic class ificatio n. 4.2 Historical rhetorical analysis The m ost immediately obvious applic ation of the project m ethodology to histor ical rhetorical ana lysis is to an area skir ted by this analysis\u2014the relationship of gender to reading expectations. Since Janice Radway's ground-breaking ethnography of wom en reading romance in 1987, critics of hi storical wom en's fiction in Am erican have begun to fo cus on records of wom en reading and responding to fiction as a way of accoun ting for the inf luence of gender on reading in Am erica. Barbara Sicher man's case study of the wom en of the Hamilton fam ily in the late 1800s found evidence in reading journals that the Hamilton daughters developed a powerful id eal of fe male heroism from reading Victorian novels and histories. Si cherm an focused on reading \"codes\" or practices developed in the \"interpretive community\" of the fam ily unit, although she does no t elabo rate o n what thes e \"codes \" were or how they were inculcated. A productive extension of Sicherm an's cas e study would apply an expectation- based m ethodology to a wider community of readers\u2014say newsreaders in New York, or a reading group responding to a certain text by a fem ale author. There 371 are two angles that could be feasibly pursued with this m ethod. First, contem porary reader respons es to a popular novel by a wom an, like Hope Leslie by Catharine Maria Sedgwick, could be compared to a contem porary m ale- authored novel on a si milar subject, like Jam Fenimore Cooper's within the two stor ies (violence, p ortray al of Native Am ericans, portrayal of wom en, etc.) could index differing filters of expectat ions that were applied to wom en's writing and m en's writing ; these differing filters wo uld suggest differing cultural s tandards for wom en's and m en's literary behavior. On the other hand, si milar rea ctions to these elem ents m ight suggest that generi c conventions or shared experiences of the Revolutionary m ilieu operated more powerf ully than g ender in de termining reading expectations. A second approach to the problem of historical reading and gender would be to compare contem porary reactions to the sam e text by both m en and wom en to se e if differing filters could be construc ted ac cording to g ender o f the reader\u2014or, on the other hand, if r eading expectations were acquired in common, contrary to the opinions of m any current fe minist scholars who believe that interpretation always va ries as a function of read er gender. Com bining both angles of expectation-based inquiry woul d provide a portrait of gendered reading in Am erica that re lied on the wo rds of the readers them selves rather than on anachronistic judgm ents by literar y critics long rem oved from the kairos of the origin al reading events. This m ethod doe s not construct an objective portrait of gender and reading but rather writes a situ ated lo cal history o f it. 372 4.3 Rhetoric of science Social historians of science who treat experim ental procedures as political textual cons tructions h ave lately co me unde r legitim ate fire from scientists in the wake of the Sokal affair. The level of expert scien tific kn owledge uired to revents all b ut a f ew scientif ically train ed rhetoricians and historians from produc ing responsible histories of the m. However, the texts that scientists them selves produce to explain their m otivations and findings to the public are another m atter. Not m erely reports of objective natural facts, these tex ts are also po litical docum ents whose warrants require exposure and analysis by soci al historians and rhetoric ians of science. This project is all the m ore urgent in the f ace of a crisis in the pu blic funding of both the arts and sciences that has both gr oups scrambling for a lternative m eans of support\u2014particularly privat e, corporate support. Scientific g rant writing , aim ed at both public and p rivate grantin g institutions, is the prim ary way in whic h the s ciences support them selves. W riting grants su ccessfully requ ires not only experien ce with the generic conventions of the practice but also a pol itical awareness of the values and de sires of the granting institutions. Studies of gr ant-writin g via analys is of successive drafts for changes in self-presentation and othe r rhetorical functions have already been conducted by researchers like Greg M yers. Since gran t writers must project f or them selves the reading expectations of th eir adjudicators, the methodol ogy of this project can add a new dim ension to work on grant propos als by providing ways to m easure the achievem ent of expertise in terms of acquiring a filter of grant-writing 373 expectations that m ore and m ore closely matches the f ilter of reading ex pecta tions used by adjudicators. Two studies are feasible. The first, a co mparative synchronic study, would com pare the gran t-writing processes of novice and expert gran t writers. By conducting think- aloud p rotoco ls with each writer as s/he plans and writes the grant pr oposal, a filter of expect ations operative in the composing process could be constructed. These expectations could then be compared to see if there were substantive differences between the novices' and the experts' projected model of thei r review ers' expectations. A second diachronic study could be conducted with a few novice grant writers who, over a period of ten to fifteen year s, become experts in writi ng grants. The changes in their pro jections of their readers' ex pecta tions over tim e could be com pared with the results o f the synch ronic s tudy to pr ovide a key not only to the cogn itive and rhetorica l processes of accultu ration in th e genre of grant writing but als o to the political acculturation of the scientists as they seek support for their endeavors among public and private readerships. The groundwork for studies of reader e xpectations in scientific rhetoric has already been laid. In \"A Stu dy in Rheto rical Readin g,\" Davida Charney compared the reading behavior of novice and expert biologists. Although her project was not fra med in term s of r eading expectations, per se, she found a significant difference in the reading behavi or of the two groups, particularly in terms of genre/text structure and global m eta-comm entary: the expert scientists made betwe en two and four tim es as m any of these types of comm ents as novices. This outcom e seems to indicate experts' heightened ability to think about and 374 verbalize communal expectati ons of genre. Lester Fa igley's study of expert and novice revisers also indicated a greater sens itivity to m acrostruc tural elem ents and genre-related goals by the experts. My proposed studies would help illum inate the process by which expert writers\u2014gr ant-proposal-writing experts, in this case\u2014acqu ire their rhetorical expertise. Com positio n resea rchers recogn ize that g reater awareness o f both exper t strategies and reader e xpectations produces more succes sful writing. Lorraine Higgins found that exposing novices to expe rt research strategies im proved the quality of the novice writing. Karen Schriv er found th at teaching novices awareness of reader goals and desires im proved their writing as well. These studies suggest a possible a pplication of m y proposed st udies in technical writing classroom s. Expert knowledge m ay be tran sferable to novices to som e degree via explicit statem ents of reader expecta tions; th e results of my studies m ight then be used to accelerate the accultu ration o f novi ce scientist writers to th e gran t-writing process. 5. C ONCL USION The project m ethod ha s prom ising applications beyond its immediate context of developm ent. Reader expecta tions r epresen t cognitiv e, factors influe ncing the reading experi ence; thus, the m ethod continues to explode inherited Rom antic conceptions of reading as a solitary and individual act between a m ind and a text. In this study of hoaxing we have seen that a hoax is not a person being tricked by a text but instead a complex and coordinated social project in which cu rrent events, cultu rally-inh erited ideas, 375 celebrities, learned conventions of read ing, personal agendas, m edia, and the projected assum ptions of other readers all shap e public d ecisions abo ut what counts as the truth. Hoaxing both reifies and responds to l ack\u2014gaps and inequities in status, education, and group mem bership. These gaps did not vanish with Victorian scienc e; they have m erely shif ted in size and orientation as th e arts and sciences have endured two W orld W ars, a Cold W ar, and most recen tly, the Scien ce Wars. In m any wa ys, Poe and Twain lost the fight to keep professional scientists from becom ing Am erica's new oracles. Barry Ba rnes claim s that science is our new metaphor for com prehending both our physical a nd social realities. \"F or us,\" he writes in his study Scientific K nowledge and Sociological Theory , \"natural order is a m odel for understanding social order\" (2). Yet even within th is ne w order, hoa xing rem ains a first-rate strategy of comeuppanc e, a m eans of redressing power imbalances between the public images of t he arts and science through th e mass m edia. Since the social stakes have chang ed since th e nineteenth -centu ry ho axes, th e mechanic s of the hoa x have m orphed to reflect current technologi es and address current power struggles. The recen t Sokal hoax is the p erfect site to ex amine the evolution of scien tific media hoaxing, since it is in m any cases the inverse of the hoaxes we have studied\u2014a scientist hoaxing literary crit ics on the grounds that they are trying to recap ture th e righ t to determ ine what count s as truth (o r the ve ry status of truth itself) for the Am erican public. This hoax and its re ception are analy zed in the Epilogue. 376 Epilogue: The Sok al Hoax In 1996 Alan Sokal, a particle phys icist at NYU, subm itted an article to the prestigious cultural st udies journal Social Text entitled \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transform ative Herm eneutics of Quantum Gravity.\" Although the editors requested that Sokal cut parts of the article, including 19 pages of citations, in th e end they accep ted it unchanged for inclusion in their \"Science Wars\" issu e, which purposed to exam ine the resistan ce of scientists to social constructivism . Strong social c onstructivism holds, aft er Michel Foucault, that \"na ture\" itself is a social cons truction f raught with politics. The \"Scienc e Wars\" issue fram ed itself as social cons tructivists' response to Paul Gross and Norman Le vitt's 1994 book Higher Superstition , which criticiz ed the sloppy appropriation of scientific concepts a nd term inology by cultural studies scholars. On the same day that the \"Science W ars\" issu e of Social Text cam e out, Alan Sokal published a com panion article in Lingua Franca explaining that his Social T ext article was a hoax. So kal described it as an experim ent: \" Would a leading Nor th Am erican journa l of cultu ral stu dies\u2014whos e editorial c ollective includes such lum inaries as Fredri c Jam eson and Andrew Ross\u2014publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the edito rs' ideo ecam e an industry ov ernight. Th e editors of Social Tex t retor ted that they had n ot really be en fooled af ter all, that they had rea d Sokal's article as an interestin g \"docum ent\" of resi stance by scientists to cultural studies. That statem ent prom pted a barrage of cr iticism . Scholars and lay people wrote into news media and academ ic journals alike voicing both support and disdain of Sokal's project, both criticism and suppor t for cultural studies. The argum ent quickly exp loded to the internet and the m ass m edia and becam e the topic of univers ity f orums and journa l issu es; sim ilarly, the issue s raised by Sokal's origin al hoa x were lost in a f ree-for-all about the postm odern Left, the quality of colleg e education, the role of women and non -Western Others in the \"Science Wars,\" and the very issue of truth\u2014if there were any such thing in th e first place, and if there were, was science its only trustworthy oracle? Reaction to the hoax has received mo re scholarly scrutiny than the hoax itself. Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Seco r cogently dissected the warrants of Stanley Fish's condescending dressing-dow n of Sokal in the New York Ti mes. The editors of Lingua Franca have published an entire volum e of reactions to the Sokal hoax, and the reactions to those reac tions, both in the dom estic and foreign media. The issues of the \"Scien ce W ars\" in Am erica, the and the social constru ctivist appr oach to science studies have all been commented upon by em inently qualifie d scholars in both the sciences and arts. W hat this project can contribute to the Sok al affair is a n descrip tion of how the hoax functioned in its or iginal co ntext and why it f unctio ned dif ferently th an, say, a critical article on the sam e topic or an expos\u00e9-style book like Gross and 378 Levitt's. A n analysis of the language used to describe the hoax in the reactions to it can also illum inate how scientif ic m edia hoaxing has changed since the nineteenth century (and how it has rem ained the sam e). Sokal's hoax observed m any of the prin ciples of hoaxing left over from the nine teenth-cen tury s cientif ic media hoaxe s. It conform ed to the form at of the academ ic cultural stud ies article by em ploying heavy citing. It appealed to expert authority in those citations by quoting founding schol ars in the cultural studies move ment, like Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Stanley Aronowitz. It employed jargon from the field, as in the following exam ple: \"Natural scientists...cling to the dogm a imposed by the long post-Enlightenm ent hegem ony over the Western intellectual ou tlook\" (217). Significantly, it also included s cientif ic ja rgon like \"Planck-scale\" and \" open strings\" that was unfamiliar to cultur al studies schola rs, just a s Poe and Locke laid an im penetr able veneer of astronom ical jargon over their hoa xes in order to give them an air of scien tific au thority. The scientific jargon co nstitu ted So kal's most interes ting trick and a key point for our discussion of the effects of his hoax: this trick was a ve rsion of De Quille 's \"E mperor's New Clothes\" appeal. Fascina tingly, many of the m edia reactions to the hoax (and S okal's own revela tion of it) ref erenced exa ctly this folk tale\u2014but from the perspective of the bystanders who watch the em peror parade by them in his birthday suit. Ma ny critic s felt cultur al studies ha d finally been \"exposed\" by Sokal's hoax for the inte llectual charade and waste of taxpayer money that it really was. However, ther e is another angle to the \"Em peror's New 379 Clothes\" s tory, the ang le De Quille also ex ploited in his ho axing, and that is th e tailors' point of view. S okal, as the canny ta ilor, casts the edito rs of Social Text in the em peror's role. U nwilling to adm it to anyo ne that they really d id not know enough about science to judge the m erits of Sokal's quantum mechanical argum ent, they publish ed his article anyway because it was better to risk fall-o ut than to lose the chance to have a \"real\" scientist supporting cultural studies (Sokal 144). The editors' own statem ents corroborat e this reading to som e extent. In their defense of their acceptanc e of Sokal's article, then claim ed that because they \"try to k eep abreast o f cultural studies ,\" they viewed So kal's contribution as \"unusual,\" com ing from a natural scientis t, and therefore \"worth encouraging\" (Robbins 55). This focus on m aintaini ng face within a pa rticular comm unity atten tion from fa cts a nd deta ils, and tha t is exactly the same psychological respon se De Quille counted on in his read ers when he employed his \"anyone who knows anything knows X\" strate gy for securing belief in his hoaxes. Another fam iliar feature of Sokal's hoax is the public no toriety it created for hi m as a counter-cultural Leftist fighting, in the view of som e, the excesses of the culture-studies Left and, in the view of others, the entire bloated edifice of the academ ic hum anities. There is a t leas t som e evidence that th is no toriety was Sokal's central goal in constr ucting e is the ence of the hoax itself. In the L ingua Franca piece Sokal defended at tacks on his ethics by saying he chose \"satire\" as a weap on because it was \"an attack that co uld not be brushed off.\" The very reason it cannot be brushed off is because a hoax constructs a Barnum esque public spectacle beyond the control of its victim s: the 380 spectacle of a victorious, notorious expert versus losing dupes. If Sokal had not intended to construct this ethos for him self, he would have worked through conventional channels to voice his criticism s of the Social Text crowd directly in an acad emic essay. Further ev idence of Sokal's desire for n otoriety co mes from Sokal's active role in pe rpetuating the public life of the hoax. He wrote hundreds of emails in its wake, attended pub lic forum s on it, wro te response p ieces for nationa l and internationa l journ als. All in all this cam paign cost him a three-y ear black hole in the \"Publications\" section of his physics CV. In 1998 when it appeared the hubbub was going to die dow n, he published a book with European physicist Jean Bricm ont called Les Imposture s Intellec tuelles, in which he extended argum ents about the inadequacy of F rench postmodernist critiques of science that he had begun m aking during the reaction to his hoax. Finally, there is the evidence of the evolving scope of Soka l's argum ents over tim e. He began, as in Lingua Franca , insisting he only had a sm all \"target\" in m ind with the hoax, the edito rs of Social Text . But as reader reaction expanded his role and his position, crediting him with nothing short of an atta ck on culture stud ies as a who le for its role in dim inishing the public reputation of American scien ce, Sokal stepped into these larger and larger shoes with such alac rity that it seem ed clear that this is where he intended to go with his hoax in th e first place. In a public lecture given at a New York University forum just a few m onths after the hoax was published, Sokal unveiled this expanded vision: Social Te xt is no t my enem y, nor is it m y main intellectu al target.... R ather, m y goal is to defend what one m ight call a scientific 381 worldview -- defined broadly as a respect for evidence and logic, and for the incess ant confrontation of theories with the real world ; in short, for reasoned argum ent over wishful th inking, superstition and dem agoguery. And m y motives for trying to defe nd these old-fashioned ideas are basica lly political . I'm worried abo ut trends in the Am erican Left -- particularly here in acad emia -- that at a m inimum divert us from the tas k of for mulating a progressive soci al critique, by leading sm art and comm itted people in to trendy but u ltimately empty intellectual fashio ns, and that can in fact undermine the prospects for such a critique, by prom oting subjectivist and relativist philosophies that in my view are inconsistent with producing a realistic analysis of society that we and our fellow citizens will find com pelling. (\"Plea\") It seem s clear from these comm ents that So kal's u ltimate goal was a broad intellectual stance, and th e hoax genre afforded him the id eal pub lic stage on which to tak e it. As counter-evidence fo r these claim s about Sokal's inten tionality with respect to the construction of his public ethos , one m ight observe that Sokal initially trie d to distan ce himself from the notoriety the hoax constructed for hi m and the aspersions it cast on him ethi cally. As m entioned above, his Lingua Franca revelation eschews the term \"hoax\" altogether. In later commentary, however, in cluding th e New York University forum speech excerpted above, he began owning his original article as a hoax, and this shift in term inology coincid ed with his acceptance of a larger public role as a spokesperso n for the 382 natura l sciences aga inst the incur sion of cultural studies. It rem ains to b e seen if the eth ics of the hoax will inf ect Sokal's reputa tion as an academ ic, as in the cas e of Poe and Twain, or if , as in De Quille 's cas e, Sokal's p hysics is a separa te enough endeavor from his social comm entary that his scientific reputation will remain unsullied am ong his peers. Cert ainly, hu manists like Stanley Fish have argued that Sokal's scientific eth ics are suspect because of his m edia ethics. But Fahnestock and Secor countered Fish by arguing that Sokal's projects are ethic ally as well as topic ally sepa rate. Further, since Sokal attacked m embers of a rival field, his reputation a mong particle physicists and other scientists m ay remain unsullied or m ay perhaps be strength ened becau se these colleagues are \"on his side.\"27 The test of time, as always, will de termine Sokal's historica l reputation as a scientist. Setting thes e familiar f eatures of Sokal's ho ax aside\u2014its co nstruc tion from the nineteenth -century hoaxes. First, Sokal is a scientist cr eating a literary hoax f or cultural studies scho lars, which is an of the nineteenth-century sc ientific m edia hoax dynam ic. Now, it is our scientists, not our artists, who feel thei r social prestige is at s take. Hoaxes remain a subversive strategy for taking th e stuffing out of newly prom inent people or institutions. The commentary in the Soka l affair figures literary scholars a s the pretend ers to the throne whom scientists are desperately trying to disinherit. This 27 I am indebted to Davida Charney for this in sight. For a contrasting case of peer reaction to scientis ts creating controversy in th eir own field, see Charney's \"A Study in Rhetorical R eading: How E volutionists Read ' The Spandrels of San Marco.' \" 383 reactionary rhetoric is backed up by econom ic metaphors in the reactions to the hoax. The issue of the public funding of science keeps coming up: some critics suggest Sokal and his fellow physicists are sniffing around for a new enem y after the Cold War and the coll apse of the defense indus try (Latour 124); others suggest th at Sokal is bitter because cultu ral stud ies and scien ce studies are starting to dam pen the Am erican enthusiasm for science\u2014an enthusiasm based on science's sp ectacu lar perform ances for Am erica in the W orld W ars and the Cold War (Robbins 58 ). B oth of these vi ews paint Sokal and his colleagues as threa tened b y rsion of cultu ies\u2014 the exac the pictu re that Poe's and Twain's hoaxes painted of artists being th reatened by scientists. Another significant difference in Sokal' s hoax is in the nature of the hoax itself. It is n ot imm ediately com parable to our nineteen th-cen tury scientif ic media hoaxes, as it was not a story in a newspa per about cultural stud ies scholars finding evidence that things di sappeared when they stoppe d thinking about them or proving that gravity was pr opaganda. The hoax target ed a sm all professional group\u2014the editors of Social Text . They were the audience who had to m ake the crucial decision about the truth or fals ehood of the text in front of them . However, because it is the job of th ose ed itors to m ake widely public the resu lts of those value judgm ents, the hoax had a s econd life, so to speak, in which both it and Sokal's revelation of it appeared si multaneously to a different and m uch wider readership. For this second reader ship, Sokal's article actually read as a parody since the readers were in on the joke rather than on the business end of it; they are th e em peror's subjects watchi ng him parade by naked. This crucial 384 distinction helps explain why there is so much term inological confusion in the reaction to Sokal's hoax. The edi tors of Lingua Franca sum up the m ayhem cleverly: In the h eadlines alone, Sokal' s article has b een called a h oax, a joke, a sting, and affair, a par\u00f3dia , a prank, uno sfregio , a spoof, canular , a fraud (delicious a nd m alicious) a ruckus, la far ce parfaite gibberish, rubbish, and hokum. (6) Many of these variants, of course, re fer to diffe ring aspects of the Sokal affair and amount to scholarly word play . However, there is one rhetorically- significant confusion of term inology, even in Sokal's own discussion of hi s hoax\u2014the confusion between hoax and par ody. The article's bi-level audience (the \"hoaxed\" editors and the g eneral public enjoying the \"parody\") legitim ates both term s, even though no one involved in the controversy clar ified this point. Many comm entators d o dem onstrate an un conscious awareness of the difference: critic isms of Sokal's agency in the m atter tend to favor the wo rd hoax, especially as a verb; those commentators who discu ss th e article's literary aspects or who efface Sokal's agen cy tend to p refer th e term parody. Sok al him self uses both terms eventually (the d ebate d rags on f or at least two years, and Sokal and Jean Bricm ont publish a follow-up argum ent in 1997), but in the initial revelation of the hoax in Lingua Franca in 1996, Sokal carefully avoi ds using the word hoax. He and corroborating words like \"sillines s\" and \"nonsense.\" As we discussed 385 with respect to author intentionality, th e word hoax carries with it a connotation of villainous agency. In his revelatory arti cle, Sokal is clearl y trying to impose a level of artistic and aesthe tic distance between him self and his deliberate attack on the reputation of the editors of Social Text . A final difference b etween the So kal hoax an d the nineteenth-centu ry hoaxes is both a difference a nd a similarity. The Sokal hoa x is still p atterned af ter a salient technology in its reading culture \u2014but that is now th e com puter virus, rather than the gears-an d-girders-ty pe m achine. Kaufer and Carley argu e the virus is now the m ajor m etaphor for co mmunication am ong re searchers in the field (Communication 2). The com puter virus, a hybrid of m echanical and organic villainy, is theref ore the perfect double for the rhetorical m echanics of the twenty-f irst century hoax. Far f rom being a clever argum entative con venience, this m etaphor actually helps explain key as pects of Sokal's hoax: his choice of the hoax as a m ode of attack, his hoax' s dependence on the internet, and his choice of Social Tex t as his target. The connection between the comput er virus and the Sokal hoax is apparen t if we consider the language of reaction to the h oax, the m edia of transm ission and reaction, and the dom inant mode for hoaxing in the 1990s. Sokal him self uses the words \"decepti on,\" \"weapon,\" and \"attack\" in his Lingua Franca piece to describe his proj ect. The r eactions t o the hoax give it all sorts of labels, but two pervasive m etaphors (aside from the em peror's new clothes) pick up on Sokal 's own assessm ent: terrorism and me chanics/technology. The is as \"in tellec tual te rrorism\" and Sokal is com pared to Ted Kaczynski; 386 these references are accom panied by references to bombs and explosions, includ ing words lik e \"defuse,\" \"detect ,\" \"breach, \" \"attack,\" \"b urn,\" and \"fireworks.\" The other persis tent analogy is to m echanis m, particularly to a trap. The m echanical language includes w ords like \"picks up steam,\" \"contrived,\" and \"fabricated. \" The hoax is elsewhere figured as a \"trap\" that was \"cam ouflaged\" for \"prey\" terr s, traps, a nd technology is not imm ediately apparent unless w e consid er a major play er in the So kal af fair that has been alm ost entirely overl in the volum inous comm entary\u2014the internet. Peter Osborne was the only major commentator who even m entioned that the in ternet \"p layed a signif icant role in f raming and sustain ing th e affair\" (196), although he did not go into m uch deta il about this role. He noted that m uch of the discussion after the hoax's publica tion took place in em ails and internet forum s between the principals and obser ving critics, which is significant. However, he did not m ention that the cr ucial negotiation of the placem ent of Sokal's hoax in Social Text took place between the editors and Sokal via the internet. Nor did he mention that to this day the hoax is sustained by a virtual reconstruction of all of the original texts and texts of reaction on Sokal's personal webpage, where it shares space with propaganda about Impostures In tellectue lles criticizing studies. I argue that the strong internet pres ence constructed by Sokal for his hoa x is not co incidenta l. Sokal is exp loiting the twenty-f irst- century hoaxing. From \"how to make your own atom ic bomb\" websites to fake 387 web diaries of teenagers with ST Ds to \"urban legend\" and scam emails, the internet h as picked up where nin eteenth-cen tury pr int m edia. Objectivity standards in print and television m edia ha ve made them inhospitable (while not impervious28) to hoaxing; m eanwhile, the developm ent of the intern et of fers an attractive alternative medium for hoaxers. First, its distributed network resists monitoring by any central authority and therefore frus trates would-be censors and referees. Print publishing houses, doing busin ess in the physical rather than the virtu al marketpla ce, a re subje cted via their p hysica lity to a highe r degree of centralized control; there is som ewhere you can \"go\" to stop a story or interrogate a writer. On the internet anyone with access to a server can publish and dissem inate any m essage they wish. Furthe r, this lack o f centralize d author ity makes the construction of internet ethos difficult and intere sting. How does an anonyom ous email or webpage accrue authority? In the absence of personal inform ation or references, resources like gr aphic presentation , timeliness of topic, celebrity, language, and ubiquity play a powerful role in establishing the credibility of infor mation rece ived via the intern et. Interestingly, if we look at our filters from the nine teenth centu ry, a sim ilar r esult can be o btained by stripping off the top tier of expectations\u2014those asso ciated with the reputation of the autho r and the m edium . In the absence of thos e powerful deciding factors, exp ectations concerning plausibility and novelty, visual im pact, form at, and language 28 An interesting exam ple is hoaxer Joey Skaggs, who through clever press-releases has gotten TV and print m edia to broad cast several of his hoaxes over the last 30 years, includi ng a \"Fat Squad\" that bullies an artificial-intelligen ce jury that Skaggs \"announced\" in the wake of the O.J. Si mpson trial; it wa s reported by CNN and CBS radio news, among other m edia. 388 determ rs. In this way the m edia revolution represented by the internet can be ch aracterized as a diminishm ent of the resources readers have at their disposal to guide judgm ents about truth and falsity. In spite of this anarch ic picture, the interne t is hardly a de n of thieves. Trustworthy institutions and f oundations also make use of the internet to stay in convenient contact with their clients. Therefore, enough us eful and credible inform ation com es via the internet that it presen ts a v ery similar enviro nment to the penny daily of the 1830s. A carrier of both fact and fiction, it is the perfect milieu f or hoaxes. The m ost common type of internet hoa x is th e em ail hoax. It is v ery quick, anonym ous (with the use of fake names and em ail accounts), and has the added bonus of accum ulating ethos for the hoax through the headers of concerned friends who forward the warnings a bout gang initiatio ns, fast food contam inations, and computer viruses. The com puter virus scam email is the most interes ting of thes e internet h oaxes for our purposes because it actually perform s the fear of contracting the virus, i.e., \"I got this em ail, so I could get th e virus just as sim ply.\" Real com puter vi ruses, of course, are easy to contract via the Internet; the Klezw orm virus is one of the most recen t exam ples. It sends itself as a message with a vague lure of a subject header, like \"per your request,\" and when it is opened, it finds every c onfidential file in your com puter and attaches it to em ails that go out to everyone on your em ail list. 389 Sokal, likely unconsciously, adopted the s ignatu re of this sa lient technology to pattern his hoax after. Like a computer virus, his hoax contained \"lures \" that tem pted the edito rs of Social Tex t (called ap propria tely in som e commentary the \"host\" journal of the hoax) to include it in the \"Science W ars\" issue. However, Sokal's sim ultaneous revelation in Lingua Franca made Social Text dissem inate a far different m essage from the one they intended to communicate with that issue. The other articles in the is sue were practically forgotten, and instead the attention of Social T ext's read ers was focused on th e gullib ility o f the editors and on Sokal's ind ictment of cultu ral scho lars f or their sloppy handling of scientific concepts. The sensation ca used the \"Science W ars\" issue to sell out. In addition, th e hoax dissem inated over the intern et to reach universities and popular m edia, who th en reprinted Sokal's basic m essage (\"Cultu ral studies a re ignorant and politica lly d angerous; sc ience is s till the on ly objective channel to truth and re ality\") to a wide lay aud ience.29 The essential functions of the com puter virus\u2014luri ng a host m achine into reproducing and dissem inating the virus to other m achines \u2014are all perform ed in Sokal's hoax. A com puter virus dam ages the host and us es the host to sp read its code, its message, across th e internet, and both th is damage and this dissem ination were clearly Sokal's intention. Osborne the 29 Kaufer and Carley find, against Walter Ong's hypothesis that new media gradually k ill old media, that in f act com bining m ultiple m edia\u2014like prin t and the in ternet\u2014augm ents sp eed and range of comm unications (Comm unication 6). This finding may explain why Sokal quickly shifted the central action of his hoax to the internet: he was both responding to its proliferation to electron ic media and facili tating it in ord er to reach as wid e an audience with his hoax as possible. 390 skillf ully, both to regis ter his hoax and to generalize its point into a f ull-sca le attack on ' cultural studies of science' and 'postmodern cultural studies' (which he tends to treat as equivalent s)\" (197). Just as com puter virus hoax em ails perfor m the danger o f the \"viruses\" they warn us ers about, Sokal's virus-hoax perform ed the vulne rability of cultural studies to attack by any discipline whose discourse they used without true understanding. S okal's specific goals dictated his choice of the hoax over other m ethods of public cr iticism . He explained his motivations in his revelation: In the end, I resorted to parody for a sim ple pragm atic reason. The targets of my critique have by now becom e a self-perpetuating academ ic subculture that typically ignores (or disdains) reasoned criticism from the outside. In such a situation, a m ore direct dem onstration of t he subcultu re's intellectual standa rds was required. But how can one show that the em peror has no cl othes? Satire is by far the best weapon; and the blow that can't be brushed off is the one that's se lf-inflicted (53). Sokal's \"Emperor's New Clothes\" refere nce is doubly significant. First, it implies tha t prin t media, when compared to the interne t that sustained much of \"l'affaire So kal,\" is the \"em peror\" of m edia. The academ ic journal is the prestig e form against which the cyber-m anifestations of Sokal's hoax\u2014including his email negotiations with the editors, his online debates, and his personal webpage that docum ents and reifies the hoax\u2014consti tute a guerilla-style but equal significance of Sokal's \"Em peror's New Clothes\" allusion is that it references the prim ary social function of hoaxi ng, which Sokal exploited even if 391 unconsciously: the hoax's ability to call in to question the construc tion of reality . The hoax, as we have discussed, operates at the stasis of existen ce; it play with what holds true in the world-views of its readers. An evaluation can be drawn from it, and most of the discussion of th e hoax has been absorbed in evaluation, as Sokal intended. But the basic function of the hoax is to call in to question assum ptions about the real world. This is what m ade it the ideal m ode of attack for his purposes. Sokal positioned him self a s defending objective scientific reality from the attack s of the \"empe rors\" who claim ed there was no objective reality.30 What better way to m ake his point, then, than to use a hoax to show that the worldvie w that the emperors clo aked them selves in am ounted to a lot of thin air and that scientists , in the final accounting, w ere the tailors with their eyes wide open and their purses full of the em perors' m oney. 30 Andrew Ross, Stanley Aronowitz , and Bruno Latour, am ong others, strenuously objected to this claim , arguing that no sane cultural critic thinks there is no such thing as reality. They co rrected Sokal's m isapprehension by saying that what is at issu e in c ultural studies of science is our inability to separate fact from value when claim s about reality b ecom e public and therefore inescapably rhetorical. 392 Appendix: How to read tables in Optimality Theory (OT) Table A1 is a rep resentation in OT of how English speakers unconsciously selec t the optim A1: S yllabification of /ans t/ in OT FAITH ONS NOCO DA an-st * ** Ans -t * *!** <a>nst *! * What the parts of the tab le mean: The lef tmost colum n lists the m ost probable sy llabificati ons of the English word \"onset.\" A hyphe n indicates the syllable break in the word. The bracketed < a> in the third candidate represents a deleted vowel (which is actually a fairly comm on phonological feat ure in colloquial English: think of the nasal \"N-n\" with a head shake in place of \"no, no\"). The top row lists all phonological constraints that app ly to syllabificatio n left-to-right from strongest (inviolabl e) to weakest (often violated in practice). The ranking was predeterm ined from analyzing m any phonological data sets in English. The constraint FAITH requires that all parts of a word should be pronounced ; ONS says syllables should start with consonants; and NOCODA says syllables should not end in consonants. The solid vertical lin e between FAITH and ONS divides the levels of ranking and tell s us that FAITH crucially dominates both ONS and NOC ODA. ONS and NOCODA are unranked with respect to each 393 other because they never operate on th e sam e part of the syllable a nd theref ore never com pete with e ach o ther; the vertical dotted line signif ies this lack of com petitio n. The ran king of the constra ints in this table au could also b e notated in a lin ear form as F AITH >> {ONS , with commas signifies equality of rank and the refore lack of com petition . The asterisks in the matr ix of the table represent violations of particular constraints. The viola tions add up like penalty points again st a candid ate, with a violation of a st ronger (leftward) constraint counting m ore than a violation of a weaker one. An \"!\" follows and indica tes the f atal violation, the one that knocks the ca ndidate out of the running for optimal form (violations are usually counted up from right to left, weakest to strongest). A candidate can earn a fa tal violation either by violating a higher-ranked constraint than the ot her candidates do, or by accum ulating more total violations than other cand idates at the sam e level of ranking. The check m ark in the candi date co lumn indicates the optimal accum ulating the fewest violations of higher-ranked constraints. This is the f orm speakers ac tually use when they pronounce the word \"onset.\" The results of the syllabification of /ans t/: In the exam ple in Tab le 1, \"an-s t\" is the optim al form . Whi le it has m ore total violations than \"<a>ns t,\" it s atisfies FAITH, the highest ranked constraint. The runner-up, \"<a>ns t\", does not. The third form , \"ans-t\", gets knocked out of 394 the runn ing even earlier because it accrue s more NOCODA violations th an either of the other two form s due to a consonant cluster \"ns\" at the end of the first syllab le. Optim ality Theory applied to a d ecision about a hoax's truth -value Table A2 represents a d ecision the truth-value of Richard Adams Locke's \"Moon Hoax\" by a reader who valu es spectacle over strict technical consistency and accuracy (see Chap ter Tw o, section two, for a histo ry of this hoax): Table A2: A reader's decision to belie ve the \"Moon Hoax\" based on spectacle, not science Novelty Sensation Popsci. Plausibilit y Internal Coh. \u0016TRUE **** **** * FALSE * * *! The solid vertical line locate s the crucial c ompetition \u2014between f irst impressions and factuality, essentially. Th e dotted lines d enote a lack of evidence for com petition in this particula r decision abo ut the truth of the ho axes: i.e. , Novelty, Se nsation and Popsci. (ve risimilitude ) are equa lly r anked in this re ader's estim ation ; thus, thes e expectations \"work toge ther\" rather than compete with each other as the reader reads. In the graph the nine factual errors in Locke's story are counted with nine asterisks (representing eight violations of Plausibility a nd one of Internal Coherence. In spite of all of this f aulty eviden ce, th is reader s till believes Locke's story to be \"true\" because to cons ider it \"false\" w ould force th e adm ission that something novel, sensational, and \"verisim ilar\" is not true. In this reader's world- 395 view, the correlation between spectacular first impressions and truth cannot bear violation, and so the \"fals e\" interpretation loses. The exclam ation point on the chart ind icates that all violation s at this highest level of expectation are unacceptable (th e convention is to mark unac ceptability on the very first violation that rende rs the candid ate inte rpretation unacceptable, and this is usu ally the weakest or right-m ost violation on a given level, as expectation strength increas es from right to lef t). Thu s, the cand idate with m ore tota l violations actu ally wins in this case b ecause of th e very low valu e assign ed to scien tific accu racy by the reader. This graph accurately represents Poe's com plaints about the values of popular science newsreaders. Now, a tabl e of Poe's personal reading of the hoax would look alm ost exactly the reverse of the one above, w ith a judgm ent of \"false\" for the hoax and with plausibility and co nsiste ncy ranked very firm ly over novelty, s ensation, and \"veris imilitud e.\" 396 Glossary The following term s and sym bols ar e esse ntial for understand ing Optim ality Theory as it is adap ted in this pro ject: *: indicates one violation of a particular reading expectation !: an exclam ation m ark placed after a vio lation \"*\" ind icates that th at violation is fatal, i.e. that cand idate in terpretation is no w disqualif ied f rom the competition to be the op timal interpretation. candidate: a possib le interpr etation of a tex t, i.e. \"true\" or \"false\" in the case of the sim ple truth-value decisions about the hoaxes considered in this projec t. The interp retation that bes t survives the \"f ilter\" of the reader 's preconceptions about science and science news is identified as the optimal candidate or interpretation. Occasio nally the reader will hav e insufficien t information to selec t an optim al candidate or will valu e two conf licting preconcep tions equally. In th ese cas es, two or more in terpretations will b e equally entertained until furthe r inform ation is gathered or a value judgm ent is m ade. constraint: The term in Optim ality Theory fo r a rule that governs a particular decision m atrix.

Dom ination is determ ined on the basis of readers' decision s in the face of com peting expectations. For example, if a read er chooses to believe a sensational 397 news item regardless of the f act th at it is riddled with sc ientific errors, Sensation crucially dom inates Inte rnal Coherenc e for that rea der. expectation : a p reconception that inf luence s interpretation while reading . Expectations are stated as propositions that are either m et or violated during a particular reading experien ce of a particular text. The expecta tions used in this project are expectations of genre (s cience news ) and ethnoscience (popular cultural knowledge about science): Authority: The author or authority fi gure's previous reputation holds. Comprehension: It is optim al to com prehend everyth ing written in a story. (This is not a conscious ex pectation; it is m ore properly a constra int on the read ing activ ity th at dete rmines what rpretive proc ess) Foreign: Anything foreign is good and probably true. Internal Coherence: If the claim s made by a story are logically consistent, it is probably true. Medium: The previous reputation of the m edium holds. News: It is optim al to read new s non-linearly, skipping to the Main Events and Details of Main Even ts sections first and only reading background and supporting material as tim e and interest allow. Novelty: New discoveries are highl y valued and probably true. Plausibility: If it seem s like it could happen, it probably did. Popsci: Stories that sound like true sc ience reports probably are. Sub- expecta Long: Longer in insta llments. Decoration: Popular science repo rts w ill often be decorated with bold headlines and woodcuts. Mystery : Popular science reports of ten have a \"mystery\" opening signaled by words like \"wonders\" Ignorance: After the opening, popular science reports generally indica te th at th e pub lic is ignorant of a particular principle/phenom enon. Wisdom: After the lam ent for ignor ance, pop sci reports generally point out a wise person who knows better. Detail: Pop sci article s will of ten have a lot of technical detail, which is a good indicator of truth. Analogy: The details in a pop sci article will often be explained with analogy to well-known phenom ena. Use: Pop sci articles often finish with an evaluation of the benefit, physical or m etaphysical , of the scientific principle/phenom enon. Entertainment: Reading of pop sci articl es is for entertainm ent, not truth, value. Progression : It is op timal to read a story as fa st as poss ible. Com petes with Com prehension (see note to Comprehension). 399 Sensation: Sensation al elem ents in a story have a high liter ary and truth- value.

See \"dom inate.\" Rank ing is ind icated graphically by solid vertical lines separa ting levels of rank; eve rything to the left of a so lid line dom inates everything to the right of it. Equa lity of rank is ind icated by dotte d vertical lines between expectations that do not com pete with each other and therefore are at the s ame level of ranking in the reader's value system. 400 Bibliography \"About Two Months Ago...\" New York W orld 1874.
