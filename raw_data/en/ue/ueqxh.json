My horse loved this stuff when he was on it. I switched a while back and was thinking about going back to this supplement until I saw the price went up by $20....nevermind...too bad too :( Date published: 2022-02-14 Rated 5 out of 5 by justine from Herb Power I do not mix it with his grain because the flavors might not work well. I put it in a separate bucket with his scoop of alfalfa pellets and he LOVES it. He no longer has access to graze on these herbs naturally. I know he misses it and Herb Power makes it possible.

It smells great, and the reviews were so positive I thought for sure that he would eat it. I started out with half a scoop and he wouldn't touch it. He readily eats HiltonHerbs Hoof and Health and I have given him the Milk Thistle Plus in the past and he gobbled that up. But there must be something here that he doesn't like.

(I eat junk!) i did try Dac supplements with great success but they have corn/soy which I try really hard to avoid in my horse's diet. I have two acres of \"lawn\" for my horse to graze. I only feed grass hay in the winter as he stays hefty very easily. My feed isn't fortified so I needed a good vitamin and mineral supplement to boost and level out his nutritional needs. I feed loose Redmond rock salt and Hilton Herb Power along with Crypto Aero. My horse was previously on a poorer pasture and fed no grain/feed at all. He wasn't in poor health by any means but now, his coat gleams, his hooves have hardened, his belly dapples have popped a little more and his top line has improved. Plus, his breath smells really good after a meal. Weird I know but I smooch his muzzle often and now it's minty and herby. He loves his feed and toppings. He will eat just the herb power ground herbs by themselves even. I highly recommend this product as an addition to your horse's diet.

My one horse is sensitive to corn and many supplements I looked up had corn as a binder...I thought I would give this a try. I looked up some of the herbs in and thought it would be great. When it came it had a lovely smell and I could smell the mint in it. My one horse hates mint so I took a half cup of the supplement for my horses to try plan. All 3 gobbled it up and wanted more!

The herbs smell of fresh pasture and my minis immediately loved the addition to their mash. Date published: 2018-05-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by Nokota Mama from Gobbled right up! I got this for my young horse for winter, since the pasture is dormant. He loves "}
